EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,279	| Episode4 |	What looks to be solar
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:25,119	| Episode4 |	Small solar cells on top of all these sensors and such

EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:51,551	| Episode4 |	We could do
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,855	| Episode4 |	Sprinkler gone off on the kids
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,439	| Episode4 |	You set that up Kevin and then we'll go
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:01,279	| Episode4 |	I do know what actually I'm going to try to set up this is going to be
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,071	| Episode4 |	I think my husband
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,863	| Episode4 |	He listens to the podcast
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| Episode4 |	But I don't think he ever goes this
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| Episode4 |	For Father's Day
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:11,007	| Episode4 |	I want to set up this is probably way TMI but
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:15,103	| Episode4 |	Are you going to order a hue light for inside of our bathroom
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| Episode4 |	Because we have like
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| Episode4 |	In our master bath we have like a little toilet
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| Episode4 |	Bright
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,295	| Episode4 |	We didn't put an outlet in for a night light
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:23,807	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,391	| Episode4 |	You know if you're in the middle of the night and have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:31,743	| Episode4 |	You have to go ahead and turn the lights so bright here like oh my God what's happening
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| Episode4 |	So I realize
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,327	| Episode4 |	I don't know why it took me this long to realize but
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,375	| Episode4 |	I'm in install a hue light
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| Episode4 |	Cuz there's a download
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:42,239	| Episode4 |	So I'm going to install the $60 hue light
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,031	| Episode4 |	In a little motion detector
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,335	| Episode4 |	Andra set it up for your SmartThings
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,639	| Episode4 |	So during the day
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,967	| Episode4 |	Can you set off the motion detector the light is just going to go on
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,759	| Episode4 |	So you no longer need to hit the light switch
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,111	| Episode4 |	Might just goes on but after about 10
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| Episode4 |	30 at night
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,743	| Episode4 |	Then when you go in I'm going to set the Hue to go to a red light
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,279	| Episode4 |	Light because red light doesn't wake people
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,303	| Episode4 |	Pull up
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,887	| Episode4 |	So I'm going to set it to go to kind of a lower red light
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,703	| Episode4 |	So then you can still see but it's not going to be like
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,007	| Episode4 |	I'm awake
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,287	| Episode4 |	It is 4 in the morning
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,847	| Episode4 |	That's better than I
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:23,199	| Episode4 |	Stop what you're going to do with it I thought you're going to different colors to Signal what you did in the bathroom or something
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,759	| Episode4 |	Okay. See that's just that's just way too much
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:32,159	| Episode4 |	I'm just saying you know it's what you talked about the changing the light colors on the Hue of the time I was like where she going with us
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:35,487	| Episode4 |	But no the red light works actually when I go out stargazing and such I have
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,071	| Episode4 |	Red film covers for over my flashlight and such for that very reason
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,631	| Episode4 |	You don't want to lose your night vision
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,911	| Episode4 |	Which is very important you're sleeping
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| Episode4 |	Except when I'm going to the bathroom
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,799	| Episode4 |	So this way
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,079	| Episode4 |	It's more important
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,895	| Episode4 |	Now there's the too much info
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,175	| Episode4 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:58,015	| Episode4 |	That's that's my plan I'm going to set it up I don't think I'm going to tell him
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,039	| Episode4 |	And then
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| Episode4 |	So one night he
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,087	| Episode4 |	He's just going to
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,135	| Episode4 |	What just happened
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| Episode4 |	That might wake him up
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,719	| Episode4 |	But then I think he'll be
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:10,047	| Episode4 |	You might want to tell him it's okay
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| Episode4 |	Really he's going to be happy
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,119	| Episode4 |	He may not even notice
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,911	| Episode4 |	I mean that would be ideal
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,679	| Episode4 |	SS
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,191	| Episode4 |	Awake
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| Episode4 |	I don't know I'm released
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,615	| Episode4 |	So there we go cuz that's like I already have a motion detector and not using
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,175	| Episode4 |	What's the cost of a $60 light bulb Plus
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,967	| Episode4 |	Maybe five
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,247	| Episode4 |	The 10 minutes of programming that
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,039	| Episode4 |	It's just simple
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,599	| Episode4 |	Like after between the hours of 10 in like
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,623	| Episode4 |	6 in the morning
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,671	| Episode4 |	My son is red color
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| Episode4 |	The time and
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,999	| Episode4 |	That way we don't have to flip a switch on and off
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,767	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,071	| Episode4 |	That's going to be I was going to do it for Father's Day
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| Episode4 |	But maybe I'll do it too
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,423	| Episode4 |	All right
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,703	| Episode4 |	Speaking of like

EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,223	| Episode4 |	For the last week I've been controlling my lights
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,991	| Episode4 |	From my

EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,295	| Episode4 |	Unusual
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:38,111	| Episode4 |	What is unusual I've been controlling it
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,903	| Episode4 |	From to new apps that let me
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| Episode4 |	Basically
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,439	| Episode4 |	Control
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,975	| Episode4 |	From the lock screen
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| Episode4 |	Of my Android
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,279	| Episode4 |	Ice
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,631	| Episode4 |	We've actually talked about one of these on the show
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,911	| Episode4 |	It is old Incarnation when
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:57,055	| Episode4 |	What is an app called you know me and you guys may remember it because it woke me up at midnight playing
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,823	| Episode4 |	My radio
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,359	| Episode4 |	Because I thought I came
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:11:59,871	| Episode4 |	I'm home
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,407	| Episode4 |	The fix
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:01,919	| Episode4 |	Fat
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,223	| Episode4 |	With an update
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,503	| Episode4 |	So that that's good
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:09,599	| Episode4 |	But the new one I wanted to cut a dick into is called reach
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,623	| Episode4 |	And
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,207	| Episode4 |	It's on Android only right now so this
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,999	| Episode4 |	If you got an iOS I'm sorry just
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| Episode4 |	Fast forward this
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,631	| Episode4 |	But basically what it does it's
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| Episode4 |	Supports
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,215	| Episode4 |	Wi-Fi devices for the most part
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| Episode4 |	And
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| Episode4 |	Right now in my house
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,823	| Episode4 |	It is supporting
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,103	| Episode4 |	The nest
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,151	| Episode4 |	The hue
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:33,663	| Episode4 |	And
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,223	| Episode4 |	My Sonos Sonos has
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,527	| Episode4 |	But it also supports
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,295	| Episode4 |	A bunch of
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,831	| Episode4 |	Other devices that I don't have
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,135	| Episode4 |	And what's cool about it is
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:46,207	| Episode4 |	Whenever you walk into a place that has anything
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:51,071	| Episode4 |	These devices it will automatically detect them on the Wi-Fi network and I'll be like hey yo do you want to connect
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:55,935	| Episode4 |	And these devices are a Chromecast anything made by LG
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,959	| Episode4 |	Make a smart TV
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,007	| Episode4 |	Heroku lifx bulbs
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,079	| Episode4 |	And then the other devices that I mentioned so WeMo nest
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,615	| Episode4 |	Sonos in
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,127	| Episode4 |	And she likes
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,199	| Episode4 |	I will say I've been having issues with my nest
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,759	| Episode4 |	It keeps making me link my account
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| Episode4 |	I'm so
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,575	| Episode4 |	Every couple days it's like
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,903	| Episode4 |	Oh now you need to relink your account and I think that's because it's an
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:16,671	| Episode4 |	Unofficial
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,463	| Episode4 |	Integration
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:22,303	| Episode4 |	So there's the benefits of being official vs. unofficial
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:26,143	| Episode4 |	But I love it because all that I do is it comes down
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,447	| Episode4 |	On my notification screen
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:34,847	| Episode4 |	And I can do it's it's very much designed for those quick things like oh someone's at my door let me just pause my
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,871	| Episode4 |	Sonos music really fast
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:36,895	| Episode4 |	Soy
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,991	| Episode4 |	Pull down the notification screen and I just hit pause if you
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:45,855	| Episode4 |	Like all I see all six of my Sonos players
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,623	| Episode4 |	Back and hip pain
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:49,183	| Episode4 |	Or when I'm going to bed at night I just
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,463	| Episode4 |	Pull down the notification
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:50,975	| Episode4 |	Screen and I can
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,279	| Episode4 |	Turn off my bedside table light
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,559	| Episode4 |	With my Hue relief
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,095	| Episode4 |	It's
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,887	| Episode4 |	In in Granite because of
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,471	| Episode4 |	Because of how I live and how many things I test I have a
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,031	| Episode4 |	Dozen different ways to do a lot of these things
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,847	| Episode4 |	But I have to say doing it from the lock screen
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,919	| Episode4 |	Is really freaking sweet you guys
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:15,807	| Episode4 |	Yeah this is this is a very clever implementation I guess they're using all the apis from these various devices
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:19,903	| Episode4 |	And consolidating all the controls right into that pull down notification shade on Android
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:24,511	| Episode4 |	And that's just a beautiful thing I'm looking at the theater face on the Google Play Store right now this is the
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,791	| Episode4 |	Free apps in beta
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:30,399	| Episode4 |	I actually it took me awhile to find it it's cuz there's a lot of apps called reach
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,727	| Episode4 |	So if you do search do a search for reach Smart Home
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,519	| Episode4 |	Now that's where you'll find it's
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:38,591	| Episode4 |	Buildfire developer jch connected Tech
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,103	| Episode4 |	Ink
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,151	| Episode4 |	And yeah I mean
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,967	| Episode4 |	Stacy it showed it to me on a Skype video chat
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,015	| Episode4 |	Not too long ago and
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:51,135	| Episode4 |	You know I got to see an action was kind of neat now it recognizes and finds all the devices quickly
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,951	| Episode4 |	Just looks really clean and it's the consolidation
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:59,583	| Episode4 |	You know I talked about using a phone to connect to all these devices and control them I actually like that
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:02,399	| Episode4 |	Do I like doing all these different apps new I do not sow
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:07,775	| Episode4 |	This is I like this idea and because it is almost like a widget in a sentence
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,055	| Episode4 |	It is
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:13,407	| Episode4 |	Yeah because it is I wouldn't surprise me I don't see it here yet
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,199	| Episode4 |	It wouldn't surprise me to see them
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:21,343	| Episode4 |	Easley Portis over to Android Wear watches and if they ever come out with iOS version again on the Apple watch where are you
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,415	| Episode4 |	Have all those things within you know an easy swipe away
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:28,255	| Episode4 |	In the wealth are there going to be doing an iOS version
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,815	| Episode4 |	And they they are looking at
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,119	| Episode4 |	Their whole goal is to do
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,679	| Episode4 |	Is to not replicate all the features
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,727	| Episode4 |	It is to do something that is
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,775	| Episode4 |	It is to do the quick features
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:44,895	| Episode4 |	In the easiest format so they are very much looking at watches
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,919	| Episode4 |	Is there very much
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,431	| Episode4 |	Looking at
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,455	| Episode4 |	Easy ways
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,759	| Episode4 |	Things outside of screens
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,295	| Episode4 |	Rhino
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:57,695	| Episode4 |	You're getting your not it doesn't give total control over all these devices what you have is the most likely things are going to
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:00,511	| Episode4 |	I want to do with them turn them on turn them off as such if it's a light
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:06,911	| Episode4 |	Play or pause on a Sonos or change the volume on a Chromecast you know something you're streaming to a Chromecast
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:11,519	| Episode4 |	So like the simplistic idea because it's quick one
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| Episode4 |	Pull-down and you're there
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,335	| Episode4 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,103	| Episode4 |	And I love it
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:15,871	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,663	| Episode4 |	I've been having a lot of fun with it
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,431	| Episode4 |	The first time
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| Episode4 |	It in it
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,759	| Episode4 |	Again it's in beta it's gotten
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,039	| Episode4 |	Progressively better
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:25,855	| Episode4 |	Like the first time I downloaded it oh my God it crashed ever
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| Episode4 |	Every 5 Seconds
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,159	| Episode4 |	Now it's very rarely cry
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:31,487	| Episode4 |	I'm so if you're on an Android
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,535	| Episode4 |	And you like to play around with this stuff
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,327	| Episode4 |	And you have a lot of
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:35,839	| Episode4 |	These devices
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,399	| Episode4 |	I highly recommend you give this
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| Episode4 |	Because it is
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:42,495	| Episode4 |	I'm not going to say is change my life
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,543	| Episode4 |	It is a lot of fun to play with
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,335	| Episode4 |	It is definitely something I'm using
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,103	| Episode4 |	Everyday
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:47,871	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,383	| Episode4 |	Check it out
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,687	| Episode4 |	And on the
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,455	| Episode4 |	You know me friend
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,015	| Episode4 |	They have fixed a lot of there
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,319	| Episode4 |	Issues with the geolocation
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:00,927	| Episode4 |	So they added official geolocation so now you're not getting all these reminders like
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,791	| Episode4 |	You left the house when you're really still in the house and it's just your Wi-Fi network that's flickered
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:07,839	| Episode4 |	They've kind of
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,399	| Episode4 |	Twitter support for
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,447	| Episode4 |	A lot of their devices so it's
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:12,959	| Episode4 |	Much better
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:18,079	| Episode4 |	And did my final thing on all of this stuff that I would say is
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,663	| Episode4 |	I'm going to beg the guys over at WeMo
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,199	| Episode4 |	You
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,735	| Episode4 |	You guys need to work
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,759	| Episode4 |	On your API
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| Episode4 |	I
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,647	| Episode4 |	I've talked to a lot of people in the deaf community and
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,439	| Episode4 |	And as someone who owns the WeMo Staffing
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:35,231	| Episode4 |	Is connecting it to a lot of things
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:39,071	| Episode4 |	I'm getting progressively more frustrated as a user
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| Episode4 |	Because
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,399	| Episode4 |	My WeMo doesn't know if it's on or off
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,215	| Episode4 |	And the more things I connected to
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| Episode4 |	The harder it's
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,519	| Episode4 |	Becoming for it to know
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,031	| Episode4 |	What
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| Episode4 |	State of being is
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,639	| Episode4 |	And that's that's becoming very frustrating for me
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,711	| Episode4 |	One solution is obviously like
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,247	| Episode4 |	Hey Stacy
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,807	| Episode4 |	Maybe you shouldn't connect it to the reach app and to the echo
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,879	| Episode4 |	And to the SmartThings app and to all these other thing
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,159	| Episode4 |	But
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,743	| Episode4 |	I don't know if that's really anti if
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,791	| Episode4 |	Bissonnet and
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:13,375	| Episode4 |	You're you're not the typical person that is
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| Episode4 |	You know
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:19,263	| Episode4 |	Is that is out there buying is priced you're trying them all and you're trying to make them all work together
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:24,383	| Episode4 |	You know for a cover it because we talked about it cuz you have to understand it
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,407	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,967	| Episode4 |	I can understand you know
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:31,807	| Episode4 |	I can't do but even on this richat for example the WeMo
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,879	| Episode4 |	The WeMo implementation is a little frustrating
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,439	| Episode4 |	For even the developers be
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,207	| Episode4 |	Because
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,231	| Episode4 |	It's kind of a Dodge
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,047	| Episode4 |	It's a little iffy on the
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,071	| Episode4 |	Annotation size
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,119	| Episode4 |	And for the echo people
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,959	| Episode4 |	Again they have some issues and Isis
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,983	| Episode4 |	Suspect there issues
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,031	| Episode4 |	With it sometimes working in
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,055	| Episode4 |	And sometimes not working
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,639	| Episode4 |	Not just because I've gotten the code word strong which is another issue
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,175	| Episode4 |	Is because
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,711	| Episode4 |	Of the
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,735	| Episode4 |	API
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,295	| Episode4 |	So I'm trying to get the
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,367	| Episode4 |	Go to talk to me cuz I know they've been trying to revamp their API
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,159	| Episode4 |	I'm hoping that this
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,463	| Episode4 |	Coming down the pike but I would really like
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:11,743	| Episode4 |	As a ninja
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:12,767	| Episode4 |	Because
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| Episode4 |	I know that I try every
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:17,119	| Episode4 |	Everything out but I think a lot of people are connecting
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:24,287	| Episode4 |	What's with this way when you start connecting one or two things in your house and then there's all these other products
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:28,383	| Episode4 |	You're going to want to look and see what else you can fit into your environment so I get that I do
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,943	| Episode4 |	Connecting light
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,711	| Episode4 |	If this then that
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:35,807	| Episode4 |	Yeah that be fun and then maybe you're like maybe if WeMo doesn't work
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,319	| Episode4 |	Swift nest
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| Episode4 |	Then suddenly you're like
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,951	| Episode4 |	Yep and if they don't work or
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,047	| Episode4 |	I agree
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,607	| Episode4 |	So on on that kind of Grimm note
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,191	| Episode4 |	Please WeMo help us out

EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,424	| Episode4 |	And it's those companies that offer
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:03,008	| Episode4 |	An existing service and by making it connected they actually
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,520	| Episode4 |	Can help
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:06,336	| Episode4 |	Basically do it better and hopefully

EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:55,232	| Episode4 |	It's really defined by the notion
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,792	| Episode4 |	That you have a product
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,584	| Episode4 |	Yeah but user a customer
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,144	| Episode4 |	And you have the company itself

EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:49,248	| Episode4 |	It is a perfect candidate for a knife
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:55,392	| Episode4 |	So you can imagine something as simple as that
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:59,232	| Episode4 |	Well I'm at a secure place you can throw papers though
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,864	| Episode4 |	Pretty simple business and its construction

EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,896	| Episode4 |	But you can imagine if I added
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:22,528	| Episode4 |	That was at work when not being is full
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,064	| Episode4 |	It could be a substantially better service

EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,528	| Episode4 |	In a way that is
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:57,344	| Episode4 |	Better balance between producing cost
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,672	| Episode4 |	I also have the same time has a high quality of service

EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,664	| Episode4 |	It's it's a very complicated thing when we think about
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:46,688	| Episode4 |	You know
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:51,552	| Episode4 |	Permissions associated with the customer who's granting the permissions
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,344	| Episode4 |	Who at which companies
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,136	| Episode4 |	To have access to the data
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,160	| Episode4 |	Can access it
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,952	| Episode4 |	Which companies can access it
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,464	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,256	| Episode4 |	In building that
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,304	| Episode4 |	Why did you guys kind of
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| Episode4 |	Create that
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,888	| Episode4 |	How does that relate to
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,168	| Episode4 |	The stages of the business
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,728	| Episode4 |	UC
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,008	| Episode4 |	Companies going through
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,104	| Episode4 |	I actually
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:19,968	| Episode4 |	It's awesome, customer standpoint it's maybe
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:23,552	| Episode4 |	Started their Journey
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:26,880	| Episode4 |	And gosh I was going to manage that once we go live until
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:30,208	| Episode4 |	Blueprints weekly just rolled out this week
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:30,720	| Episode4 |	And
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:34,048	| Episode4 |	It was in response to sorted
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:37,632	| Episode4 |	Repeating pattern that results of unmet needs
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,424	| Episode4 |	Ark Center customer base
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:45,568	| Episode4 |	Blueprint what it is that allows our costumes
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,872	| Episode4 |	Camaster business are clouds
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:52,992	| Episode4 |	Place to capture and manage basically all the roles
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:58,880	| Episode4 |	And permissions throughout connected business from the employees in the business to the products
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:03,488	| Episode4 |	To the customers to Partners you might service Buzz bottle
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:07,328	| Episode4 |	In a sense of place where a lousy one
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,120	| Episode4 |	Who are all the parties agents
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,168	| Episode4 |	Actors in my connected business
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,472	| Episode4 |	To what what do they do
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:15,264	| Episode4 |	How do they interact
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:19,104	| Episode4 |	I'm with each other what's the relationship you had each other
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:21,920	| Episode4 |	Then what is there air rights
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,456	| Episode4 |	And
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,224	| Episode4 |	So
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:26,016	| Episode4 |	Blueprint is a place
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,064	| Episode4 |	You can say all right
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:31,392	| Episode4 |	Customer is allowed to interact
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:34,720	| Episode4 |	A certain product
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:38,304	| Episode4 |	A particular
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:41,632	| Episode4 |	It also might have in it that
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:44,960	| Episode4 |	She can't interact with that same color in that
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:48,032	| Episode4 |	But a service agency
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:51,616	| Episode4 |	It's its roles Commissions in relationships
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:57,504	| Episode4 |	Access to devices
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,296	| Episode4 |	Access to data
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:03,136	| Episode4 |	Because the data that is generated by the iot
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,440	| Episode4 |	Is in enormous in its volume
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:07,232	| Episode4 |	But also has
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:11,072	| Episode4 |	There's a real need to be able to manage it and away
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:15,680	| Episode4 |	So that through the the life of that information
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,960	| Episode4 |	It is
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:20,544	| Episode4 |	Protected if you will and associated
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:26,688	| Episode4 |	With the right people are not inadvertently shared with those who we shouldn't have access to it
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:30,784	| Episode4 |	Blueprint in the case of data needs conscious
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:39,232	| Episode4 |	And and her diving system important part of it
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:44,096	| Episode4 |	Gratitude assembly cache and data that then you have to sort out in the future
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:48,704	| Episode4 |	Taxi capturing data that has gluten in it
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,496	| Episode4 |	So bad
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:53,056	| Episode4 |	That information is easy to make sense of
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:57,920	| Episode4 |	The Seattle Center
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,272	| Episode4 |	In building that
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,552	| Episode4 |	It sounds like a huge
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:05,088	| Episode4 |	A huge job
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,928	| Episode4 |	How did you guys kind of think about architecting
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,976	| Episode4 |	Which handles
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:13,536	| Episode4 |	I don't know I don't know you'll have to tell me how many
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,816	| Episode4 |	Hundreds of thousands of nodes
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:20,704	| Episode4 |	And then in building kind of what sounds like a huge kind of Knowledge Graph
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:22,496	| Episode4 |	Relationships in
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,008	| Episode4 |	Data
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:27,104	| Episode4 |	How did you design the system because that is a
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:32,736	| Episode4 |	Problem that a lot of companies who are dealing with the Internet of Things in the back end of that are thinking about in
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:36,064	| Episode4 |	It's really not something that we've established, Target
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:48,864	| Episode4 |	And what what makes it technically challenging
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,192	| Episode4 |	It's just the scale
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:56,800	| Episode4 |	How much information and how many devices are interacting
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,640	| Episode4 |	I normally would never have any reason
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:03,968	| Episode4 |	You're the largest Enterprises in the world might have
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:07,808	| Episode4 |	Few hundred thousand employees and they might have
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:14,208	| Episode4 |	Seven-figure is about interacting with their mostly desktop
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:21,120	| Episode4 |	And so the notion of devices connected
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,824	| Episode4 |	Since 2004
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:32,640	| Episode4 |	I've been running and service back
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:38,784	| Episode4 |	Total connected over 300 million devices
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:43,136	| Episode4 |	Avenue neighborhood
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,416	| Episode4 |	Mom cell
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,464	| Episode4 |	We are getting exposed to that
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,792	| Episode4 |	Years and years
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,328	| Episode4 |	Feeling back
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,864	| Episode4 |	Laird
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,680	| Episode4 |	We have to build and implement
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:37:01,824	| Episode4 |	Getting data from two devices
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:14,368	| Episode4 |	And so we build our while we have mqtt a Mexican compliant
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:14,880	| Episode4 |	Solution
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:21,536	| Episode4 |	It's actually built on the data brokerage system that reviews
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:30,752	| Episode4 |	That are built on
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:34,080	| Episode4 |	Securely got a brokerage system
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,640	| Episode4 |	The anchor tenant
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:43,040	| Episode4 |	But on top of that
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:48,160	| Episode4 |	Things like blueprints
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:52,000	| Episode4 |	Capturing time series data capture
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,048	| Episode4 |	I really felt
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:55,840	| Episode4 |	Off-the-shelf database
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:38:00,192	| Episode4 |	Technologies
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:00,960	| Episode4 |	And
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,288	| Episode4 |	There's not the Technologies office
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,592	| Episode4 |	How to deploy it
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:10,944	| Episode4 |	It it really had to
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:17,600	| Episode4 |	That you have mourned
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:29,120	| Episode4 |	Can you do the bathroom
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:32,448	| Episode4 |	And what were
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,472	| Episode4 |	Focused on
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:36,800	| Episode4 |	It's not simply doesn't work but doesn't work
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:42,432	| Episode4 |	When we did send a message we have to
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:47,296	| Episode4 |	Authenticate that message in real time
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,576	| Episode4 |	Ambi
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:54,976	| Episode4 |	Can certain people and they have lights receive that message
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:58,048	| Episode4 |	And then transmitted I have to do that all
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:05,472	| Episode4 |	Custom systems for data ingestion custom systems
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:11,616	| Episode4 |	And Andrew optimizing together in such a way that
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:15,712	| Episode4 |	Low latency delivery messages
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:21,344	| Episode4 |	Are the same time Insurance Commission
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:24,160	| Episode4 |	And I believe I saw that it was sub-50 vilaseca
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,464	| Episode4 |	Within our data
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,792	| Episode4 |	Celtics
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:36,448	| Episode4 |	But a typical using the bathroom.
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:39,008	| Episode4 |	Oh that's all the way out to me like
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:39,520	| Episode4 |	At the end
