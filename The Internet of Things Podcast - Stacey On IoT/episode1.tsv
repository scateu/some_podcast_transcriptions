EDL	00:00:00,256	00:00:04,096	| episode1 |	Hey everybody it is Stacey Higginbotham and my colleague
EDL	00:00:05,632	00:00:12,032	| episode1 |	Kevin tofel and this is sorry I caught you off-guard there Kevin but we have not
EDL	00:00:12,032	00:00:18,432	| episode1 |	Talked in awhile so you kind of threw me for a loop there we go this is this is the first time we are recording the internet
EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:22,528	| episode1 |	Set of things podcast as it is now called without
EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:24,832	| episode1 |	Without the gator on Logo because
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:25,600	| episode1 |	He know I'm his
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:28,416	| episode1 |	Well it is it is no more
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:34,816	| episode1 |	And so you're still here we're still here and we're still friends and we still love The Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:40,704	| episode1 |	We're trying this on our own we'll see how it does and you guys have actually been super supportive in
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:44,544	| episode1 |	A little demanding asking us to keep this thing going
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:48,128	| episode1 |	So we will we're going to give it our best shot
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:50,688	| episode1 |	We do what we're told we aim to please
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,456	| episode1 |	We do
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:57,856	| episode1 |	And so first off we'll get started with the device that I have been trying out in my home
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:01:04,256	| episode1 |	It's a device I recommend to lots of people so you know ye it is called the Staples connect
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,536	| episode1 |	At home hub
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:08,096	| episode1 |	I had tried out initially a couple
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,888	| episode1 |	Gosh over a year-and-a-half ago now
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:16,800	| episode1 |	About a year-and-a-half ago these tables connect home hub version 1 now I've got the second version which is manufactured by.
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,360	| episode1 |	I think it actually came out in August
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:20,128	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:22,688	| episode1 |	I know so long ago
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:23,968	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:27,296	| episode1 |	I hadn't gotten a chance to plug it in until now
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:31,136	| episode1 |	I hadn't had it in my house until a couple weeks ago so I
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:35,744	| episode1 |	Popped it in the house I tried it out and
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:36,768	| episode1 |	I got to say
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:42,912	| episode1 |	I still like this thing a lot I really do I love the way it works I think it has
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:44,192	| episode1 |	A pretty great
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,984	| episode1 |	Array of devices for people
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:49,312	| episode1 |	And a wonderful UI for people who are
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,104	| episode1 |	You know interested in the hub
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:54,176	| episode1 |	Ecosystem right who are interested in connecting a lot of things
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:00,576	| episode1 |	It has five radios so this version they added two more radios Bluetooth and zigbee
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:04,416	| episode1 |	To their existing radios which were Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,208	| episode1 |	Z-Wave and Lutron
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:10,560	| episode1 |	And it's kind of the Lutron that makes this a little different because
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,120	| episode1 |	Not
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,168	| episode1 |	When it launched not everyone had Lutron
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:19,776	| episode1 |	A couple other hubs like wink now has Lutron but this works way better than the wink hub
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:24,640	| episode1 |	I'm not going to go there but I never ask you a question so
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:28,736	| episode1 |	The difference between version 1 and version 2 it's obviously the new radios
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:32,320	| episode1 |	Is there a price difference at all and and what other
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,880	| episode1 |	What other changes have been made to this hub
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,392	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:39,744	| episode1 |	Earlier Hub was manufactured by Linksys
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,608	| episode1 |	And then Cisco sold off Linksys and sold it to Belkin
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:51,264	| episode1 |	I'm in Belkin so
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:54,336	| episode1 |	So now this Hub is manufactured by D-Link
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,128	| episode1 |	Which also has its own a smart
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,968	| episode1 |	Camera lineup the Arlo light up with gear
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,528	| episode1 |	But it doesn't have a hub so it makes this one
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:11,232	| episode1 |	Probably is a price differential but since the other Hub isn't out there anymore it doesn't really matter
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,768	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:16,608	| episode1 |	There's no real comps there right now they're doing a deal
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:23,008	| episode1 |	I believe the Hub is 7999 if you bought it on your own very expensive but don't do that
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,800	| episode1 |	Do I loved you
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:29,664	| episode1 |	This is actually pretty good one so if you buy two connected devices
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,968	| episode1 |	At Staples
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,528	| episode1 |	42999
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,808	| episode1 |	Airbus
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:38,880	| episode1 |	You will get the Hub free
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:43,488	| episode1 |	So basically you should just go spend sixty bucks on connected devices
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:49,888	| episode1 |	Bright light switches or Outlets or lights or something yeah switches Outlets
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,192	| episode1 |	I'm going to spend a little bit more and all honesty
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:55,776	| episode1 |	I personally like would go out and get
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:04:00,128	| episode1 |	Like this this would be me right I would go get maybe some Hue Lights
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:07,040	| episode1 |	Were packing a Lutron dimmer I'm a huge fan of the Lutron stuff you guys know this
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,088	| episode1 |	Or if you want to get like a
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,392	| episode1 |	They got the Arlo cameras they've got
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:16,768	| episode1 |	Support for one of my favorite devices which is the Jasco outdoor links
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:20,095	| episode1 |	That's great around Christmas time I know it's not Christmas time but
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,887	| episode1 |	You know any time you got outdoor
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,447	| episode1 |	Lights are things you want to plug in
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,983	| episode1 |	I love those things
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,007	| episode1 |	I think
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,335	| episode1 |	I bought mine on Amazon for
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,943	| episode1 |	I want to say they were about 25 bucks so that may not get you there
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,551	| episode1 |	I think they're more expensive inside the store
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:43,903	| episode1 |	So and being a cross-platform guy
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:49,791	| episode1 |	Can I use this with iOS Android and anything else you can use it with IOS and Android
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,839	| episode1 |	They also have a web browser
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,655	| episode1 |	What I've noticed that they did and I think this is really
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,447	| episode1 |	A very smart move
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,727	| episode1 |	Is they started
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| episode1 |	Doing two things
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,823	| episode1 |	1 is
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,103	| episode1 |	When your
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:07,711	| episode1 |	Looking to add on to your system they ask you things like
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:11,039	| episode1 |	Do you want to manage your home security
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,807	| episode1 |	Or
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:12,831	| episode1 |	You know
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:17,183	| episode1 |	Have your lights to something you don't have your lights turn on
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,463	| episode1 |	When you walk in the door
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,767	| episode1 |	Did they offer you little scenarios and then
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:24,863	| episode1 |	Then you should buy a connected light switch
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,887	| episode1 |	Shopping
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:31,263	| episode1 |	And that that's actually kind of nice it's giving you little hints about what you can do with these products
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,079	| episode1 |	And that's that's a good idea because a lot of people
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:37,663	| episode1 |	Don't know when you say I have a smart home what what does that mean what can I do with it
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,223	| episode1 |	You can have 50 different options that people
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:44,063	| episode1 |	Probably don't know about right or is like do you want to buy a motion sensor here like
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:48,415	| episode1 |	Well I don't know
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:54,559	| episode1 |	So I like that and then the other things they're doing is they're actually doing a lot with the data on the back end
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,375	| episode1 |	For both consumers and retailers
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,679	| episode1 |	So on the consumer side
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:03,775	| episode1 |	They'll show you their they're working really hard to show you
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:07,871	| episode1 |	If you have the following three products in your home you might also like to buy
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,151	| episode1 |	This product
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:12,991	| episode1 |	It fits well with these other products that you have
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:19,391	| episode1 |	And on the retailer side they're showing the retailer the same sort of data and then offering them the chance to go
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,695	| episode1 |	Give you coupons or
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:26,815	| episode1 |	Special discounts or maybe an email marketing campaign towards you
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:36,031	| episode1 |	You may or may not like us
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,823	| episode1 |	I'll steal from the company
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:44,223	| episode1 |	That's in my backyard practically Pennsylvania's it from his own off so this software back into
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| episode1 |	Amazon AWS
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,831	| episode1 |	That does all of this stuff end
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,903	| episode1 |	I noticed by poking around in the app a little bit
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:57,023	| episode1 |	A couple things that aren't available today like appliances
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:01,375	| episode1 |	It kind of hint to me that maybe we're going to see some cool stuff in the future
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:07,775	| episode1 |	Like appliances I'm actually on their webpage right now
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:14,175	| episode1 |	Now and they say that they're suffer framework scales across mobile devices and such which we knew that already but also HGTV
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:20,575	| episode1 |	These Blu-ray players clock radios picture frames so you could really start seeing a lot of smart
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,623	| episode1 |	Devices around the home that we don't think of today
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,927	| episode1 |	True I know that they
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,695	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:29,535	| episode1 |	Zod provides the backend software for the Salton Sea
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| episode1 |	Remote control blinds
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:35,167	| episode1 |	Which is kind of high and proprietary
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,471	| episode1 |	Home system
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,775	| episode1 |	Hours for my blood
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:46,175	| episode1 |	It's so they do that and I talked to the
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:49,503	| episode1 |	Paseo Mike Harris the other day and he mentioned to me that
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,343	| episode1 |	We should expect in the coming months to see new channel partners
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:53,855	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:59,743	| episode1 |	I'm very eager to see what he's got there and he also mentioned to me because
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| episode1 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,351	| episode1 |	I guess we haven't talked about this cuz we've been on Hiatus for a couple weeks
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,887	| episode1 |	But Amazon
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:06,911	| episode1 |	Has
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,727	| episode1 |	Put a call out for Developers
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:14,335	| episode1 |	Porous SDK there that I've actually started releasing an s2k for its Echo
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,151	| episode1 |	I don't know if you remember this but when
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:23,295	| episode1 |	I was trying out the echo the one thing I really wanted to do was command the echo to do things like open my blinds are turn off my lights
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,415	| episode1 |	Softcore says like Mike are you guys going to work with the
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,463	| episode1 |	Amazon STK
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,535	| episode1 |	He said that was something they wanted to do so
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:41,215	| episode1 |	Song Welcome to do that too I know so I'm hoping that that comes because they had actually had a deal with
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,519	| episode1 |	Ivy the voice controlled alarm clock
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:44,799	| episode1 |	That didn't
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:49,151	| episode1 |	Work out so well on the Staples end I don't think Staples offers that product anymore
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,175	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:55,295	| episode1 |	You know in my quest for home automation voice control is really high up there
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,599	| episode1 |	One day
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:01,183	| episode1 |	I agree if the invisible interface I said that for years
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,511	| episode1 |	Did you write I've heard you for years
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| episode1 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:10,911	| episode1 |	No it's okay there's a reason you're here
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,263	| episode1 |	I'm going to go check out my Staples now because
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,055	| episode1 |	I'm kind of excited by that you
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:20,127	| episode1 |	It's a good deal in Uno if you don't mind
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,175	| episode1 |	Swapping out your light switches
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:27,295	| episode1 |	I really love the Lutron stuff I know it's an old interface
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,111	| episode1 |	But it works so well oh
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,879	| episode1 |	And
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,439	| episode1 |	For all of you guys out there who really like
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:39,327	| episode1 |	Who really like lighting and I know I get in trouble every time I talk about lighting I'm sorry Mia culpa
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,351	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:47,263	| episode1 |	This is the only platform that I've experienced so far that I can actually use the Lutron Pico remote
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,311	| episode1 |	To control both my Lutron lights
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,919	| episode1 |	And any other lights that are tied into the platform
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,223	| episode1 |	So I can control my Hue Lights
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,807	| episode1 |	My like zigbee or other lights
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:00,831	| episode1 |	In
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:04,159	| episode1 |	All of that on one little remote control which is
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,951	| episode1 |	I'm going to say it pretty darn handy
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,559	| episode1 |	That's nice I know you like your remote controls as opposed to using
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:14,399	| episode1 |	Your phone so that's that's that's great
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:22,079	| episode1 |	Picking up the phone unlocking the phone and opening the app on your Apple watch don't worry
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,919	| episode1 |	Like I'm buying the Apple watch showing all your experience with user I think
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,943	| episode1 |	I am weight
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:31,551	| episode1 |	But you have an iPhone are you going to buy the Apple watch use a mall
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:37,951	| episode1 |	ISO from Windows phone all the way on up or down the stack are we going to look at it I don't know I'm still not
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,463	| episode1 |	Not convinced
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,255	| episode1 |	That is going to do
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,839	| episode1 |	Enough for the price for me if I do get when I will say this right up front
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:47,167	| episode1 |	I'll probably get the smaller one not just cuz it's $50 cheaper
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,959	| episode1 |	But also because
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| episode1 |	I'll get the sport model
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,799	| episode1 |	43409 so
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:56,639	| episode1 |	I'll save some money there I don't want spend five six hundred or more on on a watch
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,919	| episode1 |	Not smart watch
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:02,015	| episode1 |	Okay is that is a lot of money to spend on a watch
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,039	| episode1 |	And
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,551	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,623	| episode1 |	What would you what are you most looking
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,671	| episode1 |	Forward to about the Watcher does it
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,207	| episode1 |	Meet your needs
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:16,607	| episode1 |	That's the thing. You know I wear an Android Wear watch now and it I think meets my needs better
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:20,703	| episode1 |	Because of the Google Now contextual notifications that pop up throughout the day
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,007	| episode1 |	And you don't have that with
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,055	| episode1 |	With an Apple Watch at least not out of the gate
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,591	| episode1 |	On the flip side is
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:30,175	| episode1 |	You're locked in if you buy an Android Wear watch you can only use it with
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:33,503	| episode1 |	Android phone and I don't always use an Android phone so
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,319	| episode1 |	I may just buy an Apple Watch I don't know I also
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:39,647	| episode1 |	Back the pebble time so I have that coming in May
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,439	| episode1 |	Which is cross platform
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:47,839	| episode1 |	Well and you also I mean the Apple watch is the same thing I made it only works with the iPhone
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,631	| episode1 |	Exactly what I like.
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,447	| episode1 |	Yeah that's why I backup Pebble time quite honestly
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,751	| episode1 |	I prefer a cross-platform solution
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,543	| episode1 |	Pretty much anything I need these days
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,311	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:02,431	| episode1 |	I don't want to have to worry about what device I'm using who made it and what software runs
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:05,247	| episode1 |	I would just want to use apps and services
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,271	| episode1 |	Across
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,807	| episode1 |	My choices and
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,391	| episode1 |	I don't know yet but I'm not
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:17,791	| episode1 |	I'm not sold on the Apple watch I will say this haven't used it at the end when it actually for a little while at the Apple event
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,303	| episode1 |	Earlier this month
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,887	| episode1 |	Even though it does a lot of the same things as the Android Wear watch
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,191	| episode1 |	In typical Apple fashion it does
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,727	| episode1 |	Have a very elegant fluid
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,543	| episode1 |	Way of doing things
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,615	| episode1 |	I do think they got away from their Simplicity a little bit but you're
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:36,479	| episode1 |	You stuck with a small screen and few buttons it's very hard to keep things simple with user experience so
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,807	| episode1 |	Jury still out yet on that
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,903	| episode1 |	Well I do also I remember you writing many many many
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| episode1 |	Months ago or maybe it's years ago even
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,303	| episode1 |	You know nobody knows what they want a smartwatch to be
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:53,119	| episode1 |	So it's very hard to design
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:57,215	| episode1 |	A simple interface for something when you don't know what it what it really is yet
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,287	| episode1 |	Yeah this isn't evolving category and
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,335	| episode1 |	It's going to change and there's no doubt about it
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,663	| episode1 |	I think back to when the first iPhone came out in 2007
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:09,247	| episode1 |	That was kind of a turning point for the smartphone era
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:15,647	| episode1 |	But it was really about a year later that we really got what we all wanted in that was apps and it's going to take time for the
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,439	| episode1 |	The Apple watch to get its abscess while so
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,999	| episode1 |	This is going to be an interesting year of evolution I think
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,047	| episode1 |	And maybe maybe
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,095	| episode1 |	Interfacer
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,911	| episode1 |	The model for the watch isn't apps
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,703	| episode1 |	I kind of look at that and I think
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:36,127	| episode1 |	I really think it could be sensors in just like an interface or just providing additional context in
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,687	| episode1 |	In that situation you don't even need
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,735	| episode1 |	Apps per say you just need
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,807	| episode1 |	Sensors interacting with things around yuan
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,343	| episode1 |	Yep that's it
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:51,487	| episode1 |	At that point it also becomes a presence indicator and identity indicator and there's a lot of other things that are
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| episode1 |	Not
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,815	| episode1 |	Abcentric that this could work
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,095	| episode1 |	4
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,631	| episode1 |	In the future so
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:04,031	| episode1 |	But then you need you need a lot more around the watch that works with a watch for that
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,799	| episode1 |	To actually
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:07,103	| episode1 |	For it to be valuable enough to people
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:09,919	| episode1 |	A whole ecosystem I know an apple
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:14,783	| episode1 |	Apples good at that again though I think
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:15,807	| episode1 |	I think
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:23,231	| episode1 |	You would have to have homekit be already out in the market I think it's going to be hard if you're not cross platform
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:23,999	| episode1 |	I think
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,791	| episode1 |	As the ecosystem
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:26,815	| episode1 |	Gets
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:34,239	| episode1 |	Wider as it spans more than just a phone in more than just a computer and it starts didn't touch
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:38,847	| episode1 |	Every aspect of Our Lives it becomes really hard to be so vertically integrated
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,175	| episode1 |	I guess or so to have such a wall Garden
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,479	| episode1 |	It is a challenge
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:49,343	| episode1 |	But it's also a challenge that Apple has face before and they have experience with it
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:56,255	| episode1 |	And some people like to be inside Apple's world nothing there something wrong with that and it's perfectly fine. You know I know I know
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:59,327	| episode1 |	I'm not like everybody I was actually happy to hear that
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,887	| episode1 |	Android where may I should be coming to iOS
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,935	| episode1 |	In which case you could use an Android Wear
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,471	| episode1 |	Watch with an iPhone
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:08,799	| episode1 |	I don't think it'll give you the best integrated experience because of that
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| episode1 |	Vertical integration that's
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,359	| episode1 |	That's missing
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,967	| episode1 |	I might be happy enough with that again I I like Choice that's just that's just me
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,759	| episode1 |	Okay fair enough
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:26,463	| episode1 |	I want to say I also want to draw your attention to the fact that Google Now did they talked about
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:31,839	| episode1 |	An open API for Google now so you might actually get Google Now on your Apple watch
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:36,191	| episode1 |	You know two things come to mind here or you can already get
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:41,055	| episode1 |	Google Now notifications on iOS devices if you install the Google Search app
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:44,639	| episode1 |	It feels in which is really clever of Google in my opinion
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:50,271	| episode1 |	So you know I'm using an iPhone today and I already had a couple of contextual notifications pop up
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:55,135	| episode1 |	So pushing us over to an Apple Watch really shouldn't be a big deal because it's just a notification
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:00,767	| episode1 |	But as far as Google Now itself it and the openness of that that's
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,535	| episode1 |	Coming there
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,863	| episode1 |	This is becoming a whole little mini platform for Google
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:11,263	| episode1 |	Please Google Now cards that start out with just basic contextual things that it learns from you about your penis through your email
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:15,103	| episode1 |	Baylor Fort Worth to other Google service interactions
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:21,503	| episode1 |	Now that they're opening this up to developers yeah it's great to have you know a little cards that pop up from apps that say hey
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,527	| episode1 |	You're near
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:26,111	| episode1 |	The coffee shop you want to check on the FourSquare or something
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:29,695	| episode1 |	It is bridging at that gap between the app and
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| episode1 |	And having to
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:37,375	| episode1 |	Please unlock your phone go to the right app and so on apps come to you that information comes to you and I think that is really
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,679	| episode1 |	We're Google now it's going to be 6 continue to be successful
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,471	| episode1 |	I cannot wait
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:45,823	| episode1 |	I think that's probably a good place to end today or this this note of optimism
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:46,847	| episode1 |	And
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:51,711	| episode1 |	We'll stay tuned for our guests who is Brady Forest of

EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:05,279	| episode1 |	Which I'm really excited about make them cross platform
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:11,935	| episode1 |	But we did talk about making sure that you know they work and support usually
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,007	| episode1 |	Yeah well you know you'd be surprised how many don't work
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,519	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:22,175	| episode1 |	Or maybe you wouldn't cuz you talk to me and you experience the joys of them not working yourself I only buy the ones that were
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:27,807	| episode1 |	I on the other hand by all kinds of stuff but I'm going to Staples that's it

EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,047	| episode1 |	Wrigley
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,607	| episode1 |	The drop kitchen scale
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,423	| episode1 |	I'm trying to think of others that I know I've talked about I
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:26,591	| episode1 |	Well I don't know what are some of your I won't say favorites Brady cuz I'm sure you love them all but what are some of the ones that I know
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:29,919	| episode1 |	I know have hit the market cuz we try to talk about things that are mostly on the market
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:33,247	| episode1 |	Things that are
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:37,855	| episode1 |	Let's let's do mostly on the market and you can throw in one or two
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,391	| episode1 |	Are available on crowdfunding
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:45,023	| episode1 |	Sure I mean I think right now it's really just dropping ring
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:50,399	| episode1 |	Things that will be available sooner rather than later or birdie and Toto
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| episode1 |	NFC
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:56,799	| episode1 |	Things that justic crowdfunding yesterday or switchmate photo
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,103	| episode1 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,151	| episode1 |	Which is a Bluetooth
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,271	| episode1 |	Oh yes I got excited about I'm a real fan of buttons
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:10,111	| episode1 |	I love to press things to make things happened as opposed to
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,159	| episode1 |	Relying on my smartphone
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,439	| episode1 |	I'm so
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:14,719	| episode1 |	Button fan
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,279	| episode1 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:17,791	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:23,935	| episode1 |	The reason Brady is on the show is because a couple weeks ago I just got so fed up
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,983	| episode1 |	With getting devices that didn't work
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:27,519	| episode1 |	And
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,591	| episode1 |	I am constantly testing devices so part of this is
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| episode1 |	My job
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,919	| episode1 |	Is getting these connected devices in
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,967	| episode1 |	Playing with them
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:39,039	| episode1 |	But after probably 2 years of doing this
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:42,111	| episode1 |	And they showing things off to my friends and having that moment of like
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:47,487	| episode1 |	Please please please I just talk to sub to everybody and pressing a button and then nothing happening
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:50,815	| episode1 |	And my friends going wow this is really awesome
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,607	| episode1 |	I realized that
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:57,727	| episode1 |	The smart home is never going to take off at this is the user experience that people have when they spend you know
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,263	| episode1 |	Two hundred bucks on a device in
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,799	| episode1 |	It only works half the time
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:02,847	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,383	| episode1 |	I thought because
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,431	| episode1 |	So far the two devices that
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,247	| episode1 |	And there's more than just too but
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,783	| episode1 |	PCH
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,319	| episode1 |	In my my
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,367	| episode1 |	Highway 1 devices it really works
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,135	| episode1 |	Well
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,928	| episode1 |	Out of all the devices that I've tried
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| episode1 |	So I thought you'd be a good person to talk about
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,024	| episode1 |	When devices
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:24,864	| episode1 |	You know when can they actually be kind of like
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,400	| episode1 |	Beta devices and then
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| episode1 |	How do you get
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,704	| episode1 |	A device into the hands of
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:30,496	| episode1 |	Consumers that does work
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:33,312	| episode1 |	And isn't kind of an iterative process while it's out of the market
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,592	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,384	| episode1 |	Let's start
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,152	| episode1 |	Brady with
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,176	| episode1 |	Gosh
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,992	| episode1 |	When can a device be
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,272	| episode1 |	I guess in beta still
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,576	| episode1 |	And Beyond
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:51,232	| episode1 |	Because there's no
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:54,560	| episode1 |	There's no registry that says Okay a product is finished
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:57,632	| episode1 |	And reality is
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:01,472	| episode1 |	That said there's a big difference between
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,008	| episode1 |	Thug
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,056	| episode1 |	Where it
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,104	| episode1 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:10,176	| episode1 |	Which hopefully most of the things you're experiencing are bugs
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,712	| episode1 |	And
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,736	| episode1 |	Crab say
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,016	| episode1 |	What's
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:17,600	| episode1 |	Castle call designs on gourds
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,368	| episode1 |	Which is
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:21,952	| episode1 |	When it doesn't work the way it should but it is actually how they
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,488	| episode1 |	I work
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,560	| episode1 |	It's on the one case
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,400	| episode1 |	Honestly I think
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,216	| episode1 |	Which happens all the time
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| episode1 |	Or
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,752	| episode1 |	They had
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,848	| episode1 |	In a lot of the mobile platforms that these companies depend on
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,408	| episode1 |	I have ever shifting
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,456	| episode1 |	Code an API
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,528	| episode1 |	And so sometimes the stack actually changes underneath though
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,832	| episode1 |	Or you're using some configuration
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,112	| episode1 |	But they were unable to test
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,440	| episode1 |	Cuz I'm Lottery
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:53,952	| episode1 |	AR
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:58,816	| episode1 |	Constantly changing for Developers
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,632	| episode1 |	Hundreds of thousands of Android phones
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,936	| episode1 |	Numerous
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,960	| episode1 |	Bluetooth stacks
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:09,824	| episode1 |	There's thousands of Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,640	| episode1 |	Docker Network stopped working
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,664	| episode1 |	Elizabeth connection
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,784	| episode1 |	There's also the design flaws
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,064	| episode1 |	And that's when
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:23,136	| episode1 |	The inventor has come up with something they think
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,184	| episode1 |	A device
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,768	| episode1 |	But let's say a switchmate
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,560	| episode1 |	You design it to turn off your lights
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,352	| episode1 |	From your phone
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:33,888	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:37,216	| episode1 |	Like what you said Stacy you don't want to turn off the lights
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:43,872	| episode1 |	When you first get it
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,176	| episode1 |	Definitely turns off
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,480	| episode1 |	Your lights whenever you want to
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,552	| episode1 |	You don't like you got an erection
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:55,648	| episode1 |	And you wish it did something more until in that way this kind of
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,952	| episode1 |	Failed in that scenario for you
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:01,024	| episode1 |	Okay well in India time
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,584	| episode1 |	I'm less concerned about that because
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,656	| episode1 |	I am forgetting that you know
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,704	| episode1 |	The people who are building these products
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,240	| episode1 |	You know they have a limited
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,568	| episode1 |	They're usually startups they have maybe
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,360	| episode1 |	Five or ten people on a team they can't get
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:22,016	| episode1 |	I feel like if you meet your specs that you've advertised to me
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,040	| episode1 |	You're doing great
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,576	| episode1 |	That's all I want
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,904	| episode1 |	I would say though
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,416	| episode1 |	That
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,952	| episode1 |	So so let's
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:34,816	| episode1 |	Let's talk about the ways that you can fail the consumer cuz I think that's that's probably really relevant
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,656	| episode1 |	Phelous
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:42,496	| episode1 |	You can fail in many ways as Hess I have discovered throughout my life
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:46,080	| episode1 |	So there's there's the failure of a product
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:49,152	| episode1 |	Working as advertised and I think
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:51,200	| episode1 |	One way that this happens is
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,016	| episode1 |	When someone launches like on Kickstarter
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,320	| episode1 |	Or promotes their product
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,600	| episode1 |	There is
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:02,720	| episode1 |	They often have the list of basic features it'll do the following things
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:07,072	| episode1 |	And then I have the list of like things they would like to have and then they have things that
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:10,912	| episode1 |	They promised when they talked to reporters about
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,680	| episode1 |	What they're doing
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:15,264	| episode1 |	And sometimes that all gets kind of muddled together
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| episode1 |	I don't know if you've noticed that
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:21,920	| episode1 |	I don't know what the advice is and I see this all the time I mean I see it with like
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:26,528	| episode1 |	Products that talks about algorithms especially they're like oh it's going to anticipate your every need
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,856	| episode1 |	But that's not going to come out for another six months after we launched
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,392	| episode1 |	Great
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,928	| episode1 |	And really my everything
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,952	| episode1 |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:38,816	| episode1 |	That sounds awesome I'm going to totally Bacchus fresh
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:40,608	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:44,704	| episode1 |	When you when you think about that is is that somewhat
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:48,288	| episode1 |	What would you advise companies to do do you think they should be
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,336	| episode1 |	Talking about those
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:56,736	| episode1 |	Things do you think it's maybe people like me the reporters who are like all this sounds great
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,760	| episode1 |	A little bit I got to admit
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,088	| episode1 |	Well I think that
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,904	| episode1 |	Companies should always be clear when that
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:09,792	| episode1 |	What is its width Now versus what it will ship with
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,072	| episode1 |	And
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:16,704	| episode1 |	I think they should be clear when something is going to require a lot of customers to get
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,240	| episode1 |	2 scale
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,032	| episode1 |	And so
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:23,616	| episode1 |	When it's something that's going to anticipate your every need
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,384	| episode1 |	Comedian
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,176	| episode1 |	That says
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:30,784	| episode1 |	What has alot of data it will be able to figure out what users in various situations do
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:34,624	| episode1 |	The thing is they shouldn't over promise those things because
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,696	| episode1 |	Until they hit mescale they won't hit
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:39,232	| episode1 |	No scenarios
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:42,816	| episode1 |	And so they won't know what to do and that is stereos
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,608	| episode1 |	And the reality is still never
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,632	| episode1 |	Every scenario
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,168	| episode1 |	Even Google it
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,192	| episode1 |	You know
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:53,312	| episode1 |	I forget the percentage but it's never seen everyday
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:57,920	| episode1 |	Google
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,736	| episode1 |	More queries that have multiple pets
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,552	| episode1 |	User cache
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:06,880	| episode1 |	Don't have that advantage
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,904	| episode1 |	And so small
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:12,768	| episode1 |	Companies that are trying to take advantage of user data is it only have a small user base
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,792	| episode1 |	They're not going to
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,840	| episode1 |	Be able to anticipate your every need
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,400	| episode1 |	That is a real bummer
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,168	| episode1 |	But you're probably right
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,728	| episode1 |	And what about
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,568	| episode1 |	What about Baseline features cuz this is another
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:28,896	| episode1 |	Spot where I see companies fail so
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:32,480	| episode1 |	For example I recently tried out a home security system
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:33,760	| episode1 |	That
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:38,112	| episode1 |	And in this might be good for birdie because birdie is a home security
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,672	| episode1 |	Customer in air quality monitoring system isn't it
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,976	| episode1 |	Air quality monitor
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,512	| episode1 |	Is a scary
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,792	| episode1 |	That's right different birds
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,608	| episode1 |	I'm so pretty air quality NVM
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,936	| episode1 |	So I tried out a home security system
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,984	| episode1 |	And what are the things that
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,032	| episode1 |	Actually wasn't a future but
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,824	| episode1 |	It should have been a future in
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,848	| episode1 |	Maybe now
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:01,152	| episode1 |	Was but it didn't notify me when it went offline
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,968	| episode1 |	I thought that was
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,528	| episode1 |	You know a glaring failure
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,576	| episode1 |	In the product that
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,416	| episode1 |	Wasn't even part of the design specs so
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:15,744	| episode1 |	And they could add it later right and I'm sure they did
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,256	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,840	| episode1 |	So that that's okay swear it wasn't a bug it was just
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,656	| episode1 |	I guess that design
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,680	| episode1 |	Failure in
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| episode1 |	I don't know how like
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,544	| episode1 |	To think about things like that and how
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,848	| episode1 |	You prevent something like that on the product
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,616	| episode1 |	Design side
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,176	| episode1 |	How do you advise your company's
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,712	| episode1 |	I think about things
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,224	| episode1 |	Like that
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:40,576	| episode1 |	Well we try to get our company is to
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:44,416	| episode1 |	Beta units into the hands of customers as soon as possible
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,976	| episode1 |	And that's that's how you that's how you figure that out
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:53,632	| episode1 |	Bluetooth controller
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,520	| episode1 |	Several small let's say Alpha
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,800	| episode1 |	Runs
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:05,152	| episode1 |	IMusic sometimes like 3D printed super ugly and I sent them
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,968	| episode1 |	All over the US
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,504	| episode1 |	Just to see how people would use them
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:13,856	| episode1 |	And that's how they realize that they still needed to be able to turn on the lights manually
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,392	| episode1 |	Not just
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:19,488	| episode1 |	They had one user
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:22,048	| episode1 |	Actually you know knock it off the wall and break it
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:24,096	| episode1 |	Nothing really like
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,376	| episode1 |	Treat this like a
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,472	| episode1 |	We need to ask
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:32,544	| episode1 |	Insulated rubber gasket to add more friction
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:40,224	| episode1 |	And they also put a little buffer unit around the XL controller so that the the end product
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,272	| episode1 |	Could stand up to
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,856	| episode1 |	Getting your product
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,648	| episode1 |	To customers to see how to use it
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:51,232	| episode1 |	Is how you find these laws
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,536	| episode1 |	Another example is
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,096	| episode1 |	Current lettuce with their product
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,376	| episode1 |	They launched
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,912	| episode1 |	Kickstarter beta
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| episode1 |	In January
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:01,984	| episode1 |	They
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:06,336	| episode1 |	Did the kickstarter a confidence 30 units I believe
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,640	| episode1 |	Sold out in 24 hours
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,200	| episode1 |	And all the customers who bought it
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,480	| episode1 |	Will get
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:14,016	| episode1 |	A new Fitbit
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,552	| episode1 |	When the real product comes out
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,880	| episode1 |	Or at least 10
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:21,696	| episode1 |	Promised by signing up for this Kickstarter
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:24,000	| episode1 |	That they will send feedback
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,304	| episode1 |	And help inform the team about the product
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| episode1 |	When actually ship
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:31,168	| episode1 |	Orlin actually wants the real crowdfunding campaign
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:34,496	| episode1 |	Deliver the experience they want
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:37,824	| episode1 |	We pick up people to pay for the device that they're going to test
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,640	| episode1 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:50,368	| episode1 |	You'll have the features
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:52,416	| episode1 |	And I can control the heater and lights
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:54,720	| episode1 |	This is a fully functioning device
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,488	| episode1 |	However
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:00,096	| episode1 |	It won't be the exact experience they want
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:03,680	| episode1 |	They're still learning how to interact with it with the software
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,008	| episode1 |	So I mean
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,544	| episode1 |	These are going to be expensive
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:13,408	| episode1 |	Current isn't going to make any money
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:19,040	| episode1 |	No they didn't even find the cost of like
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,064	| episode1 |	The original betas
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,624	| episode1 |	Even offset the cost
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,160	| episode1 |	Beta unit
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,672	| episode1 |	It's great
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:26,720	| episode1 |	Okay
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:33,376	| episode1 |	So that's that's good feedback in the fact that maybe maybe you can even get people like
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,912	| episode1 |	If you have some sort of product that
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:38,496	| episode1 |	Really hankering for you can even get them to offset the cost of your Betta is great
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,080	| episode1 |	The other
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:44,640	| episode1 |	But let's talk about cutting the complicated
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:47,968	| episode1 |	That you can fail with bugs because I think
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,992	| episode1 |	That's where a lot of this
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:50,016	| episode1 |	Happens
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:52,576	| episode1 |	In this is super hard
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:55,904	| episode1 |	And you brought us a really good points and I don't know how to
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,440	| episode1 |	I don't know how
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,720	| episode1 |	Companies can deal with this
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,072	| episode1 |	The idea that there are so many platforms
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:06,912	| episode1 |	Then the idea that their people are clamoring for Integrations
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:10,752	| episode1 |	So if you got a connected device that you're trying to
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:11,776	| episode1 |	Launch
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:18,176	| episode1 |	Do you recommend that people start with maybe one platform like maybe just iOS
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:20,992	| episode1 |	Get it out on the market and then try to
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:24,576	| episode1 |	Build for Android is that one way to control kind of the Experian
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,368	| episode1 |	Or
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,184	| episode1 |	Is that not good enough fight I don't know
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:35,328	| episode1 |	I think simplifying the number
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:43,520	| episode1 |	Limit the number of bugs and Stereos got to deal with I don't feel like people in the eye
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,056	| episode1 |	Hold on Android for too long
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,848	| episode1 |	Because there's still quite a
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:51,456	| episode1 |	Salina technical world there's a lot of people who use Android
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,992	| episode1 |	I'm an Android user
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,016	| episode1 |	I will tell you that
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:33:00,416	| episode1 |	Yeah I think it's quite tricky to to totally avoid
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,512	| episode1 |	Keywords to get caught up in a lot of things
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:09,376	| episode1 |	Scenarios around relying on other people's platforms
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:15,008	| episode1 |	I'm so excited
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| episode1 |	Playground
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,568	| episode1 |	Here at Highway 1
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:21,152	| episode1 |	Where we have it so no sweetheart Hugh we have SmartThings
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:22,944	| episode1 |	We have a nest
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:26,784	| episode1 |	We will have a flex what kind of switchmate will have the birdie
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:29,088	| episode1 |	So the people can test
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,368	| episode1 |	How their device interacts
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,720	| episode1 |	Actually get into the home
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,280	| episode1 |	You know it's a work with SmartThings
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,072	| episode1 |	You know it'll work with nest
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,632	| episode1 |	Less people going to blonde
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,472	| episode1 |	That magical experience
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:47,008	| episode1 |	From you
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,800	| episode1 |	Systems work together
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:52,896	| episode1 |	Or they could send it to me cuz you just described my home
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,944	| episode1 |	And I even have more if they want more
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:34:00,832	| episode1 |	What we can put you on our business
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:06,464	| episode1 |	Bacon bacon just be like I will send it to Stacy
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:09,792	| episode1 |	Her home is a nightmare of epic proportions
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,376	| episode1 |	Alright so
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,960	| episode1 |	So let's see cuz cuz that is I will say
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,776	| episode1 |	You know what I actually
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,568	| episode1 |	The first thing when I get a device
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,104	| episode1 |	I actually
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,384	| episode1 |	Tested on its own Merit
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:25,152	| episode1 |	That's before I
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:25,920	| episode1 |	Hook it up to anything
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,200	| episode1 |	Because
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:30,016	| episode1 |	Because I fundamentally think it's unfair to be like
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:34,624	| episode1 |	This is awesome now I'm going to break you with like hooking you up to 20 different things
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,696	| episode1 |	Because I mankind
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:39,488	| episode1 |	Maybe I'm not
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,000	| episode1 |	Find I don't know
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,840	| episode1 |	What it comes to
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,448	| episode1 |	The Integrations this is this is really tricky in
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,472	| episode1 |	And I don't know
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:53,056	| episode1 |	How your your companies and how you tell your company's
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,872	| episode1 |	It is a consumer I don't
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:58,176	| episode1 |	I know what I do but I don't know what the normal
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,968	| episode1 |	So let's let's get your take on
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:06,368	| episode1 |	Things don't always work even like when I test out my works with Nest integration
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:09,184	| episode1 |	A perfect example will pick up big companies cuz
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:12,256	| episode1 |	Cuz they have they have power they couldn't they can handle it
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:16,096	| episode1 |	I was really excited about
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,888	| episode1 |	The shoe works with Nest integration
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,936	| episode1 |	Because I love my
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,704	| episode1 |	Hewn
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,216	| episode1 |	I like my nest
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:24,032	| episode1 |	And I thought the integration was really clever
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:29,152	| episode1 |	So I hooked it up and he was a great toggle
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,712	| episode1 |	And then I noticed an idea was when you
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:34,528	| episode1 |	Link your nest in your Hue Lights together
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,832	| episode1 |	When your nest goes to away
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:40,160	| episode1 |	After about a minute your Hue Lights will fade slowly off
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:41,440	| episode1 |	And you will save energy
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,000	| episode1 |	And if you
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,536	| episode1 |	You're like oh that's so nice
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:50,144	| episode1 |	And then if you're away for more than a day your Hue Lights will randomly go
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:53,728	| episode1 |	On and off in a random pattern to mimic someone being at home
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,008	| episode1 |	So you're like
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,544	| episode1 |	So cool
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:59,616	| episode1 |	Okay so I was sold I thought that was great
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:02,176	| episode1 |	Turn it on and then
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:04,992	| episode1 |	I had like a television crew in my house
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:10,112	| episode1 |	And I'm like this is going to be great guys watch this I told them about this integration they're like
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:13,696	| episode1 |	And then I turned I turn my Nest to away
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,720	| episode1 |	And we're staring at the lights
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,512	| episode1 |	And nothing has
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:21,376	| episode1 |	I think it's going to take a minute they want you to be able to walk out of the house
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,168	| episode1 |	Without

EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:26,240	| episode1 |	They don't want the lights to all go off at once
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,544	| episode1 |	So we're still staring at the lights and they're like
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,896	| episode1 |	Nothing
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:33,920	| episode1 |	Finally
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,944	| episode1 |	We realized
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,968	| episode1 |	It just didn't work
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,016	| episode1 |	So I'm like

EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:57,216	| episode1 |	Both of these are actually have the consumer hotline which is nice
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,288	| episode1 |	You have to go to the forums
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,872	| episode1 |	Did they actually who pushed out an update
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:06,688	| episode1 |	It was a couple people had needed an update

EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:09,760	| episode1 |	The bottom line is
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,808	| episode1 |	These don't always work
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,320	| episode1 |	And

EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:28,192	| episode1 |	I always tell them to get out front
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:29,984	| episode1 |	I mean
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,592	| episode1 |	MC not more with

EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,184	| episode1 |	And I think
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:51,744	| episode1 |	I need that
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:55,328	| episode1 |	Some people need to realize or companies need to realize
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,096	| episode1 |	Integrations
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:03,008	| episode1 |	I mean you and consumers in your direction
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,800	| episode1 |	After they already want your use case
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:07,360	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,408	| episode1 |	In the case of IV
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,016	| episode1 |	You want voice control for your phone
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:18,112	| episode1 |	Fact that it works with nest and you have the nest

EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:29,632	| episode1 |	But
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:32,448	| episode1 |	At its core it's going to be
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,984	| episode1 |	Whether or not your device looks
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,544	| episode1 |	Fair enough
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:38,848	| episode1 |	So

EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:45,760	| episode1 |	I do think that there is a market
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,832	| episode1 |	That you can test devices on so is it your
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:52,928	| episode1 |	Clearly labeled Kickstarter bettas like the is it
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,208	| episode1 |	Fish bits

EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:11,360	| episode1 |	Indiegogo or Kickstarter crowdfunded kind of thing either self-funded or however
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:14,432	| episode1 |	Self-starter kind of thing
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,712	| episode1 |	Or is it
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:19,040	| episode1 |	It it's not at a brick-and-mortar level it's
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:21,600	| episode1 |	Probably not on your website I don't know
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:23,904	| episode1 |	At what point in time can you
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,416	| episode1 |	Kind of
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:27,488	| episode1 |	Have these preview Hardware things

EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,632	| episode1 |	Pretty seamless for the end
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:39,264	| episode1 |	I mean I think it's a chance on this on the company
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,032	| episode1 |	And product
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:43,104	| episode1 |	A lot of V ones

EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:05,888	| episode1 |	The reality of these teams are five people
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,424	| episode1 |	7 people
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:13,568	| episode1 |	Extended shipping to 30 people so they're going to catch a bunch of bugs
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,336	| episode1 |	Obvious one
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,384	| episode1 |	But it won't catch them all
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,688	| episode1 |	And they won't catch them all
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:20,480	| episode1 |	Even after this ship to 10000 people
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,552	| episode1 |	They will still encounter new box

EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:31,488	| episode1 |	I'll be able to fix the bugs as they encounter them
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:34,560	| episode1 |	New bugs
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:39,168	| episode1 |	Best product

EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:12,192	| episode1 |	You make the Model T automobile
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:15,776	| episode1 |	Don't buy the first version of a self-driving car
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,824	| episode1 |	It's
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:18,848	| episode1 |	There
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:24,480	| episode1 |	Good companies are figuring this out they are figuring out
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:24,992	| episode1 |	I mean
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:28,320	| episode1 |	They are trying to create something new
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:29,600	| episode1 |	And trying to create a company
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:34,208	| episode1 |	Trying to figure out the company
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:36,768	| episode1 |	The building that product
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,560	| episode1 |	So
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,632	| episode1 |	It can be a challenge to do both
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,168	| episode1 |	At once
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,704	| episode1 |	It's like
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,496	| episode1 |	Building the airplane on your way down
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:50,336	| episode1 |	Okay very scary
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:56,735	| episode1 |	What happens if I mean because a lot of these are startups
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:58,783	| episode1 |	What do you say
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:01,599	| episode1 |	What do you recommend for these companies do they have like a
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:05,951	| episode1 |	A parachute do they have an exit plan for their consumers or
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:12,095	| episode1 |	What do you what do you tell them in case they go out of business and they leave people with
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:14,911	| episode1 |	These connected devices that may or may not be so
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,935	| episode1 |	Deported after
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| episode1 |	A year to
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:17,983	| episode1 |	I mean
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:25,151	| episode1 |	I onion I think that that's something that the iot states is going to encounter
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:29,503	| episode1 |	And we'll need to figure out I think it's something that they can learn from the web
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:32,063	| episode1 |	I remember when Billy was first coming out
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:34,623	| episode1 |	And there was a lot of concern about how
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:40,511	| episode1 |	URL shortener
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,535	| episode1 |	You don't know
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,815	| episode1 |	Where is actually meeting you too
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,607	| episode1 |	And that's
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:47,423	| episode1 |	And I brought on a lot of those
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:51,519	| episode1 |	Ruined the world with rickrolling
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,823	| episode1 |	Having perpetrated that way
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,615	| episode1 |	Italy
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:58,175	| episode1 |	Their credit
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:58,687	| episode1 |	Argument
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:05,087	| episode1 |	And said okay if we ever go out of business we are going to open source
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:08,927	| episode1 |	Our or make available our database
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,951	| episode1 |	Lynx
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:12,767	| episode1 |	And so that other people can
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:17,631	| episode1 |	USB is cuz we don't think you are going to go away but at least
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:18,911	| episode1 |	Translate our links
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,959	| episode1 |	And that really I think
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:26,591	| episode1 |	But these people can
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:30,431	| episode1 |	Still use the bit ly URL Survivor the well
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:32,223	| episode1 |	And I think
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:36,575	| episode1 |	Iot companies haven't hit that issue
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,111	| episode1 |	Where
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:42,463	| episode1 |	They are going to have to deal with
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,559	| episode1 |	Their products going away
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,399	| episode1 |	I think the first consumers
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:54,495	| episode1 |	Yeah cuz the first one we have right now I think
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:58,847	| episode1 |	Well it's probably not the first one but the biggest one that I can think of is the revolve Hub that
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:00,127	| episode1 |	Googlebot
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:01,151	| episode1 |	Revolves in
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:03,711	| episode1 |	Will stop supporting the Hub after a year
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:09,087	| episode1 |	I mean in that that was a company that was bought by Google which is
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:12,159	| episode1 |	Legitimately so legitimate business and
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:13,439	| episode1 |	Piano
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,255	| episode1 |	That's that's not just a
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:18,047	| episode1 |	Zombie kind of company so
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:23,167	| episode1 |	I don't know it is interesting I'm very curious of the devices that I have purchased
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,959	| episode1 |	How many of them will be supported
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:30,335	| episode1 |	Especially things that I have like unscrewed switch plates and rewired into my wall and like
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:34,687	| episode1 |	I hope I don't have to risk dying of electrocution again
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:39,039	| episode1 |	I'm reminded of the leave it loose
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,343	| episode1 |	Yeah Microsoft
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:45,183	| episode1 |	Trying to shut down some of those guns
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:51,839	| episode1 |	Which method people would lose their music

EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:59,519	| episode1 |	I believe they got stuck
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,287	| episode1 |	Make a note
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:02,847	| episode1 |	Now they got Legacy
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,895	| episode1 |	Google can easily
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:08,479	| episode1 |	You can picture the revolve code and system
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:11,295	| episode1 |	Blowing into Nest right so they can easily
