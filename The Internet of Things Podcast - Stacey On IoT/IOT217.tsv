EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,680	| IOT217 |	Heaven
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:51,776	| IOT217 |	I am super excited about this product we saw it at
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,288	| IOT217 |	CES
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| IOT217 |	Amazing
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| IOT217 |	Everybody who has smart
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,896	| IOT217 |	Connected light bulbs
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| IOT217 |	It is upset with the fact
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,480	| IOT217 |	If you turn the switch off
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,272	| IOT217 |	Bulbs
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,552	| IOT217 |	You're both stopped working
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,576	| IOT217 |	There's now a solution
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,368	| IOT217 |	And it's an easy solution
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,904	| IOT217 |	So easy
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| IOT217 |	Lutron is made
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:12,768	| IOT217 |	The Aurora which is a device that you're going to stick on your traditional lights
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,560	| IOT217 |	And then
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:17,888	| IOT217 |	It basically converts them to a Smart Switch without any
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:20,448	| IOT217 |	Wiring in a screwdriver eating anything like that
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,984	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,496	| IOT217 |	I
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,288	| IOT217 |	So excited about the
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,592	| IOT217 |	It's cuz I'm about to move into a rental house
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:31,200	| IOT217 |	And I have Philips hue light bulbs that I'm going to want to connect this to
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,248	| IOT217 |	Then I can basically in my rental house
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,552	| IOT217 |	How smart lighting that doesn't break
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,064	| IOT217 |	When someone turns off
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,600	| IOT217 |	Wichita
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:44,000	| IOT217 |	Whatever that is Keith this it this is interesting because you said there's no wiring involves right
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,536	| IOT217 |	Traditional you'd have to
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,560	| IOT217 |	Swap out a switch
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,072	| IOT217 |	To make it tomorrow
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,144	| IOT217 |	It literally has a little
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:53,728	| IOT217 |	I caught like a plastic round part that goes over your existing light switch
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,800	| IOT217 |	And then on top of that you basically snapping a
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| IOT217 |	Rotary
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,128	| IOT217 |	Dial
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:05,248	| IOT217 |	And the product has a queen-size battery that lasts for 3 years
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| IOT217 |	That's it you just snap it on
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,088	| IOT217 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,880	| IOT217 |	So you can turn on your lights
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,672	| IOT217 |	From the switch
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| IOT217 |	Nobody will be like
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,280	| IOT217 |	You've broken my functionality
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:20,607	| IOT217 |	And it also helps because people who don't
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:25,471	| IOT217 |	Know about Smart Homes are do not want to talk to like Madam and tell her to turn on and off the lights
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:25,983	| IOT217 |	This is wonderful
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,311	| IOT217 |	The downside to this
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,079	| IOT217 |	Is
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,359	| IOT217 |	It only works if you like
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,383	| IOT217 |	And you have to have a hue
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,687	| IOT217 |	You do not however have to have a flu shot
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,991	| IOT217 |	So yeah
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,015	| IOT217 |	You win some you lose
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:41,599	| IOT217 |	Yeah you been using me for this so you have to have some kind of
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,879	| IOT217 |	Sometimes Bridge box
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,927	| IOT217 |	If you already have one
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,719	| IOT217 |	It's really a non-issue
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:51,327	| IOT217 |	The other thing I question the price at $40 a pop because
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,911	| IOT217 |	There's not much to this thing so I would look at things like that and like
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:55,423	| IOT217 |	Panel
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,727	| IOT217 |	A piece of plastic and a battery and
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| IOT217 |	What radio
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,567	| IOT217 |	Save you a ton of time
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| IOT217 |	Keeper
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| IOT217 |	Then irregular
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:03,871	| IOT217 |	Smart Switch
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:09,503	| IOT217 |	And I would say I mean again if someone who's moving into a rental and I'm sure we're going to have a show all about
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,575	| IOT217 |	Gadgets that Stacy is put into a rental unit to make it
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,623	| IOT217 |	Behave intelligently
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,975	| IOT217 |	But as someone in that position I was actually thinking about
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:23,327	| IOT217 |	I have become dependent on my Smart switches that I have throughout my
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| IOT217 |	My home
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,887	| IOT217 |	And what am I going to do to replace a
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,679	| IOT217 |	Now the answer is
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,703	| IOT217 |	Buy a bunch of expense
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,055	| IOT217 |	They're still like $15 a ball
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,591	| IOT217 |	So it's still an investment
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| IOT217 |	When you're talking about like having legs
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,919	| IOT217 |	4 downlights or something
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| IOT217 |	But
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| IOT217 |	Then you never have to get up
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT217 |	Couch
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,807	| IOT217 |	Yay
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,879	| IOT217 |	So this should actually work even if like you're humming
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,159	| IOT217 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| IOT217 |	It should
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,975	| IOT217 |	So I'm actually getting
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:55,839	| IOT217 |	Some of these so in about a week or two when I finally moved into my new house
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,375	| IOT217 |	Hallelujah
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT217 |	Try them out
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:03,007	| IOT217 |	Write a review and tell you guys about it on the Pike
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| IOT217 |	Cast because
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| IOT217 |	Also
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,103	| IOT217 |	In lighting
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,895	| IOT217 |	Wise
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:13,503	| IOT217 |	The company that is famous for its $20 camera and the fact that it makes profit
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,527	| IOT217 |	Has
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,063	| IOT217 |	Launched LIPA
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:16,831	| IOT217 |	Oops
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:20,159	| IOT217 |	And basically with the wise light bulbs you can buy
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,719	| IOT217 |	A 4-pack for 30 bucks which I did so
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,279	| IOT217 |	Going to try these out there
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,559	| IOT217 |	Ship in the middle of June
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,375	| IOT217 |	And unfortunately they will not work
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,911	| IOT217 |	With the Philips Hue Lutron setup
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,543	| IOT217 |	But why it does not work
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,567	| IOT217 |	With Google
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,079	| IOT217 |	Assistant
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:44,479	| IOT217 |	It does and this actually just happened earlier this week and some people may go into their Google Assistant
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:48,831	| IOT217 |	Settings and not find wise in there to link to their account
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,111	| IOT217 |	Is it a staged rollout
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,975	| IOT217 |	It should have for me earlier this week
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,583	| IOT217 |	And linked It Up by like I would with anything else but
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:06,239	| IOT217 |	I think there's still some work that needs to be done because they're testing it with my Nest holographic all the nest
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,311	| IOT217 |	It's going to be Google home hub or whatever
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:14,175	| IOT217 |	When I tell the Google Assistant to show like my driveway where I have a wyzecam
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:18,527	| IOT217 |	Sometimes it takes 5 seconds and it works sometimes it takes 15 seconds
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,415	| IOT217 |	Think there's some optimization that really need to happen
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,695	| IOT217 |	However
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,975	| IOT217 |	I'm thrilled that it's finally here
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,303	| IOT217 |	And I would expect those optimizations to happen and things
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,071	| IOT217 |	Better
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| IOT217 |	You know as again
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:37,215	| IOT217 |	Staged rollout usually things are like what is demand for this how can we optimize for this
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,495	| IOT217 |	We'll see then
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,263	| IOT217 |	Right
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,055	| IOT217 |	I presume that when these bulbs
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,079	| IOT217 |	How to
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,615	| IOT217 |	Cancel pre-order right now
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,663	| IOT217 |	Expect automatically work with
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,687	| IOT217 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,223	| IOT217 |	Because that integration is already there
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,015	| IOT217 |	Watusi
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:53,343	| IOT217 |	Just to be clear of those balls that you ordered
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,367	| IOT217 |	Cartoon
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,647	| IOT217 |	Snot color
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:00,255	| IOT217 |	But for the price I was like heck yeah they're like
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| IOT217 |	Less at their 7
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,839	| IOT217 |	Which is
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,863	| IOT217 |	Excellent
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,399	| IOT217 |	Christ will see how long they last
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,447	| IOT217 |	They're only in the a19 so
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,239	| IOT217 |	If you burn down
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,543	| IOT217 |	And I should also mention
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,079	| IOT217 |	Four people cuz why is his
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,383	| IOT217 |	They're in a row right now they just launched their sensor
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| IOT217 |	Can't we talked about last week
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,943	| IOT217 |	All of these work
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,503	| IOT217 |	Proprietary sub
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,599	| IOT217 |	It's 915
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,623	| IOT217 |	What they're using
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,159	| IOT217 |	Xian Subway
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:33,023	| IOT217 |	But it's not going to work with a Bluetooth there's a beer things like that so
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,559	| IOT217 |	That is a
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,351	| IOT217 |	A little bit of a bummer
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,399	| IOT217 |	Your trade off here is
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,935	| IOT217 |	It's so cheap
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| IOT217 |	So you don't need a hub for this
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,567	| IOT217 |	Connect directly to Wi-Fi so
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,103	| IOT217 |	Yay for that but
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,407	| IOT217 |	It will work with like the sensors in
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| IOT217 |	Basically
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,271	| IOT217 |	You can use like normal things like scheduling vacation mode
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,319	| IOT217 |	You can also
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,111	| IOT217 |	Group the lights in the wise app
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,903	| IOT217 |	Control them is one
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,695	| IOT217 |	There's no light switch them
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:07,839	| IOT217 |	We'll get there and it works with shift so I wonder actually you'd have latency that
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| IOT217 |	Everybody hates
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:11,423	| IOT217 |	I wonder if you could actually connect
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,983	| IOT217 |	Bia Italy
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,775	| IOT217 |	The Hue stuff off to play around
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,127	| IOT217 |	So we'll see what happens here but
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:24,223	| IOT217 |	Smoking hot deal otherwise light bulbs if you're in the wise world
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,991	| IOT217 |	Maybe try these out
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:31,135	| IOT217 |	For cheap mine I mean these things could replace my cheapie Cree bulb so I tend to buy
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,463	| IOT217 |	I know you said cheap but I'm going to say creep
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,999	| IOT217 |	As in Comcast
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,047	| IOT217 |	Is creeping on your health
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,607	| IOT217 |	CNBC reporter this week
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,375	| IOT217 |	The Comcast
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,679	| IOT217 |	Was working on some sort of device
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,471	| IOT217 |	It was going to be focused on people's hell
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,775	| IOT217 |	They said it was a smart speaker
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,823	| IOT217 |	Comcast later clarified
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,359	| IOT217 |	It's actually going to be
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,383	| IOT217 |	Sensor
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| IOT217 |	And what it sounds like
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,479	| IOT217 |	Emotion detection sensor
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:57,759	| IOT217 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,295	| IOT217 |	It's going to use algorithm
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,575	| IOT217 |	Determined
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,111	| IOT217 |	Is someone moving around the house
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,391	| IOT217 |	Yes that means there
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:03,903	| IOT217 |	Not Dead
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,207	| IOT217 |	Are they moving at this range
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,231	| IOT217 |	Yes that mean
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,767	| IOT217 |	Things are probably pretty healthy
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:13,887	| IOT217 |	And we talked about this a couple times in the show but there are definite research studies that show things like
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:14,911	| IOT217 |	Hey
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:19,775	| IOT217 |	How many times a day a person goes to the bathroom is an indicator of how healthy they are
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,103	| IOT217 |	And so you can see Comcast pulling
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,687	| IOT217 |	Data like that from the motion sensor to give
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,735	| IOT217 |	Some sort of Health score or
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:33,343	| IOT217 |	Let people know that their loved ones are okay without involving the camera or anything weird
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,671	| IOT217 |	Right and help Focus
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| IOT217 |	Comcast cable
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:41,791	| IOT217 |	They're going to pitch this towards people with
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,303	| IOT217 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:46,911	| IOT217 |	Please talk to Lourdes Hospital licorice Engadget about using devices
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,215	| IOT217 |	Hospitals as well so
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,031	| IOT217 |	Aye yai battling mainstream
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,103	| IOT217 |	Consumers that are healthy healthy or going to
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:59,199	| IOT217 |	Going on a desperate haste there's a huge need for this
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,223	| IOT217 |	Species or population
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:08,415	| IOT217 |	Yeah and I actually get I filled a couple questions from people when they find out what I do about aging-in-place like there
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,719	| IOT217 |	What can I get for my parents so I know that there are
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,839	| IOT217 |	We may not want them at our house is a relatively younger and healthier person
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,887	| IOT217 |	But we may want them for
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,399	| IOT217 |	I left
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,935	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,215	| IOT217 |	Not having a camera is going to be
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,519	| IOT217 |	But you'll have to wait
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,079	| IOT217 |	Comcast is going to start testing this at the end of
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,127	| IOT217 |	2019 release date
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,663	| IOT217 |	Is probably 20 20 or
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,431	| IOT217 |	Possibly even later
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,503	| IOT217 |	The other question that's raises in my mind
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,783	| IOT217 |	And is holy cow
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,575	| IOT217 |	What kind of Privacy Rule
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,599	| IOT217 |	Rosewill Comcast
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,623	| IOT217 |	Map to follow
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,135	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:46,559	| IOT217 |	Look at how Comcast is like really Building Services in the Smart Hub I have long said that they have
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| IOT217 |	Very forward-looking
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,887	| IOT217 |	Very good at offering
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:52,447	| IOT217 |	Compelling services in this is
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,215	| IOT217 |	Possibly another one
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,519	| IOT217 |	Yes maybe definitely
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| IOT217 |	Branching out
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,335	| IOT217 |	I just don't know
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,383	| IOT217 |	And I could be just as arguable quotes
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,663	| IOT217 |	They have a stigma
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| IOT217 |	Cable operations
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,551	| IOT217 |	Customer service in service and general is not good
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,831	| IOT217 |	That is arguable
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,111	| IOT217 |	I'm sure many people are happy with
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| IOT217 |	The compass that's fine
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| IOT217 |	But I wonder if they can overcome
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| IOT217 |	On people who haven't believe
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,023	| IOT217 |	And also
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| IOT217 |	People worry about how much
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,863	| IOT217 |	Other data Comcast already Jets
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,423	| IOT217 |	Yeah you know between
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| IOT217 |	Your internet you so maybe
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,751	| IOT217 |	MTV cetera
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,823	| IOT217 |	Do you really want now get very personal data
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,591	| IOT217 |	Going to them
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,407	| IOT217 |	Well I will let you know because
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:36,479	| IOT217 |	Again in about 2 weeks I'm going to become a Comcast
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,527	| IOT217 |	I say two weeks it's actually
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,903	| IOT217 |	This week's podcast will be produced in Austin
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,463	| IOT217 |	Ashley next week's will be produced in Oz
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,279	| IOT217 |	What time it goes out I will be in Seattle
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:53,887	| IOT217 |	But I will become a Comcast customer so I'll let you know how
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:59,775	| IOT217 |	I'm dying to know how your experience goes
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,591	| IOT217 |	They're my backyard here in Philadelphia
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| IOT217 |	Yes and your Verizon FiOS
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,175	| IOT217 |	Yes I am
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,295	| IOT217 |	Also this week in chip news because I can't leave the chips
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,575	| IOT217 |	Out of this mediatek
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| IOT217 |	Which
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,647	| IOT217 |	Is a Taiwanese chip company that
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,207	| IOT217 |	Came to prominence for making
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:22,559	| IOT217 |	Really good soces at a lower price than Qualcomm
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,655	| IOT217 |	They have done really well in the smart
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,167	| IOT217 |	Market
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:31,263	| IOT217 |	And now they've announced date what they call a rich iot program
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:36,639	| IOT217 |	And what this is is a bunch of their chipsets are going to have the ability
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,407	| IOT217 |	2
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:40,479	| IOT217 |	Do a eye on them at a lower battery
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:40,991	| IOT217 |	Consumption
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:46,623	| IOT217 |	And this is going to be for voice so AI algorithms associate with boys
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,671	| IOT217 |	With object recognition
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,439	| IOT217 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:54,047	| IOT217 |	And then also for powering displays so all of this is the smart home stuff
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,583	| IOT217 |	Design for
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,607	| IOT217 |	Again
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,399	| IOT217 |	Low battery consumption
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,679	| IOT217 |	Cheap pricing
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,007	| IOT217 |	And the ability to have some sort of intelligence
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,823	| IOT217 |	All this means from a consumer perspective
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,895	| IOT217 |	Is we're going to see a lot of devices come on the market with Laura
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:13,759	| IOT217 |	Yeah just to give a vacation all because I followed them in the smartphone
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,783	| IOT217 |	Tablet market for years
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:20,159	| IOT217 |	If you take a look at two very similar products whether to phone or tablet doesn't matter
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| IOT217 |	Run has a
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,231	| IOT217 |	Qualcomm chip one has a mediatek chip
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,279	| IOT217 |	You probably looking at
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,815	| IOT217 |	Andrew East I-25
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,351	| IOT217 |	Percent cost
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| IOT217 |	Difference on the low side
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,447	| IOT217 |	Wow
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,239	| IOT217 |	At least
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,055	| IOT217 |	Cheap displays, your way
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,615	| IOT217 |	All right
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,711	| IOT217 |	That is it that news and let's talk about sex
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:45,247	| IOT217 |	Security specifically uses

EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,063	| IOT217 |	Vehicles in best practices
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,391	| IOT217 |	So one of the best practices for security
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,951	| IOT217 |	Patching is over there updates when I
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:57,279	| IOT217 |	When people ask me like what can I do to make sure my connected devices are secure
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,583	| IOT217 |	I tell them all the stuff about hate
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,887	| IOT217 |	Google and see how they react
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,935	| IOT217 |	Problems are vulnerabilities
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,471	| IOT217 |	Bounty program
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:09,311	| IOT217 |	Good passwords and I always ask and I'm like they should have over the air update
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:15,455	| IOT217 |	What GM is now saying that it will offer over the air updates to most of its Vehicles by 22
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,759	| IOT217 |	I think this is good
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,831	| IOT217 |	I do drive a Tesla and it updated software all the time
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,903	| IOT217 |	Most automakers have not done this in a
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:28,511	| IOT217 |	Heart is because they were worried about connecting cars to the internet because it introduces
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,327	| IOT217 |	It is a surface area of attack in
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,863	| IOT217 |	It could be scary
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,887	| IOT217 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| IOT217 |	I know you have your Tesla and
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:39,775	| IOT217 |	You can have any software updates and haven't had issues and so on so forth
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,823	| IOT217 |	IC
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:44,127	| IOT217 |	Tesla as a leader in this
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:48,735	| IOT217 |	Kinetic artistry
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| IOT217 |	Very capable
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,319	| IOT217 |	I am a little leery when
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:56,415	| IOT217 |	GM and others I'm sure there will be other car manufacturers get into this space
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,487	| IOT217 |	I just don't have the faith that
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,511	| IOT217 |	It will work
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,047	| IOT217 |	Properly
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:05,375	| IOT217 |	All the time and it needs to and I say that because just look at
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:09,727	| IOT217 |	Not quite the same situation but the aircraft
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,031	| IOT217 |	Software introduced problem
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,847	| IOT217 |	I would say in something like that
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:18,431	| IOT217 |	What the challenge that's not an over-the-air
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| IOT217 |	Correct
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT217 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:24,063	| IOT217 |	It's a testing problem and I think
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,855	| IOT217 |	The capability
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| IOT217 |	Is really important
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:31,487	| IOT217 |	Challenge associated with that capability is too full
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| IOT217 |	1
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,791	| IOT217 |	You have to secure that
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,815	| IOT217 |	Connection to
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:38,655	| IOT217 |	If you can change the functionality of a vehicle
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,191	| IOT217 |	Anytime you want
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:44,287	| IOT217 |	That doesn't add a responsibility and QA it's an added responsibility
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,823	| IOT217 |	In terms of life cycle
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,615	| IOT217 |	Software lifecycle management
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,407	| IOT217 |	And hopefully
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,455	| IOT217 |	GM it has
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:53,503	| IOT217 |	The capabilities and it is aware of
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,807	| IOT217 |	So it is kind of like going cuz like
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:58,111	| IOT217 |	Now we're seeing with the Boeing 747
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,903	| IOT217 |	737 Max
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,231	| IOT217 |	We're talking about like oh they were unaware that
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:05,023	| IOT217 |	This update actually
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:07,839	| IOT217 |	Change the functionality of this particular button
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:11,423	| IOT217 |	A machine like that
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:16,799	| IOT217 |	Cedar stained with every line of code does it how
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:20,639	| IOT217 |	You're right it's more about that not the delivery mechanism it is more about the testing
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:24,991	| IOT217 |	I don't know something just skeeves me out about this site I guess I just don't
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT217 |	Faith energy
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,063	| IOT217 |	That's a person
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:32,159	| IOT217 |	And that's something all of these companies are going to have to deal with
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,671	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:39,071	| IOT217 |	If since we're talking about it I'll bring up the fact that there's an opinion article in the New York Times this week all about
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| IOT217 |	Driver data
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,119	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,167	| IOT217 |	How customers
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,191	| IOT217 |	Consumer to buy
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,471	| IOT217 |	Why cars are not aware
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:49,567	| IOT217 |	Not aware of the type of data that
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,335	| IOT217 |	Parking
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,103	| IOT217 |	Gather
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,639	| IOT217 |	This is my man named Bill
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,687	| IOT217 |	Handy who is President Chief Executive
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,991	| IOT217 |	Of the Auto Care Association
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,783	| IOT217 |	The Articles actually called
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,319	| IOT217 |	Your car knows when you gain weight
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:04,671	| IOT217 |	Which I guess it does cuz they do have sensors in the seats now that you're there
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,951	| IOT217 |	I don't know if I
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:09,279	| IOT217 |	I want my car to be like you should drive me lesson walk mower
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,839	| IOT217 |	Possibly
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,375	| IOT217 |	But the point there is like
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:13,887	| IOT217 |	Hey
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,703	| IOT217 |	When you have over the air updates
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:20,287	| IOT217 |	You also have this two-way communication where your car could be like
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,847	| IOT217 |	Tattling on you in a way that
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,895	| IOT217 |	I know you had to stick those OBD Port monitors
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:30,527	| IOT217 |	I've also wonder and this is for cars that have built-in Connectivity Source not like
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:34,367	| IOT217 |	You will connect your car to your home internet and get the
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,391	| IOT217 |	The downloading update there
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:40,255	| IOT217 |	So I don't know how big these updates can be and probably
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,559	| IOT217 |	Does Tesla actually tell you or you just
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,327	| IOT217 |	Say
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,119	| IOT217 |	It just shows you hey I update your software
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:49,727	| IOT217 |	I'm sometimes it'll tell you anything cuz a time estimate like this will take about 40 minutes
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,751	| IOT217 |	Some of that dates are quite
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,823	| IOT217 |	But Tesla pays for my connectivity
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| IOT217 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,895	| IOT217 |	I don't know that
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,455	| IOT217 |	GM. Blind a Chevy Bolt
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:05,855	| IOT217 |	I would love to see them spell that out because I I don't
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:06,879	| IOT217 |	Use the
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:09,183	| IOT217 |	LTE integrated into my Chevy Volt
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,999	| IOT217 |	I get software updates
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,303	| IOT217 |	Dealer which is very rare mean
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,351	| IOT217 |	Once a year I get an oil change
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,375	| IOT217 |	Rotate tires every
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| IOT217 |	Power off Lionel drive that much
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,447	| IOT217 |	So
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,007	| IOT217 |	I'd like to know that you have to pay for that
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,287	| IOT217 |	Realty service
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,335	| IOT217 |	Jesus all right well
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,663	| IOT217 |	Well I hope they do that and have data
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:33,759	| IOT217 |	Car sharing data other things sharing data
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:39,903	| IOT217 |	What is the first anniversary of the general data protection regulations from the EU
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,183	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,975	| IOT217 |	It's time to say
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,487	| IOT217 |	Kush
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,511	| IOT217 |	What's happened
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,047	| IOT217 |	He answered
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:51,679	| IOT217 |	At least in the EU not much here in the US
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:55,007	| IOT217 |	Just as a refresher gdpr basically cave
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,287	| IOT217 |	People rights around their data
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,567	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:01,919	| IOT217 |	You as an individual or as a citizen of the EU basically could say
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,455	| IOT217 |	Hey stop collecting my day
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,271	| IOT217 |	What data are you collecting use
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,039	| IOT217 |	Requested
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:13,183	| IOT217 |	You could ask companies to change data that wasn't right you could retroactively pool access to your data
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:16,767	| IOT217 |	The EU has published data about
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:19,071	| IOT217 |	The number of cases and
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| IOT217 |	Things like that associated with
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,143	| IOT217 |	This legislation
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,959	| IOT217 |	Should I pull citizens and
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,751	| IOT217 |	As of March 2019
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,799	| IOT217 |	Two-thirds of EU citizen
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,639	| IOT217 |	Hold said they knew with gdpr was
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:36,479	| IOT217 |	They are about 1/3 a little over 1/3 new what it is
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:36,991	| IOT217 |	Tails
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,271	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,319	| IOT217 |	Over half said
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,135	| IOT217 |	Yes they know that there is an agency out there trying to
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| IOT217 |	Protect their data
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,695	| IOT217 |	What that means
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,743	| IOT217 |	Cases is
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT217 |	They had
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,815	| IOT217 |	A lot a lot they have
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| IOT217 |	I was like
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,655	| IOT217 |	281000
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,447	| IOT217 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| IOT217 |	And these cases are just
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,519	| IOT217 |	Complaints maybe maybe
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,543	| IOT217 |	Customer found that there
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:04,127	| IOT217 |	Data wasn't being cryptic because that's required as part of
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| IOT217 |	Tpr's well
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,687	| IOT217 |	Yeah like a half of them we're just like
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:07,967	| IOT217 |	Complaints
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:12,575	| IOT217 |	Almost 90000 of data breach notifications and then the rest were
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,367	| IOT217 |	I don't know whatever
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:21,536	| IOT217 |	But two-thirds of those cases have been closed I presume to people satisfaction because
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,560	| IOT217 |	1%
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,608	| IOT217 |	Cases have been appealed
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,656	| IOT217 |	And the rest are still ongoing
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,216	| IOT217 |	This is great because it shows how active
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,496	| IOT217 |	These
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,520	| IOT217 |	Restrictions are being
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,056	| IOT217 |	Recognized by consumers
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,384	| IOT217 |	Being questioned cementation questioning
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,176	| IOT217 |	Licensing issue
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,736	| IOT217 |	I think it's great for the night
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:46,880	| IOT217 |	Yeah and I haven't seen it at wholesale stoppage of the European economy
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,672	| IOT217 |	So also good there
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:51,488	| IOT217 |	As part of this and maybe because
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:56,096	| IOT217 |	Maybe because it's Brad Smith and he's being a thought leader here but Brad Smith over at Microsoft
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,632	| IOT217 |	Is called for
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,424	| IOT217 |	The US
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,960	| IOT217 |	To implement its own
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,752	| IOT217 |	Version of gdpr
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,800	| IOT217 |	An Apple has also called for the
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,080	| IOT217 |	Best and
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,896	| IOT217 |	That's now Microsoft and app
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,408	| IOT217 |	Apple saying
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,712	| IOT217 |	Hey this law isn't terrible
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,760	| IOT217 |	Let's get something like that here
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:17,600	| IOT217 |	And the big things that they're focused on is
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,440	| IOT217 |	You have to have a reason to process the data you can just gather data for
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,000	| IOT217 |	So you don't like your car can't just be like
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| IOT217 |	This is how much someone weighs
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,584	| IOT217 |	Personal data must be encrypted
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:31,424	| IOT217 |	People in consumers have a right to a copy of their data
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:34,496	| IOT217 |	And they have a right to ask for their data to be.
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,032	| IOT217 |	I'm all for it
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,800	| IOT217 |	I'm not going to lie
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:43,456	| IOT217 |	A sticking point
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,016	| IOT217 |	Is who enforces the rules
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:50,624	| IOT217 |	Will in the EU they created a separate agency
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,136	| IOT217 |	Who does that
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| IOT217 |	So
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,952	| IOT217 |	I would imagine
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:58,560	| IOT217 |	We would have some sort of federal agency FTC
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,584	| IOT217 |	I know there's lots of
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:03,424	| IOT217 |	Debate
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,984	| IOT217 |	The FTC resent not the FTC
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:12,384	| IOT217 |	I hate the creation of new government agencies with the FTC can be like really held over by politics
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:13,920	| IOT217 |	But
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:16,736	| IOT217 |	Something is better than nothing I don't know or not
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:22,624	| IOT217 |	But if we did though
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,672	| IOT217 |	Not about gdpr
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:28,256	| IOT217 |	But about enforcing privacy rules Mozilla has created a
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| IOT217 |	Petition
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,816	| IOT217 |	Calling on Amazon
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:35,680	| IOT217 |	To make sure all the Smart Home Products are all the connected products sold on its site
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,448	| IOT217 |	Come with a privacy
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| IOT217 |	Because not everything does
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,032	| IOT217 |	I think that's actually not a number
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| IOT217 |	I think
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:47,456	| IOT217 |	Having Amazon or a federal legislation actually helps because if it's Amazon
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,760	| IOT217 |	What happens is
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:55,904	| IOT217 |	You'll have to click through or see a privacy policy associated with the device if everyone has one is not a competitive advantage
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,672	| IOT217 |	Are people who don't
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:58,208	| IOT217 |	Two processes may be a little
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,024	| IOT217 |	So horsing everyone to behave
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,584	| IOT217 |	According to the same rules is actually a nice thing to
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:07,680	| IOT217 |	Is not part of this conversation company we're going to talk about a little bit next
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,728	| IOT217 |	That would be correct
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,288	| IOT217 |	I'll take what is Google for $500
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:13,824	| IOT217 |	Yay
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,432	| IOT217 |	About the new glass Google Glass
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,016	| IOT217 |	Yes the new one is for Enterprise has its fancy rats
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:22,528	| IOT217 |	Cheaper and
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,064	| IOT217 |	More battery efficient
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,088	| IOT217 |	I believe in better
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,112	| IOT217 |	Just generally better
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| IOT217 |	It's more better
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,976	| IOT217 |	And another little news bits
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| IOT217 |	Savant
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,280	| IOT217 |	Which is a
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:38,144	| IOT217 |	I always call it the apple of smart home systems like professional smart home systems they have rolled out
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:42,240	| IOT217 |	How can support including something pretty neat which is circuit breaker control
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,288	| IOT217 |	Explain why the school
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:49,664	| IOT217 |	So it's about already has a circuit breaker controls but now they have a
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,432	| IOT217 |	Pinion module
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,712	| IOT217 |	That
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,760	| IOT217 |	Is Chromecast compatible so
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:57,856	| IOT217 |	Like I'm assuming I could like when I'm swapping out switches and what not
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,904	| IOT217 |	Instead of running up and down two flights of stairs
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,440	| IOT217 |	See if I switch the right breaker
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,720	| IOT217 |	Mentally I could
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| IOT217 |	Turn the breaker off using homekit
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:07,328	| IOT217 |	Yes that is my thought here to end
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,120	| IOT217 |	This was actually a future
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,168	| IOT217 |	I feel like Savant launched it back at
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:15,264	| IOT217 |	Syria in 2017 and there are actually several
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:18,336	| IOT217 |	Other professionals EDS type installers who are
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,640	| IOT217 |	Messing around with circuit breaker
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:23,712	| IOT217 |	Boxes in control of those in Part B
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| IOT217 |	Because
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,296	| IOT217 |	They were thinking about things like demand response in the future
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,064	| IOT217 |	Electricity
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:30,112	| IOT217 |	And apparently really wealthy people like
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:34,208	| IOT217 |	Dedicated control of these things I don't know but it was a big deal
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:35,232	| IOT217 |	So
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:38,560	| IOT217 |	This is it it's a nice product it's a nice add onto a nice system if
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:42,400	| IOT217 |	And in fact that homekit support does go beyond just
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,168	| IOT217 |	Circuit breaker band
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:48,800	| IOT217 |	It works with light bulbs in their LED DMX LED light strips
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,872	| IOT217 |	It's a broader solution
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,896	| IOT217 |	Yes and
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:56,992	| IOT217 |	There is a new smart clock in town the Lenovo smart clock for
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,016	| IOT217 |	Google
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,624	| IOT217 |	Have already gone live
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,696	| IOT217 |	And this device ships on June 2nd $79
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:09,024	| IOT217 |	I actually saw this at CES this year back in January
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| IOT217 |	And I've wondered about I thought it was just like a
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,888	| IOT217 |	A reference is on or something when it when I walk into the
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:16,704	| IOT217 |	I guess I should say for the Press
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:19,520	| IOT217 |	But no it said it was an actual projects
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,824	| IOT217 |	Little smart clock it's like a
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:24,128	| IOT217 |	Maybe a forage displayed at 4
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,920	| IOT217 |	IPS screen
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,944	| IOT217 |	It looks like
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:29,248	| IOT217 |	The Lenovo smart display that I have
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,808	| IOT217 |	Obviously it smaller
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:37,440	| IOT217 |	It's not something to watch a video on and do things regular screen or larger screen
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:39,744	| IOT217 |	It does have a 6 watt speaker
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:42,816	| IOT217 |	You can add it to a home speaker group
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:46,656	| IOT217 |	It's got the microphone privacy switch that the nest Hub has
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:47,424	| IOT217 |	School
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:49,728	| IOT217 |	And yeah I mean it's just perfect
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,752	| IOT217 |	Size 4
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,544	| IOT217 |	Display
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,080	| IOT217 |	Especially one with camera
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,616	| IOT217 |	Cuz it doesn't have one
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:57,664	| IOT217 |	On their nightstand
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:00,736	| IOT217 |	Another Google home
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,528	| IOT217 |	Nice
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,296	| IOT217 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,064	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:04,832	| IOT217 |	We've got a
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,368	| IOT217 |	Other tiny little bits of news
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,416	| IOT217 |	Which is the
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:11,232	| IOT217 |	A German smart thermostat maker has
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:15,328	| IOT217 |	Stay home 2 compatible smart AC controller
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:21,728	| IOT217 |	It's really for the UK and EU area so, coming or going to get here
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,008	| IOT217 |	In the US at least
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,080	| IOT217 |	But they make a nice looking
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,616	| IOT217 |	Thermostat product
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:32,224	| IOT217 |	You do and they make a nice radiator turning knob date they make some really good looking
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,296	| IOT217 |	So this is basically you can
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:37,600	| IOT217 |	AC controls to your home with us
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:44,512	| IOT217 |	So this will work ethics and also
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,048	| IOT217 |	690
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:49,376	| IOT217 |	Amazon so
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:51,424	| IOT217 |	It's available there for 90 pound
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,728	| IOT217 |	Guess that's roughly
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,544	| IOT217 |	100 letter $10
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,592	| IOT217 |	But it doesn't matter cuz you can't buy here
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,920	| IOT217 |	This is our gift to our UK listeners
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:06,528	| IOT217 |	Find a little bit of news is Arduino has available
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:07,808	| IOT217 |	And we
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,344	| IOT217 |	We love our Arduino
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,904	| IOT217 |	The cheapest one
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,440	| IOT217 |	Is the Nano every it's a
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| IOT217 |	Actually $10
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:18,048	| IOT217 |	It's got a microcontroller
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:18,816	| IOT217 |	She's got it
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:22,400	| IOT217 |	Clash a rama and
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,448	| IOT217 |	They also have the Nano
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:28,800	| IOT217 |	33 iot is $18 it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,592	| IOT217 |	Also a microcontroller
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,384	| IOT217 |	Again
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,480	| IOT217 |	M32
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,296	| IOT217 |	Gabby's abuser
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,064	| IOT217 |	Small tomato
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:44,416	| IOT217 |	Products project Etc not a smart home system
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,048	| IOT217 |	I gave us play around with some stuff they have
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:53,632	| IOT217 |	To Nubia Bluetooth low-energy boards as well
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,400	| IOT217 |	So
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:57,728	| IOT217 |	You don't just check out if you're
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:29:02,848	| IOT217 |	You're hankering for a project and you went you don't need much you just want to build something that does a little something

EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:47,648	| IOT217 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin this is Josh.
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,672	| IOT217 |	Eagan Minnesota
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,976	| IOT217 |	Please feel free to use this on your show if you'd like
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:55,328	| IOT217 |	My question is regarding automation I really would like
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,888	| IOT217 |	To be able to know with high degree of accuracy
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:01,472	| IOT217 |	If people are in or not in a given room
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,496	| IOT217 |	The bedroom
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,008	| IOT217 |	The family room
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,800	| IOT217 |	Wherever so that I
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,080	| IOT217 |	Can adjust light
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,872	| IOT217 |	Denim-on-denim off
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:10,176	| IOT217 |	Depending upon if there is anybody in
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:10,688	| IOT217 |	That room
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:15,808	| IOT217 |	And I'm just wondering what's the best solution for that what's up is it a combination of sensors
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:19,136	| IOT217 |	Korath our special sensors to help with that kind of a problem
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,696	| IOT217 |	How what is the best way to
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,720	| IOT217 |	No
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,512	| IOT217 |	If there is somebody in a room or not
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:26,560	| IOT217 |	Thank you so much for all your help
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,584	| IOT217 |	Appreciate it
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:28,608	| IOT217 |	Josh
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,144	| IOT217 |	This is something
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:30,656	| IOT217 |	Men
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,704	| IOT217 |	Kevin and I've been talking about
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,264	| IOT217 |	Years and years and years
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:39,616	| IOT217 |	And we actually have some options for you which is a surprise
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,152	| IOT217 |	Because we looked at this
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:44,480	| IOT217 |	You know when you when you left your voicemail we're like okay
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,784	| IOT217 |	We don't have anything great for it we've got
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,552	| IOT217 |	Motion sensors
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:50,880	| IOT217 |	Which will tell you that someone has entered a room and you could use
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,416	| IOT217 |	Turn on lights in
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,184	| IOT217 |	AC in
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,720	| IOT217 |	Things like that
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,512	| IOT217 |	But it's kind of sucky if you want to do like
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,560	| IOT217 |	Personalization or something a little bit
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,632	| IOT217 |	But we just discovered
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,400	| IOT217 |	A new product
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:03,936	| IOT217 |	Buy in
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,704	| IOT217 |	Tell her things
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,496	| IOT217 |	We discovered
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,800	| IOT217 |	Rumor me it is a
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,616	| IOT217 |	Sensor that basically
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:14,688	| IOT217 |	The Bluetooth readings from your phone and uses that to say out
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,712	| IOT217 |	Kevin's phone
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,736	| IOT217 |	Kevin
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| IOT217 |	Has entered the room
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:18,784	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:21,088	| IOT217 |	You can buy a starter kit
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,160	| IOT217 |	For $124
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:28,256	| IOT217 |	And a sensor on its own without the starter kit
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,792	| IOT217 |	It's going to be $70
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,608	| IOT217 |	What does this do
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,632	| IOT217 |	Well
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,192	| IOT217 |	Basically just says this Smartphone is
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,240	| IOT217 |	Mounts on the ceiling
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:39,520	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,312	| IOT217 |	It's actually kind of cool
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,384	| IOT217 |	I do everything reminds me
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:46,944	| IOT217 |	I got excited about the beacon technology
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,992	| IOT217 |	Several years back which
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:51,296	| IOT217 |	Never really made it to the smart
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:55,136	| IOT217 |	Yeah we talked about a company called zuly they actually made they
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,672	| IOT217 |	Put beacons basically
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:00,000	| IOT217 |	Smart outlets and I was super excited about them and
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,560	| IOT217 |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,840	| IOT217 |	Just hasn't happened
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:09,984	| IOT217 |	I think a lot of people kiss I didn't want to do this there like that tells me that somebody is in the room
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,568	| IOT217 |	As opposed to what I can do and I want is
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,104	| IOT217 |	It tells me
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,664	| IOT217 |	A particular someone is in the room
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:22,016	| IOT217 |	Customizes automation controls based on purses
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,528	| IOT217 |	Personal choices
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:27,648	| IOT217 |	That just hasn't happened since she's just makes sense
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:31,232	| IOT217 |	If you're carrying your phone around the house most people do I know Stacy
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,048	| IOT217 |	I think most people do or this evening
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:38,144	| IOT217 |	Yeah I was just going to say but a lot of people
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:42,752	| IOT217 |	Absolutely thin
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,800	| IOT217 |	Caring wearing it so
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,592	| IOT217 |	I think this is a great idea
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:50,176	| IOT217 |	There is a bit of a downside because of his
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,456	| IOT217 |	It doesn't work
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:52,992	| IOT217 |	Anastasia
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:57,088	| IOT217 |	So it does work with some but not all Philips Hue smart bulbs
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:33:00,416	| IOT217 |	Works with lifx original and mini smart bulbs
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,976	| IOT217 |	The Bose sound wireless speakers
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,512	| IOT217 |	And ecobee
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:08,352	| IOT217 |	Yeah which is a smallest when you think about
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:14,496	| IOT217 |	Product that is not what they made for worship Google or works with matinee program play
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,056	| IOT217 |	To that program
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,128	| IOT217 |	Because then the whole world approximately
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,688	| IOT217 |	I would also say that the wages work
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:25,504	| IOT217 |	Is whoever set this up becomes
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,784	| IOT217 |	The Room Master
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,856	| IOT217 |	I really like the state of I am the Ambassador
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:30,880	| IOT217 |	I am done
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,672	| IOT217 |	What was at the GateKeeper
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,464	| IOT217 |	The key master key master
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:34,976	| IOT217 |	There we go
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,256	| IOT217 |	Ghostbusters
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:41,632	| IOT217 |	Anyway as a roommaster whenever you enter the room all settings will revert to your preference
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:45,984	| IOT217 |	And when you leave it will revert to the next highest ranked person in the room
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,288	| IOT217 |	Oh that's the problem with the kids
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,104	| IOT217 |	Isn't that guy is he ranked higher than me
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,152	| IOT217 |	Oh Lord
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:55,712	| IOT217 |	I'm going to say that's going to be a problem would like the spouses
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,992	| IOT217 |	My husband be like
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,528	| IOT217 |	Why is it suddenly so hot and
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,088	| IOT217 |	How it's so wonderful
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,624	| IOT217 |	Thanks nobody ever
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:06,464	| IOT217 |	Josh this is your problem I'm not owning this one cuz I have not going to rain tonight
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:12,864	| IOT217 |	There you go so Josh that is our solution for you I wish we had something that works with everything
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,400	| IOT217 |	What is more comprehensive
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:18,752	| IOT217 |	There is another option I mean aside from the motion sensor switch
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:23,616	| IOT217 |	There are tons of motion sensor options were there in a light switch
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,944	| IOT217 |	Or they're just a standalone Center like that the borrower
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:28,736	| IOT217 |	There are tons of motion sensors out there
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,296	| IOT217 |	There and their
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,600	| IOT217 |	Not a problem did you have a hub in most cases
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:37,184	| IOT217 |	Just for the show we also found this
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:37,952	| IOT217 |	Minute Prada
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,256	| IOT217 |	Oh yes I forgot about the minute
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:45,632	| IOT217 |	Yeah that we can't speak to how well it works because we literally just got out of
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,400	| IOT217 |	For the show
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:48,448	| IOT217 |	Can you reach out to them already for
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,472	| IOT217 |	Getting some
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:55,104	| IOT217 |	Yes this is a security product it is a device that use lap onto a magnetic
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:58,176	| IOT217 |	East Gretta magnetic plate to your ceiling and you slept this
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,456	| IOT217 |	Sensor packed
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,224	| IOT217 |	Talk to it
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,016	| IOT217 |	And it does
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,552	| IOT217 |	Motion humidity
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,064	| IOT217 |	Temperature
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,368	| IOT217 |	Detection
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:11,488	| IOT217 |	It so it'll listen for window glass breakage as the
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,280	| IOT217 |	Madame agar does now
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,304	| IOT217 |	But it doesn't have
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,376	| IOT217 |	Tamara so the people who are focused on
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,400	| IOT217 |	Privacy error going to be
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,168	| IOT217 |	Kind of excited about
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,240	| IOT217 |	Set a remind me kind of like
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,032	| IOT217 |	Maybe something that Comcast is
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:30,432	| IOT217 |	So it has all of these kind of neat features plus it works with Madam a and Google Assistant
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:34,784	| IOT217 |	Which means you might be able to and I can't tell you until I try this
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:37,600	| IOT217 |	Use the sensors in that to control things happen
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:39,904	| IOT217 |	House
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,184	| IOT217 |	Again it won't
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,208	| IOT217 |	Detective
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:46,048	| IOT217 |	If a text doesn't detect individual
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:49,376	| IOT217 |	Rice device is $149
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,424	| IOT217 |	And you can get a two pack
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,216	| IOT217 |	230.
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,776	| IOT217 |	I think it's got a pretty sweet
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:36:00,384	| IOT217 |	It is security-focused for the most part
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:02,432	| IOT217 |	Motion detection or personal
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,200	| IOT217 |	Presence
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,736	| IOT217 |	President General
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:08,576	| IOT217 |	Which is why we brought it up
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:11,904	| IOT217 |	That's the key because a lot of people don't want cameras in every room
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:12,928	| IOT217 |	Which I totally
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:17,280	| IOT217 |	Yep all right we'll Josh hopefully this helps you and
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:20,608	| IOT217 |	Everyone else please stay tuned because
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:24,960	| IOT217 |	We'll have our guest Zach's Apollo who is the CEO of particle
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:28,288	| IOT217 |	He's going to be talking about a survey they just released
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:31,616	| IOT217 |	All about what industries are using iot
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,384	| IOT217 |	What use Industries
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,432	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:37,760	| IOT217 |	Some of the Lessons Learned as company scale
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,040	| IOT217 |	Which is a big deal
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,344	| IOT217 |	Before we get to that
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,880	| IOT217 |	We are going to hear from

EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,600	| IOT217 |	Can you please please share with us how your group is
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:20,256	| IOT217 |	Thank you thanks for having me on it's really great to have an opportunity to chat with
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:24,096	| IOT217 |	So from an alien perspective
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:31,776	| IOT217 |	Helping them take their IP combined it with our technology and create a new product that they take the market
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:36,640	| IOT217 |	And our customers have been doing iot since long before iot had a name
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,432	| IOT217 |	Natural
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:40,736	| IOT217 |	Place that help with the iot and adjectives
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:44,576	| IOT217 |	And so what we do is we really help customers focus on and delivery
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,392	| IOT217 |	Health and compress their time-to-market
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:49,184	| IOT217 |	So they focus on their it
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:50,720	| IOT217 |	We focus on
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:52,768	| IOT217 |	The technology platform in the integration of it
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:59,936	| IOT217 |	The second piece is really delivering tier-1 technology and that should one technology gets them the very best Quality Inn
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,960	| IOT217 |	Customer experience
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:05,568	| IOT217 |	And then the last piece is one of their multinational or they're a small software startup
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:08,128	| IOT217 |	We help them scale globally reducing cost
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| IOT217 |	Complexity
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:10,944	| IOT217 |	And taking their product to a global market
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:14,784	| IOT217 |	Excellent and I understand that your division is Pretty in Pink
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:17,344	| IOT217 |	Compared to what most of my audience thinks about
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:19,136	| IOT217 |	Sunday think about Dell Technologies
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:21,184	| IOT217 |	They're thinking servers in PC
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:24,256	| IOT217 |	But your division focuses more on Factory floors than data set
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,792	| IOT217 |	It's OT
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,304	| IOT217 |	Not it
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,328	| IOT217 |	Is that right
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,608	| IOT217 |	That's right
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:32,960	| IOT217 |	Example of an oem customer is their developing software
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,032	| IOT217 |	So a lot of
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,568	| IOT217 |	Champs cancer medical device
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:40,128	| IOT217 |	They're developing the software in the actual
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,152	| IOT217 |	Scan devices
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,200	| IOT217 |	All of that needs to run
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:46,528	| IOT217 |	On a server ditch in a maybe it's very hard
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:49,600	| IOT217 |	Operational environment high temperature
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:52,160	| IOT217 |	Vibration and so we help them develop
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:58,304	| IOT217 |	Platform solution
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:02,144	| IOT217 |	Okay and so how does your OEM division
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,680	| IOT217 |	Really help those
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,192	| IOT217 |	Customers
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,216	| IOT217 |	Get ahead
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,776	| IOT217 |	We are really focused on
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,544	| IOT217 |	First
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,080	| IOT217 |	The IP that they're developing is
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,432	| IOT217 |	And we help them surround that I T with
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,456	| IOT217 |	The right technology +
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:20,576	| IOT217 |	And we're drawing from all of Dell Technologies to not just deli and seeing Hardware
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,976	| IOT217 |	Everything that makes up Dell technology
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:31,584	| IOT217 |	This is part of the pallet that we can help a customer to paint their product
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:36,192	| IOT217 |	And so at the Dell Technologies
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,984	| IOT217 |	Hardware software services
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,008	| IOT217 |	Program manager
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:40,032	| IOT217 |	Engineering
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,824	| IOT217 |	All of that together too
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:45,664	| IOT217 |	Creating that new product based on their IP and our technology
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,456	| IOT217 |	But that customer then takes the market
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:48,992	| IOT217 |	Awesome
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,528	| IOT217 |	So where can folks go
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,040	| IOT217 |	To learn more

EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:25,856	| IOT217 |	Like
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:28,928	| IOT217 |	A year or two and I'm hearing that things are
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:30,208	| IOT217 |	Different
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:31,232	| IOT217 |	At particles so let's
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,000	| IOT217 |	Kick it off with
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:35,328	| IOT217 |	An update on where things are at particle
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,376	| IOT217 |	Probably for everyone who doesn't know you
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,656	| IOT217 |	Guys what you actually do
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:41,472	| IOT217 |	Yeah absolutely so
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,008	| IOT217 |	Backstory on particle we are
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:47,104	| IOT217 |	Internet of Things device platform so we help companies who are
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:49,408	| IOT217 |	Making Internet of Things products
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,944	| IOT217 |	Connect those products to the internet
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:54,016	| IOT217 |	Work with a bunch of different manufacturers and
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,808	| IOT217 |	Distributors a lot of folks
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,832	| IOT217 |	Made
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:41:01,440	| IOT217 |	Products that weren't yet connected and wanted to add connectivity those products
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:04,768	| IOT217 |	He also worked a lot of entrepreneurs and startups were building new products from
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,328	| IOT217 |	Incorporate connectivity
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,864	| IOT217 |	And we provide all of the
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,680	| IOT217 |	Connectivity networking infrastructure
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:13,472	| IOT217 |	Ranging from the hardware that's embedded
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,496	| IOT217 |	Buy the product
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:15,264	| IOT217 |	Chill
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:19,104	| IOT217 |	Networking stack to cloud services that expose devices for API
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,384	| IOT217 |	Everything in between
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:21,664	| IOT217 |	End
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,432	| IOT217 |	Right now
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,456	| IOT217 |	Your customers
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,736	| IOT217 |	I assume Spanish
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,760	| IOT217 |	Dammit so let's talk about
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:29,856	| IOT217 |	You recently did a survey where you asked about 800 Developers
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:32,928	| IOT217 |	What they're using iot for how they're building stuff
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,696	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,464	| IOT217 |	What did you find
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:38,048	| IOT217 |	Let's let's start with the top probably Industries where I'm at
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:39,840	| IOT217 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,400	| IOT217 |	So we'll start with where I think I accused
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,960	| IOT217 |	Become most successful if we think about
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:45,472	| IOT217 |	The market
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:48,032	| IOT217 |	The most excited about Ice-T
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:49,312	| IOT217 |	Oec is a
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:49,824	| IOT217 |	Manufacturing
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,104	| IOT217 |	Healthcare
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,407	| IOT217 |	Energy agriculture technology
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,199	| IOT217 |	Because
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:57,247	| IOT217 |	Any technology company is
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,271	| IOT217 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,295	| IOT217 |	Some way
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:01,343	| IOT217 |	Engage with it
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:03,135	| IOT217 |	Interesting about that is
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:07,999	| IOT217 |	Okay those Industries makes sense it makes sense that you would see this Earth heavier Industries
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,023	| IOT217 |	With often more
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:10,303	| IOT217 |	More expensive products
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:14,911	| IOT217 |	With more like maintenance problems that those are the places where we see is you being successful
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,447	| IOT217 |	I think what's interesting is was not on that
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:22,335	| IOT217 |	Which is to say consumer and I think that consumer adoption of it has
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:25,663	| IOT217 |	Of course a number of
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:29,503	| IOT217 |	Like they break out successes but if you look more broadly across the industry
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,039	| IOT217 |	I think we're in a little bit of
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,063	| IOT217 |	The trough
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:32,831	| IOT217 |	Can I cycle
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,367	| IOT217 |	I'd like the trough of disillusionment
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:36,671	| IOT217 |	Yes exactly
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,951	| IOT217 |	Which is to say like that was a
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,719	| IOT217 |	. we're
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:40,255	| IOT217 |	Andorra founded
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:41,791	| IOT217 |	12
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,559	| IOT217 |	Really
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:47,935	| IOT217 |	Early days of it when things will really start to take off and it was a lot of interesting excitement around consumer
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,959	| IOT217 |	We're just not seeing the best
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:51,007	| IOT217 |	Yesterday and it squeaks
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,287	| IOT217 |	Anecdotal
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,823	| IOT217 |	The customer is where
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:55,103	| IOT217 |	More and more we're helping
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:58,943	| IOT217 |	Connect big dirty heavy machines where there's a lot of
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:03,039	| IOT217 |	Operational burden of managing that piece of equipment and
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,343	| IOT217 |	Text people who have to deal with maintenance
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,111	| IOT217 |	Uptime
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,647	| IOT217 |	And those creator
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:10,207	| IOT217 |	Opportunities to solve real problems variety because
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,999	| IOT217 |	I can do a better job of making
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,279	| IOT217 |	Machine
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:15,839	| IOT217 |	He's working because I have sensors in the machine
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:16,863	| IOT217 |	I can get it from them
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,679	| IOT217 |	Machine that leads to various
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,703	| IOT217 |	Very clear
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,471	| IOT217 |	Solutions
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,751	| IOT217 |	The problems that
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:25,823	| IOT217 |	Meaning of these initiatives actually get out the door and do actually scale
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,895	| IOT217 |	Yes cuz I feel like in the consumer
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:29,663	| IOT217 |	Even today
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:34,783	| IOT217 |	The use cases are not clear the expense associated with connected devices is
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:35,295	| IOT217 |	Hi
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:39,647	| IOT217 |	And the maintenance and ability to like make things work
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,415	| IOT217 |	Pull something
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:40,927	| IOT217 |	Together
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,231	| IOT217 |	Is really difficult because there's no stand
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:49,887	| IOT217 |	So I'm I'm with you on that so let's talk about how those kind of Trends related to
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:53,727	| IOT217 |	I don't know if we want to break it out by industry cuz he may be a little bit different but
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:58,847	| IOT217 |	When we start the use cases very clear a lot of the things that are happening happen
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:01,407	| IOT217 |	Roi associate with them it's pretty easy to see
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:03,711	| IOT217 |	What about standards like
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:08,575	| IOT217 |	Howard Lee agricultural or manufacturing or healthcare companies buying the
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:13,695	| IOT217 |	Is today do they think about things working across many different platforms or do they just like
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:16,511	| IOT217 |	I need something to monitor my
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,791	| IOT217 |	Trunks in refrigerators
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:19,071	| IOT217 |	I need something
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,351	| IOT217 |	Track the
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,375	| IOT217 |	The placement of
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,655	| IOT217 |	Seeds in my feels
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:28,287	| IOT217 |	So I think it really ends up being a question of what environment is the product
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:29,055	| IOT217 |	Sequoia
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:29,823	| IOT217 |	Important
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:32,639	| IOT217 |	Is it that it work with other products in that entire
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:34,431	| IOT217 |	Example of like
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:35,199	| IOT217 |	Factory
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:37,503	| IOT217 |	Pretzel Factory is a place where you have
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:38,015	| IOT217 |	A whole bunch of
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,087	| IOT217 |	Problem
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:41,855	| IOT217 |	That you want to try
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:43,135	| IOT217 |	Find salt dr-t
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,415	| IOT217 |	Are about the Inn
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:45,439	| IOT217 |	Interactions of those machine
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:47,999	| IOT217 |	For instance if I'm trying to
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:53,375	| IOT217 |	You know make my manufacturing line more efficient and I want to be able to track for the levels of like work in progress
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:57,215	| IOT217 |	Inventory I can't just have
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,263	| IOT217 |	One machine for sending me that day.
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:00,287	| IOT217 |	I need sort of all of the
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,847	| IOT217 |	Machines in the line to be
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,895	| IOT217 |	Giving me data and then I have a
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,175	| IOT217 |	Problem
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:06,687	| IOT217 |	Figure out how to get all the
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,503	| IOT217 |	Hands together and so we think of that is
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:10,015	| IOT217 |	Heterogeneous
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:12,831	| IOT217 |	Which is to say like lots of different I have
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:13,599	| IOT217 |	Nike products
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:15,647	| IOT217 |	One another and that's where I think
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:17,183	| IOT217 |	Standards are really important
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:19,231	| IOT217 |	Keurig 2.0
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:20,255	| IOT217 |	A lot of dust
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:21,023	| IOT217 |	Sandra's haven't been
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:21,791	| IOT217 |	Settled and are
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,071	| IOT217 |	Still in development and
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:29,471	| IOT217 |	Standards Wars that are going on in the crease of challenging Mini cases with successfully DuQuoin heterogeneous
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:30,239	| IOT217 |	He'd appointment
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:32,799	| IOT217 |	Is inhomogeneous
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:35,103	| IOT217 |	Which is to say
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:37,407	| IOT217 |	Widgets and I make $100,000
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,687	| IOT217 |	And they're almost
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:40,735	| IOT217 |	Deploy them all over the world
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:41,503	| IOT217 |	And a lot of cases
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:47,135	| IOT217 |	Supreme since we have a customer who's using us to monitor air condition
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:49,439	| IOT217 |	Air conditioner is r
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:54,815	| IOT217 |	Different air conditioners are a little different and they're in residential units in their commercial units but the fundamental principle
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:56,095	| IOT217 |	How to operate are the same
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,399	| IOT217 |	And every air conditioner is
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,679	| IOT217 |	Is a stand-alone Prada
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,471	| IOT217 |	So when you're trying to for insta
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:02,239	| IOT217 |	Monitor the air
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:04,799	| IOT217 |	And if you want to be able to improve
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,567	| IOT217 |	Service
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,847	| IOT217 |	Air conditioner
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:10,431	| IOT217 |	Then you really only need data from that
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,455	| IOT217 |	One device
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:14,527	| IOT217 |	And so standards and integrating with other
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,319	| IOT217 |	Machines and equipment
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:21,439	| IOT217 |	Isn't as important in that environment another example this is working with a company that manufactures
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:23,999	| IOT217 |	Dental operatory equipment the machines that are in
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,303	| IOT217 |	Dentist offices
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,095	| IOT217 |	Machines but they tend to be more
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:29,119	| IOT217 |	Stand-alone equipment
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:32,703	| IOT217 |	Not as complex of an environment at a factory
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:35,775	| IOT217 |	And those are cases where we seen products be
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:38,591	| IOT217 |	Successful getting to Market because essentially you're not
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,359	| IOT217 |	Waiting on
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:41,407	| IOT217 |	Ecosystem to develop you have a
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:41,919	| IOT217 |	Product
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:42,943	| IOT217 |	The problem
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,247	| IOT217 |	Directly
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:47,807	| IOT217 |	And the fact that there is
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:52,927	| IOT217 |	Continuing standard warranty IIT doesn't really keep you from being able to go out and solve your problem
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:59,071	| IOT217 |	Have you had any clients that have built out a homogeneous infrastructure
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:00,607	| IOT217 |	And then suddenly looked up in bed like
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:03,679	| IOT217 |	Oh I really wish we could connected to this thing
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:07,007	| IOT217 |	Tried to move to the next level if you have what has happened
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:07,775	| IOT217 |	What did they learn
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:10,847	| IOT217 |	What I see happening with
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:16,223	| IOT217 |	Those kinds of customers is they might say wouldn't it be nice if all these other pieces of equipment around here
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:18,527	| IOT217 |	Connected but they're not oh well so I'll just
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:21,599	| IOT217 |	Just keep trying to find other problems I can solve with this product
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,135	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,671	| IOT217 |	The downside is of course
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:25,951	| IOT217 |	That means that there
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:28,767	| IOT217 |	Are some interesting opportunity that are being left on the table
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:30,303	| IOT217 |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:35,167	| IOT217 |	What I find is it once people start shipping a Nike product the things they can do with it
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:37,215	| IOT217 |	The long-term opportunities start to become
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,775	| IOT217 |	Clear over time we're friends since you might say
EDL	00:47:39,775	00:47:41,567	| IOT217 |	I make a widget and the reason that I want
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:42,847	| IOT217 |	The widget is Kazan
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,663	| IOT217 |	And I want to be able to fix it
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:48,223	| IOT217 |	Okay that's the justification
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:50,271	| IOT217 |	A little rolling it out
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:53,087	| IOT217 |	You know what the widget also uses
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:53,855	| IOT217 |	Filters
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:55,135	| IOT217 |	Anna's filters
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| IOT217 |	Go battle
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:48:00,255	| IOT217 |	Being used so now I can do an automatic
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:03,839	| IOT217 |	Consumables business I can start sending people new filters
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:08,703	| IOT217 |	Every 3 months on the filters bad or not every 3 months everytime the filter needs to be replaced
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:09,983	| IOT217 |	Naga
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:10,751	| IOT217 |	Subscription business
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,519	| IOT217 |	And that's life
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:12,799	| IOT217 |	Second
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:13,567	| IOT217 |	Stage
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:17,151	| IOT217 |	Of my IIT products and then they start thinking about what is 1/3 / Opera
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,175	| IOT217 |	What time does Bracken start
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:22,527	| IOT217 |	Create do something better for my customers and there's enough juice there
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,039	| IOT217 |	There's enough
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:26,879	| IOT217 |	Extra things to go after once you launch a Nike product
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:27,647	| IOT217 |	That
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,415	| IOT217 |	It doesn't matter
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:30,207	| IOT217 |	How many cases that you
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:33,023	| IOT217 |	You can't do the interesting things that require in Iraq
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:35,071	| IOT217 |	Vices because there's there's enough
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:37,375	| IOT217 |	To go after I get plenty busy basically
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:39,935	| IOT217 |	Got it in the end that make sense
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:44,287	| IOT217 |	When it comes to the actual business use cases that people are
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,055	| IOT217 |	Deploying
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:47,103	| IOT217 |	Particle stuff in
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:48,127	| IOT217 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:50,431	| IOT217 |	Remote monitoring there's a little bit of Providence
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:54,015	| IOT217 |	4/2 or doing preventive maintenance and then a third or so or doing acid
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:54,783	| IOT217 |	The tracking
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:55,807	| IOT217 |	Are there
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:58,623	| IOT217 |	Other use cases that you're seeing developed
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:01,183	| IOT217 |	The other use cases
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:03,999	| IOT217 |	Is that we see happening but they're less frequent are
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:05,791	| IOT217 |	Just some kind of premium product
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:12,703	| IOT217 |	This is the like I make a widget but I make a smart widget that's more compelling for some reason and I sell at a premium
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:14,239	| IOT217 |	That was less than
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:14,751	| IOT217 |	30%
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:17,823	| IOT217 |	Then we have
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,615	| IOT217 |	To use
EDL	00:49:19,615	00:49:20,895	| IOT217 |	Particle to track
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:22,175	| IOT217 |	Consumables
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:26,015	| IOT217 |	Replacing filters and detergent and
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:27,039	| IOT217 |	Black coffee
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:27,551	| IOT217 |	Pods
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,343	| IOT217 |	Those were less than
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:31,391	| IOT217 |	And then
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:33,183	| IOT217 |	The least common was
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:34,463	| IOT217 |	Regulatory
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,535	| IOT217 |	I would think that would be high
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:39,583	| IOT217 |	So here's my I think
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:44,703	| IOT217 |	Those use cases are really strong which is like let's say that you are you do natural gas
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:45,471	| IOT217 |	Extraction
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:50,079	| IOT217 |	And you want to track methane emissions because UTA regulate
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:53,919	| IOT217 |	Particle
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:54,943	| IOT217 |	And they are very
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:55,455	| IOT217 |	Helen yusuke
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:56,479	| IOT217 |	Is because
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:58,015	| IOT217 |	They regulated again
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:49:59,295	| IOT217 |	And so
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:00,319	| IOT217 |	You have to do that if
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,855	| IOT217 |	If you're not if you're not business
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:03,903	| IOT217 |	And so I think that the fact that they
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,671	| IOT217 |	A small orange
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:05,439	| IOT217 |	Number customers
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:06,975	| IOT217 |	Is just
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:10,303	| IOT217 |	Reflective of the factors might be great use cases but they're only relevant
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:12,607	| IOT217 |	Whereas
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:13,631	| IOT217 |	Monitoring
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:14,143	| IOT217 |	Environment
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:17,215	| IOT217 |	Spencer's is something very broadly
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:19,007	| IOT217 |	Across a whole bunch of
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:20,543	| IOT217 |	Industries and use cases
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,847	| IOT217 |	All right so getting back to
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:27,199	| IOT217 |	Adoption in how people are scaling up
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:29,503	| IOT217 |	From Pilot tip reproduction reproduction
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:33,087	| IOT217 |	You know when I talk to people who are looking at
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:35,135	| IOT217 |	This space and building prototype
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:38,207	| IOT217 |	They usually start with something like a
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:40,511	| IOT217 |	The particle or maybe it's a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:44,095	| IOT217 |	And then in a certain point like a thousand maybe it's 10,000 there like
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:45,887	| IOT217 |	We need to move some
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:47,167	| IOT217 |	To something else
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:49,471	| IOT217 |	Talk to me about what you're seeing
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:51,263	| IOT217 |	In your customer base
EDL	00:50:51,263	00:50:52,031	| IOT217 |	Because you got this year
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:54,335	| IOT217 |	You got the cloud associated with
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,615	| IOT217 |	So you're basically starting
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:58,943	| IOT217 |	With particle and hopefully scaling all the way up
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:50:59,711	| IOT217 |	What is that process
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:04,319	| IOT217 |	So a lot of customers
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:05,855	| IOT217 |	Start with particle end of skin
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:08,415	| IOT217 |	I think the reason is that
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:09,183	| IOT217 |	The case
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:10,207	| IOT217 |	Anacortes Harbor
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:14,559	| IOT217 |	Business works better we we have a huge Community opportunity
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:17,631	| IOT217 |	We make your business
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:18,655	| IOT217 |	Israeli Tusa
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:20,703	| IOT217 |	Support those companies as they
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:22,495	| IOT217 |	Ring products to scale
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:23,007	| IOT217 |	So
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,799	| IOT217 |	I think if you are
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,079	| IOT217 |	Making the decision
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:26,591	| IOT217 |	Prototype
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:29,663	| IOT217 |	When you're deciding whether to continue to laptop
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:32,479	| IOT217 |	The question is what is the
EDL	00:51:33,247	00:51:33,759	| IOT217 |	Strategic
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:36,319	| IOT217 |	Or economic reason that you would want to build
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:37,855	| IOT217 |	And icing
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,135	| IOT217 |	That
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:40,415	| IOT217 |	In a lot of parallel speaker
EDL	00:51:40,415	00:51:42,719	| IOT217 |	Drawn between icing for structure and
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:43,999	| IOT217 |	Web infrastructure
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:46,047	| IOT217 |	Is essentially about dataset
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:49,375	| IOT217 |	Rick 30 years ago if you wanted
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:51,935	| IOT217 |	Build-A-Bear application you had to build a data center
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:53,215	| IOT217 |	Set up some kind of
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:53,983	| IOT217 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:56,799	| IOT217 |	And then you're dealing with a lot of heart problems
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:57,567	| IOT217 |	Like
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:51:58,079	| IOT217 |	Getting
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:00,127	| IOT217 |	Real estate and
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:01,919	| IOT217 |	Construction
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:04,223	| IOT217 |	Temperature
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:06,015	| IOT217 |	Controls and replacing servers
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:07,039	| IOT217 |	Go bad
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:08,319	| IOT217 |	None of which actually makes
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:09,087	| IOT217 |	Is your project
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:11,903	| IOT217 |	Register table Stakes to be able to
EDL	00:52:11,903	00:52:12,927	| IOT217 |	Build a web application
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:16,511	| IOT217 |	2006
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:18,559	| IOT217 |	Since then
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:19,583	| IOT217 |	You got Microsoft
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:20,351	| IOT217 |	Google
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:26,495	| IOT217 |	And overtime or more people have shifted the cloud because essentially there is no good
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:27,263	| IOT217 |	Economical
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:29,311	| IOT217 |	Versace justification for most
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:29,823	| IOT217 |	Companies
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:31,103	| IOT217 |	2
EDL	00:52:31,103	00:52:31,615	| IOT217 |	Builder
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:33,151	| IOT217 |	America
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:34,175	| IOT217 |	Dropbox
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:37,759	| IOT217 |	Spent $400 building their own software infrastructure
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:40,319	| IOT217 |	Because what they needed to
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:43,135	| IOT217 |	To do was easier and more economical for them
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:44,671	| IOT217 |	Delivered directly then
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:46,207	| IOT217 |	Using AWS
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:48,255	| IOT217 |	Another really big
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,279	| IOT217 |	Mastiff
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:52,095	| IOT217 |	Netflix
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:53,375	| IOT217 |	Hosted on AWS
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:54,143	| IOT217 |	And so
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:55,167	| IOT217 |	There are exception
EDL	00:52:55,167	00:52:55,679	| IOT217 |	Dropbox
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:53:00,287	| IOT217 |	Most of the time even large-scale what applications
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:01,311	| IOT217 |	Hotel on the cloud
EDL	00:53:01,823	00:53:03,103	| IOT217 |	Because there isn't a good read
EDL	00:53:04,127	00:53:04,895	| IOT217 |	And I think the same
EDL	00:53:05,663	00:53:09,247	| IOT217 |	The same fundamental decisions are true for it infrastructure which is that
EDL	00:53:09,759	00:53:11,295	| IOT217 |	There aren't generally Goods
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:14,879	| IOT217 |	Strategic Lacoste reasons why somebody should build their own infrastructure
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:16,415	| IOT217 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:21,023	| IOT217 |	Make your product better than somebody else's but it's not there isn't good strategic value
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:22,815	| IOT217 |	Economically perspective in life
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:26,143	| IOT217 |	Get cheaper on a unit basis but if you include all the overhead net
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:30,751	| IOT217 |	Saria's managing overseeing the infrastructure in Bluetooth devices
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:33,567	| IOT217 |	And so what you're left with is
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:34,591	| IOT217 |	The same reasons that caused
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:36,895	| IOT217 |	To be slow to adopt the cloud
EDL	00:53:36,895	00:53:38,687	| IOT217 |	Even though the underlying
EDL	00:53:40,735	00:53:42,271	| IOT217 |	Which is do you trust somebody else
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:43,807	| IOT217 |	Infrastructure for the
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:48,671	| IOT217 |	This product is super important and our job is to
EDL	00:53:48,671	00:53:50,207	| IOT217 |	Prove overtime by
EDL	00:53:50,207	00:53:54,815	| IOT217 |	Supporting a lot of customers who are happy and successful game across markets in that trust
EDL	00:53:55,583	00:53:56,095	| IOT217 |	Betfair
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:57,375	| IOT217 |	And
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:54:00,191	| IOT217 |	For a company that is looking at
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:01,471	| IOT217 |	Buying Hardware
EDL	00:54:01,471	00:54:03,775	| IOT217 |	And doing a prototype and then scaling up
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:05,567	| IOT217 |	Where do you see
EDL	00:54:06,079	00:54:07,103	| IOT217 |	The challenges
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:08,383	| IOT217 |	So
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:09,407	| IOT217 |	Your customers who are like
EDL	00:54:09,919	00:54:13,503	| IOT217 |	Yeah we run a successful proof-of-concept in
EDL	00:54:13,503	00:54:14,783	| IOT217 |	To roll this out further
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:16,319	| IOT217 |	Where do they hit the road bumps
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:18,623	| IOT217 |	Some of the biggest challenges
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:22,207	| IOT217 |	The one counters when your deployment actually product are
EDL	00:54:22,207	00:54:28,095	| IOT217 |	Different than what you expected to be when we ask customers about a bunch of different technical challenges and said
EDL	00:54:28,607	00:54:29,631	| IOT217 |	What have you found to be
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:32,191	| IOT217 |	The number one
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:34,751	| IOT217 |	What is debugging on health advice
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:36,287	| IOT217 |	Which is to say
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:37,567	| IOT217 |	Let's say you have a
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:38,847	| IOT217 |	100000
EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:40,639	| IOT217 |	But you could collapse
EDL	00:54:41,663	00:54:42,687	| IOT217 |	And generally speaking
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:44,991	| IOT217 |	But there's like a thousand
EDL	00:54:47,295	00:54:48,063	| IOT217 |	That are misbehaving
EDL	00:54:48,575	00:54:49,087	| IOT217 |	Why are they
EDL	00:54:50,111	00:54:52,415	| IOT217 |	Frank cell Princeton samite
EDL	00:54:52,415	00:54:55,743	| IOT217 |	The having issues connecting to whatever this other Tower is
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:54:58,047	| IOT217 |	They might
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:01,119	| IOT217 |	Tennis shoes where they're not getting
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:05,983	| IOT217 |	The necessary 3.3 volts to be able to for the system to be able to
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:07,263	| IOT217 |	To behave
EDL	00:55:07,263	00:55:08,031	| IOT217 |	Lively
EDL	00:55:08,031	00:55:09,055	| IOT217 |	Daylight
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:10,591	| IOT217 |	Something wrong
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:11,615	| IOT217 |	Haystak so this
EDL	00:55:11,615	00:55:12,383	| IOT217 |	Secureconnect

EDL	00:55:15,455	00:55:18,271	| IOT217 |	If you experience you have is just at 99
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:19,807	| IOT217 |	Onager devices are
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:20,831	| IOT217 |	Sending messages but one
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:26,975	| IOT217 |	It can be really difficult to figure out why they're not write any one of those problems could be the problem
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:28,511	| IOT217 |	Device is out in the world
EDL	00:55:29,023	00:55:31,071	| IOT217 |	Hearing from it can be really tough to figure out what's going
EDL	00:55:31,583	00:55:33,119	| IOT217 |	We've been building a bunch
EDL	00:55:33,119	00:55:35,167	| IOT217 |	Features around
EDL	00:55:35,167	00:55:36,703	| IOT217 |	Which is providing more
EDL	00:55:36,703	00:55:37,471	| IOT217 |	Or inside
EDL	00:55:37,471	00:55:42,847	| IOT217 |	To our customers about when you have a device been going to see what exactly is going on and what you do about it
EDL	00:55:42,847	00:55:49,247	| IOT217 |	Those are the kinds of challenges when we talked to companies who have delivered product that they say this is a really high
EDL	00:55:49,247	00:55:50,271	| IOT217 |	Start stopwatch
EDL	00:55:50,783	00:55:51,551	| IOT217 |	Before they deliver
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:54,367	| IOT217 |	That one might not be
EDL	00:55:55,391	00:55:57,439	| IOT217 |	The number to Forest in terms of
EDL	00:55:57,439	00:55:59,999	| IOT217 |	What we hear is is most challenging in the
EDL	00:55:59,999	00:56:01,535	| IOT217 |	We don't suffer.

EDL	00:56:11,007	00:56:12,287	| IOT217 |	Way too many
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:16,895	| IOT217 |	Public cases of devices that got ripped through an over-the-air software update that went bad
EDL	00:56:17,407	00:56:23,807	| IOT217 |	And so is another of these big technical challenges that we solve for customers to say we've we've tried to take
EDL	00:56:23,807	00:56:24,575	| IOT217 |	Artist
EDL	00:56:24,575	00:56:25,343	| IOT217 |	Senate results
EDL	00:56:25,343	00:56:27,135	| IOT217 |	Are you there other problems which
EDL	00:56:27,647	00:56:30,719	| IOT217 |	I think they're often for them it is difficult but if you ask
EDL	00:56:30,719	00:56:31,487	| IOT217 |	Customers
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:36,607	| IOT217 |	What we found in the survey is they weren't they weren't as challenging
EDL	00:56:37,375	00:56:38,911	| IOT217 |	Storing and collecting data
EDL	00:56:39,679	00:56:40,447	| IOT217 |	Visualizing
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:41,215	| IOT217 |	Data
EDL	00:56:41,215	00:56:43,263	| IOT217 |	Generating insights with data
EDL	00:56:43,263	00:56:44,543	| IOT217 |	We generally found the cusp
EDL	00:56:46,079	00:56:48,383	| IOT217 |	And I think that's in contrast to of the
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:52,223	| IOT217 |	Something like 450 iot platforms that exist in the world
EDL	00:56:54,271	00:56:55,551	| IOT217 |	100
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:56,575	| IOT217 |	Analytics
EDL	00:56:56,575	00:56:59,135	| IOT217 |	Find as if those are actually the hardest problem
EDL	00:56:59,135	00:57:01,695	| IOT217 |	The reason for that is the date
EDL	00:57:01,695	00:57:04,255	| IOT217 |	Not hard it's just because there's a lot of great product that already
EDL	00:57:04,255	00:57:05,279	| IOT217 |	Best about
EDL	00:57:05,279	00:57:07,071	| IOT217 |	Solving problems with data that are relevant
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:11,679	| IOT217 |	I see you don't necessarily need like a specialist it products to go and solve those problems
EDL	00:57:13,471	00:57:13,983	| IOT217 |	The one that
EDL	00:57:14,495	00:57:16,799	| IOT217 |	We heard as most challenging the generating insights
EDL	00:57:16,799	00:57:18,591	| IOT217 |	Which is to say not just collecting
EDL	00:57:20,383	00:57:21,407	| IOT217 |	But I kept turning that in
EDL	00:57:21,407	00:57:23,199	| IOT217 |	Into a solution to a problem
EDL	00:57:23,199	00:57:24,735	| IOT217 |	Generally true
EDL	00:57:24,735	00:57:27,551	| IOT217 |	Super any business with larger quantities of data is
EDL	00:57:29,343	00:57:30,367	| IOT217 |	Another thing to actually
EDL	00:57:30,367	00:57:31,647	| IOT217 |	Problem
EDL	00:57:32,671	00:57:34,463	| IOT217 |	You see the same challenges than
EDL	00:57:34,975	00:57:36,767	| IOT217 |	Like every marketing product ever
EDL	00:57:36,767	00:57:38,815	| IOT217 |	Babe like you get all this clickbait
EDL	00:57:39,327	00:57:40,607	| IOT217 |	What you doing on the website
EDL	00:57:40,607	00:57:41,631	| IOT217 |	Turning that into
EDL	00:57:42,399	00:57:43,679	| IOT217 |	Something to go do
EDL	00:57:43,679	00:57:44,447	| IOT217 |	Is the hard part
EDL	00:57:45,983	00:57:47,007	| IOT217 |	A bear in there
EDL	00:57:47,007	00:57:49,567	| IOT217 |	Companies that have been successful in helping generate those insights
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:51,359	| IOT217 |	But yeah I mean one of the things that I found
EDL	00:57:51,359	00:57:56,991	| IOT217 |	I'm looking at these survey results is that some of the things that are often painted as being the hardest problem
EDL	00:57:56,991	00:58:03,391	| IOT217 |	Don't actually seem to be that way and the hardest problems really tend to be more about this like nitty-gritty infrastructure
EDL	00:58:03,391	00:58:05,183	| IOT217 |	Sure of fundamentally how do you
EDL	00:58:05,183	00:58:06,463	| IOT217 |	Reliably connected
EDL	00:58:06,463	00:58:08,767	| IOT217 |	100000 physical devices
EDL	00:58:08,767	00:58:09,279	| IOT217 |	To the web
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:11,583	| IOT217 |	So that you can regularly communicate back
