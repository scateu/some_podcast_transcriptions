EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:36,864	| IOT132 |	A brand new os4 wearables that can track what you eat
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:37,888	| IOT132 |	Possibly
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:39,424	| IOT132 |	Got some driverless Taxi
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:43,264	| IOT132 |	And some stats on the industrial iot
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:46,592	| IOT132 |	We also have a message for this week from Qualcomm and
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:47,360	| IOT132 |	Our Guest

EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:58,624	| IOT132 |	And she's got talked about how to scale infrastructure this is really good for
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:02,720	| IOT132 |	Your boss
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:04,512	| IOT132 |	Whatever and of course we're going to eat

EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,576	| IOT132 |	Slash advert
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,648	| IOT132 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:06,976	| IOT132 |	Let's get started with security
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,488	| IOT132 |	This week
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,768	| IOT132 |	Ring
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:12,096	| IOT132 |	Watch it security system which we were totally expecting
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:12,864	| IOT132 |	And
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| IOT132 |	I find myself a little underwear
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,168	| IOT132 |	What about you
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:22,336	| IOT132 |	You know it seems like everybody's got their own security system coming out now or maybe they're partnering with somebody to
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,384	| IOT132 |	Panther security offering
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:30,784	| IOT132 |	Hey with an ounce compared to everybody else last week we talked about the new Nest secure
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT132 |	Security system
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,088	| IOT132 |	And another one
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:35,136	| IOT132 |	But later I kind of like
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,952	| IOT132 |	Ring is doing her because it's not expensive
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,512	| IOT132 |	Some of the details
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,792	| IOT132 |	Their home system is called
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:45,376	| IOT132 |	It retails for 199
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,168	| IOT132 |	A cheat code for arming and disarming
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:49,472	| IOT132 |	A contact sensor for a window or door
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,800	| IOT132 |	Passive infrared sensor for detecting motion
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:55,616	| IOT132 |	And a Z-Wave extender for adding range to smart
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,176	| IOT132 |	So
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,200	| IOT132 |	It's not a ton of stuff
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,224	| IOT132 |	Get you started
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:03,808	| IOT132 |	Yeah there's not a lot of sensors now in contrasting Nest system
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,344	| IOT132 |	Cost
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,368	| IOT132 |	Includes
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,208	| IOT132 |	I don't know what to call it
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,512	| IOT132 |	But it also has sensors
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,328	| IOT132 |	Serious and you can tags that let you
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,352	| IOT132 |	Swipe in and out of
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,008	| IOT132 |	Motion sensor
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,800	| IOT132 |	What column to extra fancy
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,312	| IOT132 |	Sensors
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,360	| IOT132 |	And then
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,432	| IOT132 |	There is another thing out this week SmartThings
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,968	| IOT132 |	Is working with ADT
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,040	| IOT132 |	BestBuy to Launch
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,160	| IOT132 |	I almost don't want to because this is really disappointing
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,208	| IOT132 |	And keep them
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:48,608	| IOT132 |	Samsung has you said working with ADT is an ADT monitor do-it-yourself security
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:53,216	| IOT132 |	Solution Power by SmartThings it'll be available exclusively at Best Buy
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:59,616	| IOT132 |	On October 29th you can pre-order it now if you're going to pre-order it's going to cost you 504
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,896	| IOT132 |	$49
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:05,760	| IOT132 |	And it's kind of basic to you don't get a ton of stuff and it's a starter pack
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:12,160	| IOT132 |	What's got a panel touch panel so that you can check in and check out the arm disarm etcetera and as far as sensors
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,464	| IOT132 |	Comes a 2 door and window
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT132 |	Sensors are detectors and emotion
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:22,143	| IOT132 |	Base station serves as a SmartThings Hub work with other SmartThings devices
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,911	| IOT132 |	Just great
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,727	| IOT132 |	Buy 4999 for olives
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,519	| IOT132 |	That which is not a lot
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,031	| IOT132 |	Seems
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,079	| IOT132 |	Like a lot of money to me and that's
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,895	| IOT132 |	Again that's the starter pack does not include monitoring
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:39,039	| IOT132 |	Get back to the ring monitoring and then talk about Nest modern as opposed to but if you want to have ATT professionally monitor
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:43,647	| IOT132 |	It starts at 1499 and safety
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:49,791	| IOT132 |	Meyering and then 2499 a months is for security services so I kind of thought for 5:49
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,351	| IOT132 |	The monitoring service for maybe a year
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,887	| IOT132 |	But I don't see it that way
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:58,495	| IOT132 |	Appear that they are don't know what Nest will charge for monitoring
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,519	| IOT132 |	Ring is going to charge
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| IOT132 |	100 a year
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,919	| IOT132 |	Serene's pricing is actually really good
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,967	| IOT132 |	Get $10 a monthly fee gets you
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,015	| IOT132 |	All of your video
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,575	| IOT132 |	According
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,367	| IOT132 |	If you bought into the system
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,647	| IOT132 |	You probably wouldn't pay much
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,159	| IOT132 |	4 month
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,719	| IOT132 |	Highly significant
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT132 |	Compared to light
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,047	| IOT132 |	ATT offers or even something
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| IOT132 |	You know like
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:26,399	| IOT132 |	SimpliSafe they have monitoring to I think that's 10 or $15
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,215	| IOT132 |	That's all so different from the nest
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,031	| IOT132 |	Security monitoring because it's
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:38,175	| IOT132 |	Going to be separate from the nest aware subscription which is now $10 a month for my recordings and such
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| IOT132 |	Right the nest security
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:40,991	| IOT132 |	I think that's going to be
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:42,783	| IOT132 |	It is
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,855	| IOT132 |	Funtimes okay
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,183	| IOT132 |	So I was talking to somebody in the industry cuz I have written a lot
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,511	| IOT132 |	About how security is the Gateway
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,047	| IOT132 |	To the Smart Home
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,839	| IOT132 |	And so it makes sense that
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,143	| IOT132 |	ATT would get in on this
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,703	| IOT132 |	Pulse was home automation Plastics
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,239	| IOT132 |	Security really didn't do much about
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,799	| IOT132 |	And they also were suing
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,383	| IOT132 |	To help integrate
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| IOT132 |	With the security system
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT132 |	And
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,967	| IOT132 |	Ring was like
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,271	| IOT132 |	We Investments are not taking her IP
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,087	| IOT132 |	And so that lawsuit is still I don't know where that is it's still
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,879	| IOT132 |	Glasses take long time
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,159	| IOT132 |	It's worth noting
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,231	| IOT132 |	Employees
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,999	| IOT132 |	But they didn't buy the
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,559	| IOT132 |	It's very complex
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:27,839	| IOT132 |	Fairy wax
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,143	| IOT132 |	But having those people on board
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| IOT132 |	Means
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:35,519	| IOT132 |	They're going to connect with other things so the ring security system
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,567	| IOT132 |	Additional outside
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:40,895	| IOT132 |	We don't know what those actually really encouraging
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,991	| IOT132 |	Don't do it right so
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| IOT132 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,855	| IOT132 |	This is a lot of confusion there's a lot of
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,135	| IOT132 |	Stuff happening in the market
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,439	| IOT132 |	Are because security issues such a
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,719	| IOT132 |	Place to start selling
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,743	| IOT132 |	Hannah smart
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,815	| IOT132 |	Most the time I hear the stat
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,119	| IOT132 |	The 20% only 20% of America
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:01,631	| IOT132 |	Let's have some fun
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:02,911	| IOT132 |	Sakura
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,703	| IOT132 |	Which is really low
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:08,287	| IOT132 |	It is it is but I think you're right as far as a gateway drug
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,055	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:14,431	| IOT132 |	It's something that people can equate to easily make security systems have been around for years and years and years
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:18,783	| IOT132 |	Where is the Smart Home Smart Home is a relatively new phenomenon
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:24,927	| IOT132 |	So I guess people can quite understand what it is I think they're also used to paying a lot of money for security system
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,535	| IOT132 |	And I wonder if that is playing into some of these packages and pricing plans
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:34,655	| IOT132 |	If I just securing my home
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,239	| IOT132 |	A security system
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| IOT132 |	Nestor smart
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,567	| IOT132 |	Are things you know plus the
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,591	| IOT132 |	150
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,103	| IOT132 |	Dr200
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,895	| IOT132 |	Camera
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,175	| IOT132 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,455	| IOT132 |	Crazy but it's also
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:55,391	| IOT132 |	It's also going to cover your whole home if you're going to spend that much money you're going to get a ton of sensors right
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:59,231	| IOT132 |	Where is if you start with one day is like the ADT SmartThings package
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,559	| IOT132 |	For $500 you're monitoring one or two maybe three things
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,583	| IOT132 |	So you have to
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,631	| IOT132 |	Then spend hundreds more on top of that
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,447	| IOT132 |	We should also say that there's been companies doing this for a while
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,263	| IOT132 |	SimpliSafe is probably
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| IOT132 |	Smartest
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:15,359	| IOT132 |	A friend of mine the SimpliSafe
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:21,247	| IOT132 |	Effect and basically they're saying hey SimpliSafe
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| IOT132 |	Plus monitor
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| IOT132 |	Very little
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,343	| IOT132 |	And
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:30,975	| IOT132 |	Another company that does very excited about
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,511	| IOT132 |	But they love their boats
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,839	| IOT132 |	354 the basement a moment
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,887	| IOT132 |	They can go out from there
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:42,495	| IOT132 |	I feel like there's one other company
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,263	| IOT132 |	Worth mentioning
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:43,775	| IOT132 |	I can't remember
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,335	| IOT132 |	Well that's okay while you're thinking about that I've got
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:51,967	| IOT132 |	What is this due to like the canaries and all the others that are
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,015	| IOT132 |	Home security cameras
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:57,087	| IOT132 |	I'm glad you asked because I'm very worried
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,391	| IOT132 |	About them so
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:08:59,903	| IOT132 |	Canarian pipe
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,951	| IOT132 |	Where to home security come
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,743	| IOT132 |	I love to pieces
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,791	| IOT132 |	You brought them into your house
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,583	| IOT132 |	Camera and a bunch of sensors
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,119	| IOT132 |	You
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,423	| IOT132 |	Punch it in and if it noticed something
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| IOT132 |	You no emotion it would
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:14,751	| IOT132 |	Notify you in
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,031	| IOT132 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,567	| IOT132 |	Someone's at my house you could check the
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,615	| IOT132 |	The Cameron say yes there is a person
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,383	| IOT132 |	Could activate lyca
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,943	| IOT132 |	Really loud siren on the device
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,223	| IOT132 |	I thought those were really
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,015	| IOT132 |	Interesting and they were actually
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,087	| IOT132 |	Like they felt like a step forward
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,623	| IOT132 |	Home Security
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,671	| IOT132 |	Leslie
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,999	| IOT132 |	Let's let's insertion
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:36,767	| IOT132 |	Device
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,303	| IOT132 |	Think about how your home
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,583	| IOT132 |	Behaves and let you know
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,607	| IOT132 |	When something is different
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,679	| IOT132 |	But I'm not sure they're doing well for example just this week
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,007	| IOT132 |	Canary
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:50,847	| IOT132 |	We saw a lot of video on the cloud and it's not really tenable financially
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| IOT132 |	Play for us so we're going to have
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| IOT132 |	To ask
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,991	| IOT132 |	We're going to roll back some pictures and I thought this was really
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,759	| IOT132 |	Unfortunate
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,295	| IOT132 |	Because nobody wants to
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,575	| IOT132 |	Teacher's butt
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,343	| IOT132 |	Also
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:05,183	| IOT132 |	If you don't have a business model that sustainable
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:08,767	| IOT132 |	Business
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,583	| IOT132 |	So there is
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,375	| IOT132 |	In the future there rolling back
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,423	| IOT132 |	Is always
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:15,935	| IOT132 |	Recording
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,751	| IOT132 |	They said that they chose that one
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,799	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,359	| IOT132 |	Most people turn their canaries to private
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,663	| IOT132 |	I would imagine so yes
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,271	| IOT132 |	It is probably the least
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:36,927	| IOT132 |	Sure I can understand why they're doing that and I just think in the long-term day and
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,487	| IOT132 |	Similar products are going to be more in a niche
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,327	| IOT132 |	Market than those who are teaming up and coming out with their own Solutions
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,607	| IOT132 |	Broader Solutions I should say
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:48,959	| IOT132 |	Security space
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,239	| IOT132 |	What do you think
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,311	| IOT132 |	Alright so lots of new things
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,615	| IOT132 |	What's up
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,663	| IOT132 |	Speaking of Piper
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,943	| IOT132 |	Which is one of those security
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:01,759	| IOT132 |	Piper Russell
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:02,783	| IOT132 |	Yuri
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:03,807	| IOT132 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| IOT132 |	The score podcast
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| IOT132 |	Russell
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,231	| IOT132 |	Meet the piper
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| IOT132 |	He left when Piper was sold to
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,399	| IOT132 |	And now he's doing a comedy called Clash
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| IOT132 |	Works and
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,239	| IOT132 |	They make a product that will be out next year
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:26,079	| IOT132 |	Just a quick thing about this this is going to be a product that you stick on your
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:31,711	| IOT132 |	Car dash like the piper it takes a picture it also has sensors that plugs into the OBD port
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| IOT132 |	Your car too
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,063	| IOT132 |	Gather location in Geneva
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:40,415	| IOT132 |	The idea here is to understand what's happening in
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:45,535	| IOT132 |	Around your car so you can check in on people as they're driving so
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,327	| IOT132 |	Tesla
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,119	| IOT132 |	Where's my husband and daughter
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,703	| IOT132 |	Are they are they stopping to get dinner let's see
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,215	| IOT132 |	Where they parked
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| IOT132 |	You can also
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| IOT132 |	Check in
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,823	| IOT132 |	See the road from
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:03,199	| IOT132 |	And then it also when your car is parked it has like glass break monitoring sensors and
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,479	| IOT132 |	Like Notifier
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:04,991	| IOT132 |	You something
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| IOT132 |	So
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:12,415	| IOT132 |	All of that comes it's 299 for the device and then there's going to be a subscription fee for the LTE
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| IOT132 |	Connectivity associate
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,719	| IOT132 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,743	| IOT132 |	At its lower-end
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,255	| IOT132 |	$5
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,791	| IOT132 |	No idea how high that
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,351	| IOT132 |	No I think this is actually really
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,375	| IOT132 |	Cool device
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,447	| IOT132 |	Mostly because I like getting my car data
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,215	| IOT132 |	And also be
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,287	| IOT132 |	Because I like the idea of having a camera in my car
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:32,383	| IOT132 |	Car that can turn on when something happens around it so late
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,175	| IOT132 |	I want to test it because unlike someone
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,807	| IOT132 |	Right I agree I think that's the
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,087	| IOT132 |	Most attractive
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,367	| IOT132 |	Here to this product
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:48,255	| IOT132 |	Plug-in modules that you can just get your car data today without module for a hundred bucks
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:59,519	| IOT132 |	Data coming everyday on my efficiency
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:03,359	| IOT132 |	See if somebody thing me when I'm parked or something like that I like the idea that
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,407	| IOT132 |	Are you going to pull the trigger unless you were actually look
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:10,271	| IOT132 |	You know I don't know about the T-Mobile syncup Drive
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,039	| IOT132 |	Yes I am
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:16,927	| IOT132 |	So I actually stumbled upon the syncup drive from T-Mobile
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:23,327	| IOT132 |	I noticed that this is not April OBD plugin module for car
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,119	| IOT132 |	Arsenal to check to make sure your car is
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:31,519	| IOT132 |	Actually compatible with my phone is not I was shocked to see that so all of our other cars are
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,335	| IOT132 |	Same thing it's a breeder that diagnoses vehicle issues
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:40,223	| IOT132 |	And so on other things as LTE built-in
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:46,623	| IOT132 |	You will pay for a 2 GB data plan per month for this and that lets you turn your car into a hotspot for
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:53,023	| IOT132 |	Idevices again to share
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,327	| IOT132 |	I don't need that aspect of it
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:14:01,727	| IOT132 |	The device itself also includes with the to get you get roadside assistance
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:04,031	| IOT132 |	Vehicle and
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:09,663	| IOT132 |	A support service from Allstate Motor Club so that's included in your monthly fee
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,967	| IOT132 |	It's only $2
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| IOT132 |	A month
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:19,135	| IOT132 |	For 24 months for the data plan that includes the roadside assistance as well as all the time
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,415	| IOT132 |	Getting an app on your car
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| IOT132 |	I think that's a heck of a deal
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,743	| IOT132 |	I don't think I've ever used
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,839	| IOT132 |	Nice piece of mind for people who don't have Roadside Assistance
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| IOT132 |	So they have
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,007	| IOT132 |	It's the same sort of thing
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:41,407	| IOT132 |	Roadside assistance
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,943	| IOT132 |	Different
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:46,527	| IOT132 |	It is a subscription starting at like 10 bucks to Fifteen bucks
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,831	| IOT132 |	Plus that Verizon activation fee
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,111	| IOT132 |	Just makes me want
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,439	| IOT132 |	And then there's like a $30 and
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| IOT132 |	So wow
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,559	| IOT132 |	That sounds like a smoke
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:02,399	| IOT132 |	Alright guys so connect your cars
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,423	| IOT132 |	No
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:08,287	| IOT132 |	A crazy light bulb because it's been a long time since I've talked about lights
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:11,871	| IOT132 |	This guy is worth talking about this is the he light
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,663	| IOT132 |	It is a Kickstarter project
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,711	| IOT132 |	And this is a smart bulb that does two things
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| IOT132 |	It listens to you
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,831	| IOT132 |	And then to
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,391	| IOT132 |	It has easy pre-programmed
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,951	| IOT132 |	Including things like Halloween
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,975	| IOT132 |	Because it's October
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,511	| IOT132 |	Makes it close
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| IOT132 |	Flickers into
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,327	| IOT132 |	Astro be effective
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,375	| IOT132 |	A spooky flickering can
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| IOT132 |	And my
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,959	| IOT132 |	Personal favorite which is
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,727	| IOT132 |	The romantic
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,031	| IOT132 |	Witches
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| IOT132 |	A pink
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,079	| IOT132 |	Elsa coming
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:45,663	| IOT132 |	So I think this is cool but I kind of
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:46,943	| IOT132 |	Freak out
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:50,783	| IOT132 |	Why because it listens to everything that you just got to pounce it
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,879	| IOT132 |	Azure making noise
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,671	| IOT132 |	Slickers from
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,231	| IOT132 |	One kind of pink to a stronger type of
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,255	| IOT132 |	FaceTime
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,327	| IOT132 |	Which
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT132 |	Curtains
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:13,567	| IOT132 |	I don't know I personally would not but I think it's an interesting
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,359	| IOT132 |	Melding of
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| IOT132 |	A different type of sensor you don't
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,223	| IOT132 |	Often have with a lightbulb right you don't typically have sound
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| IOT132 |	Is the trigger
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:26,623	| IOT132 |	A candlelight mode and then you can actually blow on the light
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:29,439	| IOT132 |	Just like a candle and it will cure your breath in
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,999	| IOT132 |	Shut up like a regular Candlewood if you've got
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,791	| IOT132 |	The music playing it can
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,631	| IOT132 |	Colors and whatnot.
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:41,215	| IOT132 |	Shoe People
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,775	| IOT132 |	It's not as interactive right this is
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,567	| IOT132 |	Cuz you got to use your smarts
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,359	| IOT132 |	The sound 2
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,175	| IOT132 |	Music translations
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT132 |	On your smartphone
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT132 |	Your smartphone has to be
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:58,623	| IOT132 |	So this would be smartphone free because the sound module is built into the bowl itself
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,719	| IOT132 |	Crazy sensors in
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,327	| IOT132 |	60
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:07,839	| IOT132 |	Bucks
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| IOT132 |	Oh that's that really
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:13,471	| IOT132 |	So that really 60 bucks for three bulbs problem
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:16,031	| IOT132 |	More realistic pricing is going to be
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,311	| IOT132 |	130
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| IOT132 |	4
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| IOT132 |	No that's that's still not realistic
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:26,271	| IOT132 |	Now the 3-pack it looks like the estimated retail price of a 117 or roughly $40 of
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,111	| IOT132 |	Color changing
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,463	| IOT132 |	Yeah Usher assassin
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,743	| IOT132 |	Some of this is also
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:39,327	| IOT132 |	Really interesting so it looks like his blue toothpaste
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,351	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:44,959	| IOT132 |	You actually it doesn't have a hug when you change the bulbs color you're doing it by sound
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,007	| IOT132 |	I'm not says without Bluetooth Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,823	| IOT132 |	You can do it with or without from what I can see
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,639	| IOT132 |	It isn't
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,943	| IOT132 |	I'd be curious to see
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,759	| IOT132 |	If I had watching a movie or something
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:00,063	| IOT132 |	There's like a door makes a like a movie mood
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:06,463	| IOT132 |	Kind of like what she was dumb a certain television shows I remember I didn't have Hue bulbs at the time but I was watching some things on
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,791	| IOT132 |	Syfy
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:14,655	| IOT132 |	Change the lights in your room to match the scene
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:15,935	| IOT132 |	And all that
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:19,263	| IOT132 |	That would be a cool mode I don't see it
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:24,639	| IOT132 |	You know she was actually doing that they have a hue entertainment features and they're working
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,199	| IOT132 |	With entertainment companies
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:27,967	| IOT132 |	2
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,991	| IOT132 |	By providing them
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,271	| IOT132 |	STK
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| IOT132 |	And
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,343	| IOT132 |	It will actually allow
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,111	| IOT132 |	Companies to
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,135	| IOT132 |	Basically created
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,671	| IOT132 |	Surround sound for
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| IOT132 |	I don't know what entertainment company is
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,023	| IOT132 |	Yeah let's make that have
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,839	| IOT132 |	I will admit that I watch Sharknado
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:46,399	| IOT132 |	Set the Hue Lights on and it made it like that much
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,703	| IOT132 |	So when that was in the water
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| IOT132 |	My lights would turn
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,519	| IOT132 |	Red
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,799	| IOT132 |	Which I was like
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,335	| IOT132 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| IOT132 |	My other favorite
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| IOT132 |	Was when it was thundering and
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,687	| IOT132 |	Lights with strobe
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,711	| IOT132 |	What article
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,735	| IOT132 |	Wasn't cheesy
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,759	| IOT132 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,783	| IOT132 |	Did it work with the movie
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,063	| IOT132 |	Definitely
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| IOT132 |	They also did it with us Syfy channel
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,927	| IOT132 |	The show that was actually much less
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,303	| IOT132 |	I don't recall which it show I was watching on Syfy
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:20,191	| IOT132 |	Syfy
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| IOT132 |	You can possibly look for it
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,615	| IOT132 |	So cool Kickstarter
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:28,895	| IOT132 |	Fun lights
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,943	| IOT132 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:33,247	| IOT132 |	Passive information collection
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,015	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,039	| IOT132 |	I don't we love that
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:39,391	| IOT132 |	So there's a company that just launched this week called clue
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,415	| IOT132 |	It's clear with a k
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:44,255	| IOT132 |	And for the Apple watch
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| IOT132 |	This software
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| IOT132 |	Magic
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,327	| IOT132 |	It
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,447	| IOT132 |	Isn't all software Magic
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:54,239	| IOT132 |	Software is Magic
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,263	| IOT132 |	This one's especially Magic
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,359	| IOT132 |	So these algorithms
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,175	| IOT132 |	Basically detect the Motions of your hand
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,223	| IOT132 |	And use that to determine
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,503	| IOT132 |	You're eating
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,807	| IOT132 |	If you're drinking and slightly more specific
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,135	| IOT132 |	Versus
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,647	| IOT132 |	Cutting steak
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,439	| IOT132 |	Braces
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| IOT132 |	Reading Eggs
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,487	| IOT132 |	Super sandwich
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:20,351	| IOT132 |	So I can tell those kind of things that also tell based on how you're holding the glass if you're drinking
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:20,863	| IOT132 |	Water or
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:24,959	| IOT132 |	Grant
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,239	| IOT132 |	Kevin
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,103	| IOT132 |	Kevin and six-year-olds everywhere
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,383	| IOT132 |	Using a straw
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| IOT132 |	It's my juice box
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,479	| IOT132 |	So I thought this was
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,039	| IOT132 |	Cool because I love that ideas
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:42,111	| IOT132 |	Having something at the ideas that would promote mindfulness around
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,159	| IOT132 |	It's less about calorie count
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,207	| IOT132 |	You can get
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,023	| IOT132 |	You know you can't log exact foods but you can get a sense of life
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,071	| IOT132 |	Wow you know what you eat a lot of food
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,863	| IOT132 |	It can also
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,375	| IOT132 |	Act
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,655	| IOT132 |	To vibrate
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:58,495	| IOT132 |	You're sitting there eating tortilla chips
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:01,311	| IOT132 |	What else does this but you know you just got
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:01,823	| IOT132 |	Reaching the bag
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:06,943	| IOT132 |	Yep during football games
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:09,247	| IOT132 |	Yashow she didn't want that to happen
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,319	| IOT132 |	I could tell you you like by the way you're still eating
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,855	| IOT132 |	You like oh so I am
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:17,184	| IOT132 |	This is an interesting Twist on like behavior modification
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,768	| IOT132 |	It reminds me of some of the early SmartWatches that would just eat
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| IOT132 |	Text what
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:25,120	| IOT132 |	Exercise you're doing or some really intelligent algorithms
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,144	| IOT132 |	Detectamet doing a push-up
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,592	| IOT132 |	You're doing it maybe you shouldn't be doing it as much
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:41,504	| IOT132 |	I think it's a very interesting concept because
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| IOT132 |	And see what I can find out about it
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:45,344	| IOT132 |	Excellent well I will say I'm a little worried about it
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,368	| IOT132 |	Not because of
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,416	| IOT132 |	This particular thing I have no
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:52,000	| IOT132 |	Problems and I talked to the CEO and she is wonderful and she is like
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,560	| IOT132 |	It stays with us when
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,584	| IOT132 |	Elsewhere
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,120	| IOT132 |	Your data
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,144	| IOT132 |	I look at this and I'm like
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,448	| IOT132 |	My hands
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,496	| IOT132 |	And you know some things I don't know if I want
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,288	| IOT132 |	People to know about
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:07,872	| IOT132 |	You know I don't know if I want that logged forever and software somewhere
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,920	| IOT132 |	Think about what you do with your hands
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:16,576	| IOT132 |	Every year it's a good point and it brings me back to the not-so-long-ago episode of
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:19,392	| IOT132 |	People are the police using data from
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,184	| IOT132 |	President Echo
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,208	| IOT132 |	Or a Fitbit
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| IOT132 |	To determine
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| IOT132 |	If somebody
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,584	| IOT132 |	I've been home when their spouse have been killed and so on
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,376	| IOT132 |	I mean that's just more data that could be used
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,912	| IOT132 |	Against you not that I'm saying
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| IOT132 |	People are worried about that
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,496	| IOT132 |	Inherently good
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,568	| IOT132 |	You're right that's the tricky sticky
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,872	| IOT132 |	Situation Sticky Wicket
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,408	| IOT132 |	Latest hits
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,688	| IOT132 |	So that's that
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| IOT132 |	I
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:45,248	| IOT132 |	Just throwing it out there but
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,064	| IOT132 |	Transiting about here privacy
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,368	| IOT132 |	So software running on
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| IOT132 |	Like an app model for
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,696	| IOT132 |	Wearables cuz that's kind of what this week
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| IOT132 |	Depends on
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,744	| IOT132 |	And then three
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,280	| IOT132 |	Passive data collection
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,048	| IOT132 |	Switch
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| IOT132 |	As ye
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:22:59,584	| IOT132 |	And also can
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,656	| IOT132 |	I will also say
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,936	| IOT132 |	Before I move off
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,448	| IOT132 |	Devices
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:08,288	| IOT132 |	Too much I ordered the Amazon Echo Plus with
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,128	| IOT132 |	That will arrive
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,408	| IOT132 |	October 31st
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,712	| IOT132 |	Which is a Tuesday you guys which means
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,016	| IOT132 |	The first podcast in November
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:18,528	| IOT132 |	We can be
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:23,904	| IOT132 |	Works I'm dying to know how and what it works with
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,696	| IOT132 |	Me too
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,208	| IOT132 |	Will let you know
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,232	| IOT132 |	All right
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,256	| IOT132 |	Driverless Tech
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:36,704	| IOT132 |	So this is just a quick news item because we know the alphabet has its way more division for self-driving cars information says that
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:40,544	| IOT132 |	So is getting ready to bring driverless taxis
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:42,848	| IOT132 |	Resume actually in Arizona
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:47,200	| IOT132 |	Specifically I think they're looking at the Chandler area which is a southern suburb of
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:50,016	| IOT132 |	Phoenix they're having some issues right now
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,064	| IOT132 |	In that the cars are struggling with left
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:58,208	| IOT132 |	Turns and not every intersection has the left
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,328	| IOT132 |	Yeah gonna make it
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,888	| IOT132 |	Obviously I've always made it but you never know
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,192	| IOT132 |	So they're looking at doing this in the Phoenix suburb
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,752	| IOT132 |	Actually saw these
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:14,592	| IOT132 |	When I was out in Scottsdale Arizona and back twice in one day I saw
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,128	| IOT132 |	Self-driving waymo car
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:20,736	| IOT132 |	We're at visiting ASU so they've been trying this for a while and
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:26,112	| IOT132 |	Arizona's pretty light on regulations with self-driving cars
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| IOT132 |	Testing and
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,464	| IOT132 |	I guess implementing an actual business model
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:34,048	| IOT132 |	Taxi so I'm sure the Lyft and Uber drivers are not happy
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,584	| IOT132 |	Because they won't be needed
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:41,216	| IOT132 |	It'll be interesting to see if people actually take WeMo up on these when they don't become available in the very near future
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,264	| IOT132 |	I would
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,032	| IOT132 |	Yep
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,824	| IOT132 |	Courseware are freaks
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,616	| IOT132 |	I mean if we think about what we've done to our houses
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:49,920	| IOT132 |	Just by virtue of
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,504	| IOT132 |	We're out there
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,528	| IOT132 |	All right
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,552	| IOT132 |	Let's take
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:58,880	| IOT132 |	A voicemail from RI
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,952	| IOT132 |	Kevin

EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,384	| IOT132 |	Kevin Kevin
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| IOT132 |	So this week
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,456	| IOT132 |	We have a question
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,480	| IOT132 |	From Charles
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,016	| IOT132 |	Sacramento about
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,344	| IOT132 |	Hey Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:32,672	| IOT132 |	Charleston Sacramento it's okay to use my message
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,952	| IOT132 |	On the podcast
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,720	| IOT132 |	Thanks again
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:36,256	| IOT132 |	For this wonderful podcast
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| IOT132 |	You guys make
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,072	| IOT132 |	And the one question I had is
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,096	| IOT132 |	Withhold
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:41,888	| IOT132 |	Switches
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,472	| IOT132 |	Are all home get approved
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,240	| IOT132 |	Switches
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,288	| IOT132 |	Controllable when you're away from
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,056	| IOT132 |	From the house
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,080	| IOT132 |	Thanks for
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,360	| IOT132 |	Taking the question
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,384	| IOT132 |	And have a wonderful day
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,992	| IOT132 |	Oh alright Charles this is a great question I bet a lot of people wonder this
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,016	| IOT132 |	And the answer is
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,624	| IOT132 |	Remote access to any homekit
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| IOT132 |	Devices
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,416	| IOT132 |	You have to have one
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,952	| IOT132 |	Thanks either
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,232	| IOT132 |	An Apple TV
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,024	| IOT132 |	Or an Apple iPad
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,840	| IOT132 |	And I think it has to be running what does it have to run Kevin
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:14,400	| IOT132 |	IOS 10.3 or later
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,192	| IOT132 |	On an iPad
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:22,592	| IOT132 |	I do not know what the Apple TV version is but I do know that the Apple TV must be
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| IOT132 |	Duration
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,384	| IOT132 |	Better
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,432	| IOT132 |	Which is the most recent one
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:32,320	| IOT132 |	So you have to have one of those things you also have to enable in this is actually where I got tripped up at first on my
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,648	| IOT132 |	Annotation iCloud
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| IOT132 |	The kitchen
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,952	| IOT132 |	And you
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,976	| IOT132 |	For example
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:43,328	| IOT132 |	The iPads are using as somebody else's iPad your going to have to
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,608	| IOT132 |	So
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,632	| IOT132 |	That iPad
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,400	| IOT132 |	Can talk to
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:46,912	| IOT132 |	Like your device
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:50,240	| IOT132 |	So that's a little wrinkled are once you get all that set up though
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:51,264	| IOT132 |	It works like a charm
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,800	| IOT132 |	And
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,848	| IOT132 |	You probably don't want this to be an iPad that your
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,872	| IOT132 |	Your kids play with
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,408	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:27:01,248	| IOT132 |	You have to leave it on all the time and you're going to want to leave it plugged in most of the time
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:05,088	| IOT132 |	Obviously, Apple TV is for most people
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:11,232	| IOT132 |	What purpose would be plugged in all the time it might be in sleep mode but it's still on for all intensive purposes
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:14,816	| IOT132 |	If you shut it off and that's your gateway to your home kit
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:21,216	| IOT132 |	You can't remotely access because the Gateway is effectively down so you can leave that iPad
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,496	| IOT132 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:26,080	| IOT132 |	So this is all done through the iCloud
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,360	| IOT132 |	Account
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,152	| IOT132 |	That's what ties all this together
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:31,968	| IOT132 |	And then again yes iPad must be powered on
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:35,808	| IOT132 |	All right so suggest about switches I just thought I'd throw in a
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,624	| IOT132 |	Couple quick switches so because
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,648	| IOT132 |	I have tested mosto
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:41,440	| IOT132 |	Thought
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:43,744	| IOT132 |	So if you're going to do a home kit
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,256	| IOT132 |	Installation
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,584	| IOT132 |	Want to swap out some switches I still love
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,352	| IOT132 |	Lutron
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,376	| IOT132 |	They have a bridge can
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,424	| IOT132 |	The bridge
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,448	| IOT132 |	It's 80 bucks
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,728	| IOT132 |	Turn on the switches which are
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,056	| IOT132 |	I think they're perfect r65
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:59,872	| IOT132 |	Are between 65 to 10
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,664	| IOT132 |	And if you can buy some
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,968	| IOT132 |	So that's my
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,016	| IOT132 |	Favorite but if you hate the Hub
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,040	| IOT132 |	Which people do
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,576	| IOT132 |	Spell. Oeave
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,112	| IOT132 |	Oak snake
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,672	| IOT132 |	Switch it is only on off it is not a dimmer
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,720	| IOT132 |	Lutron that is $50
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,768	| IOT132 |	Actually works with Bluetooth
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:19,328	| IOT132 |	Capacitive touch screen I tested it
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,864	| IOT132 |	I found it a little
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,400	| IOT132 |	There was sometimes
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,424	| IOT132 |	Possibly because
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,960	| IOT132 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:28,032	| IOT132 |	All in all I thought it was beautiful it was very pretty
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT132 |	And it were
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,336	| IOT132 |	So that's that
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,128	| IOT132 |	Idevices makes a dimmer
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:34,176	| IOT132 |	Or a switch so you could buy either on or off
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:37,760	| IOT132 |	Where the dimmer functionality for a hundred bucks I haven't helped
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:42,368	| IOT132 |	But I devices is worth noting because they have a Bluetooth based
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:44,672	| IOT132 |	Kemper remote switch that you can actually use
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,952	| IOT132 |	Three way
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,720	| IOT132 |	Lights
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:49,280	| IOT132 |	I don't think anybody else can use theirs for 3
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,912	| IOT132 |	So keep that in mind there and then Levitan
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,728	| IOT132 |	Makes a Decora iOS switch that you
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:01,056	| IOT132 |	That's actually $50 for the gym
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:02,848	| IOT132 |	I think it's 65 for
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:04,896	| IOT132 |	I don't love
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,200	| IOT132 |	Without switch
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:07,712	| IOT132 |	It's
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:11,552	| IOT132 |	Kind of feels sticky when you toggle it and then the dimming function
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:14,112	| IOT132 |	Is a tiny little knob on the side that
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:14,880	| IOT132 |	Just doesn't do it
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:17,952	| IOT132 |	Switch ratings
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:22,048	| IOT132 |	I have not tried any homekit switches although based on
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,072	| IOT132 |	Charles is questioning
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,120	| IOT132 |	Probably should so I can
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,888	| IOT132 |	Do that
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:27,936	| IOT132 |	Go grab ones I think the Leviton Maybe
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:29,984	| IOT132 |	I'll send you something
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,056	| IOT132 |	Okay okay
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:35,360	| IOT132 |	That is the news this
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,152	| IOT132 |	Weak but stay tuned
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,432	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,992	| IOT132 |	Yodit Stanton
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT132 |	Talking about
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,576	| IOT132 |	How to build out a scalable sensor Network
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,136	| IOT132 |	A lot of these things felt
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:49,952	| IOT132 |	How do I common sense but there were a couple of them
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,720	| IOT132 |	I would have thought of that
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:55,328	| IOT132 |	Before that you have a message for this week sponsor Qualcomm
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:30:01,728	| IOT132 |	Hey everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with the message from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:04,544	| IOT132 |	Welcome and I have Raj talluri Whois
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,568	| IOT132 |	What's the SVP
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:08,640	| IOT132 |	And GM of iot at Qualcomm
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,688	| IOT132 |	How to talk to us about the edge
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,456	| IOT132 |	And AI
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,480	| IOT132 |	Rush
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,248	| IOT132 |	What is
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,040	| IOT132 |	Edge
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,344	| IOT132 |	Post NC weather industry hasn't quite
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:21,440	| IOT132 |	Definition of the edge easiest way to think about it is the counterpart to the
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,512	| IOT132 |	Cloud this is Canada last box on the last
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:27,584	| IOT132 |	Do I spell the internet terminates in your house on an officer
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,120	| IOT132 |	And we
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,912	| IOT132 |	Typically referred to Edge computing
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,680	| IOT132 |	As a price
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:34,240	| IOT132 |	Testing and Analysis that's done on this last
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:37,056	| IOT132 |	Devices so that they're much closer to where the sensor
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,128	| IOT132 |	What are the benefits of Edgecomb
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,920	| IOT132 |	What is Qualcomm doing there
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:44,736	| IOT132 |	What's the benefits of computing something at the edges
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,784	| IOT132 |	You know when you have a product that's connect
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,552	| IOT132 |	Think of the clouds
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:49,344	| IOT132 |	You can't usually wait
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,624	| IOT132 |	For a long time
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,672	| IOT132 |	Information to the go to the cloud and come back
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,208	| IOT132 |	Turn your computer on the edge
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,488	| IOT132 |	You know you got much shorter later
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:31:02,400	| IOT132 |	How to make X users don't want to send all the information to the clouds like for example if you had a camera that's in your house
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,960	| IOT132 |	Depressing locally and not send all that with you in for
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:08,544	| IOT132 |	Back into the clouds that's another advantage of crossing a ditch
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,848	| IOT132 |	And lastly it reduces
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:13,152	| IOT132 |	The total cost
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,968	| IOT132 |	Because sometimes starting all this video and I don't
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:17,248	| IOT132 |	Information on the cloud cost a lot of
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:19,296	| IOT132 |	What is qualcomm's roll
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:23,648	| IOT132 |	Easter think ahead of this kind of problems and make
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:26,976	| IOT132 |	Chips that have a lot of processing can really in them
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:30,816	| IOT132 |	So that we can do things like artificial intelligence and machine learning and
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,584	| IOT132 |	Camouflage
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,120	| IOT132 |	On this Edge devices
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,912	| IOT132 |	So the customers can take advantage of
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:38,496	| IOT132 |	Can you maybe give me an example of a consumer product
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,264	| IOT132 |	That uses Edge computer
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:42,848	| IOT132 |	Yes I recently one of our customers Nest launch
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,152	| IOT132 |	The camera and discounted Ugg a lot of Frost
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,920	| IOT132 |	Sing at the edge
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:46,688	| IOT132 |	For example
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:50,016	| IOT132 |	Discount on looks for things like motion listens to
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:54,368	| IOT132 |	It just sounds like a crash up a window breaking I think like that
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,136	| IOT132 |	And then
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:58,208	| IOT132 |	You know you sent a message back with another 20
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,488	| IOT132 |	Things happen also
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,768	| IOT132 |	It's going to look nice
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:06,912	| IOT132 |	If your family members are the ones that came with your house then it doesn't send you an alert what's this someone who's not
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,448	| IOT132 |	Houston to San Diego
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,984	| IOT132 |	Daddy's doing a lot of process
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,008	| IOT132 |	Sitting at the edge
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,288	| IOT132 |	Do give intelligent
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:16,640	| IOT132 |	This sounds great so we're can listeners learn more and get started using caulk
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,432	| IOT132 |	Sportage computer
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:24,576	| IOT132 |	Go to qualcomm.com Coyote and get a lot more information about Edge computing
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:38,400	| IOT132 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest

EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,808	| IOT132 |	You are here this week
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:56,832	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:59,648	| IOT132 |	You have built actual sensor Networks
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,464	| IOT132 |	Know how to do this
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:04,000	| IOT132 |	Tell us a little bit about your history
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,816	| IOT132 |	Yeah sure is so
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,096	| IOT132 |	I guess my history
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:12,704	| IOT132 |	Music careers
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,984	| IOT132 |	Muslim time
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,288	| IOT132 |	Manchester United
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,568	| IOT132 |	Came from.
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:23,968	| IOT132 |	What happens when the whole everything physical
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,528	| IOT132 |	Has been around for about three years
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,552	| IOT132 |	Started as
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,600	| IOT132 |	Pretty much a community project
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:36,000	| IOT132 |	I started publishing
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:38,048	| IOT132 |	Name of thing in an organization in business
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,584	| IOT132 |	So we kind of came
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,864	| IOT132 |	From the environment
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:46,752	| IOT132 |	Need nowadays we focus on helping people to Troy
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,056	| IOT132 |	Manage
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:49,824	| IOT132 |	Switches
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:53,920	| IOT132 |	Start
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,200	| IOT132 |	Category
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,088	| IOT132 |	Buildings mostly
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,440	| IOT132 |	A bit about what you guys do
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,464	| IOT132 |	What you've learned
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,768	| IOT132 |	Deploying sensors and environmental
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:12,096	| IOT132 |	Air quality sensors in buildings
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:13,120	| IOT132 |	Play all kinds of
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:18,752	| IOT132 |	You have said if someone calls you hey
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:20,288	| IOT132 |	Give me a price
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,312	| IOT132 |	Is customer
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,080	| IOT132 |	Prayer for us
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,616	| IOT132 |	Talk to me about what you're trying to
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,408	| IOT132 |	To get to when someone calls you up
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,176	| IOT132 |	How should people be
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:26,944	| IOT132 |	Be thinking
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,456	| IOT132 |	About
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,784	| IOT132 |	There's a lot of hype and froth around.
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,832	| IOT132 |	It is very cool
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:35,392	| IOT132 |	But when you're investing rs 50000
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:38,976	| IOT132 |	You know what that has to be clear
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:41,024	| IOT132 |	What are you going to do what is the value of thought
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:44,864	| IOT132 |	Even like $10 percent
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:49,472	| IOT132 |	And this year investing people kind of stupid
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:50,752	| IOT132 |	That's not a trivial thing
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| IOT132 |	To do
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,336	| IOT132 |	First question is actually like what is about
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:35:01,504	| IOT132 |	How does that change what you do now so beautiful commercial projects is really like how does it make
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:06,880	| IOT132 |	Ferocity how does it make you more efficient and I think there's a lot of inefficiency
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,904	| IOT132 |	That are hot
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,976	| IOT132 |	And the physical world
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,280	| IOT132 |	Trade-offs Roi
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,328	| IOT132 |	So the second question is do you really need
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,352	| IOT132 |	50000
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:20,192	| IOT132 |	People have some other dataset
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,776	| IOT132 |	The weather information can we use that exist Within
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,336	| IOT132 |	And then layer the sensor data over
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| IOT132 |	Business
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,456	| IOT132 |	You know it doesn't really make sense
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,480	| IOT132 |	2
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,760	| IOT132 |	Always keep the train
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:37,088	| IOT132 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,880	| IOT132 |	Can you give me an example of something
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:42,976	| IOT132 |	So wooden buildings
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,768	| IOT132 |	Already some sort of
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,840	| IOT132 |	Temperature sensor
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,888	| IOT132 |	Actually happened instruments
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,960	| IOT132 |	You see what happened
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:59,616	| IOT132 |	Maybe the landlord has access to it
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,640	| IOT132 |	They might have life
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:08,320	| IOT132 |	When people come in and out and so this already
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,856	| IOT132 |	I'm making a little bit of
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,720	| IOT132 |	Supplementing What's missing
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:16,256	| IOT132 |	With the sensors
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,280	| IOT132 |	Is probably like
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:17,792	| IOT132 |	The right thing
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,632	| IOT132 |	So it sounds like so far first I need to clear
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,656	| IOT132 |	Yusuke Circle
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,288	| IOT132 |	Then I've got to think about
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,568	| IOT132 |	What resources
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,592	| IOT132 |	Already have
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,872	| IOT132 |	4M like
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:33,408	| IOT132 |	Yes
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,968	| IOT132 |	And then when you read it
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,016	| IOT132 |	Actually like thing around
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:43,648	| IOT132 |	Like one small control site
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,976	| IOT132 |	Just a few sensors
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:50,048	| IOT132 |	Initially we tested
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:54,912	| IOT132 |	Sui generis
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,728	| IOT132 |	Depakote to walk across it
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,640	| IOT132 |	He's such a huge deal
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,944	| IOT132 |	Verifying
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,712	| IOT132 |	The information
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:12,576	| IOT132 |	With five sensors 10 sensors or whatever saves you so much headache
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:17,952	| IOT132 |	Because that's so everyone
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,768	| IOT132 |	I'm going to test elasticsearch
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:23,840	| IOT132 |	Cats cats cats
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,168	| IOT132 |	Testing
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,192	| IOT132 |	Independently
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:28,704	| IOT132 |	Verifying
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:32,288	| IOT132 |	Do you do that to expect my consultant
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:32,800	| IOT132 |	Firing someone
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,616	| IOT132 |	We do that a lot
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:36,640	| IOT132 |	So there is
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,920	| IOT132 |	A number of
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,688	| IOT132 |	Things we test
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:44,064	| IOT132 |	One is the data quality like
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:47,392	| IOT132 |	Another
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:55,840	| IOT132 |	The difference of your testing weather
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:56,864	| IOT132 |	Is sampling
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:00,192	| IOT132 |	Parts per billion
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:01,472	| IOT132 |	Doing obvious changes
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:05,824	| IOT132 |	People breathe on a air quality
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:09,152	| IOT132 |	And you see the CO2 readings go up and so forth
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:13,760	| IOT132 |	Is not like a defined way because they're so many variables for the day
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:14,784	| IOT132 |	One thing she's next
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,832	| IOT132 |	Does it say
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:19,136	| IOT132 |	In terms of if it's like Nora certified
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,440	| IOT132 |	Or Plainville organic
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:24,256	| IOT132 |	Does it actually perform in the way that you expect
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,840	| IOT132 |	Does a join in a correct way
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:29,376	| IOT132 |	You know what happens when
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:34,240	| IOT132 |	Gateway goes down
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:38,336	| IOT132 |	Because this matters because
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:42,688	| IOT132 |	To go down and then there's other stuff which is a little bit more nebulous around
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,736	| IOT132 |	Battery life
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,040	| IOT132 |	So does it it's a real
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,600	| IOT132 |	Live performance
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:52,160	| IOT132 |	Kind of confirming the specs versus the
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,720	| IOT132 |	Let's talk about this
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,000	| IOT132 |	Concept of scale
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:56,512	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:57,536	| IOT132 |	People don't
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:03,168	| IOT132 |	I feel like people are like
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:06,240	| IOT132 |	How many sensors can I put on a single Gateway soda
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,008	| IOT132 |	405
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:09,056	| IOT132 |	But they don't think about it
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:10,848	| IOT132 |	The boring stuff
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:12,128	| IOT132 |	What configuration management
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,432	| IOT132 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:16,480	| IOT132 |	Even something as simple as
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:17,504	| IOT132 |	The Personnel cost
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:19,040	| IOT132 |	Flying sensors
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:21,600	| IOT132 |	When we start talking about operating the sort of
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,624	| IOT132 |	Infrastructure at scale
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,648	| IOT132 |	How should we think
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:27,744	| IOT132 |	There's two sides does the deployment cost
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:33,888	| IOT132 |	Of the personal and the maintenance cost like how much is it going to cost me and how many times do I have to get the battery change
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,936	| IOT132 |	You know in a given year
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,496	| IOT132 |	What we had
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,776	| IOT132 |	To do
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,944	| IOT132 |	Training programs for
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:49,248	| IOT132 |	Facilities manager
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,344	| IOT132 |	3D abstract away the
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,952	| IOT132 |	So our aim is to get the sensor install time
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:59,232	| IOT132 |	Down to
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,256	| IOT132 |	Around 30 seconds
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,280	| IOT132 |	And I think
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:05,632	| IOT132 |	The last assignment we got to round 20 seconds but I'm not
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:10,752	| IOT132 |	Counting my chickens
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:14,080	| IOT132 |	Somebody's going to have to physically take a Gateway put it all
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,664	| IOT132 |	Way to know at work
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,432	| IOT132 |	Because they're not
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,736	| IOT132 |	Software engineer
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,784	| IOT132 |	That are going to be the joint
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,624	| IOT132 |	Support
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,904	| IOT132 |	And training
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:28,928	| IOT132 |	Software
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,720	| IOT132 |	The people need to know this kind of
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,744	| IOT132 |	Make these projects
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:38,144	| IOT132 |	Because myself eating house like the health and safety certificates to be able to go up on a roof
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,448	| IOT132 |	But I think
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:45,312	| IOT132 |	The IRT from my perspective is going to be much more operational facing them
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:48,384	| IOT132 |	So you really need to be able to
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,944	| IOT132 |	The operations guys your friend
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,552	| IOT132 |	Deployment size
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,832	| IOT132 |	And it's a lot of detail
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,672	| IOT132 |	So we have to upload things like the drawings in the schematics of build
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,048	| IOT132 |	Next
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:11,168	| IOT132 |	If you don't know if a sensor is
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:13,984	| IOT132 |	Go badly wrong
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:19,104	| IOT132 |	Moschino that needs device ID once in a particular corner
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,640	| IOT132 |	The interface is that
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,688	| IOT132 |	Triple-A batteries
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:26,272	| IOT132 |	Country Queen to Real by through other than people trying to figure out
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:28,064	| IOT132 |	Clients are getting
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:32,416	| IOT132 |	Looks like PCS on phones in my mind
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:38,048	| IOT132 |	Expense because who hasn't run around their house at like 6 in the morning are actually more like 2 in the
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:40,864	| IOT132 |	Are smoke detectors going off and they're like
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:42,912	| IOT132 |	Standing in front of one going at this one
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:45,728	| IOT132 |	CNN
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:47,264	| IOT132 |	Going to the next one until you find it
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:51,360	| IOT132 |	Celtic Women in a giant building with sensors
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:51,872	| IOT132 |	Need a battery check
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,431	| IOT132 |	Where can I find this
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:54,943	| IOT132 |	Let me just look it up
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:58,271	| IOT132 |	Rather ideally when I get a notification of a battery go
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:41:59,807	| IOT132 |	It's like
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,575	| IOT132 |	It's this one right
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:03,903	| IOT132 |	Right ear and then think of this scale
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:06,463	| IOT132 |	Where it's usually not going to be in one
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:12,095	| IOT132 |	Location is going to be most of our clients have multiple kind of in different countries
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:16,959	| IOT132 |	So really challenging
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:17,727	| IOT132 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,519	| IOT132 |	It is that custom
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:22,079	| IOT132 |	For every client because that feels like
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,359	| IOT132 |	Seeing a scale that
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:26,175	| IOT132 |	For any of this just
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,199	| IOT132 |	Can't scale yet
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,223	| IOT132 |	Because it's just
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,247	| IOT132 |	It's too custom
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:31,551	| IOT132 |	I mean that's all we had
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:36,671	| IOT132 |	The decisions that we made around what problems do we end up solving
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,951	| IOT132 |	Rainy drawings
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,719	| IOT132 |	Dockside
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,535	| IOT132 |	How to do stuffed crust
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,303	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:43,839	| IOT132 |	The cost just goes out of
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:46,655	| IOT132 |	Also
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:49,471	| IOT132 |	You know we focus on buildings asset mantri environment
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:50,495	| IOT132 |	You know how to do this
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,287	| IOT132 |	In a repeatable way
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:05,343	| IOT132 |	That's for me the realization.
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,879	| IOT132 |	A lot of variety players are going to
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,415	| IOT132 |	Define themselves
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,743	| IOT132 |	Just pick a vertical
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,535	| IOT132 |	Make it work without vertical
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:16,351	| IOT132 |	We know exactly what to do
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:17,887	| IOT132 |	Boiler Room
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:19,679	| IOT132 |	Factory
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:27,103	| IOT132 |	Northam Healthcare application or widen of the other million and one things that people are doing
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,639	| IOT132 |	So where can you stay
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,431	| IOT132 |	Let's think about
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:32,223	| IOT132 |	Like what kind of Technology
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:33,247	| IOT132 |	Have you guys develops
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,295	| IOT132 |	Actually helps you streamline
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,319	| IOT132 |	What matters for
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:36,831	| IOT132 |	Making these
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,647	| IOT132 |	Hundreds of sensors
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,159	| IOT132 |	Thousands
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| IOT132 |	It's really been about
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:44,767	| IOT132 |	The deployment
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,327	| IOT132 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,631	| IOT132 |	So I mean
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,679	| IOT132 |	What the Ensign ends up saying is
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:54,239	| IOT132 |	Considerations in analytics and they're like
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:57,311	| IOT132 |	The effort
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:44:01,151	| IOT132 |	That we put in around
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,687	| IOT132 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:03,455	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:06,271	| IOT132 |	It is just me or even for
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:07,807	| IOT132 |	End up doing 20
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,623	| IOT132 |	Really hard tonight
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:12,159	| IOT132 |	When you got so many moving
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:15,999	| IOT132 |	And so we've taken
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:18,815	| IOT132 |	Should be people that have
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,607	| IOT132 |	Deployed you know these
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:23,423	| IOT132 |	The old phones and PCs
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,983	| IOT132 |	The 90s and early 2000s
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,895	| IOT132 |	Super streamline
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:35,967	| IOT132 |	We need the drawings in the schematics of
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:39,039	| IOT132 |	The floor and we're going to kind of Sanju
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,831	| IOT132 |	Set register's office
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:41,855	| IOT132 |	The project is done
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:46,719	| IOT132 |	Life
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:51,327	| IOT132 |	Because that status information you should be able to look at
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:53,119	| IOT132 |	Battery status
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,703	| IOT132 |	That's integrated into your slide
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:58,751	| IOT132 |	Or you're going to hell
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,335	| IOT132 |	Comes from experience
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:08,735	| IOT132 |	Because I need to head line items for iot
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:09,247	| IOT132 |	Super hard
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:15,647	| IOT132 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:18,463	| IOT132 |	Who is going to be doing this and there's two reason
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,023	| IOT132 |	You mention this is operational
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,071	| IOT132 |	Operationally focused
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:26,143	| IOT132 |	But then there's also the concept of how to
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:29,215	| IOT132 |	Network and security sensors that
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,495	| IOT132 |	Becomes maybe relevant
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,263	| IOT132 |	Pick 4 SC
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:34,847	| IOT132 |	Or anxiety side so I'm very curious
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,383	| IOT132 |	How we should be thinking about Mary
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:37,407	| IOT132 |	Those two things
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,479	| IOT132 |	Yeah for sure so funny stories in the early days
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:44,831	| IOT132 |	Using kind of short-range rf4 stuff that connects to the
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:48,927	| IOT132 |	What we had was
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:49,695	| IOT132 |	What is
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:53,023	| IOT132 |	Like are you serious you want to have like
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,559	| IOT132 |	1000 sensors
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:56,607	| IOT132 |	Connect to the human network does not never going to
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:59,167	| IOT132 |	So it has been
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:00,447	| IOT132 |	Interlock
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:03,775	| IOT132 |	At least four 2017 something like 60 or 70%
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:07,615	| IOT132 |	So what Laura gives yuan standalone
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:11,199	| IOT132 |	Gateway has a
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,991	| IOT132 |	We have furniture
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,527	| IOT132 |	A couple of tacos
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:16,319	| IOT132 |	Remotely manage the Gateway
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:17,343	| IOT132 |	Defense
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:20,415	| IOT132 |	So that's kind of a private Network.
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:21,695	| IOT132 |	Basic workouts
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:23,487	| IOT132 |	Everything else
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,327	| IOT132 |	Probably much more
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:28,607	| IOT132 |	Common
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,887	| IOT132 |	Now you might have
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:33,215	| IOT132 |	A situation where the sensors talk to some monitors
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,239	| IOT132 |	Laura net worth
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:38,079	| IOT132 |	Fox network Whatever Bud like you know you can have the human hour
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:44,735	| IOT132 |	These sensors cuz security
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:45,503	| IOT132 |	It's just a nightmare
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,111	| IOT132 |	I suppose built-in security
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:51,391	| IOT132 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:55,487	| IOT132 |	Keys and all that kind of stuff so you can
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:56,511	| IOT132 |	Elise
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:58,303	| IOT132 |	Take steps to war
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,583	| IOT132 |	It is secure
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:02,655	| IOT132 |	Well even if you've created the separate
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:05,983	| IOT132 |	Network so it might be Laura it could be a season
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,799	| IOT132 |	All your devices eventually something
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:09,311	| IOT132 |	Costume
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,591	| IOT132 |	Talk to it
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:14,687	| IOT132 |	Information has to hop from one network to another and maybe it's over
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,967	| IOT132 |	Gold and that's more secure
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:17,759	| IOT132 |	Kind of seems like
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:20,319	| IOT132 |	That's going to be a really interesting area
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:21,855	| IOT132 |	Pay attention to
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:22,367	| IOT132 |	Yes
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,951	| IOT132 |	Perspective I think the way I look at
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:27,231	| IOT132 |	Securities
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:30,559	| IOT132 |	A friend of mine
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,327	| IOT132 |	Describes
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:37,983	| IOT132 |	The way she describes it as you look at security
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:39,007	| IOT132 |	There's mold
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:44,383	| IOT132 |	The different elements
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,663	| IOT132 |	The layer between
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:52,319	| IOT132 |	The unnoticed the sensor to the Gateway and that would be appropriate security like for fedora
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:56,671	| IOT132 |	You'll have more than one day
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:48:00,511	| IOT132 |	And then you have stayed over between
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:02,815	| IOT132 |	Gateway's for example
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:04,351	| IOT132 |	Those gateways behind
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,631	| IOT132 |	And then
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:07,935	| IOT132 |	There's a security from the gateway to
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,847	| IOT132 |	One appropriate
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:18,175	| IOT132 |	Suppose that industry wire Industries not having
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:19,199	| IOT132 |	The conversations of
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:22,015	| IOT132 |	The best practice
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:25,087	| IOT132 |	Just because I see people doing
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,111	| IOT132 |	Funny things
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:28,671	| IOT132 |	Approach to security
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:33,023	| IOT132 |	Could these layers are correlated are they industry-related are they
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:35,327	| IOT132 |	Sensor
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:37,631	| IOT132 |	The way I look at it is
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:41,471	| IOT132 |	Sofa Laura for example where so their teeth
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:47,871	| IOT132 |	And you're not necessarily Reinventing
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:50,431	| IOT132 |	Create like the running joke
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:52,991	| IOT132 |	Somebody trying to roll their own crypto wishes
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:53,759	| IOT132 |	AB really bother
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:56,575	| IOT132 |	There is a consideration of
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:58,367	| IOT132 |	You know how much memory is done this
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:00,927	| IOT132 |	Like what is the
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,951	| IOT132 |	Worst-case.
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:03,999	| IOT132 |	Maybe they can get
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:05,791	| IOT132 |	Access to
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:06,815	| IOT132 |	Doxycycline
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:11,167	| IOT132 |	Answers I mean
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:11,679	| IOT132 |	Access to the
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:22,943	| IOT132 |	Then on the Gateway level is again
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:24,479	| IOT132 |	What is atopy
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,111	| IOT132 |	In your mind
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:32,671	| IOT132 |	Architect sing Against what is possible
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:34,463	| IOT132 |	And how people are going to
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:35,999	| IOT132 |	Lesser interfere with it
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:38,047	| IOT132 |	Alissa Hopkins
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:39,327	| IOT132 |	More sensitive it is
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:42,911	| IOT132 |	Put in a lot more effort around
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:46,495	| IOT132 |	Tamper proofing like people can manually touch it
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:52,127	| IOT132 |	Is Larry's but it was appropriate there is based of what is going to be gone
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:49:59,295	| IOT132 |	Security stocks I can cover all these use cases
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:00,831	| IOT132 |	What's a wearable just very different
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:03,903	| IOT132 |	Architecture
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:10,047	| IOT132 |	Because
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:11,839	| IOT132 |	People just one
EDL	00:50:11,839	00:50:13,119	| IOT132 |	That's a bracelet or something
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:20,543	| IOT132 |	To a very dumb sensor last
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:22,079	| IOT132 |	10 to $20
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:32,063	| IOT132 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show this week thank you very much
