EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,968	| IOT092 |	After 10 years I took a hiatus
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:02:00,832	| IOT092 |	So how are you holding up
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:05,696	| IOT092 |	I'm missing it a little bit missing the peeps I'm missing the the town and all the cool gadgets
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:07,488	| IOT092 |	And there are
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,256	| IOT092 |	Are so many cool Gadget
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,584	| IOT092 |	I have seen so much stuff so I have
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,608	| IOT092 |	Connected hairbrush
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,120	| IOT092 |	Toothbrushes
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,912	| IOT092 |	Scooters
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:17,472	| IOT092 |	Space heaters that are powered by CPUs that
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:21,056	| IOT092 |	Actually felt the compute power from them
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| IOT092 |	Icing
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,360	| IOT092 |	Car stuff I've seen
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,896	| IOT092 |	Appliances that work with
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,664	| IOT092 |	The echo
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,200	| IOT092 |	I have seen
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,224	| IOT092 |	Other echoes
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,504	| IOT092 |	I've seen robots
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:30,784	| IOT092 |	Racine
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| IOT092 |	Lights
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:32,832	| IOT092 |	Always sunny
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,648	| IOT092 |	I have seen the future and it is iot
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,672	| IOT092 |	Exact
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,512	| IOT092 |	There were there actually have been many cancer
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,280	| IOT092 |	Watches
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,304	| IOT092 |	I just don't care about
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,608	| IOT092 |	Basically if you can put
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| IOT092 |	A chip in it
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,680	| IOT092 |	It exists so
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,704	| IOT092 |	Will kick it off with
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,216	| IOT092 |	Crazy stuff
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:55,360	| IOT092 |	First the craziest thing I was at CES unveiled last night which is a bunch of startups and
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,128	| IOT092 |	Keppra
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,152	| IOT092 |	Look at it
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:01,760	| IOT092 |	And the craziest thing I saw was connected
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,784	| IOT092 |	Grooming products
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,320	| IOT092 |	This is apparently a theme
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:11,232	| IOT092 |	There are connected toothbrushes and there have been for a while and I've actually tried it connected to
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:11,744	| IOT092 |	Thrush
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| IOT092 |	Colibri
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,048	| IOT092 |	Never say the name
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:17,120	| IOT092 |	Is a French company and they're making a toothbrush
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,168	| IOT092 |	But now has a i
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| IOT092 |	Help you brush better
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,800	| IOT092 |	And if you want to just come by and to macro-trends together
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,592	| IOT092 |	Iot + AI
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:30,688	| IOT092 |	It basically means that like this device is tracking all this data about you and it's
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,200	| IOT092 |	Trying to adapt
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,064	| IOT092 |	Become sentient and
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,392	| IOT092 |	Or breakfast
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:39,904	| IOT092 |	Let's hope
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,208	| IOT092 |	Monumental it's gone
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,512	| IOT092 |	This toothbrush
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,144	| IOT092 |	People that tells everything right there
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,264	| IOT092 |	I think they've had one for a while
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,080	| IOT092 |	This is $79 for this toothbrush
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,128	| IOT092 |	That's a special introductory price
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,152	| IOT092 |	130
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,224	| IOT092 |	I will tell you that there is a company that makes
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,832	| IOT092 |	A beam connected toothbrush that is actually the toothbrush as part of an insurance
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,392	| IOT092 |	So you buy your insurance
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,672	| IOT092 |	Invasive
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,208	| IOT092 |	Through beam and they send you this to
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,000	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,559	| IOT092 |	There is a business model here
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,095	| IOT092 |	I don't know if it's okay
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,607	| IOT092 |	Consumer business
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| IOT092 |	No
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,447	| IOT092 |	There you go you let you know that you're brushing have
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,727	| IOT092 |	Even more ridiculous
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,751	| IOT092 |	Kevin do you want to tell them
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:34,687	| IOT092 |	Well considering I haven't even combed my hair yet today I think yes it would be a good thing for me to talk about
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| IOT092 |	Nstemi
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| IOT092 |	But I could be wrong
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,295	| IOT092 |	People may disagree and that's fine
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,319	| IOT092 |	To me this is just
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:44,415	| IOT092 |	A classic case of let's put chips and something and Paulette smart because we can
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| IOT092 |	This is a new hairbrush
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:51,583	| IOT092 |	That is the collaboration of why things
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,119	| IOT092 |	Which is owned by Nokia
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,911	| IOT092 |	And L'Oreal
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:59,263	| IOT092 |	Which is very prominent in the personal care space
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,567	| IOT092 |	They've created a hair brush that has
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,359	| IOT092 |	Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,407	| IOT092 |	And of course it has an app
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:09,503	| IOT092 |	I'm not on the toothbrush on 50 a hairbrush rather but on your phone
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| IOT092 |	Are there sensors in the hairbrush
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:16,159	| IOT092 |	Based on the sensors and
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:21,791	| IOT092 |	The hairbrush can determine if your hair is unruly because maybe you spend a lot of time
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:26,143	| IOT092 |	Coming or brushing your hair today I can tell if your hair is damaged
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:28,959	| IOT092 |	Has breakage is dry Tangled
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,239	| IOT092 |	How do you has a microphone
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:33,055	| IOT092 |	I mean microphone accelerometer gyroscope
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:37,919	| IOT092 |	The microphone might be useful because
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,735	| IOT092 |	The hairbrush was employed as a microphone
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,247	| IOT092 |	When we did our dance
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:46,879	| IOT092 |	Yeah but it's not really there for a karaoke
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:49,951	| IOT092 |	Hear your hairbrush patterns according to
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,975	| IOT092 |	Eric Stokes
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| IOT092 |	It sounds
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,071	| IOT092 |	Interesting and interesting use of
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,863	| IOT092 |	Applying technology and sensors
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:02,751	| IOT092 |	Really do we really need that I mean this thing's going to cost I think over $200
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:03,775	| IOT092 |	As a lot of my
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,311	| IOT092 |	I will be out of
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,919	| IOT092 |	I will say the only thing the only Pro there and I wouldn't
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,967	| IOT092 |	Is my daughter has
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,735	| IOT092 |	Unruly
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:16,319	| IOT092 |	Tangled hair and I think part of that reason is cuz she doesn't always brush it
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,367	| IOT092 |	She's like me I asked
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| IOT092 |	Also because I
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,535	| IOT092 |	And she doesn't brush her hair but she needs
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,559	| IOT092 |	And
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,119	| IOT092 |	Holy cow I would love something that's like
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,655	| IOT092 |	Brush your hair
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,679	| IOT092 |	Brush your hair
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,703	| IOT092 |	And tells her
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,983	| IOT092 |	But that's about it
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:39,103	| IOT092 |	That use case makes sense to me
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,151	| IOT092 |	But I'm not even sure
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:46,783	| IOT092 |	That this will do that I think this is going to capture all the information of the brushing activity nut
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,319	| IOT092 |	Remind you
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| IOT092 |	Tooth brushing activity
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:55,487	| IOT092 |	Will insult this segues nicely into another theme that I'm seeing is seeing
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:56,767	| IOT092 |	Witches
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| IOT092 |	Data collection
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,327	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,351	| IOT092 |	Bye
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,399	| IOT092 |	Like so
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,679	| IOT092 |	L'Oreal I'm sure
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,239	| IOT092 |	I'm sure that the data they get here
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,263	| IOT092 |	From everybody's hair
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,591	| IOT092 |	Thousand times better than Market data
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| IOT092 |	Consumers
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,687	| IOT092 |	They're like
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:16,479	| IOT092 |	I can sell you the exact
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,503	| IOT092 |	Conditioner and shampoo
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,087	| IOT092 |	And that kind of ties into
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| IOT092 |	A couple other products
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,415	| IOT092 |	That we seen
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,951	| IOT092 |	Which is
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,463	| IOT092 |	There is a
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,999	| IOT092 |	Smart
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,303	| IOT092 |	Echo like device called the Aristotle
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,399	| IOT092 |	For kids and basically
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,983	| IOT092 |	It is a baby monitor you can talk to it
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,519	| IOT092 |	It also has a camera
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,311	| IOT092 |	What's interesting is its
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,847	| IOT092 |	It's designed to give
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| IOT092 |	Your baby
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,407	| IOT092 |	Let's talk with your baby a bit
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| IOT092 |	But
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:51,551	| IOT092 |	It also does things like if it's seizure child playing with a Mattel toy
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:54,111	| IOT092 |	It's going to the ideas that it will
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,647	| IOT092 |	Produce extra special effects
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,719	| IOT092 |	And then all of that data is going to go back
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT092 |	2 Mattel
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,535	| IOT092 |	So basically
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:06,143	| IOT092 |	You're spending $300 to enroll your child in the most intrusive Focus
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:13,311	| IOT092 |	Yes I know that's worth a lot to a company such as Mattel in this case
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,079	| IOT092 |	It's an
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,407	| IOT092 |	I want an easy way but it's an effective way for them to
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,687	| IOT092 |	To get
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,479	| IOT092 |	Product information on how
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,015	| IOT092 |	Kids use their products
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,831	| IOT092 |	What preferences these kids may have
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,391	| IOT092 |	And let's do some towards other products and so on
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:31,743	| IOT092 |	Yeah I mean it in a sense you this almost goes all the way back to
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:35,327	| IOT092 |	When I first started Loyalty cards reward cards in stores
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:41,215	| IOT092 |	Henry's like I always are great I get discounts on my stuff yes but you were giving up all your demands preferences
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,495	| IOT092 |	To the stores
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,543	| IOT092 |	And this is just I'll call her in a while
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,079	| IOT092 |	More modern way to do so
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| IOT092 |	Loyalty cards
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,615	| IOT092 |	2.0
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:53,759	| IOT092 |	Ana titer the same thing because it's not just happening
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,295	| IOT092 |	In your home
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,367	| IOT092 |	UnitedHealthcare has a program called UnitedHealth
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:58,879	| IOT092 |	Ocean
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,183	| IOT092 |	And what it does is it offers
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,695	| IOT092 |	Employers
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,743	| IOT092 |	Your boss basically
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:09,375	| IOT092 |	The ability to gather Fitness data and set goals for their
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:12,447	| IOT092 |	Employees like walk 10000 steps a day
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| IOT092 |	Where
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,007	| IOT092 |	Walk for 5 minutes
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,543	| IOT092 |	For 6 hours during the day
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:20,383	| IOT092 |	All of these things in the ideas of your
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:20,895	| IOT092 |	Please
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,687	| IOT092 |	Can earn up to
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:25,503	| IOT092 |	$4 a day in Lake health savings account
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,551	| IOT092 |	Money
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,623	| IOT092 |	So it be money that goes towards your age
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT092 |	HSA
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:36,255	| IOT092 |	And ideas that you know how their employees Cost-U-Less so this is a cheap way to
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,815	| IOT092 |	Can I push your employees to be a little bit
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,583	| IOT092 |	Do things that are
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| IOT092 |	Incentivizes
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:41,887	| IOT092 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:46,495	| IOT092 |	So what they've done at CES is they've done it they've allowed fitbit's
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,031	| IOT092 |	So you can bring your Fitbit
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,543	| IOT092 |	Data in
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,847	| IOT092 |	And then they also
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| IOT092 |	How to deal with Qualcomm
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| IOT092 |	Coconuts Health platform
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,199	| IOT092 |	Recalled to life
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:59,807	| IOT092 |	And there are there working with that in the program itself has been expanded to
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| IOT092 |	40 States of
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,367	| IOT092 |	12 States about a year ago
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,903	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,975	| IOT092 |	I really feel like giving all of these things
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,279	| IOT092 |	We really need to start having this
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,047	| IOT092 |	Conversation
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,583	| IOT092 |	About privacy
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,399	| IOT092 |	Is it make people aware that
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,679	| IOT092 |	Can you use these
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,703	| IOT092 |	Products right now
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,495	| IOT092 |	Your data
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,311	| IOT092 |	In most cases is going to accompany
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,615	| IOT092 |	And they're going to be using it and it's not negative
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,663	| IOT092 |	You don't know
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,455	| IOT092 |	To make a better toy
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,039	| IOT092 |	You know based on watching kids play it's not a
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,063	| IOT092 |	Bad goal
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,927	| IOT092 |	No but what worries me a little bit
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,999	| IOT092 |	Companies have been collecting data for years so that's not different
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,767	| IOT092 |	But
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| IOT092 |	In this particular case Okay so the data
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,631	| IOT092 |	Is going back to United Healthcare and that can
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,911	| IOT092 |	Save
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,215	| IOT092 |	People money because they get the credits and so on
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,495	| IOT092 |	What is the employer
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:55,359	| IOT092 |	Is getting that information to and I do not know that they are aren't I'm just thinking out loud here
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,383	| IOT092 |	And eventually
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:01,247	| IOT092 |	Templar start putting that into like job evaluations
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:05,599	| IOT092 |	Will you not as healthy as you need to be to do well in this job I'm so I may be here
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,903	| IOT092 |	Mental Fitness is down because you're not
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,927	| IOT092 |	Getting a physical fitness
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,487	| IOT092 |	I mean I don't know what I want that
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:16,607	| IOT092 |	That's a real question I have tried it guys so many times to get an HR person on the show
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,887	| IOT092 |	We talked about this
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,983	| IOT092 |	Good lucks
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,031	| IOT092 |	The HR people that I have talked to
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| IOT092 |	Art on the show
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:29,663	| IOT092 |	They said they don't want that data their company should avoid having that data
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,455	| IOT092 |	Because because of issues
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,991	| IOT092 |	But it is
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,271	| IOT092 |	At a certain point
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,039	| IOT092 |	It is like
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,087	| IOT092 |	How can we not take this
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| IOT092 |	Stata
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,647	| IOT092 |	Because it will be so
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,159	| IOT092 |	Impactful
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,463	| IOT092 |	Wrecked
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,279	| IOT092 |	And that is a big question and that's why if you
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,815	| IOT092 |	Pop supplies in there
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,607	| IOT092 |	Standards
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,655	| IOT092 |	Maybe we can
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,423	| IOT092 |	Not even open
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,471	| IOT092 |	Is there a agent that's a door that you
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,847	| IOT092 |	Maybe I'm crazy
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,407	| IOT092 |	So I don't think so
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:04,735	| IOT092 |	So there was a lot of stuff for kids
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:08,831	| IOT092 |	There's there's the curry home robot that was roaming around in that
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,367	| IOT092 |	Basically
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,903	| IOT092 |	Visually recognize your kids
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,439	| IOT092 |	Let me tell you guys
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,231	| IOT092 |	Computer vision was
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,535	| IOT092 |	Baby sister
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,095	| IOT092 |	Which is is good it's actually very helpful
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,167	| IOT092 |	Listening is with
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,727	| IOT092 |	Computer vision I mean this the camera sensors have
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,775	| IOT092 |	Incapable
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,567	| IOT092 |	Quite a while to enable this
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,871	| IOT092 |	That hasn't been issued and that it's been the
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| IOT092 |	The machine learning and the recognition
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:40,319	| IOT092 |	Are the algorithms in and sifting through the data to actually make the recognition that's been lacking and I think
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:45,183	| IOT092 |	Many companies have made great strides in the past I'll say two years on that front
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:47,487	| IOT092 |	To bring it to a defective but inexpensive level
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:53,631	| IOT092 |	Yes in this this robot which is not actually available but speed real clear it's not coming out till
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,911	| IOT092 |	Next holiday
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| IOT092 |	So that's crazy
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,703	| IOT092 |	But it's
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,007	| IOT092 |	It's $700 at 699
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:03,615	| IOT092 |	Talk to your kids reads to them at Rooms around your house looking for things that are wrong
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:14,367	| IOT092 |	Cuz this is my thing about robots I haven't seen the laundry folding robot that has been touted
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,135	| IOT092 |	Being as being
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,463	| IOT092 |	I want my robot to do more than just roll around my home
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,279	| IOT092 |	Cuz I have a dog
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,375	| IOT092 |	As I say my pets do that just fine
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,423	| IOT092 |	So that's my thought
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,287	| IOT092 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:36,127	| IOT092 |	The service provider Market with iot is getting really interesting
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,431	| IOT092 |	And we're going to talk more about this on the special
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,967	| IOT092 |	Our special edition episode
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,991	| IOT092 |	Quickly
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:44,575	| IOT092 |	Alarm.com actually has introduced something called
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,623	| IOT092 |	It's insights program and basically
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,415	| IOT092 |	Any smart devices
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:54,815	| IOT092 |	They have in your house there pulling data on it and now they can actually proactively notify you when something unusual
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,327	| IOT092 |	Happens in your eye
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,399	| IOT092 |	So an example might be
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:00,447	| IOT092 |	You know if you if you guys
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,727	| IOT092 |	During weekdays
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,239	| IOT092 |	Leave
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,031	| IOT092 |	And your house is empty
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| IOT092 |	And then the door open
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,615	| IOT092 |	Like maybe one of you forgot something
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,663	| IOT092 |	I'm back in the middle of the day
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:14,015	| IOT092 |	It's actually going to send you a notification cuz that's something weird that happened that doesn't usually happen
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,831	| IOT092 |	It takes into account weekends
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,671	| IOT092 |	Holidays that sort of thing so it sounds actually really interesting
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,463	| IOT092 |	The crazy part about the
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,559	| IOT092 |	Is there working with Qualcomm to develop a drone
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| IOT092 |	Somehow
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,655	| IOT092 |	Your house would launch the Drone
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,983	| IOT092 |	When one of these things happened so you could get a visual
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,591	| IOT092 |	That's not real insights is real
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:46,783	| IOT092 |	Interesting I don't want to see all these drones flying up out of my neighbors houses when walking the dog or something
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,807	| IOT092 |	Why won't they
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,111	| IOT092 |	Where are the Drone landing pads
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,951	| IOT092 |	That that that is like a legit question
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,975	| IOT092 |	Answer
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,535	| IOT092 |	Absolutely I don't know
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,583	| IOT092 |	Did the other thing is going back to
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:05,215	| IOT092 |	When it notices using the AI insights platform and notices something different out of the norm
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,727	| IOT092 |	I think that's
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,775	| IOT092 |	Interesting but also in a sentence
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,055	| IOT092 |	Scary
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:11,615	| IOT092 |	Because I didn't talk about Haiti Security in
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| IOT092 |	And a few seconds but
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,735	| IOT092 |	Basically it's learning the patterns of how you
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,527	| IOT092 |	Come and go from your house and
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,575	| IOT092 |	Do things in your house and so on and so forth
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| IOT092 |	And if that information gets
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,647	| IOT092 |	Use buy some
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,927	| IOT092 |	Third-party dunnuck Nino
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:27,231	| IOT092 |	Stolen or hack or whatever
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,047	| IOT092 |	That's really scary because now it's like
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,607	| IOT092 |	I know these folks you know are gone
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:36,703	| IOT092 |	Every other weekend because AI insights is telling me that some
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,983	| IOT092 |	That's kind of concerning to me
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| IOT092 |	Well yes but that's
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,823	| IOT092 |	I need the company will take
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,615	| IOT092 |	Security measures
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,383	| IOT092 |	But that
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,663	| IOT092 |	I think the challenge will be
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,479	| IOT092 |	If someone at alarm.com
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:51,551	| IOT092 |	They see that
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,343	| IOT092 |	Acme
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:53,855	| IOT092 |	Who's houses
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,159	| IOT092 |	That's a problem that alarm
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,535	| IOT092 |	People like I might
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,071	| IOT092 |	My mother-in-law never stops her
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:03,839	| IOT092 |	Newspaper because
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,607	| IOT092 |	She feels like
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,143	| IOT092 |	That person the carrier made
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:10,495	| IOT092 |	Shore shore an antibiotic cement
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:15,615	| IOT092 |	Kind of become accustomed to checking into places online anyway and telling people our whereabouts so
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,919	| IOT092 |	Without knowing the patterns you could
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,735	| IOT092 |	Look at somebody's Facebook page maybe they
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,575	| IOT092 |	Get checked into place new account they're not let me go to their house or whatever so it's
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,599	| IOT092 |	Unique
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,391	| IOT092 |	New situation it's just
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,951	| IOT092 |	I just worry about all that data on my
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,975	| IOT092 |	My living pattern
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,535	| IOT092 |	That are available in in one spot
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,095	| IOT092 |	And let's talk about the others
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,607	| IOT092 |	Security device
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:43,263	| IOT092 |	Yeah so I could swear that just one or two shows a guy said I wish the router companies would
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,103	| IOT092 |	Beef up Security on their routers to
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,639	| IOT092 |	Kind of integrate
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,175	| IOT092 |	IRT security right
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,479	| IOT092 |	Again I don't remember if I did or not if I
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,247	| IOT092 |	I should have
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:59,647	| IOT092 |	But it looks like Symantec is actually doing just that Mary have announced the Norton core
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,415	| IOT092 |	Router
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,999	| IOT092 |	Which does sort of look like a disco ball is a geodesic dome
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,535	| IOT092 |	Type of
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,303	| IOT092 |	Top shape
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,863	| IOT092 |	It has multiple USB ports
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,655	| IOT092 |	Onyx and
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:13,983	| IOT092 |	The big thing here is besides being a typical Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,495	| IOT092 |	It
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:20,127	| IOT092 |	Can protect your home basically it's kinda like the front door of all your iot devices lock
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,663	| IOT092 |	The front door and everything should be safe
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:24,991	| IOT092 |	So they're using data encryption secure DNS
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:27,295	| IOT092 |	Automatic update switches
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:29,855	| IOT092 |	T I think when it comes to iot security
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,415	| IOT092 |	He will help protect your web traffic
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:37,535	| IOT092 |	Give you warnings if there is some insecure or unsecure web traffic going through
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,815	| IOT092 |	Got parental controls
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,631	| IOT092 |	You can prioritize Wifi to devices
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,423	| IOT092 |	So it's kind of got all of the
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:46,751	| IOT092 |	Table stakes in a regular Wi-Fi router for the home
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,775	| IOT092 |	But also adds
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| IOT092 |	The
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:54,687	| IOT092 |	Ability to update in case of sick of IRT issues or web attack since on a sofa
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:18:01,343	| IOT092 |	I think it is available for pre-order now I know they just announced it but it is approved for $200
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:06,975	| IOT092 |	Which isn't too too bad and that 200 includes a 1 year subscription to their core Security Plus
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:11,071	| IOT092 |	Program for all your updates regular price is going to be $280 so
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:16,959	| IOT092 |	I'm country by cuz I don't need a new router but this is exactly what I want to say I want to see more
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:21,311	| IOT092 |	Security at the router level four but all the iot devices behind the router
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,175	| IOT092 |	Of that Nelson ways to do that in Lake
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:29,759	| IOT092 |	There are actually protocols that are like trying to do that
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,551	| IOT092 |	By limiting what devices
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:32,831	| IOT092 |	Can talk to
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,343	| IOT092 |	What other device
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:39,231	| IOT092 |	Right so that is yet another in it that's not
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,279	| IOT092 |	Either or that's kind of an addition
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,071	| IOT092 |	So another layer
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,863	| IOT092 |	Okay so
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,375	| IOT092 |	More
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,655	| IOT092 |	News
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,679	| IOT092 |	We're just going to run through
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| IOT092 |	Some crazy stuff
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,263	| IOT092 |	So speaking of security
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,311	| IOT092 |	The
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:57,151	| IOT092 |	Voice over IP phone company I don't know if you guys remember them
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:57,919	| IOT092 |	There
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,943	| IOT092 |	White terrier
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,735	| IOT092 |	They're still around doing well
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,015	| IOT092 |	I actually
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,063	| IOT092 |	My buddy and your buddy Kevin
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:08,159	| IOT092 |	Dave's that's noted a couple weeks ago that they had an SEC filing for some
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,719	| IOT092 |	And now it is out
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:14,303	| IOT092 |	It is a home monitoring service that runs on your
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,071	| IOT092 |	Hello
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:15,583	| IOT092 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,607	| IOT092 |	Service
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,399	| IOT092 |	So there's
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,447	| IOT092 |	Sensors there are
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,983	| IOT092 |	Basically just add this stuff and it's
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:26,079	| IOT092 |	Again monitored home security there's a camera with motion sensors
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| IOT092 |	And
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:30,943	| IOT092 |	You know you can just add this on it becomes like a premium service
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,759	| IOT092 |	You can add to your voice calling so it's
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,807	| IOT092 |	It's like maybe it's the new double play
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,599	| IOT092 |	Security invoice
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,879	| IOT092 |	Security of broadband
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,439	| IOT092 |	Got to get your broadband
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:46,303	| IOT092 |	If you're a subscriber I would definitely look at this because
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,119	| IOT092 |	All monitoring is $6 extra a month
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,167	| IOT092 |	And if your premier
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,703	| IOT092 |	Customer of Ooma service
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:54,751	| IOT092 |	Like
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:58,591	| IOT092 |	So they have a water sensor that's going to be $30
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,127	| IOT092 |	I have to pick up a motion sensor.
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,151	| IOT092 |	It's $35
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,687	| IOT092 |	Indoor window sensors for 25
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,223	| IOT092 |	Hope there is no video
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,527	| IOT092 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:10,111	| IOT092 |	I think this is interesting it is legit and real it can be
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,903	| IOT092 |	Out in the first quarter of this year
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:12,927	| IOT092 |	Yay
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| IOT092 |	Earthquake news
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:14,975	| IOT092 |	August
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,767	| IOT092 |	Door lock
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,279	| IOT092 |	Doorbells
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,559	| IOT092 |	Keypads
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,351	| IOT092 |	Actually now integrate with
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,887	| IOT092 |	The Logitech pop
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,911	| IOT092 |	Home switch
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,703	| IOT092 |	Andrew Logitech Harmony Home
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:28,031	| IOT092 |	You're not going to be able to unlock your doors with your voice
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,055	| IOT092 |	Guys don't try it
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| IOT092 |	But you can
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| IOT092 |	Hit the pot switch
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,943	| IOT092 |	Adorable
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,039	| IOT092 |	So if you have like a Goodnight Thing associated with your hot
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,831	| IOT092 |	Top switch now you can add your August door lock
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,367	| IOT092 |	Nice
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:49,535	| IOT092 |	So we mow has a couple of updates actually Belkin as couple updates on their WeMo line product line
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:55,679	| IOT092 |	EBay WeMo mini which is a sinner smart plug about half the size of the old WeMo switch witch
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,519	| IOT092 |	I still have two of the Insight switches and they are big and bulky
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,567	| IOT092 |	These are nice and thin
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:06,175	| IOT092 |	So you don't want you guys to have two of them plug-in dirty easily into a traditional Outlet
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:10,783	| IOT092 |	There's still a little button on there in case you don't want to use your app or use your
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,831	| IOT092 |	Voice controls if you'd be to use them
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:15,647	| IOT092 |	I think it is $35 available for
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:20,256	| IOT092 |	Pre-order now I saw an Amazon yesterday January 10th available
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,560	| IOT092 |	And it's called the WeMo Mini
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,608	| IOT092 |	Make sense cuz it's Minier
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,376	| IOT092 |	And then they all
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,936	| IOT092 |	I was going to interrupt you just to say
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,264	| IOT092 |	Tp-link has the same thing
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,032	| IOT092 |	Also works
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,800	| IOT092 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,616	| IOT092 |	Same style
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:39,456	| IOT092 |	TP Link hs105
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:42,016	| IOT092 |	People been asking me about that that it is a lovely
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,808	| IOT092 |	Spark plug and it is $40
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,672	| IOT092 |	If they're essential the same I'm going to go with the cheaper one person like a
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:51,744	| IOT092 |	They both work with my account so I'll be happy
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:58,656	| IOT092 |	Yeah and then we will also has a dimmer switch their next-generation smart dimming light switch has a night mode
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,192	| IOT092 |	Prevents heart
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,472	| IOT092 |	Harsh lights at night
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:06,848	| IOT092 |	And this also would work for with voice controls I presume so you could
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,920	| IOT092 |	You could Jim things by voice if you have
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,456	| IOT092 |	An echo which is kind of nice
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,504	| IOT092 |	Will be in stores later in
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,272	| IOT092 |	January
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,344	| IOT092 |	This is an actual wall switch that is not like a
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:20,160	| IOT092 |	Plugging kind of thing so this is something off to install I would say
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,208	| IOT092 |	Do you know what is so cool about the
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,488	| IOT092 |	Switch
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| IOT092 |	I do not
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:28,864	| IOT092 |	Exists because people have hated the fact that the WeMo light switch
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:38,080	| IOT092 |	But to it has these lovely little LED lights on it and they change color based on what type of
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:38,848	| IOT092 |	Command
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,616	| IOT092 |	Triggered it
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:44,736	| IOT092 |	So if it's a voice command it turns Aqua if it if this then that Amanda turns an amber color
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,296	| IOT092 |	And I feel like there's some other colors but
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:49,088	| IOT092 |	I love the idea
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,648	| IOT092 |	Of giving someone a visual cue
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,232	| IOT092 |	What triggered it because right now
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| IOT092 |	I have WeMo switches that
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,816	| IOT092 |	Triggered all the time by things
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:02,400	| IOT092 |	And I have no idea what you just did that
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:07,520	| IOT092 |	You know that's kind of a nice thing so if the lights come on in your room all of a sudden you're like
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,544	| IOT092 |	What just happened
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,848	| IOT092 |	You can glance over there and you'll see it
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| IOT092 |	Someone gave a voice command to her
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,224	| IOT092 |	Why is this in that recipe must have been triggered
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:20,064	| IOT092 |	So that's actually kind of a really nice
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,832	| IOT092 |	User interface
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,392	| IOT092 |	So I like that a lot
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:27,232	| IOT092 |	Did you get to see this at CES unveiled or some other I did
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,512	| IOT092 |	But I got to see it now
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:31,840	| IOT092 |	They don't know exactly when it's going to be
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,376	| IOT092 |	Out there
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,912	| IOT092 |	Expecting it sometime
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,216	| IOT092 |	Later this year I bet early this year like
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,752	| IOT092 |	The plugs are out
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,544	| IOT092 |	Real life
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,080	| IOT092 |	Or not
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:44,384	| IOT092 |	And I don't think they set pricing it for the lights
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,664	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,224	| IOT092 |	We'll wait and see but I can't wait to get my
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,760	| IOT092 |	Hot little hands
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:54,624	| IOT092 |	I'm just I'm curious cuz they mentioned using the WeMo app to custom calibrate
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,416	| IOT092 |	Four different dog types of the day
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:59,232	| IOT092 |	Talk about that or show that to you
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,792	| IOT092 |	Yeah the lighting is always wacky overs
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,096	| IOT092 |	So other quick
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:07,680	| IOT092 |	News things I'm going to find out more about this cuz it's really interesting
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,960	| IOT092 |	And I don't have any other information
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,984	| IOT092 |	Cremation with zigbee
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,032	| IOT092 |	Thread if introduced
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,336	| IOT092 |	..
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:14,848	| IOT092 |	Twitch
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:15,872	| IOT092 |	Is ridiculous
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,688	| IOT092 |	Dot-dot is going to be a
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,992	| IOT092 |	Language for smart home devices
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:21,504	| IOT092 |	Communicate
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:25,088	| IOT092 |	And I'm kind of like what is it like a protocol that
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,648	| IOT092 |	Harris would like iotivity or alljoyn
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,672	| IOT092 |	Or is it
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,184	| IOT092 |	Just
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,976	| IOT092 |	You know like profiles
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,304	| IOT092 |	Cuz it be used to have these lovely profiles that made
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,840	| IOT092 |	Trippy things not work together
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,912	| IOT092 |	Somm, Lake
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,216	| IOT092 |	I need more information I asked for it
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,496	| IOT092 |	When I get it
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,800	| IOT092 |	Update YouTube it is worth noting that this exists
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:49,152	| IOT092 |	Yeah it and I noticed in their press release they say that
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:52,480	| IOT092 |	Etsy Esther dammerung prototypes
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,528	| IOT092 |	A products that speak..
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,808	| IOT092 |	Running on top of
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,856	| IOT092 |	Ipps thread Networks
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,368	| IOT092 |	Rate
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,440	| IOT092 |	And that makes sense cuz they're being thread
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT092 |	Same radio
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:06,304	| IOT092 |	Slightly different protocols but they've been working together to get things to
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,584	| IOT092 |	Phoebe running
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,912	| IOT092 |	I can't remember is it be running over thread or thread running over
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,472	| IOT092 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,568	| IOT092 |	That's a quick thing
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,592	| IOT092 |	Keep that in mind as we
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:19,872	| IOT092 |	We'll come back to that
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,176	| IOT092 |	Other
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,480	| IOT092 |	Is going to work with SmartThings
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,504	| IOT092 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:26,784	| IOT092 |	Nice
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,904	| IOT092 |	Was just a real quick it seems like everybody is trying to make
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT092 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| IOT092 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| IOT092 |	Lenovo made an echo
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,840	| IOT092 |	How do you make an echo
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,680	| IOT092 |	Yeah but we did talk about them until 1 but then the Lenovo one
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:47,776	| IOT092 |	Which is more expensive than the traditional Native Echo
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,056	| IOT092 |	It looks like an echo to me
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,616	| IOT092 |	It's a cylinder and so on
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,152	| IOT092 |	Bass boosted the
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:56,480	| IOT092 |	The speaker capability so it's much much louder
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,576	| IOT092 |	But it's just interesting that they're trying to make an echo now and all these other people making
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| IOT092 |	Echoes by putting
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| IOT092 |	The Amazons voice service
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:06,720	| IOT092 |	Package in there and then that's even equating to
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,512	| IOT092 |	Cars with some people try to put
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| IOT092 |	Echo in cars
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,328	| IOT092 |	It is true in Rex
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,376	| IOT092 |	Which is a
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,168	| IOT092 |	Traffic prediction
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,936	| IOT092 |	Company
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,960	| IOT092 |	Out of Kirkland
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,776	| IOT092 |	Hasn't popped open car where
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| IOT092 |	There's different
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:25,152	| IOT092 |	Things you can do with open car but like finding parking spaces it's kind of like a ways
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,200	| IOT092 |	Option 2
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,480	| IOT092 |	So they have
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,296	| IOT092 |	Integrated the echo into their open car platform
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,856	| IOT092 |	The other things.
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,136	| IOT092 |	The car is it competes with
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,440	| IOT092 |	Apple's carplay and Google's
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| IOT092 |	Android
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,256	| IOT092 |	Kevin and I had a hard time finding
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,048	| IOT092 |	Things that actually use
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:42,816	| IOT092 |	Open
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| IOT092 |	Car
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,352	| IOT092 |	Porsche
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,472	| IOT092 |	Yeah push it does BMW.
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:55,104	| IOT092 |	And Volvo does but they only use the entire open car platform for everything
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:59,968	| IOT092 |	Babe BBC use a piece of that like BMW has in their I3 electric vehicle
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,272	| IOT092 |	They use in wrecks to help find
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,064	| IOT092 |	Charging places nearby and so on and so forth
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,904	| IOT092 |	But what interests seems to be trying to do is bring in
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:11,488	| IOT092 |	The echo voice Services into their platform so you could
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,280	| IOT092 |	Basically control urine
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:13,792	| IOT092 |	Infotainment
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:19,936	| IOT092 |	Through voice in a cards on which again you can do through carplay Android auto and War
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,728	| IOT092 |	Whatever car manufacturer
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,264	| IOT092 |	Uses for their own systems
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,312	| IOT092 |	But it's interesting because
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,616	| IOT092 |	Once you do that you start bringing in
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:33,504	| IOT092 |	Ways to say at home I'm going to be going to such a such place get me directions
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,040	| IOT092 |	Send it to the car and it
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,600	| IOT092 |	Will work through traps for your Echo
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,648	| IOT092 |	And then return car parts
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,952	| IOT092 |	There's a lot of possibilities here but
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,768	| IOT092 |	Again as you said Stacy we looked around we don't see a ton of
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,304	| IOT092 |	Big partners
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:49,120	| IOT092 |	Car manufacturers using the entire plateau
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,192	| IOT092 |	Because
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,240	| IOT092 |	Most of them do not want to give their data to Google
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,264	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,288	| IOT092 |	That could be
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,336	| IOT092 |	Where is everybody
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,616	| IOT092 |	I know it's
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:00,896	| IOT092 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,200	| IOT092 |	So lots of Echoes
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:03,968	| IOT092 |	What's a computer
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,248	| IOT092 |	Weird grooming
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,832	| IOT092 |	Tons of updates from our traditional smart
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,112	| IOT092 |	Companies
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,624	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:15,488	| IOT092 |	We got the Lutron SmartThings which by the way you guys have to be big for y'all
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,792	| IOT092 |	Who keep asking me about
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,328	| IOT092 |	Light switches
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,120	| IOT092 |	Because now
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,680	| IOT092 |	You can you have it yet another platform
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:26,240	| IOT092 |	Which actually means I may try to
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,800	| IOT092 |	Swap back over and not use the link platform
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,360	| IOT092 |	So we will see
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:31,872	| IOT092 |	We've got
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,152	| IOT092 |	...
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,224	| IOT092 |	Service providers doing
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,784	| IOT092 |	Security and hubs all in one
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,344	| IOT092 |	Possibly
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,112	| IOT092 |	Drone landing pads
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,696	| IOT092 |	And you know what CSS just getting started
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,280	| IOT092 |	Is
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,560	| IOT092 |	We didn't talk about this so
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:51,840	| IOT092 |	Next
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,352	| IOT092 |	Episode
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:55,168	| IOT092 |	I'm going to do a review of the stringify platform
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,472	| IOT092 |	But in case you guys want to work ahead
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,776	| IOT092 |	Stringify is like
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,544	| IOT092 |	Suspend that
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,824	| IOT092 |	But it's far more power
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:06,432	| IOT092 |	It's only been iOS I've used it on iOS and I really had a lot of fun
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:09,248	| IOT092 |	Basically connected to your gadgets and then you do this like
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,808	| IOT092 |	GUI programming thing where you're like
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:15,136	| IOT092 |	If this happens and it does
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| IOT092 |	You know
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,720	| IOT092 |	Then make this happen and you can control a lot
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:20,768	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:24,352	| IOT092 |	The news out of CES is it they just released their Android
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:25,888	| IOT092 |	Which I've been waiting for
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:26,912	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,960	| IOT092 |	Review coming next week
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:30,752	| IOT092 |	But in the meantime
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:32,544	| IOT092 |	See what you think
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,336	| IOT092 |	And I think
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,616	| IOT092 |	That's plenty
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:42,016	| IOT092 |	Yeah I take a breath catcher catch your breath because you've got lots of walking running around to do a next couple days
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,064	| IOT092 |	What to bring you guys so many cool things
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,088	| IOT092 |	Remember

EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,192	| IOT092 |	Computer space
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,472	| IOT092 |	What is it doing with iot
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,032	| IOT092 |	What cell is trying to do is focus
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:39,360	| IOT092 |	Kind of the industrial embedded Edge
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,896	| IOT092 |	Environmental economist
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| IOT092 |	Talking about
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,688	| IOT092 |	Traditional embedded
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,712	| IOT092 |	Computers that are cut
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,480	| IOT092 |	Long life
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:48,576	| IOT092 |	Rugged industrial when you think about some of the key application
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:55,232	| IOT092 |	Pacifically on that industrial side you really need something that's a little bit more rugged and robust
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,512	| IOT092 |	The kind of handle those environment
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:31:00,096	| IOT092 |	We're taking the hardware solutions that we've come out with weave
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:03,424	| IOT092 |	Come out for the entirety partner program that can really bring
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,192	| IOT092 |	Software
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:06,752	| IOT092 |	He sends to create kind of a hardware software solution
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,544	| IOT092 |	In that Industrial iot
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:11,872	| IOT092 |	You leave the sales team and your team is talking with
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,640	| IOT092 |	Customers
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,920	| IOT092 |	What do you hear from them
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:15,456	| IOT092 |	One thing that we here
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:17,504	| IOT092 |	Is there trying to figure out what they're
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:20,064	| IOT092 |	Trying to do two everybody understands iot
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,136	| IOT092 |	Teorias broader terms digital transformation
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,184	| IOT092 |	It's something that needs to be part of their focus
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,208	| IOT092 |	Some part of their strategy
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,488	| IOT092 |	Enter looking for Dal because
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,536	| IOT092 |	We do business with 98
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,328	| IOT092 |	Percent of the global Fortune 500
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,120	| IOT092 |	The really looking for us to kind of help me
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,144	| IOT092 |	Lead them down that path
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| IOT092 |	So what customers really need to see
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:38,240	| IOT092 |	Is multiple layers of Roi
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,544	| IOT092 |	Yeah one good example of that is
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,568	| IOT092 |	In high-value asset
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,360	| IOT092 |	Mining equipment
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,896	| IOT092 |	Heavy duty structural
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,456	| IOT092 |	High-cost medical equipment
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:51,808	| IOT092 |	You know in terms of like predictive maintenance they're monitoring so they're getting that information back
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,344	| IOT092 |	Which allows them
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,368	| IOT092 |	How to make better equipment
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,136	| IOT092 |	The future
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:59,232	| IOT092 |	They're also trying to understand when things are going to fail so they can provide
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,768	| IOT092 |	Better service to their customers
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,072	| IOT092 |	Suning parts
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:04,096	| IOT092 |	Before that party
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| IOT092 |	Tails
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:07,424	| IOT092 |	So what makes Dells iot Hardware unique
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,704	| IOT092 |	Versus all of the other option
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,752	| IOT092 |	What are the reasons I came
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,288	| IOT092 |	Citadel to lead this group
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:15,360	| IOT092 |	Is I really saw that there's a chance for somebody
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:16,896	| IOT092 |	Differentiated in the
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,664	| IOT092 |	Marketing
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,944	| IOT092 |	In Dallas really doing that
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,736	| IOT092 |	Speak taking their strategy around
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,016	| IOT092 |	PCS
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| IOT092 |	And brought that
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,320	| IOT092 |	Two kind of the embedded Gateway Market
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,880	| IOT092 |	Meaning that we can deliver products
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,648	| IOT092 |	And weeks
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:30,464	| IOT092 |	2 3 weeks we can deliver 3 for 500
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,256	| IOT092 |	Noah Nelson
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:35,840	| IOT092 |	Market can do that and look in iot there's a lot of lot of
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:36,864	| IOT092 |	Face type solution
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,632	| IOT092 |	She's going out there so
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,704	| IOT092 |	Somebody wins the solution they need Hardware right away
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,728	| IOT092 |	So we can do that
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:44,288	| IOT092 |	The other piece which is key is Globus
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,568	| IOT092 |	You talking about
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,592	| IOT092 |	Managing
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:47,616	| IOT092 |	Critical assets
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:50,176	| IOT092 |	If something does go down there want to be able to
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,480	| IOT092 |	Get that swapped out really quickly whether it's
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,528	| IOT092 |	Science technician or get that product really quick
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:55,552	| IOT092 |	We have that
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,344	| IOT092 |	And then I think the
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:59,648	| IOT092 |	The third area is the manageability
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,928	| IOT092 |	We're bringing that
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,952	| IOT092 |	Server
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,768	| IOT092 |	Workstation manageability that Dell has
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:05,792	| IOT092 |	Throughout its products
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:06,816	| IOT092 |	And trying to bring that too
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:07,584	| IOT092 |	To the edge
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,632	| IOT092 |	So that when people have these assets
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,168	| IOT092 |	They can actually monitor them
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:12,448	| IOT092 |	And figure out the help
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:14,496	| IOT092 |	Configure them update them all of those kind of
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:18,592	| IOT092 |	There's a couple other ones but those are really the key that are kind of differentiate ourselves in this
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,152	| IOT092 |	Where can I find out more
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:25,248	| IOT092 |	Probably the best place to go would be www.
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,016	| IOT092 |	Key partners
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:26,528	| IOT092 |	Dot-com
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:33,184	| IOT092 |	And that shows our products as well as our partner Solutions
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:38,816	| IOT092 |	Hey everyone this is Stacy and I'm coming back to you with the
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,352	| IOT092 |	Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:42,144	| IOT092 |	My guest today is Tim
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:42,912	| IOT092 |	Crawford
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:47,776	| IOT092 |	Who is a strategic advisor to cios with about 25 years
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:48,800	| IOT092 |	In the IT industry
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,104	| IOT092 |	So Tim thanks so much for coming on the show
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:56,992	| IOT092 |	Thanks Stacy for the invitation to join you today really looking forward to the conversation
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,272	| IOT092 |	Me too so
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,808	| IOT092 |	I've known him for
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:04,672	| IOT092 |	A long time I've been reading in Forever especially when I was covering cloud computing and
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,208	| IOT092 |	You're struck me as being
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,512	| IOT092 |	Very attuned to like
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:09,536	| IOT092 |	Real life
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:12,352	| IOT092 |	So we might all be over here thinking
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:14,400	| IOT092 |	Oh this is going to be awesome everything
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,936	| IOT092 |	Go to the cloud and you were like
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:17,728	| IOT092 |	Check you guys
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:22,592	| IOT092 |	Here's how it's going to have to happen and it hears what real people think so I'm hoping you can do that
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,360	| IOT092 |	With
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,640	| IOT092 |	How did the Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,152	| IOT092 |	MCI Airport
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:28,992	| IOT092 |	Yeah I'm looking forward to it I think that's
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:33,600	| IOT092 |	That's a great Segway is that you know there's a lot of great things happening
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:38,976	| IOT092 |	But I do think there is a dose of reality that we just have to stop and take a breath and
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:41,024	| IOT092 |	And recognize and respect
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,048	| IOT092 |	All right
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:45,376	| IOT092 |	RCI was coming to you asking about the internet if they
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| IOT092 |	Things yet
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,680	| IOT092 |	They absolutely are
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:51,008	| IOT092 |	But I think a lot of it comes from an educational standpoint
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:55,104	| IOT092 |	I've had a number of cios approach me and say okay I understand what
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:56,128	| IOT092 |	Iot is
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,664	| IOT092 |	From a definition standpoint
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,712	| IOT092 |	What I don't understand is
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:01,248	| IOT092 |	How can it help my business
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:02,784	| IOT092 |	How does a
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:05,600	| IOT092 |	Fit in I mean I can think of some basic things
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:07,648	| IOT092 |	Such a sensors in Telemetry but
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:11,488	| IOT092 |	I really don't understand how this works and what they're really asking is
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,280	| IOT092 |	Help me connect the dots and
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,840	| IOT092 |	And that's a theme that that I often talked about his
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:17,376	| IOT092 |	This concept of connecting the dots
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,656	| IOT092 |	But
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,936	| IOT092 |	Help me understand
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:21,472	| IOT092 |	How this solves
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,240	| IOT092 |	The business problem
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:28,384	| IOT092 |	Did it come to you like having a mandate from their board or from their CEO that says
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| IOT092 |	Hey
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,432	| IOT092 |	Go get me some of that iot
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:35,296	| IOT092 |	You know it's funny you mentioned Cloud earlier in the podcast
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,320	| IOT092 |	And I would say that
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:39,648	| IOT092 |	I have seen a number of cases where
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,416	| IOT092 |	Bored
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:42,208	| IOT092 |	Publicly traded companies
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:43,232	| IOT092 |	Have approached
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:46,048	| IOT092 |	Executive team and specifically the CIO and said
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,328	| IOT092 |	We need to do cloud
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,376	| IOT092 |	I don't think iot is there yet
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:51,424	| IOT092 |	At least I haven't seen it in Mass where
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:52,704	| IOT092 |	Executives
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:53,984	| IOT092 |	And
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,008	| IOT092 |	I would include
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,800	| IOT092 |	The board of directors of an organization in that
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:01,664	| IOT092 |	Are specifically calling out iot there's a lot of questions about it but
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,480	| IOT092 |	Not where they're calling it out saying okay we need to do this
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,272	| IOT092 |	For the most part
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,552	| IOT092 |	I would put iot
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,576	| IOT092 |	He's still in that
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,600	| IOT092 |	Experimental camp
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:14,720	| IOT092 |	So very few companies are looking at it on the hole on
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,744	| IOT092 |	I brought take
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,024	| IOT092 |	But
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,304	| IOT092 |	More so from that
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,352	| IOT092 |	Experimental or very specific
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,120	| IOT092 |	Use case
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:23,424	| IOT092 |	And do you think that's the right
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,704	| IOT092 |	Way to look at it I mean
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:27,264	| IOT092 |	I hear so much about
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,568	| IOT092 |	My coyote is business transformation
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:33,152	| IOT092 |	But you also hear kind of it feels like conflicting advice which is
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:35,712	| IOT092 |	Pick up small project
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:37,248	| IOT092 |	See if it works and then
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:43,392	| IOT092 |	Go from there basically to spread out through your business see what else you can apply that to so I'm very curious like what your
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:44,672	| IOT092 |	Tactical advice
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:48,256	| IOT092 |	Yeah this is where we have to separate the wheat
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:54,144	| IOT092 |	You know every technology becomes a business transformation opportunity
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:56,192	| IOT092 |	I've had startups that I've advised
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:58,752	| IOT092 |	That they've approached me with their pitch and their pictures
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,056	| IOT092 |	We transform businesses
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:04,128	| IOT092 |	Am I a natural reaction is without saying the words
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,664	| IOT092 |	This is basically hogwash
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,456	| IOT092 |	More
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,480	| IOT092 |	Eloquent words
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,528	| IOT092 |	And the reason for that is that
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:13,600	| IOT092 |	Turn my credibility standpoint they don't do that
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,880	| IOT092 |	I mean iot
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,672	| IOT092 |	Whether it's iot cloud
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,720	| IOT092 |	Pick your favorite
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,256	| IOT092 |	New technology
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:20,768	| IOT092 |	In itself
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,072	| IOT092 |	Doesn't do anything for you
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,376	| IOT092 |	It's how you use it
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,656	| IOT092 |	Is the differentiator
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:30,496	| IOT092 |	And so I think that's a real important distinction because
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:35,616	| IOT092 |	The company that build the iot solution whether it be an isv or consultant or
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,408	| IOT092 |	A Product Company
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,944	| IOT092 |	They don't do anything
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,992	| IOT092 |	For your business directly in fact
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,016	| IOT092 |	In many cases
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:46,368	| IOT092 |	Didn't even understand your business or if they do they don't understand the intricacies of it
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:51,488	| IOT092 |	And so that's why I think it's really really important for people to understand there is no magic bullet here
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,024	| IOT092 |	It's a partnership
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:55,584	| IOT092 |	You have to understand what tools to use
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:56,864	| IOT092 |	And then
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,912	| IOT092 |	How to appropriately apply those tools
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:03,776	| IOT092 |	And So eventually what you start to realize they're selling you on something that is
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:07,360	| IOT092 |	Not necessarily meaningful it sounds good
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:10,944	| IOT092 |	But it's not something that you can really cut a tangibly get into
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,224	| IOT092 |	And that
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:18,368	| IOT092 |	To me is a is a real problem that I see I saw it and cloud and I see it in Spades and iot right now
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,440	| IOT092 |	You've got a lot of folks selling on a promise that
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:22,720	| IOT092 |	Will never be fulfilled
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,512	| IOT092 |	Let's get into
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,560	| IOT092 |	Some of the deployments used
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:29,376	| IOT092 |	What are people doing that are successful
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:29,888	| IOT092 |	Nowadays
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,424	| IOT092 |	They're a couple of
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,960	| IOT092 |	Examples of app
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:36,800	| IOT092 |	One is where the technology hits the custom
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:42,688	| IOT092 |	The customer engagement opportunity I was having a conversation with the friend of mine who is a CIO
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,992	| IOT092 |	In retail in a retail business
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:51,648	| IOT092 |	He was asking the question about iot and how iot kind of fits in and said you know there's a great way for it to fit in in
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,160	| IOT092 |	And I'll give you a
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,696	| IOT092 |	A perfect example of this
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,512	| IOT092 |	Imagine putting Telemetry on
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:57,280	| IOT092 |	The baskets
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:39:01,376	| IOT092 |	Write the little hand baskets that you carry around the store or putting on the shopping cart
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,448	| IOT092 |	Now you start to understand the path
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:10,336	| IOT092 |	That Shoppers are taking through your store so you can kind of figure out what what are hot spots and cold spots
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:10,848	| IOT092 |	Within the store
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:15,712	| IOT092 |	Now if you were to take that and tie it to particular transactions like
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:19,296	| IOT092 |	This car went through this register and
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,600	| IOT092 |	That was tied to this
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:28,000	| IOT092 |	Frequent shopper because they have a loyalty card value can start to understand more behaviors about the
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,816	| IOT092 |	The customer and their buying habits when they're in the store
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:33,888	| IOT092 |	That some might say wait a second that's a little big brother
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:35,424	| IOT092 |	Baidu
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:38,240	| IOT092 |	If you can really start to understand
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:41,056	| IOT092 |	What is selling and what isn't selling more than just
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:46,432	| IOT092 |	A binary yes or no but rather to say you know they kind of went by the shirts or went by the pants but
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:48,224	| IOT092 |	It really just bought socks
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:51,808	| IOT092 |	I think that gives you some insights that you wouldn't otherwise have Acts
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:52,832	| IOT092 |	Access to
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:55,136	| IOT092 |	To me what this is all about is
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:55,904	| IOT092 |	Iot
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:40:01,024	| IOT092 |	Like Cloud before it gives you the ability to do something you couldn't otherwise do
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,560	| IOT092 |	Other than
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:08,960	| IOT092 |	Having an employee follow a customer around the store and say who they went to this one and went to this island this album
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:09,728	| IOT092 |	Not that aisle
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:10,752	| IOT092 |	Maybe a little creepy
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:14,080	| IOT092 |	Yes incredibly
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,896	| IOT092 |	Part of what we're talking about here is
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,688	| IOT092 |	Iot gives you the
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:20,736	| IOT092 |	The data stream the information
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,016	| IOT092 |	In an automated way
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:28,672	| IOT092 |	Without having to induce more labor into the equation which is as you mentioned expensive and error-prone
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:30,464	| IOT092 |	Okay so now
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:35,840	| IOT092 |	Cios are already in charge of like maintaining computers and I was thinking of Peters and everything and that feels like
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:37,376	| IOT092 |	Huge expansion of their you know
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:38,400	| IOT092 |	Purview
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:39,680	| IOT092 |	So
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:44,032	| IOT092 |	Who's going to be in charge of these things on the tech side is it still the CIA
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:47,616	| IOT092 |	And does that mean their role kind of changes to
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:48,896	| IOT092 |	Adapt to
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:53,760	| IOT092 |	Controlling more things or should they also be dealing with the business side more now to
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:58,112	| IOT092 |	I guess it's really what is the CIO to when we have
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,904	| IOT092 |	Like this Grand connected
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,184	| IOT092 |	Retail
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:04,000	| IOT092 |	I think the first thing you have to do is
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,280	| IOT092 |	Is take a step back
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,048	| IOT092 |	And
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:08,608	| IOT092 |	Let's just spend a couple of seconds talking about
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:11,936	| IOT092 |	How the cio's role is changing because I think that creates
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,984	| IOT092 |	The context in which to answer your question
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,032	| IOT092 |	The CIO
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:19,104	| IOT092 |	Historically has been a technology leader
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:22,688	| IOT092 |	And it's what I've referred to for some time now is 2
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:23,712	| IOT092 |	Traditional Cil
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,552	| IOT092 |	But there's a new type of CIO this come about
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:30,112	| IOT092 |	And that's the transformational see I am
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:36,256	| IOT092 |	And the difference between those two individuals fundamentally is one is very technology Centric the traditional one
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:39,072	| IOT092 |	The transformational one is very business-centric
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:43,936	| IOT092 |	And what I mean by that is that the transformational CIO did it 10 times
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:47,264	| IOT092 |	The transformational CIO
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,568	| IOT092 |	Is a business leader first
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:51,616	| IOT092 |	That happens to have responsibility
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,384	| IOT092 |	Before it
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:55,199	| IOT092 |	Letters that say it not
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:55,711	| IOT092 |	Technology
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:58,527	| IOT092 |	And the reason for that is that
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:03,903	| IOT092 |	The it organization needs to be more business-centric today than it ever has
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,415	| IOT092 |	Has been
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,975	| IOT092 |	So understanding that context
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:13,119	| IOT092 |	To answer your question the CIO quite often will not be involved in these technology
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,143	| IOT092 |	Conversations the
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:15,679	| IOT092 |	Transformational CIO that is
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:18,751	| IOT092 |	And so they're more focused on
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:21,311	| IOT092 |	If we're talking about the shopping cart example
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:23,359	| IOT092 |	How did this really solve a business
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,383	| IOT092 |	Problem for me
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,919	| IOT092 |	How does a tie
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:32,319	| IOT092 |	Iot into a business problem and I can't tie it into a business problem and it's just about who cool we can put dilemma
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,343	| IOT092 |	Metreon shopping carts
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,927	| IOT092 |	Okay that's interesting maybe but
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:41,791	| IOT092 |	Why are we doing it we've got a big huge heaping plate of things to do
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,839	| IOT092 |	It's overflowing and that hasn't changed
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,631	| IOT092 |	We want to throw up
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,935	| IOT092 |	Cool Nifty little thing on the plate
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:49,727	| IOT092 |	Without tying it to a business center
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:53,567	| IOT092 |	Problem that we're trying to solve that's going to be really hard to get
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,103	| IOT092 |	Support and funding for
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,639	| IOT092 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:57,663	| IOT092 |	And what skills
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:59,199	| IOT092 |	Do you think
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:03,295	| IOT092 |	The CIO needs in the organization needs as we start to embrace all of the
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:05,087	| IOT092 |	This is new sensors
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:05,855	| IOT092 |	The snoo
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:07,903	| IOT092 |	Ways of managing data
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| IOT092 |	And I'm just trying to think about
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,487	| IOT092 |	The guy who's really good at like
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:17,375	| IOT092 |	Troubleshooting computer problems do you send him out to you know install the sensors does that change your
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,679	| IOT092 |	Types of people you hire the skills you need
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:23,007	| IOT092 |	The CIO needs to understand a couple of things
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:23,775	| IOT092 |	Number one
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:28,383	| IOT092 |	They need to understand how the company spends money and how the company makes money
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,663	| IOT092 |	And I don't mean
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:34,015	| IOT092 |	You know that they sell pants and sell shirts and sell socks if that's
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:35,807	| IOT092 |	What I mean is that
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:38,879	| IOT092 |	They need to understand how the customer in gauges
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:41,439	| IOT092 |	And the different opportunities the customer has to engage
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:42,719	| IOT092 |	Purchase those products
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:47,071	| IOT092 |	But they also need to understand the whole supply chain of how products are designed
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:52,191	| IOT092 |	The timeline that they go through for design to manufacturing to
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:54,495	| IOT092 |	Supply chain to distribution
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:56,031	| IOT092 |	And how all of that works
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:56,543	| IOT092 |	Soup To Nuts
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:57,823	| IOT092 |	Now that's
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:44:02,943	| IOT092 |	A very tall order but to a large degree these days the CIO needs to be thinking like
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:07,807	| IOT092 |	In the role of the CEO and I don't mean the CEO of it I mean the CEO of
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,575	| IOT092 |	The company
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:11,135	| IOT092 |	And so there's a much broader / view that
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,159	| IOT092 |	The CIO needs to have
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:17,535	| IOT092 |	What that means then is that a lot of these technology conversations
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:20,351	| IOT092 |	Because you will need to have those technology conversation
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:21,887	| IOT092 |	Those need to be pushed
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,911	| IOT092 |	Further into
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,959	| IOT092 |	The it organization
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,495	| IOT092 |	And so it needs to
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:29,823	| IOT092 |	Understand that and so of course they're new skill sets
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,359	| IOT092 |	With regards
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:34,687	| IOT092 |	Two new architectures around iot and I've written a bit about
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:40,319	| IOT092 |	You have some suggested architectures for iot to to have the conversation cuz that's
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:45,439	| IOT092 |	Whole nother thing right everything falls into the iot packet but iot is not iot is not iot
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:48,767	| IOT092 |	It's understanding that is really important
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:53,119	| IOT092 |	And so does new skill sets are required within the it organization
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:55,423	| IOT092 |	It is a division of labor
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:58,495	| IOT092 |	Even within the it organization
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:02,847	| IOT092 |	You still have to have some business sense today it still can't be
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:04,895	| IOT092 |	A technology Centric conversation
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:08,991	| IOT092 |	In line with this conversation about skills right now there is a lot
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:10,271	| IOT092 |	Of
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:14,879	| IOT092 |	Back and forth in the kind of industrial or Enterprise iot space about
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,415	| IOT092 |	Disparaging of
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:19,231	| IOT092 |	Information Technology with
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:20,255	| IOT092 |	Operations
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:21,023	| IOT092 |	Technology
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:21,791	| IOT092 |	And you don't
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,583	| IOT092 |	Itot divide
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:24,351	| IOT092 |	In
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,119	| IOT092 |	Salata
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,655	| IOT092 |	A lot of acronyms but
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:28,191	| IOT092 |	It's also kind of an interesting
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:32,287	| IOT092 |	Discussion because a lot of the IT people in the cio's are like
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,847	| IOT092 |	Oh my God I have to deal with life
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,383	| IOT092 |	Fike fire alarm systems
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:39,455	| IOT092 |	I'm I'm working on our email
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:40,223	| IOT092 |	So there's this like
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:44,319	| IOT092 |	Concerned about like where the role of facilities kind of management
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:47,135	| IOT092 |	Comes in here and if it does it all and I'd be curious about your take
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:49,183	| IOT092 |	You know it's
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,463	| IOT092 |	It's funny you bring that up
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:52,255	| IOT092 |	Because I can recall
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:55,327	| IOT092 |	A very distinct conversation I had several years ago
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:58,143	| IOT092 |	In past organization where the
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:01,983	| IOT092 |	Facilities organization had responsibility for the photocopier
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:03,007	| IOT092 |	No coffee Man
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:04,287	| IOT092 |	And
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,567	| IOT092 |	These
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,847	| IOT092 |	Machines guide
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,639	| IOT092 |	Really complex
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:09,407	| IOT092 |	It's really fast
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:11,199	| IOT092 |	They started connecting to the internet
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,479	| IOT092 |	Connecting to your network
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:15,551	| IOT092 |	They had a hard drive in them they had software that had to be updated
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:16,831	| IOT092 |	And the facilities folks
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:21,695	| IOT092 |	This is out of our wheelhouse we don't know what to do with it it's all technology
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,463	| IOT092 |	And they kept
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:23,743	| IOT092 |	Calling it to
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:26,047	| IOT092 |	To help address it
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:26,815	| IOT092 |	Help
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,351	| IOT092 |	You don't resolve it
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,143	| IOT092 |	Because we had processes we had
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:33,215	| IOT092 |	Means to be able to handle all of them
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:35,263	| IOT092 |	The functions we just couldn't deal with
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:37,567	| IOT092 |	Things like supplies and Ana type of stuff
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:39,871	| IOT092 |	Although arguably at someone
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:40,639	| IOT092 |	Like a printer
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,175	| IOT092 |	But anyway
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:44,735	| IOT092 |	It was interesting to have that conversation because
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:45,503	| IOT092 |	I think
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,807	| IOT092 |	The one thing you have to be careful about is
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:50,623	| IOT092 |	If you use an assumption that
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:53,183	| IOT092 |	As soon as it connects to a network
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:55,743	| IOT092 |	It falls under the purview of it
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:47:00,095	| IOT092 |	It becomes this massive organization is responsible for a lot of things that
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:02,911	| IOT092 |	It doesn't necessarily understand
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:04,447	| IOT092 |	And
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:06,239	| IOT092 |	Shouldn't necessarily manage
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:09,567	| IOT092 |	But rather other parts of the organization need to get more
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:10,591	| IOT092 |	Sophisticated to
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:12,127	| IOT092 |	And I think there's a balance
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:13,151	| IOT092 |	Destructor iron
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:17,759	| IOT092 |	And we're just seeing kind of dere the inkling of the pendulum starting to swing
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:19,295	| IOT092 |	Any other direction
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:21,343	| IOT092 |	And eventually it'll swing back
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:22,623	| IOT092 |	To something more neutral
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:26,207	| IOT092 |	So let's let's going to delve into this little bit because there are things like
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:28,255	| IOT092 |	Security that is
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:30,815	| IOT092 |	Probably very much something
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,607	| IOT092 |	I mean I know we have sex
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,143	| IOT092 |	Sisal ciss
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:34,911	| IOT092 |	Is that how you say it
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,959	| IOT092 |	Right Caesars Caesars
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,519	| IOT092 |	I know we have cesos now that are
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:46,687	| IOT092 |	Totally responsible for that and when you think about things like the target breach which was coming in through an a
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:50,271	| IOT092 |	HP AC system to the point-of-sale system to steal people's credit cards
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:52,319	| IOT092 |	That suddenly becomes like
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,599	| IOT092 |	Bully Chivas
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:55,391	| IOT092 |	That's on the network is that it
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:57,183	| IOT092 |	When you're dealing with
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:48:02,815	| IOT092 |	All of these devices that people are going to be plugging on or attaching to your network it becomes like who's in charge of that
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:09,471	| IOT092 |	I guess that's the thing that I often get pulled into is the conversation around security regardless of what
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,519	| IOT092 |	It's right you know we talked about
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:14,335	| IOT092 |	Comparing some of the analogs of iot to Cloud
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,359	| IOT092 |	It's the same issue
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:19,711	| IOT092 |	We had the same conversation about security when the internet came about the 90s
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:22,783	| IOT092 |	Oh we're not going to use it because it's insecure
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,831	| IOT092 |	Okay well today
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:25,855	| IOT092 |	If you don't use it
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:27,647	| IOT092 |	Your youre neanderthal
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:34,047	| IOT092 |	You know we had the same conversation about distributed computing we had the same conversation about Cloud we're having the same conversation
EDL	00:48:34,047	00:48:35,071	| IOT092 |	Json about iot
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:38,655	| IOT092 |	The bigger challenge that with iot unlike the other
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,191	| IOT092 |	Predecessor
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:40,703	| IOT092 |	Services
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:46,079	| IOT092 |	The sheer number of devices that were talking about in the intelligence of the devices
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,615	| IOT092 |	It creates
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:51,711	| IOT092 |	An exponentially more complicated problem to solve 4
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:54,015	| IOT092 |	That we don't necessarily have
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:54,783	| IOT092 |	A direct answer
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:57,087	| IOT092 |	What I mean by that is
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:59,647	| IOT092 |	If you think about every single device
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:00,159	| IOT092 |	In your house
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,207	| IOT092 |	And I forget about your office
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:06,303	| IOT092 |	Just think about your house from a personal standpoint how many devices do you have the
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:07,071	| IOT092 |	Connect to
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:10,399	| IOT092 |	Your internet service and if you start adding it up
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:11,679	| IOT092 |	I think on average
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:14,495	| IOT092 |	She probably have somewhere between 10 and 20 devices
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:15,519	| IOT092 |	Sprint average household
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:19,615	| IOT092 |	That's a lot of devices and that's probably not even everything that could connect
EDL	00:49:19,615	00:49:23,967	| IOT092 |	And so how do you manage those devices becomes the second piece of it which is
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:27,551	| IOT092 |	We're talking about sensors were talking about small
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:30,367	| IOT092 |	Circuitry and
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:32,927	| IOT092 |	Technology in small bits of software
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:36,511	| IOT092 |	That now we have to figure out how to effectively secure
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,047	| IOT092 |	And
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:42,911	| IOT092 |	That becomes incredibly problematic not just on a personal standpoint in our homes but
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:45,727	| IOT092 |	Think about it now in the office man the corporate environment
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:47,007	| IOT092 |	It's a problem
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:50,079	| IOT092 |	It's a personal conversation that they bring up which is
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:52,383	| IOT092 |	Okay I want to do this but how do I say
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:54,943	| IOT092 |	And even when they say those words
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:57,503	| IOT092 |	The whole concept of how do I say
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,271	| IOT092 |	Secure it
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:50:01,343	| IOT092 |	Has a whole nother set of questions that come with it
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:02,879	| IOT092 |	What do you mean by
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,391	| IOT092 |	CARiD
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:06,463	| IOT092 |	What does it what exactly does that mean
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:07,487	| IOT092 |	And how much
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:08,511	| IOT092 |	Do you want to secure it
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:10,047	| IOT092 |	Do you want it to be like for dogs
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:10,815	| IOT092 |	Do you want it to be
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:13,887	| IOT092 |	Just something that kind of keeps the riffraff out
EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:16,447	| IOT092 |	It feels like we have to come up with a new model
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:20,287	| IOT092 |	First Security like a new mental model because like the firewall model doesn't work
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:23,871	| IOT092 |	Giant hole to dump your traffic in for it to be
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:26,431	| IOT092 |	I cleaned kind of doesn't work like it did for cloud
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:33,343	| IOT092 |	And just going back again to your retail example you're going to be putting connected carts in the hands of your user
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,367	| IOT092 |	Service which means
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:37,183	| IOT092 |	You can't even protect the physical assets
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:41,535	| IOT092 |	In many cases are going to be in the hands of other people and then you're opening up
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:44,095	| IOT092 |	Maybe not ports but
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:46,399	| IOT092 |	Opening up doors into your system be alike
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:47,167	| IOT092 |	Apis for
EDL	00:50:47,935	00:50:52,287	| IOT092 |	You're basically sticking a lot of stuff outside whatever wallet so you may have built in
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:54,335	| IOT092 |	Both physically and
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:55,615	| IOT092 |	Virtually so
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:58,175	| IOT092 |	I just don't I don't even know how to think about that
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:00,991	| IOT092 |	You're more spot-on than
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:03,295	| IOT092 |	You probably think you are because
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:04,831	| IOT092 |	The issue here is
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:06,367	| IOT092 |	The old adage of
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:09,951	| IOT092 |	Crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside that perimeter
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:11,999	| IOT092 |	Security Paradigm has long since been dead
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:14,559	| IOT092 |	More than a dozen years ago
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:16,607	| IOT092 |	I was with an organization that
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:19,423	| IOT092 |	It was an institution it was at Stanford University
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:21,215	| IOT092 |	And here's a prominent insta
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:23,007	| IOT092 |	Institution and one of the
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,543	| IOT092 |	Paradigm's
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:29,919	| IOT092 |	That we had to look at is we had to assume that in our in the world that I lived in there
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:32,991	| IOT092 |	We had assumed that our network was a dirty Network
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:34,783	| IOT092 |	Is the default thinking
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:37,855	| IOT092 |	Most corporate entities don't think that way they think of
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:44,255	| IOT092 |	Their internal network is a clean Network and you set up the perimeter and all the sensors to be able to protect you
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:46,815	| IOT092 |	As long as something's on the inside you're good
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:48,863	| IOT092 |	But when you're talking about
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:54,495	| IOT092 |	College students dirty dirty college students with
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:56,543	| IOT092 |	That's exactly right right
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:57,311	| IOT092 |	You know
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:52:03,711	| IOT092 |	Unlike a corporate environment where 90% of the devices you know about he have the random Consultants or whatnot that comes in
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:04,991	| IOT092 |	Cannon plugs into your network
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:06,271	| IOT092 |	In
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:08,575	| IOT092 |	An educational Institution
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:10,111	| IOT092 |	90% of the devices
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:10,879	| IOT092 |	You don't touch
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:12,415	| IOT092 |	You don't have control over
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:17,023	| IOT092 |	And so it changes the Paradigm and I think that's part of what we have to
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:18,815	| IOT092 |	Start to think about it it is
EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:21,631	| IOT092 |	How do we start to assume that
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:24,447	| IOT092 |	We're not in a secure world
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:26,239	| IOT092 |	We don't live in a secure network
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:28,031	| IOT092 |	And so we have to take
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:28,799	| IOT092 |	Appropriate
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:31,103	| IOT092 |	Precautions we can't make that assumption that
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:36,479	| IOT092 |	Oh well if we just plug it on our Network and it's behind a firewall we're good to go right
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:37,247	| IOT092 |	Wrong
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:39,551	| IOT092 |	You know in the retail example with the shopping carts
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:41,855	| IOT092 |	How many times have you seen a shopping card
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:46,975	| IOT092 |	Out in some random parking lot somewhere that's nowhere near the store that it belongs to
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:48,767	| IOT092 |	Now imagine if it has
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,559	| IOT092 |	And iot device on it
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:55,423	| IOT092 |	And you get some kid that wants to kind of Tinker around and hack that system
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:56,959	| IOT092 |	Great so now they've got
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:57,727	| IOT092 |	The device
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:52:59,263	| IOT092 |	Is the devices connected into your
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:00,543	| IOT092 |	Your network
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:05,407	| IOT092 |	That they have full access to be able to Tinker around and play with it outside of your purview
EDL	00:53:06,175	00:53:11,551	| IOT092 |	That's just one simple example but I think we could go on for days and days talking about examples in
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:15,391	| IOT092 |	Just about every industry to and that's the other thing to think about is
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:17,183	| IOT092 |	What we're talking about today
EDL	00:53:17,183	00:53:21,023	| IOT092 |	Is not relegated to just retail or just certain industries
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:26,655	| IOT092 |	There are examples of this that cross every single industry that I've run across so far
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:27,935	| IOT092 |	Guys
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:29,727	| IOT092 |	This is very
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:30,495	| IOT092 |	Real talk
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:32,543	| IOT092 |	And if you want examples
EDL	00:53:32,543	00:53:34,847	| IOT092 |	From other Industries and other thinking
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:37,663	| IOT092 |	You're going to have to call Tim because we are out of time
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:40,479	| IOT092 |	Tim thank you so much
