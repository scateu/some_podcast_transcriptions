EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:51,104	| IOT139 |	Thanksgiving
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,640	| IOT139 |	I think we did
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,408	| IOT139 |	Yes October
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,944	| IOT139 |	Starting November I don't even know
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,504	| IOT139 |	I'm sorry Canada
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,832	| IOT139 |	And for the rest of the world that may or may not celebrate Thanksgiving
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,624	| IOT139 |	I'm actually sorry to
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,392	| IOT139 |	Because
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,672	| IOT139 |	Who doesn't love a day where you just sitting
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,488	| IOT139 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,536	| IOT139 |	We
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,072	| IOT139 |	Are going to zoom through the news
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,120	| IOT139 |	Because there's really very little of it so far
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,192	| IOT139 |	The biggest news is
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,728	| IOT139 |	The Apple homepod
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:21,568	| IOT139 |	Which is Apple's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google home
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,592	| IOT139 |	Has been delayed
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,384	| IOT139 |	This is surprise you Kevin
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,944	| IOT139 |	It does surprise me it delayed
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| IOT139 |	Yes it does
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:29,248	| IOT139 |	Yes it does
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:35,648	| IOT139 |	It's a price because they showed this off several several months ago they even had units working units for the press to listen to
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,696	| IOT139 |	Do you understand that software
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,256	| IOT139 |	One piece of it that maybe they need to work on still
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,304	| IOT139 |	Siri they certainly need to work out of my pay
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:48,704	| IOT139 |	Opinion and they said he'll be out by the holidays and now it's not coming out until early 2018 I don't think it's like a supplier
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:52,544	| IOT139 |	Supply chain issue a parts issue anything custom internal and Hardware
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,616	| IOT139 |	I guess it is software and maybe
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:58,432	| IOT139 |	Like I'm hoping there was still working on making Siri smarter
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,480	| IOT139 |	I was going to say I bet it's a Siri issue
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,528	| IOT139 |	I bet it's also
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,320	| IOT139 |	Okay so
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,392	| IOT139 |	Part of me that is so frustrated with apple in their smart home efforts and
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,416	| IOT139 |	Continually
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,976	| IOT139 |	Oh we're good at home kit
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:17,888	| IOT139 |	This announcement of homekit and then this gradual like
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:20,704	| IOT139 |	Roll out of services and then this retrenchment with
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| IOT139 |	Okay
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,752	| IOT139 |	Maybe don't need a search chip
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| IOT139 |	After a bunch of
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,288	| IOT139 |	Companies
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT139 |	Went out and did that
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,104	| IOT139 |	So that's all very frustrating
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,640	| IOT139 |	What I will say though
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| IOT139 |	Is
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,968	| IOT139 |	So I didn't find this surprising
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| IOT139 |	At all because Apple his
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,296	| IOT139 |	Consistently
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,880	| IOT139 |	Pushed forward with his incomplete version of
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,904	| IOT139 |	What it thinks
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,672	| IOT139 |	The smart home show
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,464	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,000	| IOT139 |	It feels to me that it
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,560	| IOT139 |	Not only does it not really have a Clear Vision
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,120	| IOT139 |	I think it's also getting stuck with its privacy
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,400	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,728	| IOT139 |	Kind of the way that it's segmented its
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,752	| IOT139 |	Entire ecosystem
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:58,592	| IOT139 |	So I think we see that with a couple things I think we see it with
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,152	| IOT139 |	You know it's decision to change out
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,688	| IOT139 |	Desertification chip-in make
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,480	| IOT139 |	It software authentication base
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,504	| IOT139 |	I think we're going to see
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,320	| IOT139 |	It with the problems with Siri we've seen so far
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:12,416	| IOT139 |	So I think what's Happening Here is probably apples trying really hard to
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,720	| IOT139 |	Figure out how to push forward in the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:18,047	| IOT139 |	The way it is historically push forward
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:21,631	| IOT139 |	In the mobile ecosystem and I think it's kind of realizing that it doesn't
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| IOT139 |	Always work
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,703	| IOT139 |	And I don't disagree with anything you said
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,519	| IOT139 |	Especially at a high-level I think
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:33,151	| IOT139 |	The series is going to be in the homepod it's going to be the same Siri that exist today in a phone to control things and they already
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:34,943	| IOT139 |	So again
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| IOT139 |	Noah
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,783	| IOT139 |	No argument there it's not great but
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,599	| IOT139 |	And maybe that's why they haven't they realized
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,415	| IOT139 |	Of course I realize that Siri is not
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,719	| IOT139 |	The best experience for users I have to
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,999	| IOT139 |	Thanks ad
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,815	| IOT139 |	But they realize when you put that in a
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,119	| IOT139 |	You're trying to conquer a new ecosystem with
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,655	| IOT139 |	The terrible AI witch
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,983	| IOT139 |	In some ways might need that Apple realizes that the AI is but
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,007	| IOT139 |	For the Smart Home
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,871	| IOT139 |	I don't know I could be I am frustrated with Apple
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,175	| IOT139 |	Because it kind of jerks around
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,967	| IOT139 |	What's the industry in Industry adoption
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,527	| IOT139 |	In a lot of ways a lot of people
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,623	| IOT139 |	Are holding off on the smart home to get homekit certified stuff
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,719	| IOT139 |	Right now if you're going all-in at home kit you don't have
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,255	| IOT139 |	Kind of a democratic
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,047	| IOT139 |	Accessible way to control your
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,559	| IOT139 |	Your home
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,887	| IOT139 |	You know that isn't based off the phone and I think that's
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,423	| IOT139 |	Really is stumbling block
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:33,567	| IOT139 |	See that's true I mean a lot of homekit devices obviously will work with other hugs as well and that's
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:38,175	| IOT139 |	That's why I don't think it's hurt the market too much but I don't disagree they move markets and
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,967	| IOT139 |	This is not helping in general
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,015	| IOT139 |	Even their partner
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,295	| IOT139 |	Are freshmen
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| IOT139 |	I cannot tell you how many times I have
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,623	| IOT139 |	Sad
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,135	| IOT139 |	About that
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,999	| IOT139 |	If you were hoping to get that for the holidays
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,023	| IOT139 |	You can just now
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,839	| IOT139 |	Series taking the holidays off
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,399	| IOT139 |	There you go alright so we have a correction to me
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,191	| IOT139 |	Because last week
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,727	| IOT139 |	We got a call
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,031	| IOT139 |	And I feel terrible that I answered this run
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,823	| IOT139 |	This is why you should play with their gadgets from
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| IOT139 |	More than a day before Easter
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,639	| IOT139 |	Bad Stacy
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,175	| IOT139 |	Wise
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,455	| IOT139 |	$20 Home Security
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,991	| IOT139 |	That we talked about
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,551	| IOT139 |	I said that you didn't send stuff to the cloud
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,343	| IOT139 |	That is because I was not
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:17,855	| IOT139 |	Testing it
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,647	| IOT139 |	At first with
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,439	| IOT139 |	Motion detection
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,975	| IOT139 |	I was just texting you
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:27,583	| IOT139 |	Playing with it as a live camera cuz I tend to play with things minimal features first and then build up
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,887	| IOT139 |	To all of them but when you build up
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:32,703	| IOT139 |	Can you add motion detection all your data is sent
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,751	| IOT139 |	The cloud so we did say that it did not send things
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT139 |	But it does
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,823	| IOT139 |	So that's really important to know
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,639	| IOT139 |	You can save everything to an SD card
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,663	| IOT139 |	That is all still true
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,711	| IOT139 |	And if you don't want to send anything
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:49,855	| IOT139 |	I think the cloud I did talk to one of the founders of the company and she said that if you don't use the motion detection
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:54,207	| IOT139 |	Then basically everything candy store to your device which is effectively what I was doing
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:59,327	| IOT139 |	It's interesting that they can't do the motion detection on device admin
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| IOT139 |	Are they using
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:05,215	| IOT139 |	The cloud to do processing or the video up to the cloud in store
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,751	| IOT139 |	Now there is no storage fee for
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,543	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,079	| IOT139 |	It's actually really interesting
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,383	| IOT139 |	Company I talk to the founders
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,151	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,735	| IOT139 |	Sunset from a company in China so the camera Hardware is licensed
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,015	| IOT139 |	Company of China
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:24,159	| IOT139 |	But the software they did themselves and their whole model is these are people from Amazon their model is to
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,999	| IOT139 |	Basically build the cheapest products they can
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,303	| IOT139 |	And then Branch out and other stuff
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,631	| IOT139 |	They're like it's Amazon metal great customer service at a low low price
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,655	| IOT139 |	The merchants
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,935	| IOT139 |	Solo margins to them
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,959	| IOT139 |	Low-cost to you
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:41,567	| IOT139 |	But presumably this she says it's the same Hardware that's inside the nest I
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,591	| IOT139 |	Like really
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,639	| IOT139 |	And they do have
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| IOT139 |	The money
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,295	| IOT139 |	They've said they built in the capability obviously
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,879	| IOT139 |	Store your videos so just store the motion capture
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,391	| IOT139 |	Videos
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,183	| IOT139 |	And not
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:04,351	| IOT139 |	Which really motion-capture isn't going to take up gigs and get to space
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,375	| IOT139 |	That's right you're not doing everything
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,167	| IOT139 |	But still
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,959	| IOT139 |	I was really intrigued by this cuz
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:13,823	| IOT139 |	You know that this is just the same gear Hardware that's inside the nest cam
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,615	| IOT139 |	When a nest cam sells for
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,383	| IOT139 |	Joshua
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| IOT139 |	150
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:22,783	| IOT139 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| IOT139 |	After 1:30 I nest
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,879	| IOT139 |	Pretty astonishing
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:30,719	| IOT139 |	So yeah just Kim basic Nest cam two hundred bucks
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,255	| IOT139 |	So this is
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| IOT139 |	A tenth of the price
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,583	| IOT139 |	Very audacious
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| IOT139 |	Product
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,119	| IOT139 |	Very nice
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,887	| IOT139 |	Cell
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,423	| IOT139 |	That is our correction
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,703	| IOT139 |	But
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:43,007	| IOT139 |	We're going to keep talking about it because
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,311	| IOT139 |	Oh I we should have Jingle Bells
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,383	| IOT139 |	I don't have any
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,431	| IOT139 |	Sorry
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| IOT139 |	Where's my any one of those like radio DJ
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,271	| IOT139 |	Sound machine
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,063	| IOT139 |	Need a soundboard
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,623	| IOT139 |	You're welcome
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:04,255	| IOT139 |	This is our Internet of Things podcast 2017
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,535	| IOT139 |	Holiday gift
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,047	| IOT139 |	Guide
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,839	| IOT139 |	So we
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:14,239	| IOT139 |	For our holiday gift guide everything on it we have tested unless we tell you otherwise we will be very
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,799	| IOT139 |	Clear because we don't want to send you
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| IOT139 |	Home with a crummy product
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:25,503	| IOT139 |	We also try to do different things each year so this is why you won't see my old favorites like neutrons are Hue Lights
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT139 |	It's which we all
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| IOT139 |	Can we talk about all the time
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,599	| IOT139 |	Play we like them
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,671	| IOT139 |	We don't have a single bulb on here traditional bow
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,439	| IOT139 |	We don't
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,719	| IOT139 |	Yeah that's a big
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,511	| IOT139 |	Departure for us
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,327	| IOT139 |	We
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| IOT139 |	Have broken up into categories
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,143	| IOT139 |	Set wake up a smart home
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,423	| IOT139 |	We've got
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,447	| IOT139 |	Kids stuff
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,983	| IOT139 |	We are stocking stuffers
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| IOT139 |	And we have
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,543	| IOT139 |	Crazy expensive
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,335	| IOT139 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,359	| IOT139 |	Because
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| IOT139 |	What's not
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,407	| IOT139 |	Why not
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:59,295	| IOT139 |	Let's get this party started with the reason you probably listen to the show which is smart home stuff
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:02,111	| IOT139 |	My first pick is
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,391	| IOT139 |	The wyze cam
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,439	| IOT139 |	Which is wyze
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,791	| IOT139 |	It is $20 this is the one we just talked about
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,071	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:11,839	| IOT139 |	Gosh
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| IOT139 |	You can actually use it as a
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,655	| IOT139 |	It is very small
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:19,519	| IOT139 |	There's a fully-functioning security camera it works really well
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| IOT139 |	I bought one a couple
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,079	| IOT139 |	Weeks ago it arrived
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| IOT139 |	Gosh
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,175	| IOT139 |	I feel like I could just like set this up any
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,479	| IOT139 |	And it's one of the few that you could
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,527	| IOT139 |	In-store on the MicroSD card
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:34,623	| IOT139 |	Yes you can store your data on the MicroSD card it will go to the cloud though
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,135	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,415	| IOT139 |	What else
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,183	| IOT139 |	About it
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,999	| IOT139 |	It's got everything it's got HD it's got night vision
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| IOT139 |	It's got
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| IOT139 |	Two-way audio
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,839	| IOT139 |	It's cut
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,607	| IOT139 |	Music detection
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:50,751	| IOT139 |	It's one of the few though it doesn't yet work with any of existing smart home hubs or does it
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:55,103	| IOT139 |	It does not work with any smart home hubs now I will say that when I talked to the founders they were like
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,431	| IOT139 |	Okay honestly
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,711	| IOT139 |	Not everybody has a hug.
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,295	| IOT139 |	So this is actually it you know cuz a lot of them would
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:03,807	| IOT139 |	Rick Larsen
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,623	| IOT139 |	Kevin Grayson so that's fine
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,415	| IOT139 |	Yeah so if you are like
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:14,815	| IOT139 |	What's a smart home security stuff people are all worried about her maybe are going out of town and you want to have a camera you just keep in the drawer and you just
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,839	| IOT139 |	Throw up when you know
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,119	| IOT139 |	Leaving
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,143	| IOT139 |	Twenty bucks wyzecam
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,423	| IOT139 |	Check it out
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:19,935	| IOT139 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| IOT139 |	Speaking of cameras
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,799	| IOT139 |	We got a lot of requests for the outdoor camp
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,335	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,359	| IOT139 |	My favorite
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:31,967	| IOT139 |	Floor bang for your buck good price is the Arlo Pro Outdoor
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| IOT139 |	Now
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,551	| IOT139 |	There are three versions of the Arlo camera
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| IOT139 |	There is a
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,367	| IOT139 |	Wireless
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| IOT139 |	Outdoor camera
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:44,767	| IOT139 |	Has moral batteries don't get that it's expensive compared to the pro which is what we recommend
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,559	| IOT139 |	And that is it
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,095	| IOT139 |	Wireless
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,375	| IOT139 |	Outdoor camera
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,655	| IOT139 |	It's rechargeable
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,447	| IOT139 |	Mikasa by a little extra
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,983	| IOT139 |	Sure thing if you wanted to slide it in
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:54,751	| IOT139 |	And in charge
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| IOT139 |	I like this
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:01,407	| IOT139 |	It is again motion detection activated
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,967	| IOT139 |	You can arm it when you leave and you'll get all these notifications
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| IOT139 |	People come in and out
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,783	| IOT139 |	I think it's a great product
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:12,415	| IOT139 |	These but you still have a rechargeable battery so there's no hard wiring so it's simple to install
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:15,743	| IOT139 |	I suppose use these indoors if you need to but there
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,047	| IOT139 |	Certainly rated to be used Outdoors as well
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,559	| IOT139 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| IOT139 |	And I've had my
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,119	| IOT139 |	In those places
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,399	| IOT139 |	They are lovely
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,727	| IOT139 |	They do have a pro to version
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:30,335	| IOT139 |	It is more expensive and has a siren and that's designed act as a moor
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| IOT139 |	Featured security system
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:37,759	| IOT139 |	I believe that one does 1080p video where is the one we're recommending is
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,295	| IOT139 |	720P
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,367	| IOT139 |	I don't really think that's a huge deal breaker by any means
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,647	| IOT139 |	You know
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,695	| IOT139 |	This is if you just want to see what
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,999	| IOT139 |	Exactly exactly
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,535	| IOT139 |	Mine actually don't
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:55,935	| IOT139 |	I don't have them up most of the time I throw them up when I go out of town or when I have kids on my roof then I set them up
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,703	| IOT139 |	On the roof so weak
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,471	| IOT139 |	You can keep an eye on them
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:01,055	| IOT139 |	I actually work with a lot of
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:03,103	| IOT139 |	What devices we went through and we thought about
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,639	| IOT139 |	Which cameras work with the most
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:10,527	| IOT139 |	Thanks The Nest also work with a lot of things but we didn't like them mostly because their Hardware
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| IOT139 |	Tired so
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:11,807	| IOT139 |	You have to have an outlet
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,135	| IOT139 |	Okay moving on to the smart speaker sex
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,695	| IOT139 |	Yeah we actually have
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:21,023	| IOT139 |	2 in looks plain why I'll take the first one then stay so you can
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,791	| IOT139 |	Take the second one
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:27,935	| IOT139 |	If you're all in on Amazon's platform for a digital assistant
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:30,495	| IOT139 |	Or you would like a choice in the future
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:35,615	| IOT139 |	I wish dental assistant to use I would recommend wholeheartedly the Sonos one which is
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| IOT139 |	Pretty much a brand new products
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:42,527	| IOT139 |	Obviously Sonos has been around smart speakers for a long time they pretty much pioneered multi-room audio
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,831	| IOT139 |	Wireless multi-room audio in the house and
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,903	| IOT139 |	This works with just about every music
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:51,999	| IOT139 |	Streaming service known to man it's ridiculous how much support it has
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| IOT139 |	Waiters work with
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,095	| IOT139 |	Amazon voice services
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:01,471	| IOT139 |	Today and Sonos is going to be adding Google Assistant support in 2018
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,031	| IOT139 |	So it's nice because you don't make a choice
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,943	| IOT139 |	These are $199 each the sound quality is outstanding better than any of the other Smart Homes
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:14,271	| IOT139 |	Speakers that I've tried which are mostly the smaller size ones like your
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| IOT139 |	Echo dots
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:20,415	| IOT139 |	Google mini and so on even the regular Echo and the Google home
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:23,743	| IOT139 |	This is better sounding than that so for 199
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:28,351	| IOT139 |	Don't know if I have any Black Friday deals on this cuz it's so new of a product but you know what
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,143	| IOT139 |	I would pay full price have one for this
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:34,239	| IOT139 |	But if you are looking for a bull
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,055	| IOT139 |	And you maybe you're like
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,639	| IOT139 |	My other smart speaker recommendation is the Google home
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,943	| IOT139 |	This is great if you are all in on Google
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:43,967	| IOT139 |	Like me
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:45,503	| IOT139 |	Google file
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:46,783	| IOT139 |	But even a thing
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:49,087	| IOT139 |	It's also the better of the
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,879	| IOT139 |	You're looking at Google vs madam
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,951	| IOT139 |	Google is actually smarter and
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,487	| IOT139 |	I have
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:15:01,887	| IOT139 |	Doubled up in my house and I'm finding that I'm using Google for more and more things like just last night I added
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,655	| IOT139 |	To my calendar
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,447	| IOT139 |	And it just happened it was
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:04,959	| IOT139 |	Awesome
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:08,031	| IOT139 |	You know those kind of things are starting to be
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,311	| IOT139 |	They just
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:12,383	| IOT139 |	Seamless so it's pretty cool it works
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:17,247	| IOT139 |	The Google home now last year we didn't recommend it because it didn't work with this many smart home devices
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,527	| IOT139 |	What does
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,575	| IOT139 |	It works with a lot of the big one
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,343	| IOT139 |	It doesn't work with everything
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,695	| IOT139 |	But it does work with a lot of the Philips Hue the SmartThings the wing
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,743	| IOT139 |	Like 72
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,767	| IOT139 |	Devices so
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| IOT139 |	Lots of toys
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,351	| IOT139 |	And the Black Friday deals are looking like
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,119	| IOT139 |	You could get one of these
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,143	| IOT139 |	499 bucks
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,911	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:41,311	| IOT139 |	Go on in that's a good price and I waited to buy mine until I got all the decorations with the smarthome bits
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:45,663	| IOT139 |	So I agree we was not worth the recommendation last year but it's really good
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,199	| IOT139 |	Okay so
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,735	| IOT139 |	Google home if you like it
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,015	| IOT139 |	If you're looking for a hug though
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,295	| IOT139 |	Kevin
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,855	| IOT139 |	Yeah people know I have a soft spot for this hug
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:58,719	| IOT139 |	Because I purchased the first edition of it but now they have a second edition so I would recommend
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,023	| IOT139 |	Especially because it's on sale for the holidays
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,815	| IOT139 |	The wink Hub 2
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,863	| IOT139 |	Find it for about 69 bucks right now
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:11,007	| IOT139 |	I work so just about every device I can think of because it's got all the right radios inside it's got
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,311	| IOT139 |	Phi Phi Scott Bluetooth and Scott
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,103	| IOT139 |	Cindy it's got Z-Wave
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,127	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,663	| IOT139 |	I've purchased my own
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:23,807	| IOT139 |	Very happy with it the second generation was well worth the upgrade because there's more memory inside more storage of faster processor
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:26,367	| IOT139 |	There's much less lag when I say
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:31,487	| IOT139 |	To a Google home or some other device turn this light on it just happens quickly now so
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,535	| IOT139 |	Very very happy with the wink Hub 2
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:37,119	| IOT139 |	And I would say that if you know what those radios are in your interest in this
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,655	| IOT139 |	Can you somehow still don't have a hub
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,471	| IOT139 |	I would say do this over the Amazon Echo Plus
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,751	| IOT139 |	Cell which is
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,055	| IOT139 |	Advertising itself as a smart home hub but
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:45,567	| IOT139 |	Isn't it supposed to be
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:51,199	| IOT139 |	There's one more Hub / media / everything
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:56,063	| IOT139 |	Yeah I kind of feel funny putting this in here
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,831	| IOT139 |	But
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:02,463	| IOT139 |	I have to recommend something that I bought and use everyday it's the Nvidia Shield TV
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:05,791	| IOT139 |	You're probably saying why is he recommending an Android TV
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,071	| IOT139 |	Boxwell
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:13,215	| IOT139 |	Couple recent one it's on sale for $150 or $107 with the actual game controller
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:16,799	| IOT139 |	And that way you can play Android games obviously runs Android apps
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:20,639	| IOT139 |	It's Android TV as well it's got Google Assistant built in
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:27,039	| IOT139 |	So you can use either the remote switch has a microphone or the game controller which has a microphone and speak to Google Assistant
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,087	| IOT139 |	At any time when using the TV
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:32,415	| IOT139 |	Indeed it will also be adding little microphones
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:34,463	| IOT139 |	That you can plug in around your house
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,791	| IOT139 |	And that will communicate to Google Assistant as well those are not out yet
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,071	| IOT139 |	I have not used them yet but
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,375	| IOT139 |	This is one reason I bought the shield TV
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,167	| IOT139 |	But on top of that
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:47,519	| IOT139 |	Recently Samsung being selling the SmartThings link
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| IOT139 |	For $40
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:53,663	| IOT139 |	I actually snag one for $10 on sale I don't know what the sale prices are going to be over the holidays
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,967	| IOT139 |	But even for $40 what it is
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:59,807	| IOT139 |	Is a USB stick that you plug into the back of the Nvidia Shield TV
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:06,207	| IOT139 |	And it basically has a SmartThings software and add zigbee radio to the Nvidia Shield TV so now
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,255	| IOT139 |	Essentially turn your set-top box
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,279	| IOT139 |	Into
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,351	| IOT139 |	A SmartThings Hub as well so you kind of get it
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,631	| IOT139 |	Two-for-one special
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,399	| IOT139 |	Crate
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,191	| IOT139 |	Video streamer 4K
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,495	| IOT139 |	HDR I can handle anything
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,799	| IOT139 |	And then you get the smart home hub bits as well
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,311	| IOT139 |	Got it
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,639	| IOT139 |	Cities next to devices are rounding out our Smart Home
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,663	| IOT139 |	And that is the
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:29,247	| IOT139 |	Are the smart thermostat we are picking for the ecobee
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| IOT139 |	4
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,039	| IOT139 |	Wishes
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:34,623	| IOT139 |	The ecobee thermostat has all the fun features you know and love and
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,159	| IOT139 |	Makeupplus the sensor
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,183	| IOT139 |	Plus
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,975	| IOT139 |	It's gotten anime inside so you
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,487	| IOT139 |	You can talk to it
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,327	| IOT139 |	Have things happen and it's only $200 on Amazon
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| IOT139 |	Which is a pretty good price
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:48,191	| IOT139 |	And it does work with homekit as well so you don't have to
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,727	| IOT139 |	You can use it in an iOS alarm
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,239	| IOT139 |	And then
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,799	| IOT139 |	Wi-Fi mesh networks are
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,359	| IOT139 |	Smoking hot again this year and
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| IOT139 |	We're torn
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,711	| IOT139 |	We're just going to be our
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,271	| IOT139 |	We can recommend to that's fine
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,063	| IOT139 |	All right
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,623	| IOT139 |	I will unequivocally recommend a mesh Network
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,903	| IOT139 |	For anyone who's going to get in to
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:08,927	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,463	| IOT139 |	Our two favorite
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,487	| IOT139 |	Chris Kevin's is
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,279	| IOT139 |	It's the Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,303	| IOT139 |	And that's because
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| IOT139 |	3 pack only cost
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:21,983	| IOT139 |	289 at full price I'm sure there will be some on sale in the coming weeks and it's just drop dead simple it works really real
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:24,287	| IOT139 |	Well I know some reviews said that other
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,591	| IOT139 |	Products had better Ranger better throughput but
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,639	| IOT139 |	Everybody I know and
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:31,455	| IOT139 |	I bought my own 3 pack everybody I know says it's
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:35,807	| IOT139 |	Plenty good it may not have the advanced features of some other mesh network products but
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,343	| IOT139 |	Again simple setup
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,391	| IOT139 |	Anybody can set it up and it just works
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:42,463	| IOT139 |	And I am going to is expensive
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,255	| IOT139 |	Remind me to do my Eero Plus
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:47,327	| IOT139 |	And this is the second generation Eros
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,351	| IOT139 |	It's got one
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,375	| IOT139 |	Main brain
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:53,983	| IOT139 |	Euro and then it has to beacons and beacons also double as Night Lights this will cover up
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,287	| IOT139 |	Scubbers my house just fine
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| IOT139 |	And that is 399
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,127	| IOT139 |	Love these things
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:03,967	| IOT139 |	So yeah if you have a 1 to 2 bedroom home
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,783	| IOT139 |	You can probably get away with a $300 set
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,063	| IOT139 |	Supposed to $400 set
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:12,415	| IOT139 |	And then it also offers a lot of really good
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,695	| IOT139 |	Kind of add-on features
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,743	| IOT139 |	Trolls Plus
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,511	| IOT139 |	If you want to spend money
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,815	| IOT139 |	An additional $10 a month gets you
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,631	| IOT139 |	Parental safety kind of features
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,167	| IOT139 |	And a security service
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,751	| IOT139 |	Those are mesh Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:32,383	| IOT139 |	So before we continue on with our gift list let's take

EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,912	| IOT139 |	So data analytics is a big piece of it
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:32,800	| IOT139 |	But we are bringing different pieces of artificial intelligence to make that analysis and make that the application

EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:51,296	| IOT139 |	For children I'm going to do both of these cuz I have my daughter playing with some of the stuff so first off for kids
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,344	| IOT139 |	Two are probably between the ages of
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:55,392	| IOT139 |	If I don't know 5 and 8

EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:04,352	| IOT139 |	Cat this is $30 all this is it's a little tiny sensor you can plug into
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| IOT139 |	Computer and
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,680	| IOT139 |	You wave your hand over it and things happen
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,216	| IOT139 |	So your kid can
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,752	| IOT139 |	Beatbox vacant like
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,032	| IOT139 |	Use it to control different
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,824	| IOT139 |	Games and they also
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,872	| IOT139 |	As everybody loves to do as a parent
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,640	| IOT139 |	Can use it to teacher
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,688	| IOT139 |	Decode style tell you
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:21,504	| IOT139 |	When my daughter saw the learn-to-code feature shoes
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,040	| IOT139 |	I want this again
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:25,856	| IOT139 |	She's a little over it
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:30,720	| IOT139 |	But it's so easy to use I made her set everything up she was totally fine my daughter is 11
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,000	| IOT139 |	So she's a little out of the age
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,304	| IOT139 |	But she said it was fun
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:34,816	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,352	| IOT139 |	2999
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,400	| IOT139 |	Fun little present you can get for a kid
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,728	| IOT139 |	The other is
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:46,336	| IOT139 |	For the older set and that is the littlebits R2D2 Droid inventor kit
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:47,616	| IOT139 |	For a hundred bucks
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,176	| IOT139 |	And I have not tried this
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,712	| IOT139 |	So this is one of those that we
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,736	| IOT139 |	We have not tried
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:56,064	| IOT139 |	But I have use a little bit stuff extensively
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,832	| IOT139 |	And it's
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,600	| IOT139 |	Awesome
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,880	| IOT139 |	It's well put together
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,648	| IOT139 |	My daughter loves her Lil
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,184	| IOT139 |	And so
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:04,512	| IOT139 |	What does kit is is you build a little R2D2
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,280	| IOT139 |	So cute
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,304	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,096	| IOT139 |	You get all these parts
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,376	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,936	| IOT139 |	An app that goes with it and you basically
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:14,240	| IOT139 |	Build it I don't know how to say that you build the
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,264	| IOT139 |	Little Droid
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,800	| IOT139 |	And then you learn how to use all these other
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,336	| IOT139 |	Parts so
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:26,016	| IOT139 |	I kind of want this to get a little 12-inch artoo-detoo is got a Servo control of a DC motor proximity sensor
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,808	| IOT139 |	A lot of fun with us
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,368	| IOT139 |	It's a little nicer
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,648	| IOT139 |	We've had the little bit
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,696	| IOT139 |	Like they make a kit
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,720	| IOT139 |	It has all of this stuff in
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:41,120	| IOT139 |	And you can buy that use that but it's not sometimes for kids without a project idea
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:43,936	| IOT139 |	This is nice because it gives them something to build for
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:48,032	| IOT139 |	But then they can always use these parts with the other little bit stuff and
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,568	| IOT139 |	How to start building their own stuff after
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,592	| IOT139 |	Switches
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,896	| IOT139 |	QR
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,664	| IOT139 |	Cute
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,432	| IOT139 |	OtterBox
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,480	| IOT139 |	Verisign kid tested mom
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,016	| IOT139 |	Who used to say that
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,808	| IOT139 |	I forget but I
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:02,112	| IOT139 |	I can remember the commercial that I've heard it a gazillion times
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,648	| IOT139 |	You did not come up with that Stacy
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:06,464	| IOT139 |	All right to the stocking stuffer
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:14,912	| IOT139 |	Well you cannot go wrong with a Bluetooth tracking device in my opinion I mean these things are like the size of a roughly a quarter quarter
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,936	| IOT139 |	Dollar and
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:22,848	| IOT139 |	You can attach them to bags you can attach them to weave hatching the keys actually attached one to my mailbox key so that
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:25,152	| IOT139 |	Play we all know where the mailbox key is cuz
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:28,224	| IOT139 |	Somebody in and I won't name names but I usually leave it in my
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:30,784	| IOT139 |	Pants pocket after getting the mail and then nobody can get the mail
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,344	| IOT139 |	So I'm going to recommend the tracker
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,112	| IOT139 |	Pixel
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,672	| IOT139 |	Which is the newer model the old Bravo as I think
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,464	| IOT139 |	Tumi be discontinued but the pixels
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,768	| IOT139 |	Are now the latest model
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:45,888	| IOT139 |	You can listen to make noise using your phone so that way you can find whatever you're attached to
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:50,240	| IOT139 |	They're speaking the Bluetooth in your phone to get closer and closer to them so you don't lose anything
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,824	| IOT139 |	Right now looks like they're on sale 5 pack and be found
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,872	| IOT139 |	4999 so 10 bucks
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:59,200	| IOT139 |	Apopka attach to whatever it is that you need to keep track of
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:02,016	| IOT139 |	You got a Bluetooth tracker makes it easy to find whatever you need
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,808	| IOT139 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,344	| IOT139 |	Now here's my controversial pic
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:08,160	| IOT139 |	I know that you know that I do not own this
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,696	| IOT139 |	I have played with it
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| IOT139 |	In the beta store
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:13,280	| IOT139 |	And I will also say that I
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| IOT139 |	Can't say it cuz my husband listens
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,352	| IOT139 |	Cast but I might get this
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,656	| IOT139 |	So this is the floss time
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:20,448	| IOT139 |	This is a $40 device
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| IOT139 |	Granted
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,008	| IOT139 |	It's a little silly
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:27,872	| IOT139 |	This is for people like me who don't floss as religiously as they should
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,640	| IOT139 |	It is a
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:35,552	| IOT139 |	Pretty looking device that you stick on your mirror and basically every night it looks at you and it gives you an LED :-) or
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:40,160	| IOT139 |	Turn LED sad faces smiley faces if you pull out the floss and presumably floss your teeth
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:43,232	| IOT139 |	And is this something that would motivate me to floss my teeth
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:44,512	| IOT139 |	It actually proud
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,584	| IOT139 |	I would want to smile at me
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:53,472	| IOT139 |	Also I would be like somewhere there's a server that says oh my God she never fought this
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,264	| IOT139 |	Validation
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| IOT139 |	Yeah I don't
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,312	| IOT139 |	Most of my things
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,336	| IOT139 |	What's flossing
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:05,760	| IOT139 |	You know if you have kids you can get for them and
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,272	| IOT139 |	They have little
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,064	| IOT139 |	Snap-on covers the earth
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,088	| IOT139 |	I like frogs and stuff
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,600	| IOT139 |	Never cute
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,696	| IOT139 |	That you do have to buy a special
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,208	| IOT139 |	Show results
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,024	| IOT139 |	So is this
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,560	| IOT139 |	Smokin hot deals
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,352	| IOT139 |	Is this a really interesting device
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,400	| IOT139 |	Yeah
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:25,472	| IOT139 |	40 bucks
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:26,496	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:31,104	| IOT139 |	Stocking stuffer is for the smart home Aficionado in your
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,152	| IOT139 |	Who is likes to touched
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,200	| IOT139 |	Mike's buttons
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,224	| IOT139 |	Which totally describes me
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,040	| IOT139 |	So this is the fibaro Z-Wave button

EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,616	| IOT139 |	Rhythm
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,384	| IOT139 |	This
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:10,688	| IOT139 |	Is an awesome product that one of my friends house and I played
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,968	| IOT139 |	It for like an hour and I love it
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:17,600	| IOT139 |	It is $230 for the starter kit it is both homekit and
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,648	| IOT139 |	Madam a enabled
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| IOT139 |	Plus there's an app
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,440	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:25,536	| IOT139 |	It what are these are these like six triangles that are connected to the internet
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,816	| IOT139 |	Colors
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,584	| IOT139 |	You
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:30,144	| IOT139 |	Can set them up in a pattern so it's like artwork
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,424	| IOT139 |	Aura night light
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:34,752	| IOT139 |	It's brighter than a night light but it's pretty non-functional
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,032	| IOT139 |	It's just cool
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,056	| IOT139 |	Is this how you spell
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:39,360	| IOT139 |	Spotted it dances to music
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,128	| IOT139 |	That's the Rhythm
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,688	| IOT139 |	This pretty sweet
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:45,248	| IOT139 |	And you can control it control base features with
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,064	| IOT139 |	So I like this
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,600	| IOT139 |	The really neat looking like.
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:51,904	| IOT139 |	I don't like you said their triangular and then
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,696	| IOT139 |	You get these little connectors and you just
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:57,536	| IOT139 |	Daisy chain them together in any pattern that you want and then
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:00,864	| IOT139 |	Let me see you can constantly change the light panel in your house it's kind of
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,400	| IOT139 |	It's just like a really in
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,168	| IOT139 |	Interesting
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| IOT139 |	Transport up to 30
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,728	| IOT139 |	Panels on one
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:08,800	| IOT139 |	A lot
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:10,848	| IOT139 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:18,528	| IOT139 |	I get the duty of explaining why something cost $1,500 is
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,808	| IOT139 |	On our list
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:25,952	| IOT139 |	The June oven I know we've talked about it so many times you had that you had
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,512	| IOT139 |	Because Stacy bought hers then
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:32,096	| IOT139 |	She told me about it I'm like maybe I'll try this for my wife
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:36,192	| IOT139 |	My wife loves it and we use it every single day
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:41,312	| IOT139 |	So if on the off chance you haven't heard about it the June oven is a Smart Oven
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,336	| IOT139 |	It looks like a
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,128	| IOT139 |	Big toaster oven
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:46,688	| IOT139 |	Not something to put a 20lb turkey in
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:51,808	| IOT139 |	But for most other things it's perfectly fine I've got ceramic heating element it's got a
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:54,112	| IOT139 |	Built-in camera inside the oven
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:58,976	| IOT139 |	It runs on Android it's got a nice really nice looking touch screen panel to
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:05,888	| IOT139 |	Put any presets in or change the temperature or set the timer it even now works with Madam a so I know
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,656	| IOT139 |	SA
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:11,008	| IOT139 |	Pay meteme preheat the June oven for me and I wanted to stunt it it's great
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:16,640	| IOT139 |	Really interesting in that they have a food database so when it recognizes the food that you put in
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:22,784	| IOT139 |	It literally knows how long to cook it and it tells you either you're on your smartphone or on my Apple watch reasonable
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,576	| IOT139 |	The food is done it just
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:27,648	| IOT139 |	I have not been able to cook something poorly with a just Cooks
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:32,768	| IOT139 |	Perfect for us every single time and recently I love that they've added new recipes
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:37,376	| IOT139 |	They will walk you through how to make something and then you just put in the oven and boom it's done
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:40,448	| IOT139 |	So couldn't recommend it enough for use it every single day
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,728	| IOT139 |	My husband even
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,520	| IOT139 |	Hey are you going to put the June on this list
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,544	| IOT139 |	As like
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:47,104	| IOT139 |	Okay good
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,920	| IOT139 |	So the non-smartphone loving people in our lives
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,200	| IOT139 |	It is pricey
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:52,736	| IOT139 |	The crazy expensive
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:56,320	| IOT139 |	Finally in the crazy expensive
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:56,832	| IOT139 |	SeaTac
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,160	| IOT139 |	Throw this out here cuz I've wanted one for like a year
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,440	| IOT139 |	You're in a half
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,720	| IOT139 |	Almost two years actually
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,000	| IOT139 |	Because I first saw that CSN
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:05,536	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,840	| IOT139 |	Almost two years the cleverpet
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,888	| IOT139 |	This is a $300
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,912	| IOT139 |	Connected
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:12,192	| IOT139 |	Toys for your
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:12,960	| IOT139 |	Dog
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,240	| IOT139 |	It's like Simple Simon
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:17,056	| IOT139 |	To treat dispensing Simple Simon
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,640	| IOT139 |	4 less than 20
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,152	| IOT139 |	4 hours
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,200	| IOT139 |	I'm recommending it because I've already had two
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:26,528	| IOT139 |	Your dog may not like
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:31,392	| IOT139 |	This is kind of a crazy
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,184	| IOT139 |	Purchase but I put it on here because
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:34,720	| IOT139 |	ICarly
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:35,744	| IOT139 |	It's kind of Awesome
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,024	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:39,840	| IOT139 |	You know if your dog goes for it I could see them really going
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,632	| IOT139 |	For it and it it's so far entertain my dog
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:48,288	| IOT139 |	It's got like three lights built-ins as you said Simple Simon and the Dogwood n Tryon
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:49,824	| IOT139 |	Hit the Light
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,872	| IOT139 |	You're the lights get the food
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,200	| IOT139 |	The end goal is the lights will go off in a pattern
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,016	| IOT139 |	And your dog will mimic that pattern to
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,040	| IOT139 |	Get a treat dispenser
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,552	| IOT139 |	Do it nice
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,624	| IOT139 |	He's at the stage where it will
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,392	| IOT139 |	Hit
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:04,416	| IOT139 |	The light
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:05,184	| IOT139 |	To get the tree
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,488	| IOT139 |	Again we are only
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,024	| IOT139 |	Flowers in
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:09,792	| IOT139 |	So
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:10,816	| IOT139 |	It seems dirty
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:12,352	| IOT139 |	My dog has already attacked it
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,424	| IOT139 |	I want the treats
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,960	| IOT139 |	I'm like forget the lights

EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:32,224	| IOT139 |	What a really appropriate question right ahead of the holidays
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:32,736	| IOT139 |	And
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,016	| IOT139 |	We can only answer half
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:39,136	| IOT139 |	Because while I am very familiar with outdoor modules and
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:39,904	| IOT139 |	Light control
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:42,464	| IOT139 |	Living in Texas I have no sense
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:44,000	| IOT139 |	I didn't even know you could actually put things on your
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:50,400	| IOT139 |	I got to get rid of that ice and snow in Canada
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,168	| IOT139 |	Nothing
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:51,936	| IOT139 |	Popped out at
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,984	| IOT139 |	I think so if anyone knows
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,776	| IOT139 |	And lives in the great Frozen North
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:59,104	| IOT139 |	And has an automated or connected solution to
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:03,456	| IOT139 |	Heating cables on roofs hey info at iot podcast. Calm and we will share that
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:06,528	| IOT139 |	So question
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,064	| IOT139 |	Many people will benefit from
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,344	| IOT139 |	Outdoor holiday lighting
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,136	| IOT139 |	And how to make it smart
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,160	| IOT139 |	I have
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,696	| IOT139 |	Options
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,744	| IOT139 |	The first is what I have used for the last
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,328	| IOT139 |	Which is the Jasco Z-Wave
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,376	| IOT139 |	On off outdoor module
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,912	| IOT139 |	He's our big ugly and
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:25,728	| IOT139 |	Again might have been working for three years so there
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,776	| IOT139 |	According to your number for in
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:29,056	| IOT139 |	I just keep buying more
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,592	| IOT139 |	I keep adding more lights
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,872	| IOT139 |	Please work with
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,408	| IOT139 |	SmartThings with wink
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,432	| IOT139 |	With any hub
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:37,504	| IOT139 |	Speaks Z-Wave so that's where all of you guys who have that capability
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:38,784	| IOT139 |	If you don't
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,320	| IOT139 |	There are now
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| IOT139 |	Wonderful new options
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,624	| IOT139 |	That I have not
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,160	| IOT139 |	But
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:46,720	| IOT139 |	So I would recommend these are all in the same price range
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:49,792	| IOT139 |	The Z-Wave ones are 35 they get more expensive actually
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,816	| IOT139 |	Closer to Holiday
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,584	| IOT139 |	You might pay as much as
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,888	| IOT139 |	But I also see in these are
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,168	| IOT139 |	Well rated
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:59,264	| IOT139 |	The G by outdoor WiFi plugs that work with Madam
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,288	| IOT139 |	And with an app
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:02,336	| IOT139 |	I would recommend an app go mad at me all the way
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,664	| IOT139 |	Wifi-enabled
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,944	| IOT139 |	Switches they have to
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,968	| IOT139 |	They are also
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:12,064	| IOT139 |	Outdoor rated make sure you use outdoor-rated ones though case cuz you don't want to mess around
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,856	| IOT139 |	Not appropriate
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:17,184	| IOT139 |	Covers for your lights cuz if they're GFI they're going to go off in
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:19,488	| IOT139 |	Miss out on your holiday lighting
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:22,048	| IOT139 |	So the options on the Wi-Fi front
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:26,656	| IOT139 |	IHome also makes a Wi-Fi one for 40 bucks that only has one Outlet
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,680	| IOT139 |	Which may or may not
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:30,240	| IOT139 |	Be fine for you and again Wifi works
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,800	| IOT139 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,592	| IOT139 |	And Siri voice
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,128	| IOT139 |	Which means it has a
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:38,176	| IOT139 |	For the home
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,968	| IOT139 |	People I devices also make
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,760	| IOT139 |	An outdoor
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:42,528	| IOT139 |	Module
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:44,576	| IOT139 |	It is $70 usually
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,880	| IOT139 |	It's between 60 and $75 to pen
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:52,256	| IOT139 |	It has two outlets so if that's something you could take advantage of its basically like
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:55,840	| IOT139 |	If you've got two right next to each other you might as well just get that one
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:56,352	| IOT139 |	And you
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:57,632	| IOT139 |	Consolidating
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:58,144	| IOT139 |	The same price
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:01,472	| IOT139 |	Those are your options for outdoor lighting
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,520	| IOT139 |	My other Pro tip
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,288	| IOT139 |	For you
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,312	| IOT139 |	Is
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:10,944	| IOT139 |	Instead of doing if you got a mixed-media like you've got a bunch of different options like in Dora
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,480	| IOT139 |	Maybe switches made for
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,784	| IOT139 |	From somebody else put it all through voice can
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| IOT139 |	Sedgwick
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,088	| IOT139 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:18,112	| IOT139 |	Spell routine
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:20,928	| IOT139 |	Build the scene through Amazon a
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:23,232	| IOT139 |	Are do it with homekit so you can just
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,000	| IOT139 |	Activate
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:27,072	| IOT139 |	Because if your house is anything like mine what it is
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:28,608	| IOT139 |	Will end up with this like I'll just tell
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,632	| IOT139 |	I have seven
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| IOT139 |	Or a
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,424	| IOT139 |	I think I have eight
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:31,936	| IOT139 |	Christmas light
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:33,472	| IOT139 |	All play
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,520	| IOT139 |	So I just group them all on
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:36,800	| IOT139 |	And then I'm like
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:37,568	| IOT139 |	Madam
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,592	| IOT139 |	Turn on
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,360	| IOT139 |	Christmas
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,640	| IOT139 |	And that poop everything comes out
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,944	| IOT139 |	And if you're crazy like me you can also do
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,224	| IOT139 |	Matinee
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:46,272	| IOT139 |	Turn on Christmas Eve which for me is like
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| IOT139 |	Quieter setting
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:48,832	| IOT139 |	So it's
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,112	| IOT139 |	Like a little less festive
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,648	| IOT139 |	Pure lights just for Christmas Eve
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,440	| IOT139 |	That is my advice to you
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:55,232	| IOT139 |	Again heating information
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,536	| IOT139 |	If you know any things
