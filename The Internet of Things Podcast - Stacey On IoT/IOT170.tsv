EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,640	| IOT170 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,920	| IOT170 |	We're going to start this off
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,688	| IOT170 |	With
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:55,456	| IOT170 |	Justin
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:57,504	| IOT170 |	Really Grim story in
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| IOT170 |	Honestly
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,808	| IOT170 |	I didn't think about this so
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:03,392	| IOT170 |	This weekend the New York Times did a story about how
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,160	| IOT170 |	People worrying
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:09,024	| IOT170 |	Abusive relationships how their abusers take advantage of smart home
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,536	| IOT170 |	Technology tool
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:14,400	| IOT170 |	Make their Partners lives even more difficult so they talk about setting the heat to lie
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,680	| IOT170 |	100 +
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,728	| IOT170 |	Locking people out of their house in
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| IOT170 |	It sounds like a nightmare
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:20,800	| IOT170 |	This was
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:27,200	| IOT170 |	A really sad started to read it and it got me to rethink how I Implement devices in my own home with my family
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:30,272	| IOT170 |	Happy family there's no piece of relationship here
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT170 |	But
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:37,696	| IOT170 |	I again I rethought how I do things and how I communicate what devices I'm putting in place and why
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:44,096	| IOT170 |	And who has access and so on and so forth but if you're in an abusive relationship like this and
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,656	| IOT170 |	Your home is being turned against you whether it's
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:52,288	| IOT170 |	You're being listened to all the time monitor through your microphone enabled webcams or is she said
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,336	| IOT170 |	Thermostat changes that
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,360	| IOT170 |	Make the
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:59,456	| IOT170 |	You know you're home environment miserable or you're locked out of your house you know
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,760	| IOT170 |	There's no easy answer here to
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,600	| IOT170 |	Stop that from happening if you're in that situation and that's the scary part
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,416	| IOT170 |	Yashow Kevin is put up a story on the website
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,696	| IOT170 |	Talked about this a little bit
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,512	| IOT170 |	You know you mentioned
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| IOT170 |	Best way to
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,816	| IOT170 |	Do this is have access to your router
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:15,840	| IOT170 |	So you can
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:23,008	| IOT170 |	Yeah because it's a control thing this is all about control and if you don't have control over the devices if you can get
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:26,592	| IOT170 |	I control over the centralized point of communication for those devices
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,616	| IOT170 |	Meaning the router
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:34,528	| IOT170 |	Then you know at least you can see what devices are on the network and you may not even know that's the scary part.
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,808	| IOT170 |	Could be being monitored
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,088	| IOT170 |	And not even know it
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:43,232	| IOT170 |	There could be hidden networks like we're putting place in you again don't know so access to the router I think
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,304	| IOT170 |	If you can and you would suggested
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,584	| IOT170 |	Even
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,656	| IOT170 |	Hard resetting the router to stop devices from
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,448	| IOT170 |	Having access work at least temporarily
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,984	| IOT170 |	Yeah and this is
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,264	| IOT170 |	Maybe
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,824	| IOT170 |	I don't know maybe you're packing to get out or something
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,128	| IOT170 |	I looked into hard reset
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,176	| IOT170 |	Isis and
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,992	| IOT170 |	The best option for someone who doesn't have access to the
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,784	| IOT170 |	Router or the apps are going to be
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT170 |	Things that
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,600	| IOT170 |	Don't require you to have the app so
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,136	| IOT170 |	Nest for example
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,160	| IOT170 |	Are there thermostats
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,720	| IOT170 |	You can hard reset your nest which
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| IOT170 |	Erase all your settings never
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,815	| IOT170 |	And this is not a great solution
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,095	| IOT170 |	Because whoever you're living with
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,447	| IOT170 |	You can just press your thermostat
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,471	| IOT170 |	Ring you open the
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,519	| IOT170 |	Under settings
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,311	| IOT170 |	Reset it
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:29,823	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:36,735	| IOT170 |	I'm pretty sure I can do that with the ecobee I have install as well and the whole point is you're looking for ways to reset these devices
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,759	| IOT170 |	Either without the app
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:43,647	| IOT170 |	Without access to the the app you know you may have the app which might not be able to do certain things to do administrative privileges
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,975	| IOT170 |	And if your Echo device you just pop a paperclip
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,487	| IOT170 |	Into
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,511	| IOT170 |	The reset button
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,887	| IOT170 |	It depends on the device
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,447	| IOT170 |	But there's a little hole and if you stick up
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:56,959	| IOT170 |	Paper clip in
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:59,007	| IOT170 |	The light Rings going to turn on and off
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,543	| IOT170 |	And then
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,079	| IOT170 |	You can't actually re-registered if you
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,359	| IOT170 |	I have the app on
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,383	| IOT170 |	But at least that
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:05,919	| IOT170 |	Deregister
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,199	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,735	| IOT170 |	Factory resetting your loxism
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,247	| IOT170 |	A little harder you
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,271	| IOT170 |	I need the app for
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,551	| IOT170 |	August lock
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,111	| IOT170 |	That's because he's our outside
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| IOT170 |	Your house and they don't want somebody
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,695	| IOT170 |	A thief could come in
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,207	| IOT170 |	Reset your lock
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:25,119	| IOT170 |	From the outside right you could it mean if you have the right tools you could actually remove and replace
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:28,447	| IOT170 |	That's a pretty extreme step with baby that is useful in
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,239	| IOT170 |	Your particular case it's hard to say
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:35,615	| IOT170 |	I mean you can rip out all the smart home care I called it the nuclear option but again
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,151	| IOT170 |	Crab repercussions when
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,479	| IOT170 |	The abuser finds out which they certainly will very quickly
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,503	| IOT170 |	So yeah
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,783	| IOT170 |	Heidi Lynn
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| IOT170 |	Kevin and I
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:47,647	| IOT170 |	Because we have so much stuff in our homes I'll tell you my husband actually doesn't
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| IOT170 |	Apps forever
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| IOT170 |	Iinstaller
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,743	| IOT170 |	I offer it to him
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:52,767	| IOT170 |	He's kind of
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,095	| IOT170 |	And I joke sometimes that he calls me
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,119	| IOT170 |	He can't
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,679	| IOT170 |	He's calling me when I'm out of town cuz
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,191	| IOT170 |	The lights don't work
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,031	| IOT170 |	Never thought about that
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,079	| IOT170 |	Using that so Kevin came up with some
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,871	| IOT170 |	Basic good practices for
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| IOT170 |	Partners
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,503	| IOT170 |	It's not going to solve the main issue but
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,271	| IOT170 |	Youku
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:18,111	| IOT170 |	Potentially proactively avoid this issue if
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,159	| IOT170 |	Like I'm going to start doing more of
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,695	| IOT170 |	I plan to talk
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:25,535	| IOT170 |	About whatever device I plan to put on the network with my family
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:31,935	| IOT170 |	And offer them you know the same rights that I have first of all I want to make sure they understand what device is going
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,959	| IOT170 |	What it's going to do
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:37,055	| IOT170 |	What information is going to gather and send to me or to them you know if they choose to
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:41,919	| IOT170 |	Accept the invitation the app and that way they understand exactly what's here
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,455	| IOT170 |	Because he'll know what
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,759	| IOT170 |	Could potentially be used against them
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:48,063	| IOT170 |	God forbid something happened in our relationship
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,647	| IOT170 |	Yeah I just want them to have the same information and rice that I have
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,463	| IOT170 |	Again I would never plan to do this but I want them to
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,767	| IOT170 |	Joe comfortable with everything in their house
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:02,399	| IOT170 |	And if they're not I've decided you know what I'm just gonna start putting stuff in my home office where they typically don't go
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:09,311	| IOT170 |	Man that's fine for testing and I may not be able to get all the features and so on so forth you know but that's okay they need to be comfortable in their own home
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:12,895	| IOT170 |	So proactively those are two of the steps that I'll be taken with my family
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,199	| IOT170 |	Yes and I've always done that
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,991	| IOT170 |	Like my daughter actually doesn't want smart thing
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,551	| IOT170 |	Bedroom she's told me
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,599	| IOT170 |	Looks like no just don't install it
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,623	| IOT170 |	Okay.
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,903	| IOT170 |	Not until she does have an echo
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:24,927	| IOT170 |	Because she wants
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,463	| IOT170 |	And now she has a smart
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,487	| IOT170 |	Because she
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,535	| IOT170 |	But she had to come out
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,583	| IOT170 |	So yeah
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,887	| IOT170 |	There's no easy solution air
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:34,911	| IOT170 |	Yeah this is
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,239	| IOT170 |	People
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,335	| IOT170 |	That is on that so let us talk now about
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:42,847	| IOT170 |	W
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,639	| IOT170 |	Re
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,711	| IOT170 |	Wi-Fi Alliance announced this week
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,015	| IOT170 |	A new security protocol
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| IOT170 |	Free wifi
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:59,487	| IOT170 |	It's about time since WPA2 has had its fair share of soles for quite some time in
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:05,887	| IOT170 |	It was back in 2011 that the Wi-Fi protected setup that button you would hit that would scan
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:11,519	| IOT170 |	For devices you hit the button on your router and pet access to all the new devices on network that could be Brute Force
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:15,103	| IOT170 |	Pact with as little as 11,000 guesses of the PIN
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,871	| IOT170 |	Which
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,663	| IOT170 |	That's not very secure for a
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT170 |	Protected secure
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,247	| IOT170 |	Set up so this is long overdue
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| IOT170 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,551	| IOT170 |	And
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,575	| IOT170 |	Vacation
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,623	| IOT170 |	And it's actually been used in mesh net
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,415	| IOT170 |	Other people's
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,719	| IOT170 |	Now
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| IOT170 |	This is going to
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,327	| IOT170 |	Address of The Brute Force attack issues so that'll be nice
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| IOT170 |	And
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,143	| IOT170 |	The downside to this is
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,495	| IOT170 |	Chant
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,287	| IOT170 |	It's not an existing router so
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,055	| IOT170 |	If you want this
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,591	| IOT170 |	Going to have to buy some
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,687	| IOT170 |	Which if you just got it Like Us excited about mesh routers
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,455	| IOT170 |	You just bought a metro
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,551	| IOT170 |	What
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,063	| IOT170 |	Terror
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:02,463	| IOT170 |	Two things that I would say one it's a perfect time for her router makers time
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:08,863	| IOT170 |	Introduce Smart Hub Smart's two routers because now they're going to have a whole upgrade wave of routers
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,399	| IOT170 |	Even if you
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:16,799	| IOT170 |	Buying new device that supports wpa3 and I believe LG smartphones will support
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:20,383	| IOT170 |	This year it's okay because that will always fall back
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,919	| IOT170 |	To WPA2
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:28,319	| IOT170 |	So you won't have all the new security features of wpa3 but you don't necessarily need to
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,623	| IOT170 |	Upgrade your router to still use the device on your home network
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,927	| IOT170 |	Yes and if you buy these
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,439	| IOT170 |	New Riders
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,535	| IOT170 |	Nothing else to think
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,583	| IOT170 |	It is backwards compatible
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,119	| IOT170 |	But
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,911	| IOT170 |	Someone to what extent
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,263	| IOT170 |	Fluorite
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,567	| IOT170 |	But in other news for iot
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,615	| IOT170 |	People the Wi-Fi Alliance also introducing the
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| IOT170 |	Easy Connect
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,199	| IOT170 |	Which is really nice
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,759	| IOT170 |	Because basically you snap a picture of a QR code
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,039	| IOT170 |	And then you can
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,319	| IOT170 |	Connect a device to
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,087	| IOT170 |	Your WiFi
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:08,255	| IOT170 |	And that's that's good that's actually how you connect certain devices to your network today I know that
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:11,327	| IOT170 |	There's a QR code on the bottom of Google home Mini
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:18,239	| IOT170 |	Homekit devices have a numerical but also you can scan a QR code to app so that makes total sense
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,519	| IOT170 |	Sakura witch
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,311	| IOT170 |	They say it is we will see
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,591	| IOT170 |	I'm sure someone
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| IOT170 |	How long till attack
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,735	| IOT170 |	All right
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,247	| IOT170 |	Tesla
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| IOT170 |	They have a new
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,575	| IOT170 |	Pricing model
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,367	| IOT170 |	For data so anybody who has a test
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| IOT170 |	Mary called it
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,927	| IOT170 |	You basically had
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:40,255	| IOT170 |	I know when I bought mine they would like to have four years of data free
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:44,351	| IOT170 |	And then you'll have to pay for it and I'm like how much is it there like we don't know yet
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,423	| IOT170 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| IOT170 |	I hope
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:55,871	| IOT170 |	So I've been actually Loki worrying about that for a while cuz you know the
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| IOT170 |	They kind of have me over
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,431	| IOT170 |	Barrel I totally need internet
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,455	| IOT170 |	Connectivity for
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:10:59,967	| IOT170 |	My car
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,551	| IOT170 |	A lot of the functions that has relies not just on Wi-Fi
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,599	| IOT170 |	In my garage but also cellular
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:07,903	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,439	| IOT170 |	How's it going to work
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| IOT170 |	Apparently people who bought their cars will not have to
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| IOT170 |	If you were buying a new one
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,863	| IOT170 |	No you get a certain amount of time
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,167	| IOT170 |	Use basic data
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,447	| IOT170 |	And that will always be
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,263	| IOT170 |	But if you want to use like real time
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| IOT170 |	Traffic
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,567	| IOT170 |	Views if you want to do
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| IOT170 |	Do you like Street View maps
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,127	| IOT170 |	Data-intensive app
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| IOT170 |	Applications
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| IOT170 |	Then you will pay
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,711	| IOT170 |	$100
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:39,135	| IOT170 |	So for the basic you'll like still be able to get maps and routing you just won't get say the traffic the real time
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,159	| IOT170 |	Hondata
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:44,511	| IOT170 |	So your car will still function and do lovely things for you it just won't be
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,047	| IOT170 |	I'll tell you that
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,815	| IOT170 |	Traffic
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,607	| IOT170 |	But you do have it on your phone so
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,167	| IOT170 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:56,287	| IOT170 |	If there's something I couldn't get on my phone then I would consider getting this if I had a test what would I do not
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,567	| IOT170 |	I wonder
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,847	| IOT170 |	If you can connect
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,175	| IOT170 |	Your car to your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:07,039	| IOT170 |	In which case you don't need to pay the $100 a year but it is a little clunky
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,343	| IOT170 |	Now also
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,879	| IOT170 |	It includes the fancy package
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,671	| IOT170 |	Including car streaming
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,463	| IOT170 |	Media and music so
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| IOT170 |	Prior to that it's been
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,535	| IOT170 |	And also the intern
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,071	| IOT170 |	Which I personally have
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,839	| IOT170 |	I have never used in my
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:20,863	| IOT170 |	But
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,399	| IOT170 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:28,799	| IOT170 |	Let me know how many people drive without the phone I know I don't think there's a big push to move certain smartphone
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| IOT170 |	Activities while you're on-the-go
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,895	| IOT170 |	Saline to the car so you can leave the phone behind
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,199	| IOT170 |	Nobody's more conveniently
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,479	| IOT170 |	Like being able to skip a song
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| IOT170 |	You know and have it
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,551	| IOT170 |	Run from 1 places
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,063	| IOT170 |	Supposed to on your phone
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,343	| IOT170 |	It's kind of nice
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,671	| IOT170 |	There's a huge screen in your Tesla so
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| IOT170 |	If you're navigating
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:46,719	| IOT170 |	When you want to look
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,255	| IOT170 |	For real-time nav
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,791	| IOT170 |	You know for real time
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,559	| IOT170 |	Traffic
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,071	| IOT170 |	It's nice to look
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,607	| IOT170 |	17 in
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,631	| IOT170 |	Sitting right there
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,471	| IOT170 |	Bissell you're going to pay $100 a year for
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,519	| IOT170 |	Is a convenience factor I'd say
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:04,383	| IOT170 |	But I like this model I think it's good because there is a lot of things that were unlike
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,175	| IOT170 |	How are you going to prove
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| IOT170 |	Activity for these things
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,735	| IOT170 |	Is it having
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:14,367	| IOT170 |	Some of these devices it's very easy to say hey it's a water sensor it's a wake-up this many times
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,903	| IOT170 |	X many bytes of data
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,183	| IOT170 |	So for that
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,463	| IOT170 |	I
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,487	| IOT170 |	Could price that into
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,511	| IOT170 |	Vice really well
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,559	| IOT170 |	Right I have a good sense of
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,071	| IOT170 |	What's going to happen
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,887	| IOT170 |	With some of the devices that have screens or
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,911	| IOT170 |	Things like that
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,703	| IOT170 |	It does become a little dicey
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,983	| IOT170 |	Like you can't really effective
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,751	| IOT170 |	Sleep rice that
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,543	| IOT170 |	Into the hardware cost of the
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,823	| IOT170 |	Device when someone buys
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,639	| IOT170 |	So this is kind
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,687	| IOT170 |	Gives you the functionality that you
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| IOT170 |	Expect for
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,735	| IOT170 |	Your device
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT170 |	Then offers you
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,295	| IOT170 |	It's your things
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:48,671	| IOT170 |	Yeah and they're not limiting how long you can use those fancy things if you want to stream
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,463	| IOT170 |	Audio near car over the web
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| IOT170 |	You could do that
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:56,863	| IOT170 |	Theoretically 7 by 24 not that you would and you're not paying like overages or anything like that
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,935	| IOT170 |	I like this
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,959	| IOT170 |	Nautica
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,727	| IOT170 |	Crazy thing I like
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,519	| IOT170 |	Tiered structure there
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| IOT170 |	I think we'll see
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,175	| IOT170 |	I don't know how many subscriptions I'm going to end up
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:12,991	| IOT170 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:17,855	| IOT170 |	Yes finally I mean I don't remember when
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:24,255	| IOT170 |	Amazon announced that's what they had said prior that they're bringing Madam a voice support to iOS
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,559	| IOT170 |	And they did this week and I tested it
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:32,959	| IOT170 |	So in the matter of a app there is no a button that you just tap and you don't need to say matinee or you just
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:38,335	| IOT170 |	Ask a question or say a command and she behaves just like she would in an echo device right on your iPhone
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:45,759	| IOT170 |	It's not always listening thing Apple will probably never allow that for right third-party digital assistant
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,039	| IOT170 |	I totally get that
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,831	| IOT170 |	One thing though I think
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:52,927	| IOT170 |	That Amazon is missing the boat on and hopefully there's an update to do this soon
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,975	| IOT170 |	A lot of iPhones have
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,255	| IOT170 |	Force Touch where you can
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:15:02,655	| IOT170 |	Hard press the screen on an app icon and get alternative options in all kinds of different things and if I do that on my
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,703	| IOT170 |	Google assistant app for iOS
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,007	| IOT170 |	There's a button that says speak to your Google assist
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,055	| IOT170 |	They don't do that for
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:14,175	| IOT170 |	Manamea on the anime app so I think it would be helpful to you just don't have to open the app that way
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,711	| IOT170 |	You just push press
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,247	| IOT170 |	So other than that
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,271	| IOT170 |	Works great
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:20,831	| IOT170 |	Took him forever to come out with it I don't know what took so long
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,111	| IOT170 |	Got it I don't understand
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,903	| IOT170 |	Use case for this but maybe it's cuz I don't have my phone
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,207	| IOT170 |	All the time I'm like I just shouted out
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,743	| IOT170 |	I guess it's 4 p.m.
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:31,839	| IOT170 |	No I mean if you're not at home and you want to turn on
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,631	| IOT170 |	Things that are connected to a matinee
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:41,823	| IOT170 |	You know or see who's home or you know what there's a ton of anything that she's connected to at home and you want to access remotely
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| IOT170 |	We should be able to do this way
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,663	| IOT170 |	OkCupid
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,479	| IOT170 |	That is like
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| IOT170 |	We talked about this
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,039	| IOT170 |	A couple
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,319	| IOT170 |	Weeks ago the wise camera
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,343	| IOT170 |	And
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,135	| IOT170 |	After I wrote cuz I was just
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,903	| IOT170 |	Appointed that I couldn't
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,415	| IOT170 |	Turn it off
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,743	| IOT170 |	I have like five people
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,863	| IOT170 |	I just plug it into a smart outlet
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:05,887	| IOT170 |	Then I
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,703	| IOT170 |	Sounds like
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,727	| IOT170 |	Target
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,311	| IOT170 |	Who is like me and just
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,847	| IOT170 |	Didn't see that
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,615	| IOT170 |	Thank you
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,127	| IOT170 |	Thank you
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,151	| IOT170 |	Twitter
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,687	| IOT170 |	Did see it and
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,967	| IOT170 |	Kind enough to put it out
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| IOT170 |	Smart listeners
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,831	| IOT170 |	Smart listeners and connect
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,159	| IOT170 |	So let's talk about basic news
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,719	| IOT170 |	. actually I think
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,767	| IOT170 |	We got a smart
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| IOT170 |	Stent
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,839	| IOT170 |	This is the device you stick in your
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| IOT170 |	And it
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,447	| IOT170 |	Holds your arteries open
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:41,983	| IOT170 |	Text several people
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,543	| IOT170 |	They are
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:48,127	| IOT170 |	Lovely except for they get clogged up just like your arteries do in
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,151	| IOT170 |	How to come out
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,687	| IOT170 |	Another surgery in
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,247	| IOT170 |	So this one
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:17:00,927	| IOT170 |	You this is wild this tent was created or designed to actually act as a large antenna
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,207	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:08,607	| IOT170 |	The stent itself the tubular stent is made up of wiring that just goes around and around around a form
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,655	| IOT170 |	Understand and there's a pressure monitor
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,959	| IOT170 |	Attached to this and that measures
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:18,591	| IOT170 |	I presume you the blood flow or the pressure on the artery and because of the antenna
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:21,407	| IOT170 |	That pressure information can be monitored
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,015	| IOT170 |	Exactly exactly
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:31,903	| IOT170 |	I look at this and it looks like a caterpillar to me because of the way it's designed with the whole design is an antenna that's just amazing
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| IOT170 |	Research project
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,255	| IOT170 |	Not actually out
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,399	| IOT170 |	You got to see it
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,679	| IOT170 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,471	| IOT170 |	The company called
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,239	| IOT170 |	Gets
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,263	| IOT170 |	24 million in
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,079	| IOT170 |	These guys on my podcast
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| IOT170 |	They have their sensors attached
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,687	| IOT170 |	Google Street View cars in
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,711	| IOT170 |	And we're measuring pollution in
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,271	| IOT170 |	It was a great project
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,575	| IOT170 |	I loved it because it talks about
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,623	| IOT170 |	Having air quality monitor
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,647	| IOT170 |	Ring sensors
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,927	| IOT170 |	Lower level is really
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,231	| IOT170 |	Because a lot of cities put them
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:07,743	| IOT170 |	Way high up
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| IOT170 |	People are breathing
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:11,839	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,143	| IOT170 |	That's one into being able to track
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,679	| IOT170 |	Very granular
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,703	| IOT170 |	Air pollutants
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,471	| IOT170 |	AR
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,751	| IOT170 |	How cities planned
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:21,311	| IOT170 |	Better so you can say oh my gosh this intersection is
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:21,823	| IOT170 |	Horribly
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,127	| IOT170 |	Let's see what we
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| IOT170 |	We can do to improve traffic flow
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,431	| IOT170 |	In this area for exam
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:27,711	| IOT170 |	Maybe we just plant more
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,271	| IOT170 |	I like what they're doing
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,551	| IOT170 |	They
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,063	| IOT170 |	Raised
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,903	| IOT170 |	More sensors are more cars and more places in
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,183	| IOT170 |	I love it
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT170 |	And
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,231	| IOT170 |	That is what I
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:41,791	| IOT170 |	Very cool
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,583	| IOT170 |	Meanwhile in Buda
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,887	| IOT170 |	He municipal smartness
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,447	| IOT170 |	Yes Meme
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,263	| IOT170 |	In Sydney Australia they are
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,055	| IOT170 |	Linksmart Park
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:55,359	| IOT170 |	Benches and I love this because
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:58,175	| IOT170 |	All of the benches and surrenders tables as well
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,455	| IOT170 |	Have sensors in them
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:05,599	| IOT170 |	That basically determine if the bench is being used if it's broken
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:11,743	| IOT170 |	That allows the local municipality to a keep track of
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:15,583	| IOT170 |	Any upkeep they need to do and get it taken care of faster but also
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,607	| IOT170 |	Tell them
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,423	| IOT170 |	How to better design public spaces right
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,215	| IOT170 |	What about that says
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:27,615	| IOT170 |	It's there's no user data collected Noah I'd personally identifiable user information it's not saying that Kevin is
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:30,175	| IOT170 |	Sitting on this bench and sat there from this time to this time
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,967	| IOT170 |	It's just saying that someone did
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,015	| IOT170 |	And that's pretty rare that we have
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:37,855	| IOT170 |	Batters new security issue here from a personal privacy standpoint
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,647	| IOT170 |	So that is brilliant
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:44,767	| IOT170 |	I would love to see more places to this I don't know how much it cost but it shouldn't be that expensive to add these
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:48,863	| IOT170 |	Pressure sensors and such to park benches and tables
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:52,959	| IOT170 |	Very curious to see what kind of data they get out of it and one for me how they use the data in the future
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,263	| IOT170 |	And now we'll move from smart
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| IOT170 |	Park benches
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:56,799	| IOT170 |	Too smart
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,311	| IOT170 |	Faucets
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:19:59,871	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,383	| IOT170 |	Delta
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,175	| IOT170 |	We got very excited about this
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,199	| IOT170 |	As we saw it
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,479	| IOT170 |	Imat ces
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| IOT170 |	Delta makes a
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,551	| IOT170 |	Bi-weekly means face
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:12,671	| IOT170 |	No it is it is it was cooler when I actually saw it
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:16,767	| IOT170 |	Retrofit kit
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,791	| IOT170 |	Touch2o faucet
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| IOT170 |	The retrofit
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,631	| IOT170 |	Vitamin A
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| IOT170 |	Faucet so this means it will talk to you
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:28,031	| IOT170 |	Everyone's like what why would I care
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| IOT170 |	But I'm going to tell you why you
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| IOT170 |	So I did this in
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,407	| IOT170 |	Back when we talked about it originally the
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,943	| IOT170 |	Pricing was about five hundred
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,455	| IOT170 |	Dollars was
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,735	| IOT170 |	Plan pricing
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,783	| IOT170 |	For this for a total faucet
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| IOT170 |	And adding
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,855	| IOT170 |	AC replace your existing
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,623	| IOT170 |	Faucet with this
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| IOT170 |	Touch to Dada
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,695	| IOT170 |	Capacitive touch faucet
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,719	| IOT170 |	Which I also
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,255	| IOT170 |	Just means to turn it on
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,119	| IOT170 |	So I happen to have a capacitive touch faucet
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| IOT170 |	He said it would be about
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,983	| IOT170 |	102
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,543	| IOT170 |	$120 but it is not on the market
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,311	| IOT170 |	Get this is a beta
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:02,591	| IOT170 |	They really wanted
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,383	| IOT170 |	Let me try it cuz I am soaked
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,407	| IOT170 |	Crazy about this kind of stuff
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| IOT170 |	And by they wanted
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:10,527	| IOT170 |	Stacy really try it means Stacy really want to try and they said okay
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,416	| IOT170 |	So this is
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,952	| IOT170 |	Is not something you can buy
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| IOT170 |	Eventually
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:22,048	| IOT170 |	I think it could be if we're going to have dealt actually to come on the show in a cup
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,376	| IOT170 |	The faucet
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,912	| IOT170 |	Installing it
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,448	| IOT170 |	Looked so scary
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:30,240	| IOT170 |	You guys cuz you had to turn off the water in
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,336	| IOT170 |	And you need to have power underneath your sink cuz
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,872	| IOT170 |	This is wifi-enabled
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,408	| IOT170 |	Wi-Fi sucks juice like
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,224	| IOT170 |	Business so beforehand I had batteries
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,736	| IOT170 |	Power Ranger
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,528	| IOT170 |	Batteries
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| IOT170 |	Not enough
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:43,808	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,088	| IOT170 |	I put under my sink
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,624	| IOT170 |	I do have power
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,392	| IOT170 |	Because I have a
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,160	| IOT170 |	Garbage disposal
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,440	| IOT170 |	In the dishwasher
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,208	| IOT170 |	Running off of
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:50,976	| IOT170 |	That's so yay for
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,792	| IOT170 |	I turn off the water in basic
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| IOT170 |	Glee you just
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| IOT170 |	I just remove
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,120	| IOT170 |	One module that was in between
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,400	| IOT170 |	Pipes and I stuck two more
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,704	| IOT170 |	Then I connect as a little ethernet
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,032	| IOT170 |	Because thanks need ethernet now you guys
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,568	| IOT170 |	And
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,104	| IOT170 |	Can you basically
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,640	| IOT170 |	Tested
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,176	| IOT170 |	And then you connect it to
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,712	| IOT170 |	Remind me account
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,480	| IOT170 |	And
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,760	| IOT170 |	I had a little trouble
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,040	| IOT170 |	Connecting
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,576	| IOT170 |	When it's set up a soft access point
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,880	| IOT170 |	And basically was like trying to
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,904	| IOT170 |	Connect the faucet itself
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| IOT170 |	But I work through that
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| IOT170 |	It was a weird glitch
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,352	| IOT170 |	And then
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,400	| IOT170 |	I was able to
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,424	| IOT170 |	Tell Madam a
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:34,496	| IOT170 |	Hey so hey. Ma ask Delta to turn on water
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:35,776	| IOT170 |	Turn on
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,056	| IOT170 |	Turn off
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,848	| IOT170 |	And there's about a 4 second delay
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,128	| IOT170 |	So this is not a great option
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,408	| IOT170 |	You know you're saying supper
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,224	| IOT170 |	May just run over faster
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,504	| IOT170 |	But is really cool
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:46,528	| IOT170 |	You can do things like
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:49,344	| IOT170 |	Hey Madam a ask Delta to dispense to
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,416	| IOT170 |	Does it does it does it accurately
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,184	| IOT170 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,744	| IOT170 |	You actually just heard the problem with
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,536	| IOT170 |	But this Witch is it's really hard to
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,816	| IOT170 |	Number to ask Delta
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,888	| IOT170 |	Yeah that's a problem with a lot of these skills
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| IOT170 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,704	| IOT170 |	So I struggle with my
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:05,728	| IOT170 |	Words
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:09,824	| IOT170 |	I struggle with my words like your words use your words
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,896	| IOT170 |	Once we got it down
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,664	| IOT170 |	Using it
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,944	| IOT170 |	Not as often as I thought we
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:17,248	| IOT170 |	But we do use it to
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,016	| IOT170 |	Phil
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:18,784	| IOT170 |	Things that
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,320	| IOT170 |	Are large
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:20,832	| IOT170 |	And you don't want to
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,624	| IOT170 |	You know like I don't want to stand there
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,160	| IOT170 |	Like a gallon of water
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,976	| IOT170 |	So I can just stick the bucket under there and just
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,256	| IOT170 |	Tell it to dispense a gallon
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:31,584	| IOT170 |	You can also go to the Delta website
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,864	| IOT170 |	There is not an app
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,168	| IOT170 |	Go to the Delta website
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,960	| IOT170 |	Dragon / 2
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,240	| IOT170 |	Home screen
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,592	| IOT170 |	But it shows you your
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,128	| IOT170 |	Check your water usage history so
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,664	| IOT170 |	So you can see how many gallons of water
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,688	| IOT170 |	Use for that sink
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,456	| IOT170 |	Canidae which is kind of
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,272	| IOT170 |	We'll see if you're building a new house I would
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| IOT170 |	Totally put this in
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,648	| IOT170 |	You can do custom
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:24:00,512	| IOT170 |	Type Phillips to like if you have a water bottle that has x amount of ounces capacity you could
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| IOT170 |	Shortcut that
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:05,376	| IOT170 |	Yes so I did create a shortcut I have a vase that I used to fill
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,400	| IOT170 |	Are fish tank
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,192	| IOT170 |	Water evaporate
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| IOT170 |	Take it slow
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,752	| IOT170 |	Can you treat the water in the
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:14,080	| IOT170 |	Right now I have a big face and it needs
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,104	| IOT170 |	11 + 1/2
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,872	| IOT170 |	Cups of water
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,664	| IOT170 |	So instead of saying 11 and 1/2
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:19,456	| IOT170 |	Half cup Cypress to set base
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:19,968	| IOT170 |	As my
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,760	| IOT170 |	A program database
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,296	| IOT170 |	And so now I just say
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,064	| IOT170 |	Matinee
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| IOT170 |	Ask Delta
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,368	| IOT170 |	To fill
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:26,880	| IOT170 |	Face
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,440	| IOT170 |	Nice
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,720	| IOT170 |	I have one question
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,536	| IOT170 |	The ethernet port
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,840	| IOT170 |	Is on the module that YouTube retrofitted
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:44,544	| IOT170 |	I'm just wondering if I need an ethernet port in my kitchen or something they connect to each other there's a module that controls
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,312	| IOT170 |	The capacitive
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,592	| IOT170 |	Touched and there's a module
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:47,616	| IOT170 |	Controls
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:54,784	| IOT170 |	Okay so no concern there of not having total airports in the kitchen you do not need
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,440	| IOT170 |	I liked
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,232	| IOT170 |	My family so far seems to

EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,208	| IOT170 |	Yeah we're going to tackle this into pieces
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,744	| IOT170 |	Because
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,024	| IOT170 |	There are two pieces
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:18,656	| IOT170 |	They don't work together so actually will just tell you to give up on the home
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,424	| IOT170 |	KIPP dream
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,472	| IOT170 |	Talk a little bit about this as we
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,032	| IOT170 |	Used
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,800	| IOT170 |	The Abode
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:27,872	| IOT170 |	Worse with lots of devices and they have a wonderful
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,640	| IOT170 |	List
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,920	| IOT170 |	On their website so I'll put
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,688	| IOT170 |	Link to that
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,712	| IOT170 |	In the show notes
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| IOT170 |	Of the devices
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:33,760	| IOT170 |	Is it safe to test
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,296	| IOT170 |	Works with both
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,064	| IOT170 |	Z-Wave Danzig
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,368	| IOT170 |	I noticed on there that they had the
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,392	| IOT170 |	Aeons
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,440	| IOT170 |	I love those
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,720	| IOT170 |	I think they're really good
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,488	| IOT170 |	Dancing very attract
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,280	| IOT170 |	They have
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,304	| IOT170 |	One of the and or sense
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:49,120	| IOT170 |	Gen 5 in that is a recessed door sensor
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,912	| IOT170 |	Answer so you can actually install that
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,936	| IOT170 |	Insider
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,704	| IOT170 |	Torso you
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,496	| IOT170 |	Holypop
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,288	| IOT170 |	And then you don't have these like we're
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| IOT170 |	Weird things on it
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:57,568	| IOT170 |	Exterior
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| IOT170 |	And makes
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,968	| IOT170 |	Water sensors door sensors
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:05,760	| IOT170 |	They do make light bulbs
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,040	| IOT170 |	Wouldn't be excited about that
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,064	| IOT170 |	So I wouldn't go there
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:08,832	| IOT170 |	For that
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,624	| IOT170 |	But I also saw that
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| IOT170 |	That they have
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,160	| IOT170 |	The linear
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:12,928	| IOT170 |	Garage door
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,208	| IOT170 |	Which you would
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| IOT170 |	About that
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,000	| IOT170 |	Kevin
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:17,792	| IOT170 |	What do you think about it
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:22,144	| IOT170 |	I like it it's very easy to install it's literally just adding
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,192	| IOT170 |	Plugging it into a power port
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,776	| IOT170 |	Jack and then connecting two wires to your garage door opener
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,800	| IOT170 |	You made a ladder
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,568	| IOT170 |	Probably
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:32,896	| IOT170 |	Unless you're really tall on like me but it's not a daunting install at all
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,176	| IOT170 |	It works very well
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:35,968	| IOT170 |	Correct
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:41,856	| IOT170 |	Is easy you mentioned door locks they have
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,880	| IOT170 |	This works actually with
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:43,648	| IOT170 |	Kwikset door
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| IOT170 |	Blocks the Z-Wave
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,208	| IOT170 |	Kwikset door locks I have those
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:47,232	| IOT170 |	They're fine
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,280	| IOT170 |	It also works with the Schlage door locks
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,328	| IOT170 |	And I'm not saying this because they sponsor this
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,656	| IOT170 |	Their door lock quality is better
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| IOT170 |	So
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:57,216	| IOT170 |	I would probably go with that if
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,776	| IOT170 |	That you're seriously concerned about
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,312	| IOT170 |	But it only works with the Z-Wave
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,872	| IOT170 |	So this is where it gets can
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,408	| IOT170 |	Using because Slade also Mesa
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:12,832	| IOT170 |	Louis Facebook swell several of these vendors make homekit devices that are not compatible and the reason
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,624	| IOT170 |	People understand
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,160	| IOT170 |	Very simple reason
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:20,000	| IOT170 |	Homekit only supports to radio protocols WiFi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,792	| IOT170 |	So you're never going to find
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:25,120	| IOT170 |	At least today a Z-Wave or zigbee device that works with
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,192	| IOT170 |	Myself so that's the issue
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,472	| IOT170 |	It is
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| IOT170 |	And
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:33,312	| IOT170 |	It also works with Nest devices ecobee devices
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,872	| IOT170 |	It works with your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,384	| IOT170 |	It works with Google
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| IOT170 |	So there's
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,456	| IOT170 |	A lot of things this is going
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,760	| IOT170 |	You're not going to have
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,808	| IOT170 |	That cool ability on your iPhone
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,856	| IOT170 |	Look and see who's at your
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,136	| IOT170 |	So that is
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,696	| IOT170 |	But that's what it works with
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,232	| IOT170 |	And it actually seems really
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,512	| IOT170 |	Good in
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,792	| IOT170 |	Again a lot of people
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,072	| IOT170 |	Like the security system so
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,352	| IOT170 |	Good luck to you Shana
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,912	| IOT170 |	And sorry to burst your bubble
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,472	| IOT170 |	Remember if you

EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:29,888	| IOT170 |	And we talked a lot about the legal
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,656	| IOT170 |	Background here
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,192	| IOT170 |	Tok also about what it

EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:22,880	| IOT170 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,416	| IOT170 |	Is Syracuse
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:27,488	| IOT170 |	Barbar who is the author of a book called
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:31,072	| IOT170 |	Habeas data and a reporter with ARs Technica
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,608	| IOT170 |	Hi Siri how are you doing
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:33,632	| IOT170 |	Hey what's going on
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:36,192	| IOT170 |	Man I am super excited about this be
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:39,776	| IOT170 |	Because I spent a lot of time thinking about all the crazy Gadget
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,544	| IOT170 |	Json stuff that I can
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:44,128	| IOT170 |	Can put in my house and I spend very little time talking about
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:48,480	| IOT170 |	What this means in the big picture for people's privacy and
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,248	| IOT170 |	What it means with the lawn for
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,064	| IOT170 |	So I am happy to have you on the show quickly
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:55,136	| IOT170 |	Tell me a little bit about what the book is and why
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:32:02,304	| IOT170 |	Chores for the book yeah it's called habeas data privacy vs the rise of surveillance Tech it covers 50 years of service
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:06,400	| IOT170 |	Valence law history in America so the book is mostly about 10 legal cases
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:11,520	| IOT170 |	Mostly Supreme Court not 100% but mostly starting with chapter 1 which is a case called
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:15,872	| IOT170 |	Cats versus United States which the Supreme Court decided in 1960
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:18,432	| IOT170 |	57 or we are getting 1967 engine take
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:24,320	| IOT170 |	And this involves a guy in Los Angeles and Sunset Boulevard who was using pay phones to
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:30,720	| IOT170 |	Make illegal gambling phone calls and the police put a recording device on top of the phone booths
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,744	| IOT170 |	That he was using
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,304	| IOT170 |	To do that they didn't have a warrant for that
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,584	| IOT170 |	They captured his voice
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:40,192	| IOT170 |	While he was in the phone booth and ultimately the Supreme Court ruled that this was not okay
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,472	| IOT170 |	Mistreated this phrase
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,776	| IOT170 |	Call a reasonable expectation of privacy
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,800	| IOT170 |	Cease of the Supreme Court sad
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:51,712	| IOT170 |	That when you step into a phone booth just as when you are at home or in a hotel room or in a few other places you have a quote reasonable expectation of
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:55,808	| IOT170 |	Privacy to be free from government surveillance and if the government doesn't want us to reveal you
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:56,832	| IOT170 |	They need a warrant
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:59,904	| IOT170 |	To do so that's part of the legal underpinning
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,976	| IOT170 |	For a number of cases that I write about in the book
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:05,024	| IOT170 |	And many others that have provided
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:09,120	| IOT170 |	Sort of a framework for understanding how the courts think about
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,912	| IOT170 |	Surveillance over the last half-century
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:12,192	| IOT170 |	Biscuits case
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:15,264	| IOT170 |	Set up this idea of this reasonable expectation of
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,056	| IOT170 |	Privacy and the rest of the book
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:22,944	| IOT170 |	Spend a lot of time exploring how that intersects with technology so you talk about things like
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:27,040	| IOT170 |	Real-time location data you talk about thermal imagery applied outside
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:31,136	| IOT170 |	If homes there's wiretapping there's a lot of technical
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:33,952	| IOT170 |	Innovations that are currently still being addressed by the
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:40,096	| IOT170 |	You actually in the book talking about a case that just was decided last week at the Supreme Court
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,376	| IOT170 |	Can you tell me a little bit about that
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:48,288	| IOT170 |	Yeah so that's a case called Carpenter vs United States and it involves a guy by the name of Little Tim Carpenter who is
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:50,848	| IOT170 |	Is involved in a gang of men operating
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:54,688	| IOT170 |	Primarily in Michigan and Ohio back in 2010 and 2011
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:34:00,832	| IOT170 |	That were sticking up Radio Shacks and cell phone stores they were after the latest models of iPhones and Android
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,416	| IOT170 |	And the government in that case was able
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:08,000	| IOT170 |	To go to a company in this case MetroPCS and Sprint
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:14,400	| IOT170 |	And require them to turn over to the government the phone record specifically What's called the cell site location information
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:18,752	| IOT170 |	In other words we're Littleton Carpenter's phone was and by extension where he was
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:22,080	| IOT170 |	In this case over the course of a hundred and twenty seven days
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:28,224	| IOT170 |	I got they didn't have to have a warrant to do this and so the question that the Supreme Court this time was being asked to answer why
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:35,136	| IOT170 |	Is that okay is it okay for the government to obtain such a large volume of data about somebody more than a hundred and twenty
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,416	| IOT170 |	20 days worth of data about somebody
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:43,328	| IOT170 |	That not only show that yes he was at the scenes of the various crimes but also you know that he was at church on Sunday that he was at
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:48,192	| IOT170 |	At a relative's house on another day and that he went to buy coffee in a different day and you know he did lots of other things
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:52,032	| IOT170 |	That had nothing to do with the crimes that he was accused of committing did the government
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:53,568	| IOT170 |	Need a warrant to get all of that
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:56,128	| IOT170 |	Data to find out all of those things about
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:56,640	| IOT170 |	Tim Carpenter
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:59,200	| IOT170 |	The Supreme Court in a five to four ruling
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:04,064	| IOT170 |	Said yes the government does need a warrant that location data here is different
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:08,160	| IOT170 |	Then other kinds of data that the government might have been able to previously obtained
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:12,768	| IOT170 |	So now presumably law enforcement agencies all over the country are now trying to figure out
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:15,840	| IOT170 |	How to adjust their policies and practices
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:16,864	| IOT170 |	To deal with this new reality
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,144	| IOT170 |	Now
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,680	| IOT170 |	This feels like yes
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,448	| IOT170 |	Awesome
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:26,848	| IOT170 |	But in reading about this it sounds like there's actually a lot of limits in the court didn't kind of didn't talk about Gathering
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,616	| IOT170 |	During the state of
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,384	| IOT170 |	Overtime or
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:31,712	| IOT170 |	How long they would have this data they left a lot of things open
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,736	| IOT170 |	Open so I'd love to get your
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:39,648	| IOT170 |	So yeah so if you read the decision and it's long it's about a hundred and twenty Pages including all of the descendants
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:44,256	| IOT170 |	So in the majority opinion which was written by Chief Justice John Roberts
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,792	| IOT170 |	The court seemed to suggest
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,816	| IOT170 |	You know that the government
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:53,216	| IOT170 |	Certainly needed a warrant to obtain data that was more than over the course of more than six days so the government wanted to come out
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:58,848	| IOT170 |	After myself at location information for more than 6 days they certainly needed at work Beyond.
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:03,712	| IOT170 |	Before that they probably need a warrant but they so it was a little bit fuzzy in the way it was written
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:10,112	| IOT170 |	The dissenters sort of seized upon that and said yo the Six-Day rule is very arbitrary why is it take days and not 5 or so
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,392	| IOT170 |	7 we don't know
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,160	| IOT170 |	But
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:13,440	| IOT170 |	We don't know yet
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:16,000	| IOT170 |	Exactly what that's going to mean in practice
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:22,400	| IOT170 |	Presumably you know presuming that law enforcement agencies are following the Supreme Court's guidance here is that it just means that it
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,960	| IOT170 |	It's a little bit harder now for law enforcement
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,728	| IOT170 |	To get all of this
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:32,128	| IOT170 |	Information right now they have to show probable cause which is not that hard to get right judges sign off
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,664	| IOT170 |	Off on probable cause warrant
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,480	| IOT170 |	Literally every day around this country so it's not
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:41,344	| IOT170 |	Difficult but it certainly requires the police to do a little bit more legwork upfront
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:47,744	| IOT170 |	But you know it's very early still this issue just came out a few days ago so we don't exactly know yet what the full Wrath
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,512	| IOT170 |	Ramifications of Adar
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:52,352	| IOT170 |	True okay let's break some Concepts down from the book
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:55,936	| IOT170 |	That I think are worth talking about before we actually get into like smart home
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,496	| IOT170 |	Which is what is idea of
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,520	| IOT170 |	D orders
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,032	| IOT170 |	Warrants
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:03,616	| IOT170 |	Super warrants because these are all like the standards of
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,128	| IOT170 |	Proof that
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:07,456	| IOT170 |	The right government establishment has to show Buffet
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,480	| IOT170 |	For getting the data
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,760	| IOT170 |	So talk to me about that
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:16,160	| IOT170 |	Sure it's a deodorant which is named for a particular section of the store to medications act which is a federal law
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:16,928	| IOT170 |	All that governs
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,720	| IOT170 |	How the governments in Access
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:25,120	| IOT170 |	This particular data and what standard they need to show a d order merely requires relevancy to an Envoy
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,632	| IOT170 |	Going investigate
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:29,984	| IOT170 |	That's pretty low and that's pretty broad generally there's no real issue there
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:36,640	| IOT170 |	So we've gone now with respect to cell site location information data we've gone now from this do you order standard relevancy
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:42,272	| IOT170 |	Too probable cause right side that's a standard well-known framework that is in 4th amendment law
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:47,648	| IOT170 |	Criminal defense unit going back for a very long time right this is a well-known understanding of what that means
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,952	| IOT170 |	That the government has to show probable cause
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:56,352	| IOT170 |	That there is evidence of a crime that if they search somebody's home or somebody's phone or whatever it is that they're going to find evidence of a
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:38:01,472	| IOT170 |	The crime a super warrant as you mentioned a moment ago isn't even higher standard right and
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:05,312	| IOT170 |	To be clear the term super warrant is a nickname that lawyers have given
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:09,664	| IOT170 |	For what the government has to show when it wants to obtain a wiretap order
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,200	| IOT170 |	So if anybody has ever watched
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:13,248	| IOT170 |	Universe TV shows or movies
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:19,648	| IOT170 |	The most notably the wire you probably remember that the character in The Wire of Jimmy McNulty spends a lot of time go
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,440	| IOT170 |	Going to this Baltimore judge
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:23,488	| IOT170 |	Asking for wiretap orders
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:28,096	| IOT170 |	On particular phones that the you know fictional criminal gang in that show
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:29,888	| IOT170 |	Are using to conduct their drug-dealing up
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:35,264	| IOT170 |	The reason why they're called super warrants oftentimes in the real world is because
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,568	| IOT170 |	In order to get a wiretap order
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:40,384	| IOT170 |	The police law enforcement has to show to the judge
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:43,712	| IOT170 |	That conventional surveillance either has already failed
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:45,248	| IOT170 |	Would fail
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,296	| IOT170 |	Or would be too dangerous to undertale
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:49,344	| IOT170 |	Right so you can imagine for example
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:55,744	| IOT170 |	Trying to infiltrate like a gang or a mafia-type organization or something like that where it would be extremely difficult
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:39:02,144	| IOT170 |	If not outright impossible for them to do that and they have to swear in a document write affidavit to the judge that really
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,936	| IOT170 |	Play this is the ultimate Last Resort
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:08,032	| IOT170 |	And this is the only way that we're going to be able to bust these bad guys is if we wiretapped
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:11,360	| IOT170 |	Stop listening in on somebody's phone calls
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,688	| IOT170 |	It's pretty invasive I think all of us kind of inherently understand that
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:18,784	| IOT170 |	So the government has to clear a pretty high bar in order to be able to
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:24,672	| IOT170 |	Be granted a wiretap and in the federal court system the federal courts actually publish annual statistics
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,464	| IOT170 |	It's showing how often
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,000	| IOT170 |	Set wiretap orders are granted
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:31,328	| IOT170 |	Wiretaps have been allowed under the lawn out
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:37,728	| IOT170 |	For 50 years and we've lived under with all the wiretap ACT also known as title 3 for 50 years now and so
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:44,128	| IOT170 |	So we have a pretty good sense of how that works and you know this guy hasn't fallen right the fact that the government has to go
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:46,176	| IOT170 |	3D Dexter Hoops doesn't seem to be
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:47,200	| IOT170 |	A big barrier
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:52,320	| IOT170 |	Okay and now that we talked about warrants this gets into possibly the big macro theme
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:58,720	| IOT170 |	The book if I'm thinking about it which is this idea of metadata versus content so a wiretap for example
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,512	| IOT170 |	Is getting my actual content of my
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:03,328	| IOT170 |	But in several of the cases that you write about
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:09,728	| IOT170 |	What government is actually getting is just a record of the phone calls like the numbers called or what time someone called
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:12,288	| IOT170 |	The courts seem pretty okay with
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| IOT170 |	The government getting access to lots of metadata
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:18,944	| IOT170 |	Talk about that sure so if we go back to the 1970s
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:25,344	| IOT170 |	There's a famous case that I read about the book called Smith versus Maryland Smith versus Maryland is one of two cases that form the under
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:29,952	| IOT170 |	Painting of another fun super catchy legal phrase known as the third party Doctrine
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:32,768	| IOT170 |	The third party Doctrine comes out of this case
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:35,840	| IOT170 |	Smith vs Maryland and also case called United States vs Miller
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:39,936	| IOT170 |	Richmond vs Maryland basically involves a woman who gets
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:46,336	| IOT170 |	Bugs on her doorstep at midnight in Baltimore in the 1970s and the man who robbed her
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:52,736	| IOT170 |	Also decided in His Infinite Wisdom that he also was going to make harassing phone calls against her from in some cases
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,016	| IOT170 |	Sit home and in other cases
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,296	| IOT170 |	Nearby payphones
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:41:01,696	| IOT170 |	Hopefully the police in that case were able to obtain a court order to get his car record using a device
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,464	| IOT170 |	Vice called a pen register
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,280	| IOT170 |	Again we would maybe today call this
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:11,680	| IOT170 |	A call log or just metadata righteous essentially showing that he called her at these particular times for you know the
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,448	| IOT170 |	This number of minutes
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:18,848	| IOT170 |	You know he challenged the fact that the government was able to obtain these call records again without a warrant and also
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:25,248	| IOT170 |	Julian Smith versus Maryland the Supreme Court decided that no that's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment you don't
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:30,368	| IOT170 |	I need a warrant to access these types of car records as you say this is a sort of metadata versus
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,904	| IOT170 |	Just content type of Distinction
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:36,768	| IOT170 |	So that the idea there is that you know the third-party in Smith versus Maryland was
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:43,168	| IOT170 |	The local phone company in that case and because he used that company to effectuate his calls to call her
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:45,472	| IOT170 |	That he had given up a privacy interest
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,496	| IOT170 |	In the fact that he
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,288	| IOT170 |	He had called her because he used the phone company
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:53,151	| IOT170 |	Need to do it and so then the phone company could give up those call records to government or to anybody else
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:59,551	| IOT170 |	To type you don't more to the modern-day right this is exactly the kind of question that this room Court was facing in Carpenter
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:03,391	| IOT170 |	Was was this an instance where has the government argued
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:08,255	| IOT170 |	That accompany could be compelled to hand over Hall records or in this case location records
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:09,023	| IOT170 |	Of carpenter
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:11,839	| IOT170 |	In the Supreme Court's decision in Carpenter
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,375	| IOT170 |	The majority found that
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:16,447	| IOT170 |	The csli the cell site location information
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:22,847	| IOT170 |	Was basically to private and too personal and you know went too far it was more than just a couple days
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,615	| IOT170 |	Call records
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:26,175	| IOT170 |	It was in this case 227 days
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:30,783	| IOT170 |	Literally everywhere this guy went and so they said that that's too invasive
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:37,183	| IOT170 |	So in this particular case they said that the government had gone too far but the court took great pains to say we're not
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:37,951	| IOT170 |	Overturning
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:41,279	| IOT170 |	This third party Doctrine we're not saying that that is
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:44,351	| IOT170 |	Not good law they said you know it still persists
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:46,399	| IOT170 |	In other areas but in this case
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:52,799	| IOT170 |	Where were talking about such a large volume of location information coming from a cell phone we're going to say that the third project
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:53,311	| IOT170 |	Doesn't apply
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:59,199	| IOT170 |	Alright so now that I feel like we've gotten a basic legal education which was probably a bit much for every
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:00,479	| IOT170 |	But worth it
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:03,295	| IOT170 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:03,807	| IOT170 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:07,647	| IOT170 |	Because to me everything that we're doing
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,927	| IOT170 |	In the internet today
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:10,463	| IOT170 |	We're obviously leaving these
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,743	| IOT170 |	Digital footprint says what
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:12,255	| IOT170 |	What people liked called
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:14,303	| IOT170 |	But it's scary because
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:20,703	| IOT170 |	This is a huge amount of data about individuals that is stored in perpetuity or for however long accompanied
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:24,543	| IOT170 |	Deems it wants it and it's accessible in searchable by
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:26,079	| IOT170 |	Apple computers which is on
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:26,591	| IOT170 |	Resident
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:31,967	| IOT170 |	So keeping all of that and we're bringing it closer and closer into our homes with
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,247	| IOT170 |	Very little understanding of what
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,551	| IOT170 |	Doing so let's talk about
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:38,879	| IOT170 |	The devices that scare you the most or that you think are
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,159	| IOT170 |	The most rate for
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,207	| IOT170 |	Government overreach
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:43,487	| IOT170 |	You know all of these
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:49,631	| IOT170 |	Smart home devices and I'll admit I don't know nearly enough about the Myriad of devices that are out there in comparison to you
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:55,775	| IOT170 |	But from the ones that I am aware of you know the Amazon Echo or the Google smart home devices are the Apple smart home device
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:44:00,895	| IOT170 |	Is or even just something even more basic like a video you know baby monitor for example
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:04,735	| IOT170 |	To me there have been you know numerous instances of
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:08,063	| IOT170 |	Certainly questionable situations where whether it's
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:14,207	| IOT170 |	Some miscreant out in the world you know hacking a baby monitor to say awful things to a young child
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:16,511	| IOT170 |	All the way up to you know there was a case
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:22,911	| IOT170 |	Just last year I believe it was we're in Arkansas in a murder trial the government wanted Amazon to turnover record
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:29,311	| IOT170 |	Heard from an Alexa that was present near the scene of a murder as a way to try to get at what either the victim or
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:33,919	| IOT170 |	The alleged perpetrator had said in the minutes prior to the murder
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:37,503	| IOT170 |	And you know this came up a little bit in some listeners may remember
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:43,903	| IOT170 |	Just a couple years ago there was this so-called FBI versus Apple Showdown that involved a locked iPhone in the wake of The Sandbar
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:50,303	| IOT170 |	Bernardino terrorist attack here in California and one of the arguments that Apple made was you know sort of what I would call
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:55,167	| IOT170 |	OB If You Give a Mouse a Cookie argument and this is in her some listeners may be familiar with the children's book
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:45:01,567	| IOT170 |	If You Give a Mouse a Cookie and it's just a never-ending list of things that the mouse will want and so basically this is sort of what Apple
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:05,407	| IOT170 |	Who argued if they said look if we Apple agree to what the government wants
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:11,807	| IOT170 |	Today if you want us to break our own security and get into this iPhone that was owned by or used by you know now
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:18,207	| IOT170 |	Now dead terrorist in San Bernardino tomorrow you can ask us to turn everybody's iPhones into tracking devices or you could ask Amazon
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:24,607	| IOT170 |	How to turn into Lexus intuitive snooping devices in everyone's home we write you know and on and on and on and on we don't yet have the answer to
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:30,495	| IOT170 |	Do the legal question as to whether or not the government does have the authority to order companies to do their bidding
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,775	| IOT170 |	It's not clear yet
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:36,127	| IOT170 |	How far the government can go and with the prevalence of all of these kinds
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,663	| IOT170 |	End of devices that people have
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:39,967	| IOT170 |	Voluntarily brought into their homes
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:43,039	| IOT170 |	If you are an ambitious FBI agents or local
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:44,063	| IOT170 |	Police officer
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:47,647	| IOT170 |	It's easy to understand I think how those types of devices
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:49,439	| IOT170 |	Could be useful to law enforce
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:55,839	| IOT170 |	You know I don't know about where you live in Austin but here in Oakland where I live I have many neighbors that have you know surveillance video camera
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:46:02,239	| IOT170 |	Outside their homes that are pointed literally at my own driveway and also for the public Street and I know of
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:08,639	| IOT170 |	Another neighborhoods here in Oakland up instances where local neighborhood groups have voluntarily handed that information
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,175	| IOT170 |	Over to police to bust
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:12,479	| IOT170 |	Robbery suspects or things like that burglary
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:15,039	| IOT170 |	Chica understand how that would be useful
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,575	| IOT170 |	But at the same time it's
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:19,391	| IOT170 |	Very different when a company is being forced
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:24,767	| IOT170 |	To hand that over and it seems to me that we're rapidly entering a world if we're not there already
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:27,839	| IOT170 |	Where those types of requests those types of court orders
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:30,655	| IOT170 |	Are going to become you no more the rule rather than the exception
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:33,215	| IOT170 |	What kind of precautions do you think
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,751	| IOT170 |	Companies
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:38,335	| IOT170 |	Need to have in place as they start putting these devices
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:45,759	| IOT170 |	Yeah that's a good question you know so I think there's this phrase that many people may be familiar with known as privacy by Design
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:52,159	| IOT170 |	And that doesn't just mean how do you design the actual product of what kind of data does it collect but also a few steps.
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:58,559	| IOT170 |	Down the road once your products are out in the world what happens when your local police department calls up with ring or a
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:00,095	| IOT170 |	Any other company and says hey
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,119	| IOT170 |	You know we think that
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:05,215	| IOT170 |	The data from this device would be helpful in our investigation
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:07,263	| IOT170 |	And you know I think all of us want
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,031	| IOT170 |	The police
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:10,591	| IOT170 |	To do their job so I would say if
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,359	| IOT170 |	Accompany
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:17,759	| IOT170 |	Not to pick on ring in particular but you know what, do you like that that is selling a product that collects you don't visual data audio data on
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,527	| IOT170 |	All kinds of other things
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:23,135	| IOT170 |	If they don't already have a policy in place as to under what conditions they will
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:25,695	| IOT170 |	Comply with the government and also it's important
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:32,095	| IOT170 |	To remember you know are they going to notify the customer who has generated or who is associated with that pitch
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:33,887	| IOT170 |	Particular device for that particular account
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:40,287	| IOT170 |	So I would suggest two companies that they really need to think long and hard as to what kinds of information they are collecting
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:46,431	| IOT170 |	And what they're going to do when the day comes that a government entity wants access to that data
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:52,575	| IOT170 |	So just to pick a technology that I know we're thinking a lot about and has a lot of surveillance capabilities
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,599	| IOT170 |	What do you think about
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,111	| IOT170 |	Drones
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:48:00,511	| IOT170 |	Drones are a technology that I think a very very interesting but also
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:03,071	| IOT170 |	Very problematic in some ways
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:06,655	| IOT170 |	Elegant we have to distinguish between the actions of
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:13,055	| IOT170 |	Private persons are regular individuals like you and me and the actions of the government right because drones are so cheap lawn
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,615	| IOT170 |	Enforcement that traditionally could not afford
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:16,383	| IOT170 |	Sade have
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:19,199	| IOT170 |	A fleet of aircraft or helicopters are even one
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:22,527	| IOT170 |	Can now afford not only a drone but perhaps most
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:28,671	| IOT170 |	So if you run a Google News search for police acquires drones you'd be surprised
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:33,279	| IOT170 |	It practically every week somewhere in America you know some County Sheriff for some town
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:39,679	| IOT170 |	Is now you know buying or expanding its drone Fleet and in many instances those towns or counties
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:40,447	| IOT170 |	We're cities
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:46,847	| IOT170 |	Don't always have clear policies as to again and what circumstances they can deploy the drones in what circumstances they don't deploy
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:53,247	| IOT170 |	Play them what happens to the data that is collected what happens to the videos with the photos that are collected are they allowed to mount
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:59,647	| IOT170 |	Extra devices on to the Drone such as an infrared camera or other kinds of things are they allowed to loan it out
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:06,047	| IOT170 |	Two other agencies so a lot of us I think we're just generally unaware as to what kind of surveillance technology our local
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,327	| IOT170 |	Law enforcement have
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:11,423	| IOT170 |	And if you don't know I would encourage anybody to file a public records request
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:17,823	| IOT170 |	You don't have to be a lawyer or journalist to do this every state has public records laws and you can you know send an email or a letter
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:24,223	| IOT170 |	We're to your county sheriff or your Police Department and ask them for a contract purchase records things like that policies regarding
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:25,247	| IOT170 |	Drones or anything else
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:29,087	| IOT170 |	Okay so it feels ambitious is a person who
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:35,487	| IOT170 |	Likes having the convenience and even a little bit of safety associated with some of these devices like I love my smart speaker
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:37,791	| IOT170 |	I don't want to give it up I actually left my doorbell cam
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:44,191	| IOT170 |	But how can I take my love of Technology my understanding of technology and apply it towards better
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:47,263	| IOT170 |	Why so the government doesn't use this kind of stuff
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:48,031	| IOT170 |	Against me
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:49,055	| IOT170 |	It feels pretty daunting
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:55,199	| IOT170 |	It is daunting you're right the first thing is to you know check the Privacy policies that none of us read
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:58,527	| IOT170 |	Yeah we don't read all the time if you have let's say
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:50:01,087	| IOT170 |	A smart doorbell or a smartphone
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:03,135	| IOT170 |	Security camera or whatever the case may be
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:06,719	| IOT170 |	Go actually read the policy that the company had laid out
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:12,607	| IOT170 |	If it's done by a reputable company chances are very good that they will have one of these policies up on their website
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:19,007	| IOT170 |	And go actually read it if you don't want to read every word just search for it phrases like law enforcement or subpoena or Warren
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:20,799	| IOT170 |	Or things like that and see
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:24,639	| IOT170 |	If the terms that they have laid out in that document comport with what you think
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:26,943	| IOT170 |	Is fair and reasonable for the company to
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:30,271	| IOT170 |	To do you know and also I would say if you are
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:33,343	| IOT170 |	Again whether you're a reporter and attorney and activist
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:37,439	| IOT170 |	Just a regular you know citizen ask your local law enforcement agency
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:43,839	| IOT170 |	How many times they have you know tried to get at somebody is Alexa data or something like that file record
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:44,863	| IOT170 |	Request ask
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:48,447	| IOT170 |	Because I sensibly these agencies are supposed to be accountable to us
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:54,847	| IOT170 |	And it's hard for reporters like you and me to find out and we rely on individuals to come forward and
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:51:01,247	| IOT170 |	And tell us you know hey this thing happened to me or I found out that my County Sheriff was doing X Y and Z and I'm really worried about that
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:07,647	| IOT170 |	That so I would say you know asked around and if you don't think that you're in a good position to tell the world then you know
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:12,511	| IOT170 |	No contact me or you or any other reporter that you think would be receptive to that type of information
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:17,375	| IOT170 |	All right well service thank you so much for coming on the show today I really appreciate it
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:18,655	| IOT170 |	My pleasure
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:20,959	| IOT170 |	That's it for this week
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:27,359	| IOT170 |	Thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at stays
