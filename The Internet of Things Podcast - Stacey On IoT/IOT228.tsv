EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,216	| IOT228 |	Let's get started with
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:21,568	| IOT228 |	News about devices listening in since it was reported that
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,360	| IOT228 |	Both Google
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:26,688	| IOT228 |	And Madame a have contractors who listening
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,992	| IOT228 |	Two other entities
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:29,760	| IOT228 |	We've seen
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,808	| IOT228 |	Taliban all the three other digital
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,600	| IOT228 |	With the exception of Bixby
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:37,440	| IOT228 |	NY
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,744	| IOT228 |	So Apple also came out and
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:43,584	| IOT228 |	Said that yes it has contractors listening in
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:45,632	| IOT228 |	On a rotisserie improved
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,424	| IOT228 |	The quality of voice recognition and
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT228 |	Now
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,472	| IOT228 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:53,056	| IOT228 |	They have contractors that listen to both Skype and Cortana
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:54,080	| IOT228 |	So
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,128	| IOT228 |	The Skype calls actually
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,920	| IOT228 |	They could be listening in right now
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,736	| IOT228 |	Because they don't say anything
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,368	| IOT228 |	Okay so in response to this
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:08,160	| IOT228 |	Google has always allowed
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,184	| IOT228 |	People to
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| IOT228 |	Opt out of having
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:10,976	| IOT228 |	Calls record
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| IOT228 |	Now
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,584	| IOT228 |	Amazon for Padme has
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,608	| IOT228 |	Now said that
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,632	| IOT228 |	You can do the same thing
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:21,472	| IOT228 |	And they added to their terms of service that some of
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,264	| IOT228 |	Calls could be recorded
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:23,776	| IOT228 |	Tencent
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,080	| IOT228 |	Apple
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,920	| IOT228 |	Says it is going to stop having people listen to series
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,712	| IOT228 |	Utterances
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,224	| IOT228 |	Entirely
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:33,504	| IOT228 |	And
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,296	| IOT228 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,064	| IOT228 |	We don't know what they're going to
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,832	| IOT228 |	I do yet but
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| IOT228 |	I'm sure they're going to come up with something
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:39,904	| IOT228 |	Probably
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,952	| IOT228 |	Akin to Amazon
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,976	| IOT228 |	Or Google's
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,000	| IOT228 |	So
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,048	| IOT228 |	I don't know Kevin
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,584	| IOT228 |	Do we feel good about this yet
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,680	| IOT228 |	Well hell yeah everybody got caught with their hand in the cookie jar so to speak
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,704	| IOT228 |	And everybody
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,752	| IOT228 |	Exit Microsoft so far has
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,288	| IOT228 |	Come to a
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,568	| IOT228 |	What I consider reasonable
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,104	| IOT228 |	Solution
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| IOT228 |	4 people
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,688	| IOT228 |	Protect our privacy and terms of the voice recordings
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,736	| IOT228 |	An actual contractors are humans listening
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:09,344	| IOT228 |	A Microsoft for its Skype stuff uses in the Skype
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:09,856	| IOT228 |	Translation
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:13,440	| IOT228 |	It does say in an FAQ that
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,488	| IOT228 |	Skype does collector in
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,024	| IOT228 |	Information conversation to help a
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,815	| IOT228 |	Improve products and services
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,351	| IOT228 |	It does not say that
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,375	| IOT228 |	People are listening
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,959	| IOT228 |	Nor does the Microsoft privacy
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,799	| IOT228 |	There's room to be better
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,823	| IOT228 |	People don't mind
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,871	| IOT228 |	Computers in last after they really have a problem with
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,919	| IOT228 |	Which finger
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:38,527	| IOT228 |	The only other choice for these companies to make the services better is actually to ask
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,855	| IOT228 |	The users of the services to manually review
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:45,439	| IOT228 |	Audio activity and responses and so on
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:49,023	| IOT228 |	And I don't know enough people would do that so I get why they do it
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,583	| IOT228 |	But they should have always been very upfront about
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,399	| IOT228 |	You can contractors and then having people listening
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,679	| IOT228 |	Agreed
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,471	| IOT228 |	All right
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,751	| IOT228 |	He also a Microsoft
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,543	| IOT228 |	News Microsoft says that it has
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,847	| IOT228 |	The Russian State hackers
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,151	| IOT228 |	Rather Russian State hackers
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,711	| IOT228 |	Using iot devices to
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,479	| IOT228 |	To breach net worth
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,271	| IOT228 |	Is this surprising
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:15,647	| IOT228 |	No basically the Microsoft threat Intelligence Center wrote that there are
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:21,023	| IOT228 |	Are lots of printers video decoders and other iot devices being used as a way to get into
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,791	| IOT228 |	Networks
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:26,399	| IOT228 |	It's interesting that devices that they found this on
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:30,239	| IOT228 |	Because you're not a question but you put it on Twitter which got a lot of responses
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,519	| IOT228 |	Is a printer
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,799	| IOT228 |	An iot device
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,311	| IOT228 |	Cause
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,127	| IOT228 |	Microsoft discovered attacks in April
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,151	| IOT228 |	When
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,735	| IOT228 |	Some devices a voice over IP phone and office printer
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,783	| IOT228 |	We're communicating with
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| IOT228 |	Russian servers
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| IOT228 |	Exactly
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:49,439	| IOT228 |	And this is this got me thinking because I get very frustrated when we we talked about
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,975	| IOT228 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:55,327	| IOT228 |	Is a group in basically he would find out that the culprit is like
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,351	| IOT228 |	Network DVR system
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,143	| IOT228 |	Which was a big deal in Boracay
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:02,495	| IOT228 |	I asked and I was being completely serious do people think that a printer
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| IOT228 |	Is an iot device
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| IOT228 |	And lo and behold
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,359	| IOT228 |	Over a hundred people
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,127	| IOT228 |	Give me the response
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,687	| IOT228 |	So good responses
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,479	| IOT228 |	Pull the mountain
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:12,991	| IOT228 |	Three category
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:16,575	| IOT228 |	One was the group of people who tended to be old
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,367	| IOT228 |	Who are like
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,439	| IOT228 |	No it's more M2M it's not really iot
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,743	| IOT228 |	Then there with the litter list
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,815	| IOT228 |	Call them there like it is a thing it is connected to the internet
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,863	| IOT228 |	Does it is an iot device
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,167	| IOT228 |	To which I say
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,959	| IOT228 |	I don't sweat
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| IOT228 |	Computers
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:34,751	| IOT228 |	What about
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,031	| IOT228 |	Everything else
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,335	| IOT228 |	And then the third group of people who
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,615	| IOT228 |	Probably or closer to me
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,407	| IOT228 |	Those people said
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,967	| IOT228 |	It is only an iot device
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,247	| IOT228 |	Connected to the internet
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,551	| IOT228 |	It has sensors and then
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,599	| IOT228 |	People use the sensor information
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,367	| IOT228 |	N2
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| IOT228 |	Survive some business value
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,231	| IOT228 |	And that's the iot device like when I'm thinking about is he.
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,023	| IOT228 |	But
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,071	| IOT228 |	I will say
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| IOT228 |	If you were an infosec
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,935	| IOT228 |	Responsible for corporate security
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,471	| IOT228 |	Then yes
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:08,287	| IOT228 |	A printer is probably at iot device because it
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,055	| IOT228 |	Does
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,079	| IOT228 |	Provide this whole into your network
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,943	| IOT228 |	Wrinkly sure one of those people you don't care what's call you want to make sure it's secure
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| IOT228 |	And if it's
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,527	| IOT228 |	Connected to your network and or the internet
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:22,111	| IOT228 |	Hat is upgradable software firmware Etc
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,135	| IOT228 |	And has
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,671	| IOT228 |	Data
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,439	| IOT228 |	I can be
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,767	| IOT228 |	Captured I guess is the best way to say maybe from a print queue
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:34,399	| IOT228 |	Or the Wi-Fi SSID if it's a wireless printer I yeah you got to worry about this stuff
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,191	| IOT228 |	And you know they can pull stuff
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,543	| IOT228 |	If it's hacked which means I could get your secret printed
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,567	| IOT228 |	Corporate documents
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,639	| IOT228 |	Although I should say like four people were like
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| IOT228 |	Wait
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,943	| IOT228 |	Why are people still using print
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,967	| IOT228 |	Which I'm like
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,991	| IOT228 |	But do not live in the
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:51,807	| IOT228 |	Picture
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,855	| IOT228 |	So I guess from this perspective
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,879	| IOT228 |	I would say
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:58,463	| IOT228 |	That we should start thinking about network security and iot security
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,767	| IOT228 |	Maybe a little bit more
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,327	| IOT228 |	Greater lady a little bit with a little bit more sophistication
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:08,191	| IOT228 |	Is a printer is a network device it does you have to have security around it
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,983	| IOT228 |	And you should update the firmware and that's what
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,519	| IOT228 |	Also
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,103	| IOT228 |	Two of the Microsoft attacks were using default passwords
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,407	| IOT228 |	And here's my recommendation to you
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:21,759	| IOT228 |	Anything in your corporate Network that has a default password should be unplugged
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,271	| IOT228 |	And recycle
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,063	| IOT228 |	Jacinda story
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,367	| IOT228 |	You should not have that on your network
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,415	| IOT228 |	Ever done
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:28,927	| IOT228 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,743	| IOT228 |	I like okay we solve that problem
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,279	| IOT228 |	But I don't know
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:37,887	| IOT228 |	So I'm a link to this you guys feel free to continue the discussion I
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| IOT228 |	I am very
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:45,311	| IOT228 |	All right speaking of tough questions there are more tough
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:51,711	| IOT228 |	Questions for ring and various police departments that are working with Ring the video doorbell company now on
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,223	| IOT228 |	Buy Amazon
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| IOT228 |	Vice
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,319	| IOT228 |	They actually reported last time that ring
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,135	| IOT228 |	Contracts with police departments to get the
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| IOT228 |	Them two
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:03,743	| IOT228 |	Sign people up for the Neighbors app they give them
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,535	| IOT228 |	Free ring doorbells to giveaway
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,327	| IOT228 |	The neighbors app
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,863	| IOT228 |	Is an app that you
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,143	| IOT228 |	You can download
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,191	| IOT228 |	Basically lets you
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,215	| IOT228 |	Upload
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,751	| IOT228 |	Your footage
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,311	| IOT228 |	If you feel that there's a security problem
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| IOT228 |	Can you search talk about security
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,615	| IOT228 |	Problems in your neighbor
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,919	| IOT228 |	Police departments
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,687	| IOT228 |	AR
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,711	| IOT228 |	Able to
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,735	| IOT228 |	Ask
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| IOT228 |	Homeowners
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,295	| IOT228 |	For their video footage
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,319	| IOT228 |	If there is a crime
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,879	| IOT228 |	To get this footage police officers have
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,671	| IOT228 |	Ask the homeowner end
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,463	| IOT228 |	And they have to have a case number
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:34,975	| IOT228 |	To go with that
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,279	| IOT228 |	But people are upset because it's
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,303	| IOT228 |	Apus search
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,887	| IOT228 |	Vice is really upset with ring because
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,447	| IOT228 |	Has noticed a pattern
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,031	| IOT228 |	Of ring helping police departments
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:51,615	| IOT228 |	Encourage people to download the neighbors app and to submit their video
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| IOT228 |	So there
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,943	| IOT228 |	Encouraging Police Department's to
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:59,295	| IOT228 |	Be on social networks and to share video footage and to
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:02,623	| IOT228 |	Ask for help and that sort of thing and that will boost
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,135	| IOT228 |	Both
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:07,999	| IOT228 |	Downloads of the neighbors app and boost the willingness of people to opt into
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,791	| IOT228 |	Police request for
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,303	| IOT228 |	Video data
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,839	| IOT228 |	What's really disturb
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,911	| IOT228 |	Kevin go ahead
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:19,263	| IOT228 |	More news came out to this week we saw / on govtech.com
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,055	| IOT228 |	That's
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,591	| IOT228 |	Even if a
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| IOT228 |	Ring
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,895	| IOT228 |	Homeowner
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:30,271	| IOT228 |	Decides not to share video the police can just go to Amazon which owns ring
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,599	| IOT228 |	And essentially subpoenaed the video
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:36,159	| IOT228 |	That's totally different
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:40,767	| IOT228 |	Mille Lacs there and I'm kind of bothered
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:45,375	| IOT228 |	Tony's body the public information officer for the sheriff's office in Fresno County
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,655	| IOT228 |	Which is one of those
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,935	| IOT228 |	But we
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,751	| IOT228 |	Apartments that's partnered with Amazon and ring on this
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:55,871	| IOT228 |	He disagrees with the claims of privacy violations here is
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,151	| IOT228 |	His
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:01,759	| IOT228 |	I would say to anybody to think this is another case of Big Brother watching
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,087	| IOT228 |	Poor us trying to invade privacy go to Step One
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,647	| IOT228 |	It took the consumer to invest in the product
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:11,999	| IOT228 |	They chose to pay for a service that enables it to be viewed by either us
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,023	| IOT228 |	Ring
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,583	| IOT228 |	I don't agree with that last part
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,399	| IOT228 |	Me either in this is what's really frustrating
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:23,007	| IOT228 |	Ring is actually soliciting police departments as their own Salesforce
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,543	| IOT228 |	As a new sales Channel
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,079	| IOT228 |	Yes so
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,895	| IOT228 |	We got this weird circular logic where you're like
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,431	| IOT228 |	Hey
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:36,575	| IOT228 |	We're going to give you access to all of this video data if you get people to sign up for the app in
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:40,671	| IOT228 |	You know you can get away these doorbells and talked about it a lot and then people will be like
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,231	| IOT228 |	I trust my Police Department I will totally Buy
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:44,767	| IOT228 |	So
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,559	| IOT228 |	And and then
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,071	| IOT228 |	They're like
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:51,935	| IOT228 |	Well yes they did voluntarily by this but they bought it because they're police
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,215	| IOT228 |	Has been
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| IOT228 |	Essentially selling it
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,079	| IOT228 |	Even getting incentives
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,127	| IOT228 |	The police department's from ring
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,919	| IOT228 |	Yes to sell it so
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:04,223	| IOT228 |	The sort of logic is is not my
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,271	| IOT228 |	And I don't like
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:09,087	| IOT228 |	This in this sort of thing is going to
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:09,599	| IOT228 |	Hurt
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:10,879	| IOT228 |	Iot come
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,415	| IOT228 |	It's very subtle
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,463	| IOT228 |	I don't like it
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:21,119	| IOT228 |	Yeah and I think the other thing is in this story every time the word subpoena is mentioned it soon quotes
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:28,031	| IOT228 |	Which leads me to believe it's not a subpoena process
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,567	| IOT228 |	They talked about just requesting the day
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,639	| IOT228 |	Yeah when you just go to Amazon and get it yeah
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:35,711	| IOT228 |	They mate if they have a case number Amazon may decide to give it
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:41,087	| IOT228 |	Is that even if they don't have a case number I is how I read it and
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:44,159	| IOT228 |	Listen I'm for this in general this type of
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,207	| IOT228 |	Providing the information to the police
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,047	| IOT228 |	I mean I actually did that when my car was hit
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,863	| IOT228 |	The video camera out front captured
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:55,423	| IOT228 |	Basically you could say was a hit-and-run but the
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,983	| IOT228 |	Person who hid it was across the street so they run very far
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:03,359	| IOT228 |	Disputed hitting my car and I took the video and I provided it to the police
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,895	| IOT228 |	That's different to me then
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:07,199	| IOT228 |	We can just go look at everybody's video
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,991	| IOT228 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:14,367	| IOT228 |	And if you say no they still have a recourse it's not like we can still look at everybody video
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:19,231	| IOT228 |	Veterinary courses Amazon so before you buy a ring doorbell
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,791	| IOT228 |	You may want to consider that
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:22,815	| IOT228 |	Please have a bath
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,215	| IOT228 |	All right
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,263	| IOT228 |	So we're not excited about
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,311	| IOT228 |	We are excited
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,639	| IOT228 |	About story that Kevin scooped a while back
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:37,663	| IOT228 |	Tell us about it
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,943	| IOT228 |	Jumpsuit
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:42,527	| IOT228 |	I don't recall when exactly I do and it's right here
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,063	| IOT228 |	Story April 3rd
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,111	| IOT228 |	And we talked about this on the podcast
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:50,207	| IOT228 |	I was strolling through the FCC database looking for new devices and found
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,791	| IOT228 |	A device from Google that was certified
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,839	| IOT228 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:01,983	| IOT228 |	And it's called Mistral that's the code name we won't be called mister all winning if and when it comes to Market
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:07,359	| IOT228 |	But essentially the code name is draw lines up with Gale and Gale is the current
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,663	| IOT228 |	The existing Google WiFi products
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:15,039	| IOT228 |	So that led me to believe that this is going to be some type of mesh Wi-Fi device
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| IOT228 |	The very least
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:21,183	| IOT228 |	And possibly only because of the chipsets being used could even be
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| IOT228 |	Could have
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:28,607	| IOT228 |	Digital assistants built-in and maybe even a screen will see what Google does I suspect we'll see this device in October
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,679	| IOT228 |	Presumably when Google has its Hardware lunch
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,495	| IOT228 |	9to5 Google latched onto that
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,311	| IOT228 |	This week with some more information
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,591	| IOT228 |	Honda
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:41,919	| IOT228 |	Saying that it will support Wi-Fi 6
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,991	| IOT228 |	And I'm actually excited by this because
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:49,599	| IOT228 |	There are some Wi-Fi six Chromebooks and other devices that are in the world right now
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,879	| IOT228 |	But they're useless
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:53,951	| IOT228 |	6% of unless you have a Wi-Fi six
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,719	| IOT228 |	Router
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:15:00,607	| IOT228 |	So we sing I've seen some pre-certified Wi-Fi 6 router so this leads me to believe that
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,655	| IOT228 |	This why I should be a certified device not it
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,679	| IOT228 |	Pre-certified away
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,703	| IOT228 |	Got it
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,519	| IOT228 |	Okay well I am excited is that something you would
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,079	| IOT228 |	I would
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:12,127	| IOT228 |	I want Google to actually
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| IOT228 |	Undulates
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| IOT228 |	Digital
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,991	| IOT228 |	Assistant smart speaker stuff into Google WiFi
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,039	| IOT228 |	And I still think that's we're going to do here
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,599	| IOT228 |	But if they don't even if they don't I probably would
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,647	| IOT228 |	Best Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,927	| IOT228 |	All right speaking of
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,439	| IOT228 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,231	| IOT228 |	Guess who might be getting into the
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,279	| IOT228 |	You'll never guess
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,559	| IOT228 |	Walmart
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,863	| IOT228 |	Actually they won't be producing
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,423	| IOT228 |	A router necessarily they're looking at doing a
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| IOT228 |	A bridge
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,239	| IOT228 |	Under its project Franklin
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:38,751	| IOT228 |	Hard worker
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,031	| IOT228 |	So
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,055	| IOT228 |	We found
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,079	| IOT228 |	An FCC filing
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| IOT228 |	Actually our friend
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,895	| IOT228 |	Works at variety found
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,919	| IOT228 |	It sent it over
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,199	| IOT228 |	But he found a
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:53,343	| IOT228 |	SEC filing for a Walmart wi-fi to Z-Wave bridge that will control a garage door opener
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,903	| IOT228 |	And this is fascinating
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:56,927	| IOT228 |	1
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,487	| IOT228 |	Because I actually think egg
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| IOT228 |	Garage door
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,791	| IOT228 |	Open R type
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,607	| IOT228 |	Product is wonderful I've even bought them
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,887	| IOT228 |	People who are not in.
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,727	| IOT228 |	So it's a nice little gateway drug or just a useful thing
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,031	| IOT228 |	I'm going to throw it in the useful thing
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,079	| IOT228 |	But
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| IOT228 |	Pfcc application
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:18,943	| IOT228 |	It was filed on behalf of Walmart by project
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,479	| IOT228 |	Franklin LLC
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:23,807	| IOT228 |	And if you're asking what the heck project Franklin is
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:26,111	| IOT228 |	It is a consumer
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,623	| IOT228 |	Hardware
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:27,647	| IOT228 |	Start
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,719	| IOT228 |	Inside Walmart store number 8 building
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:37,375	| IOT228 |	Our friends over at the spoon basically broke the story about project Franklin all the way back in June
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,143	| IOT228 |	So not bad
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:41,215	| IOT228 |	And because it was making
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| IOT228 |	A
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,519	| IOT228 |	Frozen yogurt machine
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:47,871	| IOT228 |	And the idea behind this is that Walmart
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT228 |	Wants to
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,663	| IOT228 |	Have some sort of
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,991	| IOT228 |	Connected devices in the home that
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,015	| IOT228 |	Can collect consumer
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,319	| IOT228 |	Because they're looking at
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,647	| IOT228 |	The data that Amazon is able to connect through all of its
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:00,927	| IOT228 |	Products
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,463	| IOT228 |	What's matinee inside in there like
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,487	| IOT228 |	Yeah we need that
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:09,631	| IOT228 |	Stay tuned for more on that and for a possible launch of a Walmart
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:10,911	| IOT228 |	Garage door open
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| IOT228 |	Yay
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,239	| IOT228 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:17,055	| IOT228 |	And in other news I can't do a creative Segway here because
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,079	| IOT228 |	It's really random
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:19,871	| IOT228 |	Last week
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,687	| IOT228 |	Actually it was Thursday the day that the show
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,711	| IOT228 |	Went live
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,247	| IOT228 |	A New Consortium
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,271	| IOT228 |	Botched called
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,295	| IOT228 |	The fira
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,063	| IOT228 |	Consortium
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,343	| IOT228 |	This was
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:33,951	| IOT228 |	Spirit stands for fine
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| IOT228 |	Ranging
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:40,607	| IOT228 |	And this is a Consortium created by Assa abloy which is balad company that owns Yale locks and August
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:43,167	| IOT228 |	Nxp semiconductors Samsung
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,935	| IOT228 |	End
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,447	| IOT228 |	Bosch
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,239	| IOT228 |	They created this
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,543	| IOT228 |	To use ultra-wideband radio.
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,591	| IOT228 |	Technology to locate objects
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,103	| IOT228 |	In space
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,127	| IOT228 |	Cell
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,431	| IOT228 |	Sort of like the new Bluetooth
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,967	| IOT228 |	Yeah like the new Bluetooth
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,527	| IOT228 |	So what's happening here is ultra-wideband
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,831	| IOT228 |	I covered this all the way back in 2000
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,599	| IOT228 |	This is How old is
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,439	| IOT228 |	We were excited about it way back when
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| IOT228 |	Because it allows you to send
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,999	| IOT228 |	A lot of data
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,071	| IOT228 |	Really
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:11,583	| IOT228 |	Fast
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,375	| IOT228 |	Puerto Rico
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,679	| IOT228 |	Say hi to be nearby
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,215	| IOT228 |	You can send fax
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:21,055	| IOT228 |	Memes of data the idea was going to be that it was going to be a wireless
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,127	| IOT228 |	Monitor Solutions you can stick your
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,431	| IOT228 |	Computer next to a bigger Monitor and you wouldn't have
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,199	| IOT228 |	Connect anything
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:30,783	| IOT228 |	Elekta 60 gigahertz
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:32,831	| IOT228 |	Which is very short range
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,391	| IOT228 |	Very very fast lots of data
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,671	| IOT228 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:39,231	| IOT228 |	So the folks at nxp or saying the
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,279	| IOT228 |	Technology never got a fair Shake
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,839	| IOT228 |	Because Wi-Fi just got better and better so we just didn't need
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| IOT228 |	We didn't
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,423	| IOT228 |	So now they want to do it
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| IOT228 |	4
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,495	| IOT228 |	Finding locations
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,103	| IOT228 |	They're saying that Bluetooth accuracy right now is to meters
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,663	| IOT228 |	Now they don't take into account the fact
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,967	| IOT228 |	The Bluetooth has their latest version Bluetooth
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,271	| IOT228 |	They can actually do within a
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:02,783	| IOT228 |	Couple inches
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,111	| IOT228 |	But that's basically the area that this
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,391	| IOT228 |	Consortium
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,999	| IOT228 |	I don't know it's going to need a new radio
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,511	| IOT228 |	It's
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:19,423	| IOT228 |	You're going right down the path I was going to go and then they mention all the verticals you want to Target
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,007	| IOT228 |	And specific use cases you know for like vehicle-to-vehicle
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| IOT228 |	Communication
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:28,383	| IOT228 |	Maybe ride or fight sharing applications AR
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,175	| IOT228 |	Access Control
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,991	| IOT228 |	Drones
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,783	| IOT228 |	I don't know
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:42,207	| IOT228 |	So I don't know I'm talking to nxp I'm going to try to get someone maybe for Bosch to come on the show and talked about this a little
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,719	| IOT228 |	Bit more cuz I
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| IOT228 |	I have a lot of questions
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| IOT228 |	And very few answer
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| IOT228 |	Look at you some quick news bits
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:53,471	| IOT228 |	I found an Indiegogo campaign that might interest a lot of
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:54,751	| IOT228 |	It's called
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,031	| IOT228 |	Connect
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:57,823	| IOT228 |	It's a terrible name
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,359	| IOT228 |	Betsy a.m.
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,919	| IOT228 |	And Camera connect
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:06,015	| IOT228 |	It's a hug that allows you to connect a bunch of cameras and then you can monitor them anywhere
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,807	| IOT228 |	I'm it works with
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:11,647	| IOT228 |	Most security Brands they're showing pictures of Arlo
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,743	| IOT228 |	What looks to be a real security cameras look like
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,279	| IOT228 |	But what looks to be a nest cam
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,303	| IOT228 |	Baby orangutan
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:24,703	| IOT228 |	They say you can select just about any brand of Cameron they support over 50 Brands including wise Nest Arlo
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,007	| IOT228 |	Another so
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,823	| IOT228 |	The interesting thing is it lets you put your
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,895	| IOT228 |	Camera footage on the Hub to get a terabyte of storage
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,199	| IOT228 |	There is a cloud option if
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,711	| IOT228 |	If you want it
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:37,759	| IOT228 |	This way
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,783	| IOT228 |	You don't have to work with
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,599	| IOT228 |	Weird clouds from other camera vendors
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:42,879	| IOT228 |	And
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,439	| IOT228 |	I don't know what this is this is a meat product
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,231	| IOT228 |	But I don't know how it works but
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT228 |	I'm very
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,511	| IOT228 |	Interested in it
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:53,887	| IOT228 |	It's an aggregator Centigrade Orville your video so that it doesn't go to the cloud
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,911	| IOT228 |	It stays local
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,959	| IOT228 |	The nice thing is
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,519	| IOT228 |	There's no subscription fee unless
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,335	| IOT228 |	You would like to access that video when you are away from home
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,407	| IOT228 |	$60 a year
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,687	| IOT228 |	Cuz video
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,223	| IOT228 |	Hugely fat
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:09,759	| IOT228 |	Which makes it
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:10,783	| IOT228 |	That's why
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:16,159	| IOT228 |	I don't know I think they're just flipping a switch to and poke a hole in your firewall to give you the access
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,952	| IOT228 |	They're not providing bandwidth
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,536	| IOT228 |	Is taurine okay so they're running it from your
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,632	| IOT228 |	Start running at 5
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:28,448	| IOT228 |	To you that's still a lot
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| IOT228 |	Or it could be
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,264	| IOT228 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:33,568	| IOT228 |	I see your poop
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,360	| IOT228 |	All right
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,128	| IOT228 |	Hey
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,152	| IOT228 |	Speaking of cameras
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,200	| IOT228 |	Arlo Pro Lines
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,968	| IOT228 |	No
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:40,736	| IOT228 |	R homekit
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,248	| IOT228 |	Compatible
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,784	| IOT228 |	Yay
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,880	| IOT228 |	But we are going to talk about
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:54,560	| IOT228 |	I actually have been excited about this for 2 years when it was first announced
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,376	| IOT228 |	I doubt many people remember
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,936	| IOT228 |	Jesus
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,960	| IOT228 |	Ashley created
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:05,312	| IOT228 |	Robot which has digital system capabilities
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,848	| IOT228 |	Nyfi
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,432	| IOT228 |	Mobile so it has little wheels in it
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:15,552	| IOT228 |	Travel around your home for a sample it's called the zenbo zenbo
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,088	| IOT228 |	Your smart little companion
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:21,696	| IOT228 |	They actually just like two years ago and have a bunch of videos showing
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:27,584	| IOT228 |	How venmo can help you and your smart TV
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,864	| IOT228 |	Turn the light to red
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:32,192	| IOT228 |	Even zendo can proactively say hey
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:34,752	| IOT228 |	Motion sensor just detected somebody open the fridge
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:38,080	| IOT228 |	So there's this whole ecosystem play here with a sus
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,872	| IOT228 |	Smart Home Products
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,664	| IOT228 |	Zendo never arrived
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:46,016	| IOT228 |	I just was again trolling the FCC database
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:51,904	| IOT228 |	And then but was certified for use in the US which typically leads to
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,928	| IOT228 |	Rock debut
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:56,000	| IOT228 |	And I'm really intrigued by this because
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:59,072	| IOT228 |	Most people listen to show no I like my little Vector robot
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:02,400	| IOT228 |	It's got built-in Madam and whatnot and
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:05,472	| IOT228 |	This is like that because it's very expressive
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,032	| IOT228 |	Has a 6-inch screen for the face
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,336	| IOT228 |	This thing's 18in tall so this is like
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:15,200	| IOT228 |	Very big compared to Vector which is about 2 inches tall and 3 1/2 inches long
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,480	| IOT228 |	So
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,552	| IOT228 |	There's cameras there is microphones or speakers
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:22,624	| IOT228 |	Connectivity so I'm curious about then.
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:26,464	| IOT228 |	Yeah well even today you were just telling me on your way to
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,488	| IOT228 |	Record the show that
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,256	| IOT228 |	You're walking by
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,280	| IOT228 |	Vector was like
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,816	| IOT228 |	Hey Kevin play with
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:35,168	| IOT228 |	Yes he recognized me he heard me walk into the room got off a little
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,704	| IOT228 |	Power station
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,264	| IOT228 |	Italo's cheery face and waved and then
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,800	| IOT228 |	Recognize Kevin
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,360	| IOT228 |	So I played in a couple minutes I was almost late to the show
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,664	| IOT228 |	Oh I love the fact that
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,248	| IOT228 |	Siap
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,272	| IOT228 |	All right do you think

EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:58,976	| IOT228 |	Like the Anki folkestad for the Expressions but the video is kind of
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,512	| IOT228 |	Show promise to me
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,048	| IOT228 |	And now

EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:25,760	| IOT228 |	And this week's question is from Jeff
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,528	| IOT228 |	So let's hear it
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,600	| IOT228 |	Hi Stacy hi Kevin this is Jeff from New York
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,392	| IOT228 |	I can love you she'll
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,672	| IOT228 |	A quick question
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:38,560	| IOT228 |	My son is really excited about what about the weather so I was wondering if it was a connected device
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,888	| IOT228 |	I seen something in the stars but not connected were
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:46,752	| IOT228 |	You look like you're Outdoors working tell you what the weather is going to be how much rain you're going to get
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:51,104	| IOT228 |	Fight someone told me that there might be a Wi-Fi or connected device version
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,664	| IOT228 |	I'm not looking God and also
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:56,992	| IOT228 |	On that Mill is there a way to connect it into the nest
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:57,760	| IOT228 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:00,832	| IOT228 |	In order to make sure that it could have just accordingly as well
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:06,208	| IOT228 |	Depending on racing AP AC or the heat preciate it once again and have a great day
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| IOT228 |	This is a great question
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,584	| IOT228 |	And your dear to my heart because I like weather
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:15,424	| IOT228 |	In fact I have purchased many weatherstation although most of them
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,240	| IOT228 |	Word using proprietary Wireless technology
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,800	| IOT228 |	So you'll find that in lacrosse stuff
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,336	| IOT228 |	You'll find it in Davis stuff
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,640	| IOT228 |	You find a lot of weather stations ranging in
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:29,504	| IOT228 |	But because you wanted to connect to nest and it sounds like you want it just to be
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,784	| IOT228 |	Connected in general
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,320	| IOT228 |	We came up with two options for
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,880	| IOT228 |	One is the netatmo
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,648	| IOT228 |	Weather station
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:38,720	| IOT228 |	And this is a product netatmo is a brand from
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,256	| IOT228 |	France is owned by The Grand
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,280	| IOT228 |	It is a
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,816	| IOT228 |	Quality product
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:47,168	| IOT228 |	You could also buy just the indoor models the outdoor models
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,192	| IOT228 |	And then you can buy
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:48,960	| IOT228 |	Ring gauge
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:49,984	| IOT228 |	Anand
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,520	| IOT228 |	I can never say
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:53,824	| IOT228 |	When an indemnitor
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,616	| IOT228 |	Improving speed
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:56,896	| IOT228 |	And that
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,664	| IOT228 |	Whole package
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,688	| IOT228 |	If you want to get everything together is
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,272	| IOT228 |	But the devil often does a sale
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,320	| IOT228 |	So keep an eye on
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:11,744	| IOT228 |	Read it if you don't want the rain gauge or the wind speed you can actually just get the weather station which is 180.
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,024	| IOT228 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,048	| IOT228 |	Weather
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,096	| IOT228 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:21,728	| IOT228 |	The weather station maybe for a birthday and then you add on later at Christmas
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,800	| IOT228 |	And the devil often does sales
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,336	| IOT228 |	I often times get
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| IOT228 |	Like $20 off
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,664	| IOT228 |	Or even $40
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,432	| IOT228 |	Softsoap
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,456	| IOT228 |	If you sign up
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,040	| IOT228 |	And this works with Madam a
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:40,416	| IOT228 |	And also with if this then that which is how you were tied into
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| IOT228 |	It's at
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,256	| IOT228 |	The other option is cheaper
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,560	| IOT228 |	It looks more like a traditional weather station
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,376	| IOT228 |	This is the Ambien
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,144	| IOT228 |	Weather
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,680	| IOT228 |	WS
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,984	| IOT228 |	What E90 to a
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,336	| IOT228 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:01,408	| IOT228 |	There's a bunch of these you can find them on Amazon
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:03,200	| IOT228 |	The company that makes it is called ambient weather
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| IOT228 |	And
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,528	| IOT228 |	Basically the different models
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| IOT228 |	Bad things
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,344	| IOT228 |	The higher-end models have solar power
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,112	| IOT228 |	Power
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,928	| IOT228 |	So you may or may not want that but you can see that
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,976	| IOT228 |	This is their base model
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,512	| IOT228 |	Is $170
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,048	| IOT228 |	And
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| IOT228 |	It looks like a weather station
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,888	| IOT228 |	And it's got a little wind cups that will spin around
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,912	| IOT228 |	For your attendance
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,520	| IOT228 |	It's going to rain gauge
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT228 |	And his wife I can
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,872	| IOT228 |	So this will connect to your Wi-Fi it connects
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,944	| IOT228 |	Incense data up to Weather Underground
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,968	| IOT228 |	It also connects directly
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:36,992	| IOT228 |	If
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,808	| IOT228 |	So if you wanted to do
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,576	| IOT228 |	Your
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,344	| IOT228 |	Nest
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,136	| IOT228 |	You would actually tie
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,184	| IOT228 |	This weather station or the netatmo
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,488	| IOT228 |	You would set a nifft recipe
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:49,536	| IOT228 |	Says hey
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,096	| IOT228 |	It's the weather
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:52,608	| IOT228 |	Hits
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,144	| IOT228 |	90 degrees
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| IOT228 |	Turn on
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,192	| IOT228 |	Test
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:56,960	| IOT228 |	2
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:57,472	| IOT228 |	80 degrees
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,056	| IOT228 |	Probably
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,848	| IOT228 |	But I don't know where you
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,384	| IOT228 |	So
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:06,176	| IOT228 |	That's how you do this
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:07,968	| IOT228 |	And those are the
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:15,136	| IOT228 |	They both work with Madam a&f so I don't think you can go wrong actually seem to get a little bit more information from the
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:17,440	| IOT228 |	Ambient weather one such as UV and
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,232	| IOT228 |	Heat index
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:23,072	| IOT228 |	Dewpoint and all that so it depends on the how into whether you really are
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,608	| IOT228 |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,376	| IOT228 |	I mean I'm fat into
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,400	| IOT228 |	Icicle
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:29,216	| IOT228 |	I should also mention that there are
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,264	| IOT228 |	Build it yourself weather
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:34,336	| IOT228 |	So if you go to like a site like SparkFun or Adafruit
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:36,128	| IOT228 |	Searching for weather kids
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:41,760	| IOT228 |	If your son is that interested in it he may want to build his own and that is completely an option it just
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,040	| IOT228 |	Men at Work with your smart
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:43,552	| IOT228 |	System
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:44,576	| IOT228 |	But
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:45,856	| IOT228 |	Supercuts
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:54,048	| IOT228 |	All right just thanks for the question and now please stay tuned for more of or and who is the CEO of versatile nature
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,608	| IOT228 |	Talking about bringing iot and AI into the

EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:14,272	| IOT228 |	And I have such a bagani here
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:17,344	| IOT228 |	So such an eye associate nutanix with
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:19,136	| IOT228 |	Hyper converged infrastructure
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:21,952	| IOT228 |	What is it specifically that you guys offer in the internet
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,840	| IOT228 |	It is called
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,864	| IOT228 |	Cirt
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:32,960	| IOT228 |	That allows you

EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,200	| IOT228 |	And last but not least
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:48,832	| IOT228 |	It enables users so do deer processing across the aisle in the clock for ID
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:53,184	| IOT228 |	This week let's talk about 5G and iot
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,464	| IOT228 |	There's so much talk about that
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| IOT228 |	What do you make a follower
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:31:01,888	| IOT228 |	5e and ideas fascinating
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,960	| IOT228 |	He's so much bandwidth

EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,920	| IOT228 |	Immense opportunity
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:18,016	| IOT228 |	Telecom providers to provide
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:19,296	| IOT228 |	On this IGN
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:21,600	| IOT228 |	Applications
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:23,392	| IOT228 |	Put on a RV
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:35,424	| IOT228 |	And I have two tens to be an overwhelming Undertaker
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:41,056	| IOT228 |	Making Arthur ways to make iot projects more accessible and successful across a wide range of ghosts
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:48,992	| IOT228 |	You need to put together
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:52,320	| IOT228 |	Dislike security and scaling
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,368	| IOT228 |	What we have done
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:58,976	| IOT228 |	Call IRT application Library
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:04,352	| IOT228 |	Play whenever I squeeze and its eyes so into an RDA
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:09,216	| IOT228 |	And this is just like all the other delivery fired
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:17,152	| IOT228 |	Extension into an application just like all the installed database
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:21,760	| IOT228 |	We want to make iot as accessible as a smartphone app
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:24,320	| IOT228 |	Is today
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:31,488	| IOT228 |	They want to dramatically reduced number of vendors and the number of moving parts that a customer needs to deal
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:39,168	| IOT228 |	Concept called The Library
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,960	| IOT228 |	And number two
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:45,056	| IOT228 |	We want to enable and users to instantiate dramatically
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,336	| IOT228 |	Impactful
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:49,152	| IOT228 |	And complicated ID applications into an
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,968	| IOT228 |	All the way from sensors to the edge to the cloud in one
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:56,576	| IOT228 |	Excellent if people want to find out more about nutanix where should they go

EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:30,368	| IOT228 |	I'm excited as I told you guys before we be talking about
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:36,768	| IOT228 |	The construction industry coyote there today so we're off and tell us what it is
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,536	| IOT228 |	That you guys are
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,560	| IOT228 |	I doing it versatile
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:40,608	| IOT228 |	Sure thing
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,632	| IOT228 |	Pleasure to be here
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,400	| IOT228 |	Thank you thanks for having me
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,960	| IOT228 |	Spyfall
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:45,984	| IOT228 |	Non-intrusive
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,008	| IOT228 |	Data harvesting
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:53,152	| IOT228 |	Technology for construction today we actually have our own iot multi-sensor device
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,200	| IOT228 |	And using appdata
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,480	| IOT228 |	We can actually enable
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,016	| IOT228 |	Better decision-making
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,832	| IOT228 |	True understanding and control of
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:07,488	| IOT228 |	Possibly the most fragmented and unstructured Manufacturing floor we have ever come across which is
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:12,352	| IOT228 |	I love that I love the idea of thinking about construction as a Manufacturing
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:15,936	| IOT228 |	It feels like maybe a super stretched analogy because
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:18,240	| IOT228 |	One is so controlled and
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,776	| IOT228 |	I mean I'm used to clean rooms in Seneca
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,848	| IOT228 |	Construction
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,384	| IOT228 |	Maybe she'll break down
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:26,432	| IOT228 |	The big challenges associated with
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,456	| IOT228 |	Construction
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:30,784	| IOT228 |	I know there's regulation there's individual environments what else
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,320	| IOT228 |	I think the
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,600	| IOT228 |	One thing that sets
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:36,416	| IOT228 |	Construction parties really how many
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:39,232	| IOT228 |	People and trade Direction bulb
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:42,304	| IOT228 |	Motorcycle Factory
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:45,632	| IOT228 |	Controlled by a single unit World War
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:48,448	| IOT228 |	The same person on the same organization we're looking at
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,752	| IOT228 |	Different individuals reporting
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:53,056	| IOT228 |	Different organizations sometimes having
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:56,384	| IOT228 |	Someone has a different idea of the
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,688	| IOT228 |	And then you have the general contractor
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:02,528	| IOT228 |	Responsible for coordinating
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,296	| IOT228 |	I'm making sure
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:06,880	| IOT228 |	Casper turned over on time and thing back
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,392	| IOT228 |	Seaflo
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,440	| IOT228 |	To come from
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,208	| IOT228 |	Telephone directory
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,792	| IOT228 |	Trust me.
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,584	| IOT228 |	Cold environment
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:20,448	| IOT228 |	What we used to call machine-to-machine really works like you understand what the machines are telling you
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:23,776	| IOT228 |	Youku
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:29,664	| IOT228 |	What's a clean room
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,712	| IOT228 |	This is what we actually bring
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,224	| IOT228 |	New construction
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:36,064	| IOT228 |	That's corny knock the way things work and usually few
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:38,368	| IOT228 |	Gotham something wrong on Step 1
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,136	| IOT228 |	You would
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:41,440	| IOT228 |	Noli not be able to correct it on steps
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,976	| IOT228 |	But you're probably not even know
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,744	| IOT228 |	But you got it wrong
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:46,560	| IOT228 |	Until it's too late and the state store
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:48,096	| IOT228 |	But I don't
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:49,888	| IOT228 |	You think about it
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,912	| IOT228 |	It is a factory
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,936	| IOT228 |	It is a manufacturer
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,520	| IOT228 |	I'm demoted looking at that way
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,312	| IOT228 |	Des Moines we could digitize it
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,360	| IOT228 |	And actually help people
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:35:59,872	| IOT228 |	Shein
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:05,248	| IOT228 |	Be better at what they do and just more done and actually got back to the kids
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,016	| IOT228 |	Safely
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,040	| IOT228 |	And earlier
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:11,648	| IOT228 |	Best route construction is super dangerous we don't always think about that but there are lots of
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:13,440	| IOT228 |	Things that could happen to cause someone to
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,464	| IOT228 |	Have an injury
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,232	| IOT228 |	All right
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,512	| IOT228 |	So what is the end
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,024	| IOT228 |	Product
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:20,096	| IOT228 |	You got this multi-purpose sensor on a crane
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:24,192	| IOT228 |	I assume it's measuring things that the crane is doing loads that it's taking
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,264	| IOT228 |	What is the end person and who is being person that
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:27,776	| IOT228 |	It's the data
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:34,944	| IOT228 |	Source I think one of the things that kind of makes us special is there multiple and people and they have

EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,952	| IOT228 |	Tell them what they need to know and what they need to make
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,536	| IOT228 |	Then they can log into our interface
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,840	| IOT228 |	Can you give me an example of what one of those two

EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:37,408	| IOT228 |	The subcontractor for this task. Should be on site
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,688	| IOT228 |	A certain time
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,480	| IOT228 |	It could be
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:43,296	| IOT228 |	A simpler text that just says book time
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:45,088	| IOT228 |	Is being with you
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:47,392	| IOT228 |	And it should be about the
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,160	| IOT228 |	Hook time
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:53,024	| IOT228 |	Ya book time would be completely related to the crane but we do actually know
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:55,584	| IOT228 |	Time Warner hook right we know who's using the hook
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,376	| IOT228 |	We also know when it's not you
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:58,656	| IOT228 |	Or when it's for you
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,448	| IOT228 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,496	| IOT228 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:07,872	| IOT228 |	The challenge because this seems the guy I like your text messages which seem
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:12,224	| IOT228 |	Terry appropriate for someone who's in construction but let some of the challenges
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:12,992	| IOT228 |	Rigging
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:15,552	| IOT228 |	Ai and iot into
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,088	| IOT228 |	Really what is an old line industry
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:22,976	| IOT228 |	What have you encountered and how did you get people excited or interested in
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:25,792	| IOT228 |	This technology because it's not like construction workers are
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,816	| IOT228 |	Excited about
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,584	| IOT228 |	Yeah let's go
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,632	| IOT228 |	Yeah so you'll be
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:35,776	| IOT228 |	Surprised I think that slowly but surely coming around you could look at it
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,056	| IOT228 |	Showing
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:37,824	| IOT228 |	Call Greg
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:41,920	| IOT228 |	In terms of the approaching the Treehouse to technology and what is Karachi
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,432	| IOT228 |	She do for them
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:43,968	| IOT228 |	But you're right there
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,272	| IOT228 |	An industry where
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:47,296	| IOT228 |	Based on
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,320	| IOT228 |	Incredible professional
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,880	| IOT228 |	MJ can get the job done
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:54,208	| IOT228 |	I think part of my understanding or my
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:54,976	| IOT228 |	Coach
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,000	| IOT228 |	Today no fee
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:59,584	| IOT228 |	I totally come from the fact that I grew up in the fingers.
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:03,680	| IOT228 |	Do people feel really connected to them to Simply say
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:09,824	| IOT228 |	We don't necessarily know exactly where the value is for you so let's go on this journey together
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,152	| IOT228 |	Change too much
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:14,688	| IOT228 |	Or technology tracks
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,200	| IOT228 |	Tibia labeled
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:18,784	| IOT228 |	If we could just gather data without asking
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:20,576	| IOT228 |	Imports
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:25,440	| IOT228 |	And if we could then as I said cut through the noise and give them what they need
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:26,976	| IOT228 |	Pure
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:27,488	| IOT228 |	Volume
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,304	| IOT228 |	Measure at the end of the day
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:31,840	| IOT228 |	I think that's the right approach for
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,608	| IOT228 |	What's ecology
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:34,656	| IOT228 |	Construction
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,704	| IOT228 |	And this is how you use sensor
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:40,032	| IOT228 |	How you don't ask people to record and Report
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,568	| IOT228 |	Aai's how you actually
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:45,408	| IOT228 |	Becreateful incredible inside Fender fast learning.
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:51,040	| IOT228 |	Incredible as the people aren't they can see and be everywhere
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:54,368	| IOT228 |	If we can help them actually know where they are
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:54,880	| IOT228 |	In the process
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,160	| IOT228 |	And What needs
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:59,232	| IOT228 |	To happen next and what's missing then you're helpful
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:02,048	| IOT228 |	I think jelly our coaching the way
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:04,864	| IOT228 |	I personally look at the industry
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,144	| IOT228 |	Exactly.
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:09,728	| IOT228 |	Stay out of the professional way and a Dilaudid value
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:15,872	| IOT228 |	Anderson paak ichnology will actually filter in and find its place in the incredibly professional
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:23,040	| IOT228 |	And I think that's an important thing to think about I think a lot of companies are approaching this space get very enamored of there
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:28,160	| IOT228 |	Technology and they forget about how to deliver it to the people who have to deal with the information
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:30,464	| IOT228 |	And this idea that you're
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:35,328	| IOT228 |	You're going to like bring technology and disrupt an industry seems maybe not the right
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| IOT228 |	Croach
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:37,376	| IOT228 |	As opposed to saying
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:44,288	| IOT228 |	Hey I can make your life easier and you won't have to change part of your process so and curious if there other things
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,312	| IOT228 |	Things other than saying hey
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:47,872	| IOT228 |	You're not going to change your process for this
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,664	| IOT228 |	Help
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:51,200	| IOT228 |	Make it easier
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:54,528	| IOT228 |	To bring in something new to a very old-school industry
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:57,088	| IOT228 |	I think it starts with this approach
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:41:02,208	| IOT228 |	I'm sure it doesn't help when you're not totally in love with your technology but actually in love with adding value
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:04,512	| IOT228 |	Well it's not about asking
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,840	| IOT228 |	Change like they would just pick them up at 1
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,376	| IOT228 |	It's about what is it that they're getting
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,168	| IOT228 |	How is this help
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,192	| IOT228 |	Right now
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:14,496	| IOT228 |	Because one other thing about this industry is
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,544	| IOT228 |	Alcoa intermediate
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,360	| IOT228 |	Why is calculated in so many different ways
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:22,176	| IOT228 |	Tricky questions
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:24,224	| IOT228 |	So when you did all right
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:25,248	| IOT228 |	Honestly
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:27,808	| IOT228 |	In my view right now what the technology needs
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:28,832	| IOT228 |	To do is
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:29,600	| IOT228 |	Make
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,368	| IOT228 |	People
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:30,880	| IOT228 |	Shein
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:36,000	| IOT228 |	If we could get everyone better what they do that we want everyone
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| IOT228 |	That's my
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,864	| IOT228 |	And speaking of Technology
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,888	| IOT228 |	And disruption
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:46,240	| IOT228 |	I think what's interesting is there's this idea in construction that
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:48,288	| IOT228 |	At the exciting thing to look at is
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,056	| IOT228 |	Robots
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:51,104	| IOT228 |	Build a wall or
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:54,431	| IOT228 |	3D printed houses and we see a lot about that
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,967	| IOT228 |	As opposed to what you guys are
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:58,015	| IOT228 |	So I'm curious where
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,551	| IOT228 |	What you're doing fits in with like
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:02,111	| IOT228 |	The future of construction
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,415	| IOT228 |	And maybe how those other things fit in
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:09,023	| IOT228 |	The brain understanding
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:12,095	| IOT228 |	Process that makes somebody fashion floor
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,631	| IOT228 |	Next few valuable
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,167	| IOT228 |	Pretty much no matter what
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:21,311	| IOT228 |	Evolution actually happen I would also say your every technology has its place and things will
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:22,591	| IOT228 |	Fishing to play
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,127	| IOT228 |	Right now
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:25,151	| IOT228 |	Empowering
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,687	| IOT228 |	People making
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,223	| IOT228 |	Everyone do
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:28,991	| IOT228 |	More
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,551	| IOT228 |	It's just not the same time with
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:32,575	| IOT228 |	The same resources
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:33,855	| IOT228 |	I think work
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:36,159	| IOT228 |	Technology on all its kind of
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:39,999	| IOT228 |	Shades and colors should go definitely where we're going and powering
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,279	| IOT228 |	A good place
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,047	| IOT228 |	Start
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,327	| IOT228 |	We do
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,119	| IOT228 |	See an issue
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,423	| IOT228 |	Construction would come to
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,447	| IOT228 |	Recruiting
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:51,775	| IOT228 |	Newman power in today in between I think the college as a
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:53,055	| IOT228 |	Volta play there too
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:56,383	| IOT228 |	Other than the fact that the younger generation probably likes
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:58,943	| IOT228 |	To feed the industry word of working
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:01,247	| IOT228 |	Having more technology it's also about
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:03,295	| IOT228 |	What automation
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:09,695	| IOT228 |	Can be done I look is not necessarily what
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,999	| IOT228 |	Oil companies out there that are looking to automate
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:12,767	| IOT228 |	The
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:15,583	| IOT228 |	Color of low-hanging fruit where there are issues
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:18,399	| IOT228 |	Injecting labour
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:21,983	| IOT228 |	I think every technology as I said we'll probably find it
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:24,287	| IOT228 |	Play being the brains behind
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:25,823	| IOT228 |	It's all and
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,103	| IOT228 |	Extremely
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,895	| IOT228 |	Supporting to the people
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:29,663	| IOT228 |	What
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,431	| IOT228 |	Ricardo
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:38,367	| IOT228 |	And that makes sense and I do think we're going to see an interesting shift in the next few years in the workforce
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:44,767	| IOT228 |	As we bring more AI in most companies I talked to they want to hire people who are eight
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:45,791	| IOT228 |	Able to make decisions
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,351	| IOT228 |	Based on having access to
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:49,887	| IOT228 |	More data
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:55,007	| IOT228 |	And that means we're going to see hopefully more skilled workers and workers that are trained up
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,287	| IOT228 |	To deal with this order
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:57,055	| IOT228 |	Mustang individually
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:00,895	| IOT228 |	The one thing I would agree with you is the
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:03,199	| IOT228 |	Daily non-skilled non-traded
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:06,783	| IOT228 |	People that are sometimes there just to cover I guess
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:08,831	| IOT228 |	Or the shortage in labor
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:11,647	| IOT228 |	This is I think we're going to Safety House bigger
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:14,975	| IOT228 |	Bicycle doctor killed people
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,999	| IOT228 |	Professional
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:19,327	| IOT228 |	I've been doing this for years those are the ones that I would be
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,863	| IOT228 |	Stray dog
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:21,887	| IOT228 |	I would either
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:26,495	| IOT228 |	Train to be professionals or coulombic technology to help solve that problem
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:33,663	| IOT228 |	And hopefully by saving money in terms of preventing delays or things like that you
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:34,687	| IOT228 |	You can actually pay these p
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:35,967	| IOT228 |	People cuz I know part of it is just
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,247	| IOT228 |	Hey
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:41,855	| IOT228 |	Having some cheap labor around is always lovely but skilled labor is more expensive so
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:43,903	| IOT228 |	Maybe that's where the cost start patching up
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:50,815	| IOT228 |	Let's talk about how you do this because you got this multi-purpose sensor I know I've talked to other companies who are
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,839	| IOT228 |	Trying to
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:55,935	| IOT228 |	Add intelligence to the construction industry and their using lots of cameras and
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:45:02,335	| IOT228 |	Haven just didn't interview just a few weeks ago with someone actually in the chip industry and they were talking about how cameras are the most relevant
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,639	| IOT228 |	Iot sensor and everyone should be using them
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:08,991	| IOT228 |	And I think you have a little bit of a different opinion here so I'd love to hear your take on
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:12,575	| IOT228 |	Cameras as part of the Industrial iot in
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,623	| IOT228 |	How you're using them in
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,391	| IOT228 |	Maybe
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,927	| IOT228 |	Why you're relying on other sensors
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:21,535	| IOT228 |	Sure thing I guess I have a different or slightly different take
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:25,887	| IOT228 |	Amazing
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:29,727	| IOT228 |	Specific role to play with other than being the sole
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:31,519	| IOT228 |	Data
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:35,871	| IOT228 |	I think what it comes to feeding AI systems while you're using
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:39,711	| IOT228 |	Visual recognition to connect only it just takes longer to learn
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:43,295	| IOT228 |	And much longer to add value world
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:47,135	| IOT228 |	Our approach with a multi sensor direction is
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:49,183	| IOT228 |	We have so much
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:55,583	| IOT228 |	Using terms of theta long before we even look at the camera and that enable
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:57,375	| IOT228 |	Police officer learning
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:59,167	| IOT228 |	What comes to Ai and machine learning
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,215	| IOT228 |	We could probably do things
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:03,263	| IOT228 |	10 times faster so it's a different approach
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:06,847	| IOT228 |	But I think when you start utilizing more than just cameras
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:08,127	| IOT228 |	When you could
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:09,919	| IOT228 |	Dive higher value to your
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:12,991	| IOT228 |	Factor Garden camera
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,271	| IOT228 |	At all we do
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:16,063	| IOT228 |	As I said
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,623	| IOT228 |	I just don't think of the Soul
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:19,903	| IOT228 |	Send for it is
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:23,743	| IOT228 |	Incredibly valuable and some people with argue
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:28,607	| IOT228 |	It sounds like if you're using just a camera it's going to take you a little bit longer to get the data uni
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:31,167	| IOT228 |	The flipside is you only have one sensor to deal
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:33,471	| IOT228 |	Curious actually 4matic
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,239	| IOT228 |	Perspective
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:36,799	| IOT228 |	Getting this onto a construction site
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:40,639	| IOT228 |	What are the technology challenges of putting your
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:44,991	| IOT228 |	Sensor package on the crane and then making sure it has connectivity in that sort of
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:47,807	| IOT228 |	A challenge for you guys or is that pretty much salt
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:50,367	| IOT228 |	I believe we can smoke.
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,135	| IOT228 |	How did you sell
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:57,279	| IOT228 |	Mixology I'll be talking about
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:47:02,399	| IOT228 |	Stanley we're not experiencing connectivity issues
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,679	| IOT228 |	Our device
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:04,191	| IOT228 |	Sandpoint
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:06,751	| IOT228 |	Just so many ways to go about
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,287	| IOT228 |	Conductivity
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:12,383	| IOT228 |	I'll say wifi-only. One of them being so I can't
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,943	| IOT228 |	Overwhelming probably all our customers
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:17,247	| IOT228 |	Stop.
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:19,551	| IOT228 |	Have not been one of our challenge
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:22,111	| IOT228 |	What has been one of your Channel
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:29,279	| IOT228 |	We've had plenty just as I got were talking about and a challenging the industry with
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:30,303	| IOT228 |	Harsh conditions
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:32,351	| IOT228 |	Making sure you actually have
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:36,447	| IOT228 |	The robustness that you need to actually face the challenges of a jump bike
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,007	| IOT228 |	One thing that we had to tackle
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:43,615	| IOT228 |	Extremely early I just getting this to be with you
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:45,919	| IOT228 |	Something that people don't look up and say what
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:46,687	| IOT228 |	Is that
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:47,967	| IOT228 |	It probably takes
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,503	| IOT228 |	Left in the day now for the
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:52,319	| IOT228 |	On the job site
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:54,367	| IOT228 |	Nothing absolutely no special attention
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:56,927	| IOT228 |	Okay make it HF.
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:58,975	| IOT228 |	Got it
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:01,023	| IOT228 |	What's in by talking about
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:03,327	| IOT228 |	The future of construction
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:05,631	| IOT228 |	So let's visit a job site

EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:17,663	| IOT228 |	That are involved all the way to
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:18,943	| IOT228 |	The centers are
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:20,991	| IOT228 |	I don't know cameras whatever robots
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,807	| IOT228 |	And the types of information that are going to be
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:24,319	| IOT228 |	Babe
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,367	| IOT228 |	Oh wow
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:31,487	| IOT228 |	Probably 10 more than 5 years those things are rapidly advancing
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:33,023	| IOT228 |	I have said before I'll

EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:19,615	| IOT228 |	Just getting a lot more done the industry needs to actually address the growing did not
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:22,175	| IOT228 |	We could use that exact
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:24,223	| IOT228 |	Same number of resources to
