EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:23,552	| IOT030a |	Hold on hold on
EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:27,136	| IOT030a |	Okay is it a potpourri of iot
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:27,904	| IOT030a |	Oh my
EDL	00:00:27,904	00:00:30,976	| IOT030a |	Goodness it is a potpourri of iot
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:33,536	| IOT030a |	I will never do that joke again I pray
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:35,072	| IOT030a |	Cuz I asked
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:39,936	| IOT030a |	Cuz I never say
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:41,984	| IOT030a |	This is a shadow
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:44,288	| IOT030a |	For everyone who is running while listening to podcasts
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:46,080	| IOT030a |	Cuz apparently they're like 5 if you out there
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:50,944	| IOT030a |	Go run run faster faster and for the rest of you hurt slugs like me
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:52,480	| IOT030a |	Just chill it's all good
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:55,040	| IOT030a |	This week on the Smart Home
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:57,344	| IOT030a |	Prince what do we have we should start off with
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:59,392	| IOT030a |	I got a little testy about smart home stuff
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:02,208	| IOT030a |	Yes you did
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,512	| IOT030a |	You cut it off on the whole industry
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:06,048	| IOT030a |	I did well
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:07,328	| IOT030a |	I'm just going to say it
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:10,144	| IOT030a |	Mad I got really frustrated
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:10,912	| IOT030a |	And I
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:16,032	| IOT030a |	To tell you how frustrated I got I basically said the best product out there right now is the Winx
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:16,800	| IOT030a |	Smart home hub
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,592	| IOT030a |	And that that gives you a clue Kevin
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,616	| IOT030a |	End of how bad
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:21,152	| IOT030a |	I feel that the industry
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:25,504	| IOT030a |	Oh I know that's bad because I'm like on the wink bandwagon and you
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:29,600	| IOT030a |	Got so many different hugs in the bridges and whatnot that you like me
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,368	| IOT030a |	But
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:32,416	| IOT030a |	The fact that you're saying that the best product
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:33,440	| IOT030a |	In the market
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:36,512	| IOT030a |	Maybe made by a bankrupt company is pretty telling
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:37,536	| IOT030a |	So my issue is
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:39,328	| IOT030a |	Every
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,864	| IOT030a |	Company out there
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:43,936	| IOT030a |	I feel like everyone is basically accepted that early adopters
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,472	| IOT030a |	Are going to early adopt
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,008	| IOT030a |	And everybody else is just
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,056	| IOT030a |	Going to follow them and there's this Acceptance in the market
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,592	| IOT030a |	Sometime
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,872	| IOT030a |	People are going to start buying these
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,408	| IOT030a |	Men
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,200	| IOT030a |	There's no care for the
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:55,968	| IOT030a |	Consumer
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,248	| IOT030a |	And people just keep
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,016	| IOT030a |	Pushing out
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,552	| IOT030a |	Products that
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,856	| IOT030a |	Need to be updated in terms of like
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:04,672	| IOT030a |	Like home kid and we even they're pushing out incompatible stand
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,720	| IOT030a |	Nobody is telling a
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,000	| IOT030a |	Coherent story
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,768	| IOT030a |	About
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,560	| IOT030a |	What is devices do
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,072	| IOT030a |	And
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:16,192	| IOT030a |	Products are really expensive and people are installing them for the Long Haul
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,496	| IOT030a |	Yeah I mean your home is a
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:22,848	| IOT030a |	Tell me the biggest investment that most people make and when you do things around the house
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,872	| IOT030a |	Spend that money
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,176	| IOT030a |	And you'll do it over and over and over and over again
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,968	| IOT030a |	Like you and I do with our Gadget
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,016	| IOT030a |	So that's one aspect
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:33,344	| IOT030a |	Some of these companies aren't even pushing a product or pushing a vision
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,624	| IOT030a |	And then we can have a problem
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,696	| IOT030a |	You mentioned you know we've and
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,256	| IOT030a |	And Google's thread and all that you know
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,792	| IOT030a |	Nothing's come of that yet
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,816	| IOT030a |	Red is a newly launched
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,608	| IOT030a |	Are relatively newly
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,704	| IOT030a |	And yeah those products are not really in the market
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:54,080	| IOT030a |	I mean they're backwards compatible there's a couple of things that can be updated the thread if they were using zigbee chips
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:57,152	| IOT030a |	With homekit coming out basically
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,688	| IOT030a |	Anybody who's purchased
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,456	| IOT030a |	A smart home
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:02,016	| IOT030a |	Product in the last to know three years
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,064	| IOT030a |	You're going to have to buy everything new
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,856	| IOT030a |	For home yet if so
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,392	| IOT030a |	You know everyone's like well orally adopt
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,416	| IOT030a |	Do you know that's what have
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:11,744	| IOT030a |	What happens if you want to do
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,512	| IOT030a |	The nest
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| IOT030a |	Weave
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| IOT030a |	That's a new protocol that also
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,632	| IOT030a |	Isn't actually quite in product Seattle
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| IOT030a |	Won't be till next year is
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:19,936	| IOT030a |	Talk about
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,960	| IOT030a |	What is Thatcher thing
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,264	| IOT030a |	Also what if you decide you don't want to
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| IOT030a |	Stick with apples
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT030a |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,336	| IOT030a |	And you want to switch phones
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,640	| IOT030a |	I've got all these locks and whatnot
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,176	| IOT030a |	Installed in your house
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,968	| IOT030a |	This is terrible for the engine
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,248	| IOT030a |	This is just
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,296	| IOT030a |	Terrible it is terrible and
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,600	| IOT030a |	I mostly agree with your point about
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:42,208	| IOT030a |	What's better nothing about the consumer I think most of the companies would argue against that
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,744	| IOT030a |	Hopi prophecy reasons
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,304	| IOT030a |	I think really what it is they're all trying to
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,096	| IOT030a |	Innocence I almost blame Apple for this
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,144	| IOT030a |	They're all trying to own the experience
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:53,728	| IOT030a |	So they're pushing everything they can at getting
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| IOT030a |	You know broad acceptance
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| IOT030a |	Products installed in homes
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,104	| IOT030a |	Getting their apps on everything so
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,384	| IOT030a |	People can do stuff with them
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,664	| IOT030a |	This is kind of why I like
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,944	| IOT030a |	Amazon's approach because
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,504	| IOT030a |	They're pushing your own experience by
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,272	| IOT030a |	Putting out a plateau
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,808	| IOT030a |	As opposed to
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,576	| IOT030a |	Putting out
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,368	| IOT030a |	Actual Smart Home Products
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:16,768	| IOT030a |	Bright and as soon as I see Amazon embracing or babies other people embracing Amazon and I talked to him
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| IOT030a |	A lot of different
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,303	| IOT030a |	Companies
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| IOT030a |	Pushing smart
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,607	| IOT030a |	Sun products
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,935	| IOT030a |	Soon as I see more of Amazon so-called
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,959	| IOT030a |	Competitors
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,495	| IOT030a |	Building stuff on
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,519	| IOT030a |	Viecco
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,823	| IOT030a |	Play service
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,383	| IOT030a |	The Voice servicenow
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,663	| IOT030a |	I will I will
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| IOT030a |	Bailey Bryan
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,967	| IOT030a |	Into it cuz that's really what I want to
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,527	| IOT030a |	You know please Google
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,575	| IOT030a |	Urm Google is actually
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| IOT030a |	Titus calendar
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT030a |	I asked
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,927	| IOT030a |	My echo for my calendar for the day
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| IOT030a |	I want to control my Sonos
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,743	| IOT030a |	Over
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,279	| IOT030a |	My echo I want to
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,559	| IOT030a |	I want to get Spotify on that
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:55,935	| IOT030a |	And that's a thing I mean it's going to take time for these Integrations and actually I think out of everybody
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:58,495	| IOT030a |	Amazon probably done the best job by putting there
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:03,615	| IOT030a |	Code and SDK is out there and leaving it up to all these smart home product manufacturers to
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,151	| IOT030a |	Use the cloud service or not
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:09,247	| IOT030a |	It's to the point though I were still have to buy so many different unique
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,039	| IOT030a |	Hubs and bridges and things
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:15,391	| IOT030a |	You don't think people don't want and I said it before I don't want all these hugs and prayers only have one
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,743	| IOT030a |	Ethernet port on my Google onhub router I don't have room for a bunch of hugs and brushes
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,911	| IOT030a |	Well then that's okay I knew I was okay because going back to the very beginning
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| IOT030a |	Topic
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:31,263	| IOT030a |	Cause my wink doesn't have to be hardwired to a router it works over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,103	| IOT030a |	Hey he works what can I say
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,663	| IOT030a |	It does what I needed to do
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| IOT030a |	Link is so
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,711	| IOT030a |	Temperamental
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,247	| IOT030a |	And it turns on my lights
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,319	| IOT030a |	If you have much higher standard
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,415	| IOT030a |	And that's okay
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,439	| IOT030a |	My high standard
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,231	| IOT030a |	Interfering with my ability to enjoy it
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,767	| IOT030a |	That's correct
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,839	| IOT030a |	I'm glad you said it not me
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:59,423	| IOT030a |	Alright well if you have high standards like
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,703	| IOT030a |	You may be disappointed
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| IOT030a |	If you don't
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| IOT030a |	Perhaps you should be in the early adopter camp
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,799	| IOT030a |	In
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,823	| IOT030a |	Or pick up the wink
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:09,407	| IOT030a |	So so this is my my call to the industry is
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,967	| IOT030a |	Stop treating customers
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| IOT030a |	Like guinea pigs
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,807	| IOT030a |	Especially if you really want us to get beyond the earliest
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| IOT030a |	Because I can tell you
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:21,951	| IOT030a |	People ask me questions about this stuff all the time especially when they find out what
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,487	| IOT030a |	I'm writing about in there just like
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:30,143	| IOT030a |	Stacey how do you spend like that kind of money on something when you know that you know it's going to be obsolete
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:36,543	| IOT030a |	And I'm like oh I'm kind of hoping it's not going to be but but it might be in
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,335	| IOT030a |	I have to swear to be okay
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:41,919	| IOT030a |	Then I just kind of shrugged and I say it's my job but honestly if it weren't my job I don't
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,455	| IOT030a |	I can't really canceled
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| IOT030a |	I really can't
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,551	| IOT030a |	It was amazing to me is that
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,831	| IOT030a |	A Smart Homes are not new
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:53,183	| IOT030a |	Just the consumerization of them I would say is relatively new
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,743	| IOT030a |	And even from where we were
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,767	| IOT030a |	5 years ago
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,279	| IOT030a |	5 years ago
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,607	| IOT030a |	Even where we are from 5 years ago
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:05,727	| IOT030a |	We got the basic building blocks in place we finally settled on the right radios and so on
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:11,103	| IOT030a |	And we got pretty widespread compatibility between mobile operating systems to control these things we got voice
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,383	| IOT030a |	Recognition to handle it
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:12,895	| IOT030a |	And yet
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,455	| IOT030a |	There are still so many different
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,991	| IOT030a |	Ways of doing it and it's just
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,271	| IOT030a |	It's annoying as all get-out
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,295	| IOT030a |	I don't even think
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,319	| IOT030a |	Solid
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,599	| IOT030a |	Be honest but
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:22,879	| IOT030a |	That's okay
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,719	| IOT030a |	So that's that was me going postal on the smart
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| IOT030a |	The ministry
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,511	| IOT030a |	Get your stuff together and
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| IOT030a |	But in that vein
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:36,959	| IOT030a |	For those of you guys were Brave out there brave enough we do have a lot of I get the occasional emails from
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,983	| IOT030a |	You guys keep up coming
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| IOT030a |	Love it
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,031	| IOT030a |	From people asking
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,055	| IOT030a |	Basic questions
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,383	| IOT030a |	Kevin I thought this would be a good time to to answer those Bass
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,407	| IOT030a |	Questions on
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,431	| IOT030a |	How does
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:49,503	| IOT030a |	People get started what kind of questions should they ask in
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:54,879	| IOT030a |	Do you know we do this every now and then but I figured now's as good a time as any to kind of go over this so Kevin
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,927	| IOT030a |	What kind of questions should people ask
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,719	| IOT030a |	Ask themselves when they're considering a smart
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,279	| IOT030a |	Take me like oh I want to have a smart home
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,327	| IOT030a |	Short I mean the end there so many
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:07,423	| IOT030a |	And so and when I can obviously come up with all of them but I can come up with a bunch of the top of my head
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,495	| IOT030a |	I think the first thing you want to do is figure out what
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,543	| IOT030a |	Devices you want to control
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| IOT030a |	Do you know some people may not care about locks
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,127	| IOT030a |	Garage doors and one I just met want lights
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,431	| IOT030a |	Timmy want integrated music system
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| IOT030a |	I would make a list
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:25,599	| IOT030a |	And what you want to add first cuz it's tough as we just said does not come cheap
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,671	| IOT030a |	I think in your article you said you'd spent over $3,000 in the past
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,695	| IOT030a |	Er-2
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,743	| IOT030a |	Yasso
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| IOT030a |	I was call it what do you want to do
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT030a |	Say you want a smart home
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:45,567	| IOT030a |	Yeah I'm absolutely I'll figure out and prioritize a list of what it is you want to do and I think that's a perfect
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,591	| IOT030a |	Perfect start
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| IOT030a |	And once you do that
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,407	| IOT030a |	Then I would say I would
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,687	| IOT030a |	Start researching
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,223	| IOT030a |	Various hubs and platforms
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,503	| IOT030a |	Because
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,319	| IOT030a |	Some of them support certain products emblem support others
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,623	| IOT030a |	Certain products and maybe the products you're looking at
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,159	| IOT030a |	Are supported and maybe I want to
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:03,231	| IOT030a |	Pacific garage door opener doesn't work with Samsung
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:03,743	| IOT030a |	SmartThings
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,791	| IOT030a |	Throwing it out there and let me know
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| IOT030a |	Give me an example
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,863	| IOT030a |	I think that's your best bet
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:13,983	| IOT030a |	Is to figure out what supported products are on your list work with which hubs and they're going to find overlap
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,519	| IOT030a |	Which is great I think that's ideal
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,823	| IOT030a |	Temperature outside going to find some things
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,847	| IOT030a |	Can't be controlled by certain
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:19,871	| IOT030a |	Certain hubs
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:25,503	| IOT030a |	I would ask if you want to you know do voice activation and control that means you probably won't either
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,575	| IOT030a |	Homekit stuff with serious resuming an IOS person
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,367	| IOT030a |	Whenever you go with me Amazon Echo
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,183	| IOT030a |	You know nothing there are other we talked about the IV I believe
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,231	| IOT030a |	I would say actually
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,743	| IOT030a |	Yes
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,279	| IOT030a |	Yes
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,559	| IOT030a |	That is
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,327	| IOT030a |	Emerging
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,095	| IOT030a |	By far
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,143	| IOT030a |	Is the most used
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,655	| IOT030a |	Way to interact
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:46,239	| IOT030a |	You won't use it everyday but until you can like
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,263	| IOT030a |	Program
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,311	| IOT030a |	Like a great rules engine and
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,847	| IOT030a |	All the ones out there kind of
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| IOT030a |	All right
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:57,247	| IOT030a |	It's just so handy in the beautiful thing is I know I said it before but I really think of bears repeating
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:01,087	| IOT030a |	Actual post I wrote four years ago over a cake all about
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:06,975	| IOT030a |	When Siri came out I said this is the invisible interface of the future and that is a beautiful thing because whether it's Siri where there is
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:09,535	| IOT030a |	You're saying Google what you're saying
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,815	| IOT030a |	You know Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:15,679	| IOT030a |	Anybody can use it as long as I can speak obviously so you're not tied to
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:20,799	| IOT030a |	Everything happening on your personal phone through your personal apps anybody in my family for example
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,823	| IOT030a |	Can turn lights on and off
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,359	| IOT030a |	You know she opened
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| IOT030a |	Close the door and so on
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,199	| IOT030a |	Give me the voice activation that's a beautiful thing as well
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| IOT030a |	Those are good things to
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| IOT030a |	To start with
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| IOT030a |	Also say
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,295	| IOT030a |	Amazon
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,111	| IOT030a |	Dot-com the retail side in their home automation Channel
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,183	| IOT030a |	Actually shows you they have a wonderful setup it shows you
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,207	| IOT030a |	What devices
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| IOT030a |	His work with
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,767	| IOT030a |	Yep so
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,839	| IOT030a |	That's a wonderful place to do research once you've decided
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,375	| IOT030a |	Hey these are the following sick
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,911	| IOT030a |	6 things I want to do in my home
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,959	| IOT030a |	And you can kind of look and be like
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,007	| IOT030a |	Oh look here all the devices that were
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,847	| IOT030a |	So starting there and then I also had someone ask
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| IOT030a |	Ask me about smart outlet
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:03,551	| IOT030a |	I was just talking about those this weekend and I'll tell you why after you talk about
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:06,367	| IOT030a |	Okay this person wanted to know what
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,391	| IOT030a |	Type of smart outlet
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,183	| IOT030a |	They should install which
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:11,999	| IOT030a |	Dear God that's actually a really hard question
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,023	| IOT030a |	Because they didn't
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,071	| IOT030a |	Ask me anything other than that
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| IOT030a |	So there's
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,655	| IOT030a |	There's a bunch of a smart outlet
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,679	| IOT030a |	Like a diamond dozen
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,751	| IOT030a |	You can get a bunch of soap from a feature category
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,543	| IOT030a |	You can get a smart outlet with
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,567	| IOT030a |	Pretty much any radio
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,591	| IOT030a |	Zigbee Z-Wave
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,871	| IOT030a |	Bluetooth Wi-Fi
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:31,199	| IOT030a |	So I would recommend anyone who doesn't have
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,735	| IOT030a |	Like a hug and doesn't want a hug
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,527	| IOT030a |	You just want to pop a smart outlet in there
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| IOT030a |	Go with a Wi-Fi or
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| IOT030a |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,087	| IOT030a |	Smart outlet
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,111	| IOT030a |	Best part Daniel
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,463	| IOT030a |	And before you go any further are you are these Outlets
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:46,559	| IOT030a |	Actual replacements for your current Outlets or add-ons to your existing
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:50,399	| IOT030a |	Because that's another question if you don't want to do installation by ripping out your existing Outlets
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:53,983	| IOT030a |	Mostly she just plug right now
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,543	| IOT030a |	Caesar daughter picture
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,871	| IOT030a |	So some things to look for in these Outlets
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,639	| IOT030a |	This one is
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,919	| IOT030a |	Does it take up your whole Outlet
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,991	| IOT030a |	Just think about that cuz like the old school wemos
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,527	| IOT030a |	You played that baby and you have
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,551	| IOT030a |	Like Trader Joe's
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,111	| IOT030a |	And that's no good
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| IOT030a |	Think about the future
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:11,903	| IOT030a |	Outlets
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,183	| IOT030a |	A lot of the ones on there
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,487	| IOT030a |	They monitor your energy usage
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,047	| IOT030a |	Which he might be like yay or you might be like
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,815	| IOT030a |	Screw that I don't need it
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,351	| IOT030a |	I'm paying an extra ten bucks sport
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:23,423	| IOT030a |	Two there's one that offer presents
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:29,567	| IOT030a |	There's actually only one that I know if that's the zuly we've reviewed them which is kind of a cool feature but you have to buy three of them to get that
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,079	| IOT030a |	So if you want
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:35,199	| IOT030a |	Don't do it a lot of them will offer dimmer capabilities on a lamp module
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,759	| IOT030a |	So if you're going to plug a lamp in this is great
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,807	| IOT030a |	If you just wanted to turn your Appliance on and off for
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,087	| IOT030a |	You don't need that
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,623	| IOT030a |	Let's see what else can these things off
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:45,951	| IOT030a |	Well let me tell you what I was looking at this weekend and why
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:50,303	| IOT030a |	You were kind enough to send me I think for my birthday a WeMo Insight switch made by Belkin
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,119	| IOT030a |	And those go for like 50 bucks so they're not cheap
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,447	| IOT030a |	Also not too big too big won't lose an outlet
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,495	| IOT030a |	It's an outlet just
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:02,335	| IOT030a |	Like any other smart outlet as you would said there's another dime a dozen
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,615	| IOT030a |	What I like about this one
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,895	| IOT030a |	That I can
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,431	| IOT030a |	Track the energy usage
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:10,527	| IOT030a |	Both in real time as well as historical and it will tell me my estimated monthly usage
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| IOT030a |	So if you're
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,343	| IOT030a |	Plugging in something that may use a lot of juice
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:18,719	| IOT030a |	And you want to keep track of that you can do that right in the app thanks to the outlets with gun additional capability
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| IOT030a |	Lottery winners don't have
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,279	| IOT030a |	That's cool
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| IOT030a |	I tend to
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,839	| IOT030a |	Dislike have how do you feel about the WeMo soft
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:29,727	| IOT030a |	It's okay only have one we moved the one WeMo switch I was thinking this weekend about adding another one because we
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:34,847	| IOT030a |	We're going to put a heater in my step daughter's room and we don't want it set to a temperature
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,615	| IOT030a |	Because of
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,895	| IOT030a |	Type of heater that we're getting
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| IOT030a |	We want to put on the schedule
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,199	| IOT030a |	So
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,783	| IOT030a |	I thought that we would be good and I can also see how much juice is actually using so
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:46,367	| IOT030a |	I'm okay with it I mean it I just pretty much use the on-off button in software
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,695	| IOT030a |	I don't see where yet. Can I get to my wink or any like that
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,535	| IOT030a |	That's a whole nother aspect going back to original question
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,351	| IOT030a |	Luby's do you want multiple apps or do you want
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,119	| IOT030a |	You know everything in one
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,679	| IOT030a |	And right now I got multiple apps for different things
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,191	| IOT030a |	You should be able to
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,471	| IOT030a |	Insight switch
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,263	| IOT030a |	200 not to your wing
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,311	| IOT030a |	That's exactly
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:07,871	| IOT030a |	It's funny you say that because then this could be helpful as well
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,687	| IOT030a |	For people who don't know what Hub they want
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:16,831	| IOT030a |	You can actually download the software for these hubs the apps for these hubs that's just SmartThings app or the WeMo app for the win
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,111	| IOT030a |	Hub app
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:20,927	| IOT030a |	And in there when it says add a product you can tap that
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:23,487	| IOT030a |	It will show you all of the supported products
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,047	| IOT030a |	So that's an easy way to research what sports what is well
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,351	| IOT030a |	Is true although
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:28,863	| IOT030a |	They also.
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| IOT030a |	For profile
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,215	| IOT030a |	Zigbee and Z-Wave which means summer genetics
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| IOT030a |	Yeah some of them
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,263	| IOT030a |	Just kind of add on your
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,079	| IOT030a |	Okay
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,895	| IOT030a |	So that's kind of a little bit for newbies who are like
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,735	| IOT030a |	I want to add stuff but I don't know what to do or maybe you're just
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| IOT030a |	Older people
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,831	| IOT030a |	You're your old hands at this in your like
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,367	| IOT030a |	I just want to
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:52,671	| IOT030a |	Yeah I don't know
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,487	| IOT030a |	Okay so exciting new products on the market
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,023	| IOT030a |	Just run down
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,791	| IOT030a |	Some cool stuff
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| IOT030a |	Corner
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:01,119	| IOT030a |	Which I remember if I've ever talked about this
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,143	| IOT030a |	But this is in the homes
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,167	| IOT030a |	Security space
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,703	| IOT030a |	This is actually really
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,007	| IOT030a |	A cool looking product it is shipping now
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,823	| IOT030a |	It's a cool thing because it is a home security products
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| IOT030a |	Four Lake Apartments
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,687	| IOT030a |	Safer transient spaces but that made
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,455	| IOT030a |	What is that mean
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,223	| IOT030a |	Apartments
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:18,015	| IOT030a |	It was in a box I don't know
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,551	| IOT030a |	A container
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,855	| IOT030a |	But it's $98
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,135	| IOT030a |	You got this like
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT030a |	Dongle that
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,183	| IOT030a |	A plug into your router
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,719	| IOT030a |	+ 3
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,487	| IOT030a |	Tabs
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,255	| IOT030a |	Corners
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,047	| IOT030a |	Open close sensors
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| IOT030a |	That you can put on
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| IOT030a |	Your door
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,631	| IOT030a |	Windows whatever
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,399	| IOT030a |	In and out
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,959	| IOT030a |	I talk to the CEO of this company and I thought it was
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,495	| IOT030a |	Is vision is basically
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,799	| IOT030a |	Just cheap and easy security
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,079	| IOT030a |	Four people and then
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:45,663	| IOT030a |	You know instead of being monitored security what it is is you
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,199	| IOT030a |	You created an app that
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,503	| IOT030a |	Is a circle of friends that gets notified if they
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,015	| IOT030a |	There's a break in
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,343	| IOT030a |	I think this is a great value
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,135	| IOT030a |	Three of these for $98
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:16:00,255	| IOT030a |	I love that I love the fact that these are very unobtrusive looking you probably won't even see them quite honestly because they
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:03,839	| IOT030a |	Kind of blend in with the casing around your window or your door
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:06,655	| IOT030a |	Musicbee so we got a standard there
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,679	| IOT030a |	Couple things I'm not
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:12,031	| IOT030a |	Keenan I don't have another place to plug a dongle in my router and
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:15,359	| IOT030a |	Not everybody else does either in even if they don't have an onhub they might have something with you
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,919	| IOT030a |	Just for ports this gets back to too many things
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,967	| IOT030a |	Being plugged in and also
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:24,063	| IOT030a |	Again this does have an app as you had said and that's what the notifications go
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:24,831	| IOT030a |	Again
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,879	| IOT030a |	I would love to see some consolidation
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,647	| IOT030a |	So that everything goes
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,719	| IOT030a |	The one that I want a smart home interface not
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,231	| IOT030a |	Smart Home
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,279	| IOT030a |	You know but that's not
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,327	| IOT030a |	Is the new product they could integrate it with
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,863	| IOT030a |	Different holiday credit to credit with
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,143	| IOT030a |	Amazon's Echo who knows
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:41,215	| IOT030a |	So that there's a lot to like here in a couple things and I'm like
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| IOT030a |	Improve anyways
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,543	| IOT030a |	Now I will say
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,079	| IOT030a |	And talking to people who build these products
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:47,871	| IOT030a |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT030a |	Stability like the way
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,175	| IOT030a |	Link has bad ads
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,479	| IOT030a |	It's about books
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,247	| IOT030a |	A couple bucks
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,015	| IOT030a |	Steer
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,039	| IOT030a |	Base building materials
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT030a |	Json
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:56,831	| IOT030a |	Retail term
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,183	| IOT030a |	So and I know in talking to the Sea
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:01,951	| IOT030a |	CEO the important
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,743	| IOT030a |	If it's super cheap
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,279	| IOT030a |	Because he's
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,071	| IOT030a |	College.
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,447	| IOT030a |	And these are probably
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:18,079	| IOT030a |	Targeted for those folks who don't have any other smart home stuff right now for me you know where the wink hub
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,615	| IOT030a |	Academy support
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,919	| IOT030a |	Call correctly so I don't necessarily
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:24,223	| IOT030a |	Yes I don't need this the stick that comes with the
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,991	| IOT030a |	The corner
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,063	| IOT030a |	You know I mean I do need it because I tell the projects designed to work right now
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:34,463	| IOT030a |	I know what the audience are going for but you could expand that audience for people who are buying hugs and a
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,999	| IOT030a |	Broader smart home ecosystem
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:36,511	| IOT030a |	You know
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,071	| IOT030a |	I can't see the FAQ is here
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| IOT030a |	But if it's
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,631	| IOT030a |	Supports like zigbee
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:47,775	| IOT030a |	Zigbee h a 1.2 wink actually supports that so then you
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:52,383	| IOT030a |	You could actually bring it in it wouldn't have the profile necessarily but you could probably try to bring it in if
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:56,479	| IOT030a |	Yeah I mean I would give it a shot because I don't want that
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,271	| IOT030a |	Extra zigbee dongle
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:01,343	| IOT030a |	Add to my router already have zigbee on my network I don't need it
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,647	| IOT030a |	Kevin I don't like dongle
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,671	| IOT030a |	Bojangles
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,207	| IOT030a |	See it I'm sitting here

EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,023	| IOT030a |	Tried to do something super advanced
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,303	| IOT030a |	Did I mess mine up
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,607	| IOT030a |	Not SmartThings fault it was me
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:47,167	| IOT030a |	Just messing things up because I was
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,191	| IOT030a |	I was too ambitious
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| IOT030a |	See guys
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:52,543	| IOT030a |	So give me give me another week as I try to extricate myself

EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,223	| IOT030a |	It's a special thing when you
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT030a |	My whole family is
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,087	| IOT030a |	To hang this to us
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,879	| IOT030a |	Just pick a system in
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,903	| IOT030a |	Stick with it for a week
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,975	| IOT030a |	Just tell them that you need a second home and that will be your smart home
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:16,607	| IOT030a |	So so yes that's quarter it by the way it's corner with a
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,631	| IOT030a |	Make a wish you wouldn't know
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,191	| IOT030a |	I'm using my hard k sound here
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,775	| IOT030a |	Corner safe.com
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,823	| IOT030a |	With a k
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,335	| IOT030a |	So
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,871	| IOT030a |	I think Lucy
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:30,175	| IOT030a |	I feel like we've done a good job today
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,455	| IOT030a |	Do you have another topic
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:31,967	| IOT030a |	But I don't think we're
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,527	| IOT030a |	Surprise okay okay
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,319	| IOT030a |	What about the kitchen in little
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,087	| IOT030a |	Products
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,647	| IOT030a |	To Baker boards yeah we got to talk about this for all the developers in
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,743	| IOT030a |	Y'all are still the kingmakers
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,559	| IOT030a |	Play Coyote poop
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT030a |	Okay
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,375	| IOT030a |	So
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,399	| IOT030a |	Exciting things
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:53,215	| IOT030a |	Is Intel announced a new note in Tilden in
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| IOT030a |	Sitwell until now
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:57,567	| IOT030a |	Pianos it was a joint announcer with the Arduino folks
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,871	| IOT030a |	So they said that they were going to put the
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,639	| IOT030a |	Mercury chip
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,175	| IOT030a |	Reno bird
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:04,223	| IOT030a |	Which up until now featured
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:04,991	| IOT030a |	What was it
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,271	| IOT030a |	Arm-based atmel
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,551	| IOT030a |	ShopRite
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:13,695	| IOT030a |	So actually if I'm not mistaken this is the first shipping product with until scary module inside
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,743	| IOT030a |	Even though they shut it off
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,791	| IOT030a |	Announced it in January at the Consumer Electronics Show
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:21,375	| IOT030a |	Is it okay well I guess it's not they shut it off also in a fuss
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| IOT030a |	Watch but that mean
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,983	| IOT030a |	That's not shipping yet this is this is actually available
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,519	| IOT030a |	Okay well an Arduino board
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:32,127	| IOT030a |	Yeah so it doesn't look as good on the rest I'll grant you that
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,943	| IOT030a |	Geek Chic in some parts of the world
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:41,343	| IOT030a |	So I am eager to hear your experience with this because
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,623	| IOT030a |	I know that
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,927	| IOT030a |	Some of the major boards that people had tried out
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,439	| IOT030a |	Using
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,535	| IOT030a |	Which had that had an atom
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,047	| IOT030a |	Chip on it
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,351	| IOT030a |	Kansas has the cork I believe
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,423	| IOT030a |	Yeah they had an Edison with a cork
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| IOT030a |	On it
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,007	| IOT030a |	Nose Edison with Adam those Heretics superhot
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,799	| IOT030a |	Ayodhya play with it
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| IOT030a |	A couple of those at the
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,335	| IOT030a |	Maker Faire
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:07,199	| IOT030a |	This is not going to run hot this for this is a 32-bit cork
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,967	| IOT030a |	Processor
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,271	| IOT030a |	384
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,295	| IOT030a |	Kilobytes
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,063	| IOT030a |	With a k
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,343	| IOT030a |	Flash memory 80
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,879	| IOT030a |	Kilobytes of RAM
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:15,903	| IOT030a |	A digital signal
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:19,744	| IOT030a |	Signal processor Bluetooth LE radio and six-axis sensor
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,768	| IOT030a |	This is the tie
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,352	| IOT030a |	The type of physical and digital worlds together
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,168	| IOT030a |	So what is it this is not
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,704	| IOT030a |	Intel Core i7 power dynamics
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,728	| IOT030a |	This is not your future
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,288	| IOT030a |	Definitely
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,312	| IOT030a |	30 bucks
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,360	| IOT030a |	Anda
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,896	| IOT030a |	Yes shipping Now song
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:39,968	| IOT030a |	Sure I have an Arduino board since I could do I want to get this
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:42,784	| IOT030a |	The difference is the chip release I don't I don't know if I'm going to
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,296	| IOT030a |	Drop the money off
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,600	| IOT030a |	Maybe
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,368	| IOT030a |	So
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,904	| IOT030a |	In another
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,672	| IOT030a |	MakerBot
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,184	| IOT030a |	Ford Flash
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:55,072	| IOT030a |	Imagination which is a semiconductor company that does more Graphics chip
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,608	| IOT030a |	Damn
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,376	| IOT030a |	A maker
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:57,888	| IOT030a |	Coyote
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,936	| IOT030a |	Based on the maps
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,448	| IOT030a |	Architecture
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:05,824	| IOT030a |	Mepps man I think I had a pocket PC or PDA with a mips chip in it
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:06,848	| IOT030a |	20 years ago
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:13,248	| IOT030a |	Oh no no no no I'm not I'm not bashing to buy any maintenance great they're still around
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,272	| IOT030a |	Options are good
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,040	| IOT030a |	So now
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,832	| IOT030a |	The mips architecture now
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,880	| IOT030a |	They're telling us that
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,416	| IOT030a |	End and I have no idea
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,720	| IOT030a |	Is this diskin's a little bit out of my purse
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:26,560	| IOT030a |	But they're saying this is great because you know up until now
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,584	| IOT030a |	All of the
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,352	| IOT030a |	Other
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,400	| IOT030a |	Maker and death boards have been using
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,168	| IOT030a |	You know arm-based
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,728	| IOT030a |	The
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| IOT030a |	Pi uses
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:36,544	| IOT030a |	It uses a specialty design
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:38,080	| IOT030a |	Broadcom SOC
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:40,384	| IOT030a |	Up until the until announcement that used a
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:41,920	| IOT030a |	Atmel
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,992	| IOT030a |	But with the mid stuff
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| IOT030a |	This is
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,784	| IOT030a |	Not a mobile
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,320	| IOT030a |	Bass processor
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,112	| IOT030a |	This is especially designed for iot
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,392	| IOT030a |	Now the specs
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,232	| IOT030a |	Sound too girly iot
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:23:01,632	| IOT030a |	Other than it has Bluetooth in it yeah I would agree this is probably more like a Raspberry Pi competitor so you could
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:06,496	| IOT030a |	I still do iot applications and design with it but it's not like Arduino there's a definite difference
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:10,080	| IOT030a |	For one thing is more than twice the price at $65
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:11,104	| IOT030a |	It's a duel
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,616	| IOT030a |	Kormit
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,408	| IOT030a |	CPU
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,712	| IOT030a |	You correct as Bluetooth 4.1
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,016	| IOT030a |	It also has 802 11ac
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,552	| IOT030a |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,832	| IOT030a |	An audio DAC
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,648	| IOT030a |	An SD card slot switch to me this is more like a
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,696	| IOT030a |	A Raspberry Pi competitor
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,464	| IOT030a |	Which
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,744	| IOT030a |	Still has tie-ins to 2
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:30,304	| IOT030a |	You know iot and smart home type things you can
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:33,376	| IOT030a |	Do all kinds of things on a runs Linux or Android so
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,424	| IOT030a |	This is a low-cost computers with us
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,960	| IOT030a |	Oh yeah and I
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,496	| IOT030a |	Interesting
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,520	| IOT030a |	Cuz I know you can make the
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:41,824	| IOT030a |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,360	| IOT030a |	Done
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:46,944	| IOT030a |	Alright so those are two new boards for people out there who are excited about Mickey
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,248	| IOT030a |	18 Hardware Goforth do so let us know which
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,528	| IOT030a |	And
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:52,064	| IOT030a |	I think that's it for the
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,832	| IOT030a |	Today Show
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,344	| IOT030a |	We will end

EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,640	| IOT030a |	It has been for like the last 2 years buying up startups
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:51,968	| IOT030a |	In The Internet of Things you guys started with I think thing work
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,248	| IOT030a |	Send keyboard up
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,576	| IOT030a |	Heceta and just recently this month you guys have bought
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,856	| IOT030a |	Before you from
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,368	| IOT030a |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,648	| IOT030a |	Is an AR
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,440	| IOT030a |	Play what's a lot of people were like
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:05,536	| IOT030a |	AR augmented reality in The Internet of Things how does that work together
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| IOT030a |	So
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| IOT030a |	I guess we should probably start with
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,120	| IOT030a |	Congratulations
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,888	| IOT030a |	And then
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,424	| IOT030a |	What is your vision
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,448	| IOT030a |	For The Internet of Things
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:16,032	| IOT030a |	Yeah well thanks again Stacy so
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:21,664	| IOT030a |	You know what we think that what's really happening here is a convergence of digital and physical
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,736	| IOT030a |	Elements in the things are the products that we interact with everyday
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:31,904	| IOT030a |	Refrigerator or an automobile or a truck is partially there in front of you in a physical format
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:36,256	| IOT030a |	But it's also partially implemented up in the cloud with analytics and iot
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:38,304	| IOT030a |	It's 04 so we've been assembling
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:41,376	| IOT030a |	A collection of technologies that helped merge together
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,936	| IOT030a |	Both the elements of the product but also the
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,264	| IOT030a |	Ways in which we would interact with products that are part physical in
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:48,032	| IOT030a |	Buy digital
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,080	| IOT030a |	Platform
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,128	| IOT030a |	Helps connect the physical product
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,152	| IOT030a |	Up to the cloud
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:58,784	| IOT030a |	And then our cold-light acquisition helped us to perform analytics against the data that we were
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,320	| IOT030a |	Gathering Findlay products
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,112	| IOT030a |	And now the beauty 4 U technology
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,184	| IOT030a |	Credible ability to go
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:08,512	| IOT030a |	Back to the physical product into projector
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:11,584	| IOT030a |	To augment all of that digital knowledge we have
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,864	| IOT030a |	Back under the physical product
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:16,448	| IOT030a |	Dashboard what's going on with the product or
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:19,776	| IOT030a |	Explain how to operate It Works products
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,800	| IOT030a |	We can kind of Mary
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:23,616	| IOT030a |	What we know diddly about the product
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:26,176	| IOT030a |	With the actual physical product that's right there in front
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,224	| IOT030a |	So I love this concept
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:30,784	| IOT030a |	Because you called it a digital twin
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,600	| IOT030a |	You also called it in Avatar but I kind of like the idea of a ditch
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:36,416	| IOT030a |	Triple twin because it sounds a little less science fiction e
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:36,928	| IOT030a |	And I think it's
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,000	| IOT030a |	Cool idea because and it's a
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:42,304	| IOT030a |	Easy one for normal people to grasp
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,840	| IOT030a |	Switches I have a
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,376	| IOT030a |	Refrigerator in reality
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:45,888	| IOT030a |	And
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,448	| IOT030a |	It's doing everything I normally would expect it to
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:51,520	| IOT030a |	To do but it also actually we're going to stop with refrigerator because
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,312	| IOT030a |	Everyone mocks the connected
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,128	| IOT030a |	Let's let's take something a little bit more
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,152	| IOT030a |	More practical
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,176	| IOT030a |	I have a Connect
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| IOT030a |	I actually have
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| IOT030a |	It has its
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,784	| IOT030a |	Job in reality
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:03,808	| IOT030a |	You know it's a lie
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,904	| IOT030a |	But there's also a stream of digital information coming off of it
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,440	| IOT030a |	That I can't actually see
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:12,768	| IOT030a |	See but it's becoming just as important to me and it's
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,792	| IOT030a |	It's this weather
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| IOT030a |	Connections
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,608	| IOT030a |	Two services
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:17,376	| IOT030a |	So
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:19,936	| IOT030a |	Various different platforms that might be connected to maybe it's
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,496	| IOT030a |	But it's also data about you know
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,544	| IOT030a |	It might have a temperature sensor in it might have
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,568	| IOT030a |	A present sensor
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,872	| IOT030a |	So all of these things are also relevant
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,640	| IOT030a |	2
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:31,712	| IOT030a |	Not just me as someone who cares about the light in my home
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,248	| IOT030a |	But also
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| IOT030a |	Platforms that have
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,320	| IOT030a |	That's correct I mean
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:41,440	| IOT030a |	The term Avatar sorted means the digital counterpart to a physical pain
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,720	| IOT030a |	But you're right the term
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,768	| IOT030a |	Digital twin is actually better because
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:45,792	| IOT030a |	Coincidence
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,072	| IOT030a |	Born at the same time
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:49,376	| IOT030a |	The point is each time you create a
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:51,680	| IOT030a |	Physical instance of a physical product
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:53,216	| IOT030a |	You wouldn't react it
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,240	| IOT030a |	Digital twin
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,544	| IOT030a |	And therefore all of the experiences
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:59,104	| IOT030a |	And exposures environmental conditions
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,152	| IOT030a |	The were experienced by the physical product
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,200	| IOT030a |	Can also be experienced by its
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,224	| IOT030a |	Digital twin
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,064	| IOT030a |	Indifferent any point in time you kind of have a one-to-one mapping between the two
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,856	| IOT030a |	This is important
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:15,232	| IOT030a |	Because there are many people that want to know what's going on with the physical product but it's a thousand miles away
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,512	| IOT030a |	However the digital twin
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,048	| IOT030a |	Is a couple of
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,072	| IOT030a |	Lost connection
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:23,168	| IOT030a |	So in terms of the engineers wanting understand how they designs performing
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,960	| IOT030a |	They can check in on the digital twin
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:26,240	| IOT030a |	What a service technician
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:28,800	| IOT030a |	Who I wants to understand if there is something
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,592	| IOT030a |	Service needs coming out board
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,872	| IOT030a |	To use Predictive Analytics
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,920	| IOT030a |	Can interact with the digital twin
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:39,040	| IOT030a |	Wait just one second before we take it to that level
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:39,808	| IOT030a |	Because I think
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,600	| IOT030a |	I want to keep it real simple gesture
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,368	| IOT030a |	For a second
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,952	| IOT030a |	Picture with it is
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,976	| IOT030a |	Nnsy
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,256	| IOT030a |	Anime
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:51,328	| IOT030a |	Not giving my my listeners all the credit and I'm sorry if I'm not
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| IOT030a |	Taking the light bulb example
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,680	| IOT030a |	Cuz I think this is really worth
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:57,216	| IOT030a |	Exploring cuz I think it's
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,776	| IOT030a |	What's before you
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,336	| IOT030a |	You're buying this augmented reality
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,616	| IOT030a |	Qualcomm hit develop
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:06,944	| IOT030a |	What's in lots of developers use it and it's really powerful in
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,968	| IOT030a |	And basically
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,760	| IOT030a |	You can hold up your phone
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,040	| IOT030a |	It's your phone that
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,368	| IOT030a |	Are there other ways
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:20,256	| IOT030a |	Certainly before you would run on phones tablets and of course my classes okay
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,024	| IOT030a |	So probably
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,840	| IOT030a |	A lot of use cases in the industrial world with migrate toward
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:26,400	| IOT030a |	Glasses because they have the advantage of being a hands-free
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,960	| IOT030a |	So I hold up something
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:29,728	| IOT030a |	Like my phone
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| IOT030a |	Smart glasses
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:32,544	| IOT030a |	And I if I looked at my light bulb
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,568	| IOT030a |	I could actually see
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:36,384	| IOT030a |	See all this digital information that I can't
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:36,896	| IOT030a |	AC current
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,712	| IOT030a |	That so I could see for example
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:42,016	| IOT030a |	It would a identify hey
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:45,856	| IOT030a |	Look at the light bulb and it could show me like all the services that I have
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,368	| IOT030a |	Connected to it
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,904	| IOT030a |	It could show me like
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:50,208	| IOT030a |	Hey the present sensor says you're here
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:53,536	| IOT030a |	Hey this says it's connected to the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,072	| IOT030a |	Stacy haiduk says it's connected
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,096	| IOT030a |	If this then that
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:59,424	| IOT030a |	These are all theoretical and this isn't what PTC is actually
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,960	| IOT030a |	Doing this is a smart home exam
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,728	| IOT030a |	The listeners
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:02,496	| IOT030a |	Now
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,520	| IOT030a |	Jim
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,824	| IOT030a |	But I just want people to understand
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:08,128	| IOT030a |	This all could come to light like
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,408	| IOT030a |	Flash
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,432	| IOT030a |	Right there and then
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:12,480	| IOT030a |	It could be super awesome because right now
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:16,320	| IOT030a |	If I look at this late I have to go to an app and try to figure this out after Remember When
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:19,136	| IOT030a |	I connected it to and there's nothing really on the market that does the
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:25,024	| IOT030a |	So imagine in my garage at home I have my car
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:31,168	| IOT030a |	And my wife has her car parked right next to it and her garage lot and I walk out and I point my phone at her car
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:33,728	| IOT030a |	And it shows me that the gas was a little low
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:36,288	| IOT030a |	And the driver side front tire
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,592	| IOT030a |	Isabel law
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:42,176	| IOT030a |	You really should change your transmission fluid because
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,968	| IOT030a |	So disability
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,736	| IOT030a |	2
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,528	| IOT030a |	Interact with physical things
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,832	| IOT030a |	But because of the digital twin
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:53,952	| IOT030a |	The gather all of the information that's specific to my wife's car and map it onto my wife's car
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,720	| IOT030a |	Because
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:58,816	| IOT030a |	And then when I move the phone over and pointed it at
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,840	| IOT030a |	My own car
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,400	| IOT030a |	We've been linked to the digital twin of my car
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,192	| IOT030a |	And we see that the transmission fluid
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,984	| IOT030a |	True Predictive Analytics perhaps
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,264	| IOT030a |	Needs to be changed so
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,824	| IOT030a |	Actually the transmission is glowing
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| IOT030a |	When I pointed at my car
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:13,408	| IOT030a |	Whereas when I pointed it at my wife's car
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:15,456	| IOT030a |	You know perhaps the tire in the yard
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:19,040	| IOT030a |	In the gas tank we're glowing As Seen On TV Gators
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,832	| IOT030a |	What needed to be dealt with
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,112	| IOT030a |	You know it's my transmission
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,136	| IOT030a |	She was going to be like
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,672	| IOT030a |	Hey there's a part of my car that's glowing
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,720	| IOT030a |	What's that
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:32,864	| IOT030a |	Well let me tell you that until the next step would be
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:33,376	| IOT030a |	Homeowner
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:37,472	| IOT030a |	Is a consumer I'm not going to work on my transmission to let's say I wasn't
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,776	| IOT030a |	The mechanic
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,800	| IOT030a |	I need to work on
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:46,432	| IOT030a |	I could know again using my glasses tablets on whatever look at that transmission and say
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,712	| IOT030a |	Explain to me
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:49,760	| IOT030a |	How I would go about service
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:53,088	| IOT030a |	And it would say well you've got to come over here and open those like
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:57,696	| IOT030a |	And then you need to remove this so I cover panel and then you need to come down here and do that
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,256	| IOT030a |	You need to come under the car and drain the fluid here and
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:07,168	| IOT030a |	What is not a general process for a general transmission
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:13,312	| IOT030a |	Specifically what to do for this specific transmission that's right in front of me with full wariness of won't spin
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,664	| IOT030a |	Bright
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,432	| IOT030a |	And that's
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,456	| IOT030a |	Awesome so
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,736	| IOT030a |	You guys have
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,504	| IOT030a |	Let's say you have
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:23,552	| IOT030a |	A lot of deals with Industrial
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,320	| IOT030a |	Companies
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:28,416	| IOT030a |	Actually got a partnership I think with GE on their brilliant Factory
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:28,928	| IOT030a |	Product
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,768	| IOT030a |	How is this going to be implemented
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,048	| IOT030a |	With your customers
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,072	| IOT030a |	Because there's
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:36,096	| IOT030a |	It's not like
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:39,168	| IOT030a |	One the deal isn't closed yet I think you said you were hoping it be closed
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:39,936	| IOT030a |	Later this quarter
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,728	| IOT030a |	So how does this
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:44,800	| IOT030a |	Cuz there's a lot of Technologies involves to walk me through
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,824	| IOT030a |	How this becomes
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:50,944	| IOT030a |	Yell if we take this idea that I have a closed loop with a product
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:53,248	| IOT030a |	Meeting Dad through Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,296	| IOT030a |	I'm getting information from that product
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:59,392	| IOT030a |	Two analytics watching that information to find things that aren't obvious
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:03,744	| IOT030a |	And then through augmented reality I'm able to see what I need to know
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,536	| IOT030a |	Is a dashboard or an instruction
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:08,352	| IOT030a |	I'm going to get back onto that product
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,400	| IOT030a |	This idea of a closed-loop interaction
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:13,728	| IOT030a |	Could be implemented in so many different businesses
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,264	| IOT030a |	In so many interesting ways
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:19,360	| IOT030a |	So I think we should just an explosion of possibilities of what things
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,152	| IOT030a |	It what what companies could do
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:26,272	| IOT030a |	People could do it with this type of technology so what we're going to bring to our customers it showed of
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,808	| IOT030a |	Technology platform
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,088	| IOT030a |	That's a very
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,112	| IOT030a |	Fastway
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:32,416	| IOT030a |	To implement some incredibly
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,696	| IOT030a |	Innovative
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,744	| IOT030a |	Now that we're going to
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:38,560	| IOT030a |	In our Enterprise Solutions business we're going to try that
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:41,376	| IOT030a |	Pre develop some of the most obvious Innovative use cases
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:42,656	| IOT030a |	But I think
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:48,800	| IOT030a |	So many possibilities here it's going to be very difficult to get the end Solutions all into a box with a bow on them
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:50,336	| IOT030a |	I think it's dead will be
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:52,128	| IOT030a |	Providing the enabling possibilities
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,712	| IOT030a |	Maybe if I could Stacy imagine walking into your laundry room
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,736	| IOT030a |	Yeah.
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:34:00,832	| IOT030a |	You know my washer and dryer at home have lots of buttons and dials and displays
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,880	| IOT030a |	Actually need that stuff
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:04,928	| IOT030a |	I could just have white boxes and Sheet Metal
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:11,072	| IOT030a |	Washer the dryer it would augment on to the washer or dryer
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,608	| IOT030a |	Appropriate digital interface
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:13,888	| IOT030a |	And then I could customize
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:17,728	| IOT030a |	So I could say I want a button on the washer for blue jay
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,288	| IOT030a |	Get all big load hot water
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,056	| IOT030a |	The cold Ranch
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:23,104	| IOT030a |	Etcetera etcetera
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:25,920	| IOT030a |	Whatever I want I'll customize that and say that
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,968	| IOT030a |	Now when I put my phone at my washer
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:31,296	| IOT030a |	In addition to all the standard stuff has got a big button that says blue jeans
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,344	| IOT030a |	And I just touch that button on my phone
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,624	| IOT030a |	Intruder
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:39,488	| IOT030a |	The washer to configure itself to do blue jeans just the way I like to do blue jeans
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:41,024	| IOT030a |	So you can see it even with
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,584	| IOT030a |	Causes to retake the whole way we design things
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| IOT030a |	Why put all that human
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:48,704	| IOT030a |	Machine interaction Hardware cost money
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:50,752	| IOT030a |	And you know can be a little complicated
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:53,056	| IOT030a |	Why building a tall is a machine
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,848	| IOT030a |	When
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,128	| IOT030a |	Wow although
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,152	| IOT030a |	I'm going to tell you
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:57,920	| IOT030a |	Two things
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:00,224	| IOT030a |	One I love the idea of having a programmable button
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,248	| IOT030a |	Or two
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,552	| IOT030a |	5 on my washer dryer
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,320	| IOT030a |	But
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,600	| IOT030a |	I hate the idea of having the
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,416	| IOT030a |	Carry a phone around for the rest of my days
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,208	| IOT030a |	Because none of my products have buttons on
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,512	| IOT030a |	I would I would just die
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:13,792	| IOT030a |	Cuz I I just
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,328	| IOT030a |	This is this is a recurring theme
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,144	| IOT030a |	So I don't want
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:20,448	| IOT030a |	But I like the idea
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:21,984	| IOT030a |	To make the world
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,008	| IOT030a |	Programmable
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,032	| IOT030a |	Through
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,312	| IOT030a |	Maybe it's a R&B
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,104	| IOT030a |	Programmable
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| IOT030a |	Cool with that
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,176	| IOT030a |	Very cool so
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,224	| IOT030a |	It sounds like you're going to have a
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,248	| IOT030a |	Death platform
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,808	| IOT030a |	For this and so if I want to make
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,832	| IOT030a |	Before it apps
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:38,368	| IOT030a |	And like play around with like
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:41,184	| IOT030a |	Maybe I'm Tesla and I'm like hey this sounds awesome
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:43,232	| IOT030a |	I want to make an overlay for my world
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:48,096	| IOT030a |	Or maybe I'm a hospital that I want to download this and start like playing around with things the nurses
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:50,144	| IOT030a |	Dua for a patient betke
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,168	| IOT030a |	That sounds
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:51,680	| IOT030a |	Awesome you
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,216	| IOT030a |	AR
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:55,776	| IOT030a |	Certainly I mean I could look at a patient with the
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,080	| IOT030a |	Smart glasses are again with my phone or tablet
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,872	| IOT030a |	Who the patient is
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:00,896	| IOT030a |	Everything
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:07,296	| IOT030a |	Any alerts I should know right this moment but also you know how are they doing on the fitness program
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:09,088	| IOT030a |	Body temperature
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:12,672	| IOT030a |	If example anything I could get somewhere volts or from
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,488	| IOT030a |	Things like the bathroom scale that this person interacts with
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:18,048	| IOT030a |	I can aggregate together on their digital twin
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:23,936	| IOT030a |	It's all I'm always just comparing the physical to the digital twin and mapping information from one to the other
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,520	| IOT030a |	I frankly both directions here and it really gives me
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:29,568	| IOT030a |	The beauty of the physical experience
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,616	| IOT030a |	Which is still the person in front of me I see that
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:38,272	| IOT030a |	But all the richness of that digital information that used to be filed away in databases and I had to look away from the purse
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:47,488	| IOT030a |	Now I can bring that rich information right here into this experience with the person and she both the person and everything I
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,768	| IOT030a |	I need to know about the person
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,560	| IOT030a |	Soda in the same frame of vision
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:53,120	| IOT030a |	So right now though my digital twin
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,888	| IOT030a |	Like
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,424	| IOT030a |	I've got a crazy at my house has it
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,472	| IOT030a |	Will twin I have a digital.
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:37:00,032	| IOT030a |	Twin but right now all of my digital twin data
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,824	| IOT030a |	Is locked away still in different database
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,384	| IOT030a |	So how are we envisioning
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,664	| IOT030a |	The creation of the
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,944	| IOT030a |	Is digital twins in them
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,992	| IOT030a |	Coming together so like researchkit feels like
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,552	| IOT030a |	A really cool example for the medical
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,088	| IOT030a |	Coalfields of getting that data.
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,368	| IOT030a |	Come together
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,136	| IOT030a |	Place
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:18,464	| IOT030a |	I don't see how purple things developing in other Industries
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,768	| IOT030a |	Well I think if you do research on
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,584	| IOT030a |	It's working from NASA
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:27,168	| IOT030a |	I have the second space shuttle disaster
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,960	| IOT030a |	They knew on take off
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,776	| IOT030a |	That a piece of foam had broken loose and hit a tile
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:37,152	| IOT030a |	And it's suspected that maybe the tile was dislodged they didn't actually have a twin they couldn't stay well
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:38,176	| IOT030a |	What if we talk
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:42,016	| IOT030a |	A digital replica of the Space Shuttle and we knock the tile off it
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,832	| IOT030a |	And it tried to simulate the re-entry conditions what would happen
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:50,720	| IOT030a |	The theoretically could have done that but not in the time frame available to them because they didn't have any infrastructure ready to go
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:53,792	| IOT030a |	Ashley pioneered this concept of the digital twin
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,864	| IOT030a |	Which is we want a digital point of a space shuttle
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:59,936	| IOT030a |	Any point in time by looking at the digital version
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:05,824	| IOT030a |	We know what's going on with the physical version it's a little hard to look at because it's
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:09,408	| IOT030a |	Ability to understand
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:15,808	| IOT030a |	I'm a little complicated here but the basic idea is to have a one-to-one counterpart so for a person that's unlevel
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:18,112	| IOT030a |	I suppose your digital twin is your social security number
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:21,184	| IOT030a |	So how could I go and connect elements to Beta
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,976	| IOT030a |	In elements of experience
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,512	| IOT030a |	Social Security Now
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,792	| IOT030a |	Now when we move
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,096	| IOT030a |	Into the industrial world
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:30,656	| IOT030a |	We ain't got you like I did your points to be conventional
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:32,704	| IOT030a |	Because when we try to augment
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,752	| IOT030a |	Information from the
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:37,568	| IOT030a |	Digital twin positive physical
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,336	| IOT030a |	Counterpart
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:41,152	| IOT030a |	We want to map it in 3D space as well
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,712	| IOT030a |	You know if I want to attach a gauge
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:46,016	| IOT030a |	To a motor on something about machine
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:48,576	| IOT030a |	I have to know where is the motor on that machine
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:50,624	| IOT030a |	And how does that change as I walk around the machine
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,184	| IOT030a |	Sit ups and down to Subway
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:56,768	| IOT030a |	Okay I guess the Internet of Things has a big debt to Nasser that we should
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,072	| IOT030a |	But not today
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:01,120	| IOT030a |	Because we are almost out of time so
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,656	| IOT030a |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:07,008	| IOT030a |	For coming on the podcast I'm a little chilled by the idea of my social security number
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:13,152	| IOT030a |	And all of the information I'm creating being attached to that but we'll have to work on some security associated with that
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:13,920	| IOT030a |	And
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:16,224	| IOT030a |	You know for people and then four
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:16,736	| IOT030a |	Devices
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,272	| IOT030a |	I know you guys are
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,040	| IOT030a |	Already
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:23,648	| IOT030a |	Adapt it 3D software and all of that so I look forward to seeing
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:25,952	| IOT030a |	Kind of how this plays out in the real world
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:32,352	| IOT030a |	But we'll be doing with our digital Twins and how that's going to change manufacturing you want to give us one quick example
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:37,984	| IOT030a |	Should I walk through a factory in there are many pieces of automation equipment in the factory from different vendors
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:42,080	| IOT030a |	And I point my phone at 1 after the next on the knees while I get a dashboard of
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,384	| IOT030a |	How productive that piece of Machinery is
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:47,200	| IOT030a |	How much you should say odd and what service needs it down
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:48,480	| IOT030a |	That's not move on to the next one
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,784	| IOT030a |	Can I get a whole different experience
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:54,368	| IOT030a |	Different piece of equipment from a different vendor and you know I'm going to factory filled with them
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:56,928	| IOT030a |	What is ability to interact
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,464	| IOT030a |	In a rich interactive way
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,744	| IOT030a |	One thing at a time
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:00,768	| IOT030a |	In a way that's
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,304	| IOT030a |	Specialized to that thing
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,608	| IOT030a |	Alex a very powerful exciting idea
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,656	| IOT030a |	Thank you so much for
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,168	| IOT030a |	Coming down the pike
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:09,216	| IOT030a |	Yeah thank you Stacey
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,800	| IOT030a |	And that concludes this week show
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:15,616	| IOT030a |	Thank you so much for listening and we'll see you next week
