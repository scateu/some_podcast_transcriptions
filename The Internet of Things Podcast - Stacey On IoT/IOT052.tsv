EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:39,840	| IOT052 |	I do too

EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,384	| IOT052 |	So Thursday
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:53,664	| IOT052 |	AR podcast
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,712	| IOT052 |	A website called the information
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,016	| IOT052 |	Publish the story that
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:01,344	| IOT052 |	Wow Dropped a Bomb It talked about
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:04,160	| IOT052 |	And had an interview with Tony fadell the CEO of nest
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:07,488	| IOT052 |	The Exodus of over 500 employees
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,768	| IOT052 |	Abbott company
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:09,792	| IOT052 |	Why
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,840	| IOT052 |	Nest has not managed to
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,632	| IOT052 |	Introduce new
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,424	| IOT052 |	Products in the two years that
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,728	| IOT052 |	It's been since Google has purchased it
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,496	| IOT052 |	And
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:21,312	| IOT052 |	Kind of laid bare a management style that is
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,104	| IOT052 |	I don't know how would you describe it
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,408	| IOT052 |	You know
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,688	| IOT052 |	An anesthesiologist
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:32,832	| IOT052 |	Stop people clearer I don't know anything about this internally at Google so this is just speculation and observational
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,880	| IOT052 |	Answer your question
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,928	| IOT052 |	Barely controlling
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| IOT052 |	Turley controlling and mean
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,536	| IOT052 |	Tony fadell came from Apple
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| IOT052 |	Which
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,584	| IOT052 |	Controller
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,864	| IOT052 |	Standard operating procedure
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,960	| IOT052 |	Tight controls over Hardware software and messaging you know messaging about
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,984	| IOT052 |	About products and such
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,520	| IOT052 |	And
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,824	| IOT052 |	It's a
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,360	| IOT052 |	Based on the information story
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:58,944	| IOT052 |	N3ver pretty solid now that's I don't I don't doubt
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,480	| IOT052 |	Their sources or anything
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| IOT052 |	Seems like
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:08,928	| IOT052 |	Maybe things are too controlling over there I don't know
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,744	| IOT052 |	And seeing people leaving from nest for quite some time
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| IOT052 |	Fortunate
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,560	| IOT052 |	Didn't have a
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| IOT052 |	The access
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,120	| IOT052 |	These guys got with
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,936	| IOT052 |	But also didn't have
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,216	| IOT052 |	The time
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,496	| IOT052 |	Delve into this but
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| IOT052 |	Men
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,080	| IOT052 |	I have no reason to doubt the story because it
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,360	| IOT052 |	Chives completely with
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,944	| IOT052 |	I would also say
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,224	| IOT052 |	From
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,248	| IOT052 |	All of this
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:36,064	| IOT052 |	There's a couple lessons we should probably take from the
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,576	| IOT052 |	1
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,624	| IOT052 |	Explains to me totally
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,464	| IOT052 |	Why they're two totally different protocols called weave
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:46,304	| IOT052 |	One from Google it went from gas because it sounds like the people at Google
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,352	| IOT052 |	Are not really working with the people
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:48,864	| IOT052 |	Add nest
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:52,960	| IOT052 |	There's a little anecdote in there that Google is building an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,728	| IOT052 |	Type device
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:54,752	| IOT052 |	And
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,848	| IOT052 |	The Nest team was like hey we want in on that and the Google team was like
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,384	| IOT052 |	No thanks
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:01,920	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| IOT052 |	That feels pretty damn
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| IOT052 |	The other two this was
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| IOT052 |	The Dropcam part
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:14,976	| IOT052 |	And that's kind of a surprising to hear who who is the person over there it's Greg Duffy
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,024	| IOT052 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,583	| IOT052 |	Nest purchase Dropcam about
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,351	| IOT052 |	6 months
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:20,863	| IOT052 |	After
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,911	| IOT052 |	Google hit purchase nest
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,959	| IOT052 |	And it kind of lump those two together
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,519	| IOT052 |	Basically
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,287	| IOT052 |	When
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:33,919	| IOT052 |	Greg Duffy the CEO of Dropcam left everyone was kind of shocked and there were rumors
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,503	| IOT052 |	Nast wanted to put out this video camera
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:40,063	| IOT052 |	Hated working there
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,903	| IOT052 |	People are crying and working out
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,975	| IOT052 |	And now for the information story
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,535	| IOT052 |	Actually talk to them and explained
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,815	| IOT052 |	A lot of things
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| IOT052 |	Like ghetto
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,631	| IOT052 |	How Tony fadell
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,935	| IOT052 |	Treated him maybe not
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| IOT052 |	How someone who
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,263	| IOT052 |	Had previously run a company would want to be treated
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,079	| IOT052 |	And then on Tuesday
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| IOT052 |	Duffy actually posted
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| IOT052 |	Something on medium that said
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,199	| IOT052 |	Hey that story
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,759	| IOT052 |	I just want to say that my employees for great
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,599	| IOT052 |	Has Tony fadell had insulted the Dropcam employees in the story
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| IOT052 |	And
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,695	| IOT052 |	He went further and said that most of successes
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:21,279	| IOT052 |	From the previous earnings report we're actually Dropcam successes
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,583	| IOT052 |	Seems like a pretty big
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,631	| IOT052 |	A grenade a lot in the middle of this fight
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,423	| IOT052 |	It's getting ugly
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:31,263	| IOT052 |	And I don't know if we're going to continue or not I hope it doesn't but
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:35,359	| IOT052 |	Pieces of the story are you right lobbing grenades and and it's just not not pretty
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,431	| IOT052 |	It does show though how tough it is
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:38,943	| IOT052 |	To make
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,735	| IOT052 |	A smart home device
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,295	| IOT052 |	Tony fadell has for years
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,623	| IOT052 |	Been a proponent of the intuitive and responsive home
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:53,279	| IOT052 |	As opposed to everybody else who's trying to pitch these like programmatic homes where your like I will tell my lights to turn off at 10
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,863	| IOT052 |	Adele's version has always been that he wants
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,911	| IOT052 |	Your device is to react to you
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,471	| IOT052 |	Ness was very much part of that
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| IOT052 |	I think so
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:06,079	| IOT052 |	Ask the space kind of heat it up
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| IOT052 |	It became more and more difficult
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| IOT052 |	Control all of that
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| IOT052 |	Because
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,943	| IOT052 |	Credit score
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,223	| IOT052 |	Nest can't be a plateau
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:17,855	| IOT052 |	It has to be an ecosystem and I think it's hard for someone who's that controlling to open up and let that happen
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:23,743	| IOT052 |	And then we talked about this before I'm into to your point about it but it's difficult to make a device these days
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:28,095	| IOT052 |	There's so much changes going on between protocols and
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:34,239	| IOT052 |	Radio technology and dealing with people's privacy and security issues which are certainly valid
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:38,335	| IOT052 |	Nnn opening things up to third-party developers do you or don't you
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,127	| IOT052 |	How do you do it if you're going to do it
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:46,527	| IOT052 |	This is not a revolution that's going to happen in a short amount of time and I know that sounds obvious because innocence Stacy you and I been watching it going
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,551	| IOT052 |	One for several years now
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| IOT052 |	But this
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:53,439	| IOT052 |	Really does speak to the difficulty of it and why things
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,463	| IOT052 |	Tornados
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,999	| IOT052 |	Quick as they could be
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,559	| IOT052 |	You got people such as a apple who are
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| IOT052 |	Want to control everything
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,631	| IOT052 |	Down to the security chip inside
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:04,191	| IOT052 |	There's so many moving parts
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:07,519	| IOT052 |	And everybody wants to that to control a known bits of it
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,543	| IOT052 |	It's very very
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,055	| IOT052 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,383	| IOT052 |	Incredibly and I would say that I would love it to be
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| IOT052 |	More like the internet
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:19,295	| IOT052 |	Common protocols everybody works together but it's so far
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,343	| IOT052 |	And that's why we're going to always have these
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| IOT052 |	Bridge services
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:23,903	| IOT052 |	Services like
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:29,535	| IOT052 |	If this then that or you thinking
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,327	| IOT052 |	That's an awesome Segway
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,095	| IOT052 |	So what
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,863	| IOT052 |	Talk about what
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:33,375	| IOT052 |	What's happening with
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,167	| IOT052 |	Send that
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:41,055	| IOT052 |	I'm saying again because now it's more of a kind of bad news so to speak
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,335	| IOT052 |	Coming up Delaware
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,127	| IOT052 |	So here's what happened
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:48,479	| IOT052 |	A service called pinboard which is owned and created by one developer
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:51,039	| IOT052 |	Social bookmarking for introverts
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| IOT052 |	Attack something you favorite something and
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,951	| IOT052 |	Are you save it for later like any article or what you like on the web
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,743	| IOT052 |	Cost 11 bucks a year
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,815	| IOT052 |	It's a cool service a lot of people apparently love it
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,095	| IOT052 |	And what happened was
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,655	| IOT052 |	A post
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,471	| IOT052 |	When if this then that said hey
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,799	| IOT052 |	You know your ifta integration is going to break
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,823	| IOT052 |	On April 4th
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,663	| IOT052 |	And if you wanted to keep working
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,991	| IOT052 |	You're going to have to develop something with the new code that were release
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,783	| IOT052 |	And the developer was like
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:29,439	| IOT052 |	And then I guess she had some back and forth with it to send that because a second post that went up
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,231	| IOT052 |	I believe on Monday
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,047	| IOT052 |	And it got some play
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| IOT052 |	It was like
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,887	| IOT052 |	Yeah so here's all the things I find wrong with this so
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,447	| IOT052 |	And I think it's because his users were like
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,519	| IOT052 |	Hey if two saying our stuff is going to break what's happening
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,823	| IOT052 |	And basically this is a tough
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,359	| IOT052 |	Because
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:49,407	| IOT052 |	Totally right in saying
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| IOT052 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:55,039	| IOT052 |	I think it's great that you did this integration of my service so many years ago
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:00,415	| IOT052 |	Now that you want me to develop it for you because you're turning that perfectly fine working one-off
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,207	| IOT052 |	I'm just not going to do it
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,975	| IOT052 |	I totally get that
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:10,399	| IOT052 |	I do too and you know it Services mature and change and then there's infrastructure changes to make things better or not
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,679	| IOT052 |	Presume that's what's happening
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,471	| IOT052 |	With if this than that but
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,751	| IOT052 |	I'm looking at the
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,823	| IOT052 |	The note from the pinboard developer notes
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:23,455	| IOT052 |	Sites that want to work with if this then that will have to implement a private API that can change without warning now
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:29,855	| IOT052 |	You know it says I'm all for glue Services big and small and I think I would if this then that is to Glucerna as it's great you can put
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,903	| IOT052 |	Bug pieces in and make things work together
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:37,535	| IOT052 |	And he says it's better for the weather they connect a stable document public apis rather than custom private ones
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,071	| IOT052 |	I get that in a minutes
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:43,167	| IOT052 |	That's the ideal that's kind of part of that whole ecosystem effort worth
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,775	| IOT052 |	Founder of if this then that
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,055	| IOT052 |	And
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,823	| IOT052 |	I was like
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,591	| IOT052 |	Linden
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,663	| IOT052 |	Here a couple questions I have for you one of which was what's up with this
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:10:00,575	| IOT052 |	He responded that he says we are working with pinboard to find the right steps are in tension
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:05,183	| IOT052 |	Platform rather we want to do everything we can to help Partners take ownership of their Channel improve it over time
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,743	| IOT052 |	But in his argument is
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| IOT052 |	And his statement
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:14,399	| IOT052 |	We simply cannot maintain improve and make each of these channels great without the help of the services themselves
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:20,287	| IOT052 |	We could have done a much better job in communicating this desire for change in ownership with both pinboard and are user
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,615	| IOT052 |	So he said they have over 300 channels on it
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,127	| IOT052 |	Bissonnet today
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:28,223	| IOT052 |	They want to have thousands and they can't support this without
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,735	| IOT052 |	People's help
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:31,807	| IOT052 |	Doubt
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:35,903	| IOT052 |	There's some stuff in in the post about the developer terms of service where
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,183	| IOT052 |	Basically all of the data
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,023	| IOT052 |	If this and that
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,839	| IOT052 |	Looking out with this actually
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,959	| IOT052 |	Personal like the consumer terms and services
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,031	| IOT052 |	It looks like
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:54,335	| IOT052 |	If the sin that takes my data
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,615	| IOT052 |	And it puts
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:11:00,991	| IOT052 |	Information about me and all the things that I'm using with that it's stores all that information in a folder
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,575	| IOT052 |	Is personally identifiable
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,647	| IOT052 |	They say they don't share it
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| IOT052 |	Unless they've got
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:12,511	| IOT052 |	Law enforcement or legal processes which I believe
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,815	| IOT052 |	A civil case
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:18,143	| IOT052 |	Eeyore when it's necessary to do so to protect the rights and property
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| IOT052 |	Or others
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,775	| IOT052 |	In the same terms and conditions it says
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:30,431	| IOT052 |	Quote we may share our data including personal information about you with our partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,503	| IOT052 |	That's a little contradictory
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,599	| IOT052 |	Yeah and I asked Lyndon about that and he didn't actually respond to that
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,927	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,207	| IOT052 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:48,351	| IOT052 |	You don't they have to monetize in for the last year-and-a-half they've been working with
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,655	| IOT052 |	Third parties seoul
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:54,495	| IOT052 |	Comedies like pinboard except companies that want to be associated with if
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,311	| IOT052 |	And they've been making those companies develop their own
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,591	| IOT052 |	API Integrations.
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,383	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,199	| IOT052 |	It's been something that's been happening for a while
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:10,623	| IOT052 |	The fact that they're going to turn off the freeway or the early versions that they built up to like establish the platform
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,391	| IOT052 |	Users
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,671	| IOT052 |	It's kind of WhatsApp setting
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:17,279	| IOT052 |	That's upsetting as well as I do and I don't know the answer this question but I'm wondering how much
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,839	| IOT052 |	Advance notice that they gave to certain people
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,143	| IOT052 |	You know cuz April 4th is right around the corner
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,423	| IOT052 |	That's true
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,263	| IOT052 |	It was on Twitter when it received the letter he started to
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,335	| IOT052 |	In which case that's not enough time
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,103	| IOT052 |	No
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,919	| IOT052 |	Okay so he received a letter this week and they're shutting it down basically
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,223	| IOT052 |	Yeah that's that's
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,063	| IOT052 |	Okay so
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:45,951	| IOT052 |	Don't have a lot of conclusions there it looks like if they spend that is doing
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| IOT052 |	Services
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:53,119	| IOT052 |	In a with a developer Community to make themselves exciting for end-users and then they kind of switch the terms because I've got to make
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:57,471	| IOT052 |	You put the plumbing in place let people use it and then you turn off the spicket
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,799	| IOT052 |	Not good not good so we'll stay tuned
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,847	| IOT052 |	We'll come back to this
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:06,687	| IOT052 |	Issue again especially with the user terms because I really would like to know
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,199	| IOT052 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| IOT052 |	My data
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,271	| IOT052 |	Undecim
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| IOT052 |	Better stuff
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,599	| IOT052 |	August doorbell
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,903	| IOT052 |	Camera
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,071	| IOT052 |	And
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:23,839	| IOT052 |	What you think
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:29,471	| IOT052 |	I like it like this doorbell since I saw it way back in December and thought I was going to
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| IOT052 |	Get it back in
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:38,431	| IOT052 |	But it's good some of the reviewer say it's too big for the door frame and it is it's a big Square
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,735	| IOT052 |	I know you got a skinny space so you may not go for it
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,015	| IOT052 |	Yeah I do
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,319	| IOT052 |	But I can tell you it will not fit in
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:47,135	| IOT052 |	I'm sure we'll fit many people store so
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:52,511	| IOT052 |	It'll fit for me and it came with a mounting block because my doorbell is not on the same wall as
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| IOT052 |	The door is ajar
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:54,815	| IOT052 |	Catty corner
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| IOT052 |	It's none of the above
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:02,239	| IOT052 |	In which case is probably a good solution you going to see the side of the person
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,543	| IOT052 |	Facing the door I presume
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| IOT052 |	What they do is they make these little mounts that
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,919	| IOT052 |	Can't it out at like a 45 degree angle
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:12,735	| IOT052 |	Is August is the only one of all the doorbells that actually
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,503	| IOT052 |	It comes with one
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,527	| IOT052 |	Which
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,087	| IOT052 |	It's very easy to install
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,879	| IOT052 |	A lot of people and I'll just say this
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,695	| IOT052 |	Don't be afraid to take your doorbell off
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,023	| IOT052 |	And install one of these doorbells it's about a 15-minute operation
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:28,095	| IOT052 |	And I have a stucco house so
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,887	| IOT052 |	You know I'm talking about drilling into the Mesa
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:37,055	| IOT052 |	You know she may not need new holes you are if you're doing Bricker
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,103	| IOT052 |	Stucco candidate the little anchor bolts
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,431	| IOT052 |	It's so easy you guys
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:46,015	| IOT052 |	And and yes there's some wiring to connect but it's so negligible
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:51,391	| IOT052 |	Give me the wiring essentially I got some beaches for power it's it's actually capturing video and such
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,439	| IOT052 |	Over life I assume
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:57,023	| IOT052 |	Yes yeah so you're not you're not wiring a video feed
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,559	| IOT052 |	Innocence you just wiring another
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,095	| IOT052 |	Essential another doorbell
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:08,031	| IOT052 |	So if people are cuz I know some people are like one install a little bit higher someone for like a hundred bucks in them
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,895	| IOT052 |	And it's not just because I am handicapped
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,015	| IOT052 |	You just take off your doorbell nuc
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,807	| IOT052 |	You have another doorbell
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,087	| IOT052 |	You're going to want to
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,439	| IOT052 |	$199
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,535	| IOT052 |	It has a wonderful HD camera
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:34,911	| IOT052 |	Unlike the others this has more of a square view as opposed to the long way
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,959	| IOT052 |	Landscape View
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,239	| IOT052 |	You can see
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,287	| IOT052 |	So clearly during the day at night
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:46,175	| IOT052 |	Maybe not as good of quality is the skybell at night but I found that it's a little bit more
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| IOT052 |	Reliable
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:52,575	| IOT052 |	On the notification side making sure that when something happens
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,159	| IOT052 |	It let you know and then it's faster to load
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,951	| IOT052 |	Wichita
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:01,023	| IOT052 |	It took about two seconds to resolve
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,583	| IOT052 |	The video feed when I'm in the house
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,375	| IOT052 |	Not bad
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:11,775	| IOT052 |	There's no service or anything that you have to pay for them no monthly Fabian the only reason I ask is because it will actually eat fabric
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,311	| IOT052 |	Call record every single
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| IOT052 |	Interaction and you can reply those
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,431	| IOT052 |	Is the cloud service isn't setup
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,759	| IOT052 |	He's coming back right now
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:24,319	| IOT052 |	It it does not have anything like that
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,599	| IOT052 |	There's no fee associated
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,135	| IOT052 |	Tulelake
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,439	| IOT052 |	See a certain like
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,463	| IOT052 |	Up to a certain time
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:30,975	| IOT052 |	Birthdays
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,511	| IOT052 |	History
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:37,631	| IOT052 |	Catch up yet I bet they will have that okay I see it now coming soon and then August app update
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:40,191	| IOT052 |	Animal Crossing
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,703	| IOT052 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:41,983	| IOT052 |	Well
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,495	| IOT052 |	The service
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:44,799	| IOT052 |	30 days worth
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,639	| IOT052 |	Is that make sense
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:55,807	| IOT052 |	Got you okay I'll have to go look and let you guys know but
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,831	| IOT052 |	I know that
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:59,647	| IOT052 |	The ring doorbell you can actually download videos
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,439	| IOT052 |	From the doorbell and store them yourself
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| IOT052 |	So that is pretty handy
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT052 |	If you have a ring you may already know
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:12,191	| IOT052 |	August doorbell cam
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,751	| IOT052 |	I'm excited I think it's the most beautiful of all the doorbell
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,799	| IOT052 |	Just for my
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,311	| IOT052 |	Pretty person
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,103	| IOT052 |	Yeah no design it's beautiful
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,663	| IOT052 |	So that is that other things
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:24,223	| IOT052 |	That we talked about in the oven
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,271	| IOT052 |	Oh you love the June oven
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:29,087	| IOT052 |	I did I think it's such a fun idea to have like a I-4
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,623	| IOT052 |	Expertise
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,159	| IOT052 |	Internet of things makes you an expert
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,951	| IOT052 |	Without actually having to be
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,231	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,791	| IOT052 |	Kevin you want to say what's going on there
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:44,191	| IOT052 |	So the company has raised an additional 22 and 1/2 million dollars in 5
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| IOT052 |	Financing
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,263	| IOT052 |	And for those who are not familiar with the junit
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:52,639	| IOT052 |	I I like this description on on TechCrunch cuz I know I've said it before deposits like an easy bake oven for grown-ups
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,407	| IOT052 |	Some
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,455	| IOT052 |	It's going to cost you $1,500
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,015	| IOT052 |	So why they raised more money
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:05,183	| IOT052 |	Did Ashley delay this the launch of this is well yeah it was actually in June
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,231	| IOT052 |	Now it's going to come out
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:07,743	| IOT052 |	In the court
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,023	| IOT052 |	Holiday time
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,583	| IOT052 |	That's a big change
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,399	| IOT052 |	So here something's
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:18,751	| IOT052 |	What they're trying to do here is they replace like the typical oven light
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,775	| IOT052 |	Inside the oven
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:24,639	| IOT052 |	So that like incandescent kind of style light that you got with nmds
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,919	| IOT052 |	Put
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:27,967	| IOT052 |	Sensors in the feet of the oven
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,759	| IOT052 |	They've also put a GPU in a
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,271	| IOT052 |	Camera
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:37,695	| IOT052 |	Inside so I did a camera inside the oven so it can look at the food in the gpus to do kind of machine learning
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,999	| IOT052 |	So I can say like
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,535	| IOT052 |	I'm going to totally
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:44,351	| IOT052 |	You know cook it this long so you don't have to
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| IOT052 |	Know how to cook
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,399	| IOT052 |	A pork chop
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:51,007	| IOT052 |	In talking to people in the home appliance business sole kit Electrolux
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,543	| IOT052 |	Whirlpool
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,591	| IOT052 |	Whenever I ask him about that they were like
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:58,943	| IOT052 |	Yeah you know putting LEDs inside of an oven environment is super
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,455	| IOT052 |	Hard
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| IOT052 |	And
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,039	| IOT052 |	Some of the stuff they were trying to do any
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:05,855	| IOT052 |	A camera inside the environment is also super hard
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,927	| IOT052 |	Just to do at production scale
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:13,023	| IOT052 |	So what I'm wondering is if they kind of realized that
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,095	| IOT052 |	What they're attempting maybe a little bit
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,375	| IOT052 |	They swallowed more than they can chew
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:22,239	| IOT052 |	That's possible in an animal so wondering I mean
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:26,335	| IOT052 |	The idea behind us as the oven will actually know what you put in it
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:30,431	| IOT052 |	So it's not like you to say I'm cooking a pork chop
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,199	| IOT052 |	What you just said
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,479	| IOT052 |	And I wonder
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,039	| IOT052 |	Algorithmically are they having challenges there as well
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,343	| IOT052 |	I'm in stitches. Vast array of
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,135	| IOT052 |	Foods
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,719	| IOT052 |	Yeah but that mean with machine learning and deep-learning
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| IOT052 |	That doesn't feel as in
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,303	| IOT052 |	Intimidating to me
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,583	| IOT052 |	The actual
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,375	| IOT052 |	Stuff they're trying
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,727	| IOT052 |	And if you think about putting a semiconductor
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,847	| IOT052 |	Oven work
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| IOT052 |	So I mean
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:01,663	| IOT052 |	I don't know
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,455	| IOT052 |	What they're doing is hard
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,247	| IOT052 |	It's worth
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:10,111	| IOT052 |	In their defense and along the lines of what you're saying the challenges maybe they did say they said in the statement
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:15,231	| IOT052 |	That they decided to work with new manufacturing partners for Plastics and cosmetics sheet metal
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,999	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,583	| IOT052 |	It could be supply chain issues could be proud of challenges
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,375	| IOT052 |	At least partially
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,679	| IOT052 |	The reason why this is being delayed
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,959	| IOT052 |	So there we go
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,287	| IOT052 |	Cuz I really want to try this
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,847	| IOT052 |	I hope you get a review Winnetka
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,383	| IOT052 |	$1,500 for this
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,223	| IOT052 |	Probably here
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,783	| IOT052 |	Let's talk about what we
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,087	| IOT052 |	$1,500
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,135	| IOT052 |	Was it $90
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:46,719	| IOT052 |	89 99 plus tax
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,487	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,767	| IOT052 |	Before the show
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,303	| IOT052 |	Kevin and I both
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,863	| IOT052 |	Received our emails from Amazon
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:58,751	| IOT052 |	If an arriving Thursday on time
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:20:59,775	| IOT052 |	Right
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,359	| IOT052 |	Is the smaller version of the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,919	| IOT052 |	It doesn't have the full speaker in it but should
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,199	| IOT052 |	Presumably have all the other fan
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,015	| IOT052 |	You'll hear more about that
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,527	| IOT052 |	Thursday
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:15,391	| IOT052 |	And we actually talked about the other Prophet came out with about the Amazon tap
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:20,256	| IOT052 |	And you got an email from a listener and it you know it
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:23,072	| IOT052 |	Shame on me for not making the very good point that he made
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:28,192	| IOT052 |	Yes so Joseph episode
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,728	| IOT052 |	First portability
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,264	| IOT052 |	Like all for it
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,056	| IOT052 |	And then second
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,848	| IOT052 |	Never wanted it
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,640	| IOT052 |	Echo to creeping her opinion
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,944	| IOT052 |	Because it's always
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,992	| IOT052 |	Teacher is a great choice for our home
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,552	| IOT052 |	That's a really valid point I'm in
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,112	| IOT052 |	Some people don't like the always listening function
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:49,696	| IOT052 |	That's in the Amazon Echo today and the tap
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:56,096	| IOT052 |	Doesn't have that you press the button when you want to listen and I remember saying that that take some of the magic out of it for me
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:59,936	| IOT052 |	But some people are fine with that they rather give up that magic and
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,008	| IOT052 |	Be safe and secure knowing it's not always listening so
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,544	| IOT052 |	It's a really smart
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,824	| IOT052 |	Smart observation
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,128	| IOT052 |	So yashow he's keeping his wife happy
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,408	| IOT052 |	And he's one of the
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,456	| IOT052 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,760	| IOT052 |	Now we know who those people are
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,808	| IOT052 |	Apparently
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,600	| IOT052 |	It was a no-show so they can't be all bad
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,976	| IOT052 |	Also from
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,744	| IOT052 |	Amazon
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:27,328	| IOT052 |	Is this week actually marks the anniversary of the Amazon Dash
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,608	| IOT052 |	Which
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:31,680	| IOT052 |	We we don't talk about the much but those are the buttons
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,704	| IOT052 |	Physical button
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,752	| IOT052 |	Fix the things
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,264	| IOT052 |	Like
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,848	| IOT052 |	Your washing machine washing machine
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,384	| IOT052 |	And you just press it
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,664	| IOT052 |	Order
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:46,784	| IOT052 |	A new product there specific for one product so a tide Dash
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,320	| IOT052 |	Only order you knew
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,088	| IOT052 |	Tides
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,112	| IOT052 |	From Amazon
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT052 |	So to me it feels like
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,720	| IOT052 |	Like a lesser cousin of the dash
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,768	| IOT052 |	Assume that service which I think is suica Google
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,328	| IOT052 |	It has like censored
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:00,608	| IOT052 |	In orders at 1
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,888	| IOT052 |	Texture Olmos
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,168	| IOT052 |	Stout that's awesome
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,704	| IOT052 |	That I like that I like
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:07,520	| IOT052 |	Like this this is nothing more to me than just moving the one
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:11,104	| IOT052 |	Click buy button off your phone or tablet and put it on your physical device
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:15,200	| IOT052 |	People like it because Amazon is announcing over a hundred new button
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,248	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,552	| IOT052 |	Imagine how cluttered your home could be
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:26,208	| IOT052 |	I'll check the new buns maybe I mean if there's some product
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,488	| IOT052 |	Maybe
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,256	| IOT052 |	But
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| IOT052 |	I don't know
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:29,792	| IOT052 |	We'll see
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:32,352	| IOT052 |	And usually the way Amazon has done it and
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:32,864	| IOT052 |	Previous year
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,144	| IOT052 |	Has been
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,168	| IOT052 |	By the button
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,984	| IOT052 |	For like for 99 and then you get a credit off of your
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,776	| IOT052 |	First order us whatever it is
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,104	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,872	| IOT052 |	They cost money but
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,408	| IOT052 |	Do you get it back
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,968	| IOT052 |	Do you want to talk about
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,272	| IOT052 |	Well yeah I mean that's something I would reward
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:55,392	| IOT052 |	It's something I wish I had a button for redelivery
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,440	| IOT052 |	Yeah you you actually
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,256	| IOT052 |	Tune me into this something smart
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| IOT052 |	Wine bottle
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,560	| IOT052 |	It's called a Cuvee
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:06,656	| IOT052 |	And I've never heard of this before but it is a wifi-connected bottle
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:11,776	| IOT052 |	The bottle is not cheap I think it's $180 if you pre-order
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,080	| IOT052 |	Hundred dollars
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,128	| IOT052 |	And you can use it to actually
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,664	| IOT052 |	Order
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:21,760	| IOT052 |	Refills of wine that will retail between 15 and $50
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:26,368	| IOT052 |	So it's it's wifi-connected I didn't see how you do the reorder thing
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,648	| IOT052 |	Doesn't sense it
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:30,464	| IOT052 |	Do you have sensors in the bottle
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:34,304	| IOT052 |	And I know you're supposed to go to the website and pick out the bottles that you
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,888	| IOT052 |	So they're going to do a recommendation
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:40,192	| IOT052 |	Service kind of Amazon
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:43,008	| IOT052 |	Well Amazon Netflix those kind of companies
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,776	| IOT052 |	So it'll
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,824	| IOT052 |	Take your taste into account
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:46,848	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,408	| IOT052 |	If you find a way to order
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,688	| IOT052 |	You can actually order it directly
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:54,528	| IOT052 |	The bottle 100% sure how that would work
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,832	| IOT052 |	Matching you have to decide like
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,368	| IOT052 |	Like I really like this one particular
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,392	| IOT052 |	1
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,208	| IOT052 |	Fresco
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,720	| IOT052 |	Right
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,536	| IOT052 |	I think
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:08,096	| IOT052 |	It's an interesting delivery model is like the razor
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,144	| IOT052 |	The razor blade model for
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,168	| IOT052 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:15,264	| IOT052 |	In this case the razor is like
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,592	| IOT052 |	Too expensive
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:26,272	| IOT052 |	It's interesting how we're seeing a shift towards the ordering process in the purchase of things with with iot
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:28,576	| IOT052 |	Not buying it what she thinks of buying everyday things
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,344	| IOT052 |	Biote
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:35,744	| IOT052 |	And we just talked about the dash buttons this is kind of similar to literally order the wine right from the wine bottle the reusable
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:38,560	| IOT052 |	Wine bottle which actually keep your wine fresh for up to a month as well so
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:45,728	| IOT052 |	I think we're seeing is I mean this is a totally legitimate business model but I think was going to end up happening is we'll see
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,520	| IOT052 |	Subsidizing
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,544	| IOT052 |	In device
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,104	| IOT052 |	After a certain point so what we're going to do
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,128	| IOT052 |	Get is
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,152	| IOT052 |	Companies that
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:57,504	| IOT052 |	Maybe cheaper version
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:00,064	| IOT052 |	It's got sensors it's got the
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,576	| IOT052 |	Pre-ordering
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,112	| IOT052 |	And it's also
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,648	| IOT052 |	Has to be like vacuum sealable
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,184	| IOT052 |	Gear whine
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,464	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:09,024	| IOT052 |	That could be incredibly expensive and not
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:09,536	| IOT052 |	We're subsidizing
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,352	| IOT052 |	I really think
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| IOT052 |	Example
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,912	| IOT052 |	Coffee maker
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,984	| IOT052 |	Like a Keurig or something
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,008	| IOT052 |	Is connected
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:23,104	| IOT052 |	Mr. coffee connected
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:25,152	| IOT052 |	Peacemaker and then they do deals with
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,176	| IOT052 |	Ghetto folders in
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:36,672	| IOT052 |	I agree and it and it takes away a lot of activity from
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,976	| IOT052 |	What smartphones and tablets and computers and
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,768	| IOT052 |	Put it where you
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,328	| IOT052 |	Never you want and use those products
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,352	| IOT052 |	You know
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:47,680	| IOT052 |	And the challenge will just be getting the hardware cheap enough
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:50,496	| IOT052 |	And getting people comfortable enough
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,824	| IOT052 |	With the business model that the manufacturers of these products will be
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,592	| IOT052 |	Comfortable subsidizing
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:59,456	| IOT052 |	I'll be curious to see how that works cuz even like right now with the Amazon Dash
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:02,016	| IOT052 |	I haven't ordered any because when I look at Amazon I'm like
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,832	| IOT052 |	And their pricing for toilet paper is way too expensive
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,928	| IOT052 |	Like
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,464	| IOT052 |	Take away my ability
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,488	| IOT052 |	To choose
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,512	| IOT052 |	For me
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,536	| IOT052 |	Prices kind
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,560	| IOT052 |	Trump's convenience there
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:19,424	| IOT052 |	Confirm much of America that's probably still
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:19,936	| IOT052 |	McKay's
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:20,960	| IOT052 |	I could be wrong
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:23,776	| IOT052 |	I would say so but I think over time
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,592	| IOT052 |	Millennials growing up in Saint convenience lb
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:29,408	| IOT052 |	More about purchasing decision
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,712	| IOT052 |	Yeah and you know
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:37,344	| IOT052 |	Procter & Gamble is doing the experiment connected Febreze
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,624	| IOT052 |	Plugins
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:41,184	| IOT052 |	And they're actually
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:45,536	| IOT052 |	Experimenting with this model intent of selling Febreze has
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,352	| IOT052 |	I don't think they're selling it directly to the app yet but that is their plan
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,288	| IOT052 |	Pay anything to sell more products
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,336	| IOT052 |	More stuff
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,872	| IOT052 |	So while you're drinking your wine

EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:54,048	| IOT052 |	I'm so we looked at a handful of different segments
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,328	| IOT052 |	Of the
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,608	| IOT052 |	Smart home environment
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:59,168	| IOT052 |	Those three being home utilities
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:02,496	| IOT052 |	Things like power on electric gas
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,776	| IOT052 |	Metering systems
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:06,336	| IOT052 |	Things where you could potentially save money
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| IOT052 |	Is by using Spark
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,128	| IOT052 |	Home devices
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:11,968	| IOT052 |	We also looked at a home appliances things like fridges
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:12,992	| IOT052 |	Laundry machine
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,832	| IOT052 |	Your internet-connected toaster or sous-vide maker
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:20,416	| IOT052 |	And then Internet connected or Internet of Things
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,464	| IOT052 |	Security and safety devices
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,000	| IOT052 |	Baby monitors

EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:53,184	| IOT052 |	Is now done with the FDA on
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:56,256	| IOT052 |	Medical devices connected medical devices
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:59,584	| IOT052 |	And this report is the precursor to one on the smartphone
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,168	| IOT052 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:03,936	| IOT052 |	Distinct
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT052 |	But not unrelated
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,728	| IOT052 |	It's so
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:09,824	| IOT052 |	I am the Cavalry free stock round is like
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:12,384	| IOT052 |	Set a group of security researchers
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:15,968	| IOT052 |	Animal eyes that are dependents on connected technology
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,272	| IOT052 |	Is going faster than are billions
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,040	| IOT052 |	Sure that technology
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,368	| IOT052 |	I so particularly where that comes to
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,416	| IOT052 |	Human life and Public Safety
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,184	| IOT052 |	Type devices
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:27,488	| IOT052 |	Such as automobiles
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,536	| IOT052 |	Medical devices Smart Homes
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:32,096	| IOT052 |	Public infrastructure
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:32,864	| IOT052 |	Planes
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:33,888	| IOT052 |	Trains
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:34,912	| IOT052 |	Public Utilities
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:37,728	| IOT052 |	And now this report fits into that fairly well
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,544	| IOT052 |	Although it's not directly a
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,568	| IOT052 |	I am the cavalry
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,360	| IOT052 |	Framework document
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,152	| IOT052 |	It certainly has a lot of this
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,432	| IOT052 |	Hallmark San Marcos
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,736	| IOT052 |	I particularly need some of the recommendations
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:51,040	| IOT052 |	I see a lot of familiar faces in there
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:54,112	| IOT052 |	Edit can be used it as we
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:57,184	| IOT052 |	In the future work on a iot framework
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,976	| IOT052 |	For cyber safety
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:01,536	| IOT052 |	Let's go into that because your recommendations
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:06,656	| IOT052 |	Your first recommendation which is security by Design is something people talked about for never
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,960	| IOT052 |	And it's also like
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:15,360	| IOT052 |	I feel like it's the bare minimum but it's also like basically the standard that a lot of the connected device makers are actually kind of trying to
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:17,408	| IOT052 |	To get to today as opposed to like
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,200	| IOT052 |	4 years ago when they started building these things
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:21,248	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:26,624	| IOT052 |	That talks about I mean the basic assumption and I will include in the show notes a link to this document every
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,928	| IOT052 |	The basic assumption is that you
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:32,512	| IOT052 |	Assume that there going to be people trying to attack your device
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,280	| IOT052 |	So you heard me
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:35,840	| IOT052 |	You continually test it
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:41,472	| IOT052 |	He's crazy tremendous like lines of code so you can avoid
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:44,800	| IOT052 |	You making overly complicated devices with lots of Entry
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,568	| IOT052 |	It's basically
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:51,968	| IOT052 |	From there you go on and you talk about third-party collaboration which I read is bug bounties or at least not suing people who brings
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,760	| IOT052 |	Security issues to you right
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,040	| IOT052 |	You guys are appropriate funny
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,856	| IOT052 |	Well work with Pro don't see people who are trying to help you
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,672	| IOT052 |	I think is a better way to think of it
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,768	| IOT052 |	And then you've got seven more and we'll probably talk about most of them
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:09,888	| IOT052 |	But how are some of these different for the smart home then for automotive and medical devices
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:13,216	| IOT052 |	One of the major ways in which
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,776	| IOT052 |	Smart Homes environment is different than
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,800	| IOT052 |	Vices and Automobiles
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,360	| IOT052 |	Is that their candy
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,640	| IOT052 |	Allure consequence
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,920	| IOT052 |	Also
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,712	| IOT052 |	You look at some of the economic
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:26,528	| IOT052 |	I'm smart homes versus medical devices
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,040	| IOT052 |	Albertsons
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,320	| IOT052 |	Auto deals
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:32,416	| IOT052 |	You've got a lot of really small Kickstarter size projects
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:35,488	| IOT052 |	That are maybe 10:50 hundred dollars
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,280	| IOT052 |	Smart home space
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,328	| IOT052 |	There's not a lot of room
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,864	| IOT052 |	To add on different
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,656	| IOT052 |	Siri features are security measures
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:46,752	| IOT052 |	I told you a lot of other things so particularly with the two that you identify
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,288	| IOT052 |	Security by Design
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,848	| IOT052 |	Third-party collaboration
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,384	| IOT052 |	Those are things that
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,200	| IOT052 |	Reduce the need for external dependencies
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:57,760	| IOT052 |	To ensure security of the device itself
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,064	| IOT052 |	At the same time that there are
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:03,648	| IOT052 |	Septic tank on the kickstarter side projects for Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:06,208	| IOT052 |	They're also Kickstarter size projects
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,256	| IOT052 |	Security platform
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,304	| IOT052 |	That would be Edition
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,072	| IOT052 |	2
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:13,376	| IOT052 |	Internet of Things Smart Homes devices
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,424	| IOT052 |	Not where you started
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:17,728	| IOT052 |	You kind of the model as we have in corporate it
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,800	| IOT052 |	Let's buy a system
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,824	| IOT052 |	And then
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:24,384	| IOT052 |	Layer security defenses around it
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:26,176	| IOT052 |	In and out of this cost model
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:28,992	| IOT052 |	None of those things that really doesn't look for a number of reasons
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:32,064	| IOT052 |	Main ones doing that the others know how am I
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,880	| IOT052 |	Also if
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:36,928	| IOT052 |	Consumers are going to have to buy additional things
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,488	| IOT052 |	You're probably not going to buy the additional
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,328	| IOT052 |	So you'll just have insecure devices that
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:43,840	| IOT052 |	Ashley click
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| IOT052 |	I am third
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:49,984	| IOT052 |	Consumers believe that these devices are not inherently secure
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,288	| IOT052 |	Dental inducer prices
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| IOT052 |	Confidence
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:53,824	| IOT052 |	The Titans
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,152	| IOT052 |	Or people are very very hesitant to accept
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:59,968	| IOT052 |	And other things connected devices in their homes
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:02,784	| IOT052 |	Okay let's go back to your number two point
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,808	| IOT052 |	Because it's worth teasing a
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:09,440	| IOT052 |	But I think you're about as the pain of the system's nature of the Internet of Things in the Smart Home
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:15,328	| IOT052 |	Which is I might buy a hub from one vendor and then connected to other products is that kind of what you were talking about
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,352	| IOT052 |	Yeah you buy
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:19,680	| IOT052 |	Some type of a hug from one day vendor connect to the other products
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,216	| IOT052 |	You might also have
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:24,800	| IOT052 |	Something more like a mesh Network or different things connected
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:27,104	| IOT052 |	Lost my talk
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,176	| IOT052 |	Q but it might not talk to Alexa for instance
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:35,296	| IOT052 |	Got it so that's just not as effective but unfortunately that's how we're setting up a lot of Arkansas
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,320	| IOT052 |	Times right now
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,600	| IOT052 |	That's right
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,648	| IOT052 |	It's less effective the tire cost
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,416	| IOT052 |	Tire maintenance
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,952	| IOT052 |	That's it requires a
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,976	| IOT052 |	High degree of expert
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,512	| IOT052 |	What to use on the purchaser
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,584	| IOT052 |	And ultimately I think you're seeing some of the effects of bad and
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,376	| IOT052 |	Alexander reluctance to buy some
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:52,192	| IOT052 |	Set the devices are to use expected futures
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:56,544	| IOT052 |	Because people don't quite understand it and they don't feel like they are masters of that demand
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:59,616	| IOT052 |	Nor should they have to be in order to use a
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,152	| IOT052 |	In order refrigerator
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:02,432	| IOT052 |	Baidu security for a living
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT052 |	And yet
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,736	| IOT052 |	I would be hard-pressed
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,784	| IOT052 |	To adequately secure my fridge
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:10,368	| IOT052 |	Norwood I really want to spend the time securing it
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:17,280	| IOT052 |	And I'm with you I've got 40 semi connected devices in my house and I am like 100% sure that if someone wanted to
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:21,120	| IOT052 |	They can totally take them over I'm living totally in this Blissful security by obscurity
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,400	| IOT052 |	I probably shouldn't admit
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:23,936	| IOT052 |	But
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:31,360	| IOT052 |	That makes sense and we'll get to kind of demand for these but I did want to continue going through some of your recommendations first kiss
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,896	| IOT052 |	You got some really good ones
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:40,320	| IOT052 |	So the to that kind of really strong like struck a chord with me with the date of protective measures in the informed consent
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,880	| IOT052 |	For data usage because most people can see that
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,928	| IOT052 |	The Internet of Things is about
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,440	| IOT052 |	Getting data
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:46,976	| IOT052 |	And then
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:50,048	| IOT052 |	Glean insights from that data whether it's
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:52,608	| IOT052 |	For the company itself weathers for the user
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:56,704	| IOT052 |	We currently have an issue where a lot of people
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:37:02,592	| IOT052 |	Aren't just worried about their security other devices they're worried about the privacy of their data and these kind of points
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,408	| IOT052 |	Bring that up so I'm curiously
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,688	| IOT052 |	Why these are in here
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:07,712	| IOT052 |	How do you really
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,528	| IOT052 |	Sorry I mean
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,064	| IOT052 |	Like you said it's
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,600	| IOT052 |	Data privacy
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:18,720	| IOT052 |	Is one of the biggest issues with a Chinese consumer devices from the consumer
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,744	| IOT052 |	Perspective
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,536	| IOT052 |	ISO
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:24,096	| IOT052 |	A commitment to preserving
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,632	| IOT052 |	The agreed-upon trust
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:29,216	| IOT052 |	That consumers have with the companies that they buy these things from
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:34,080	| IOT052 |	I think it's really important it's a signaling mechanism to the company or to Consumers
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,872	| IOT052 |	That we value
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:38,176	| IOT052 |	Your privacy as much as you do
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,968	| IOT052 |	For whatever varying level
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:41,760	| IOT052 |	I'd agree that you don't value it
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:45,088	| IOT052 |	And what's one of the things that we call I get to hear is
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,136	| IOT052 |	It's not necessarily a binary
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:48,672	| IOT052 |	Privacy or no privacy
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:52,000	| IOT052 |	That is not necessarily A trade-off that everyone will agree on
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,048	| IOT052 |	I'm certainly
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,352	| IOT052 |	Facebook doesn't have the same views as
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,144	| IOT052 |	Odyssey
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,424	| IOT052 |	Diverse Power
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,960	| IOT052 |	They just never will agree
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,240	| IOT052 |	But
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,776	| IOT052 |	If you can set up the
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,312	| IOT052 |	Some situation in which
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,616	| IOT052 |	The company in the individual
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:10,176	| IOT052 |	Can together jointly negotiate
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:11,456	| IOT052 |	That data privacy
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:14,784	| IOT052 |	I think that's a really good point to be able to get to
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,320	| IOT052 |	And if we can
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:19,136	| IOT052 |	Cuz decouple some of the business model
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:21,952	| IOT052 |	Consumer value
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,744	| IOT052 |	Then we can start
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,768	| IOT052 |	See you there
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,792	| IOT052 |	Will having a
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,328	| IOT052 |	Your privacy conversation
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,864	| IOT052 |	Call Nat individual
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:29,888	| IOT052 |	Level
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,168	| IOT052 |	Kimberly payoff
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:35,776	| IOT052 |	If you have the ability when you're going into user device
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,824	| IOT052 |	To say I just
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:40,640	| IOT052 |	I want to be able to have this level of day to you sir
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:43,968	| IOT052 |	Or I want to be able to agree any time
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:46,272	| IOT052 |	You want to hand over
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:47,808	| IOT052 |	This data to third party
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:50,368	| IOT052 |	Or I want to have some kind of a saying that
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:54,464	| IOT052 |	That's a level of granularity that we don't necessarily have today
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,256	| IOT052 |	But it might be worth having a discussion around
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:00,864	| IOT052 |	M4 manufacturers to have a way to reassure consumer confidence
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,656	| IOT052 |	Not without
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:05,216	| IOT052 |	Especially imposing a one-size-fits-all
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,240	| IOT052 |	Our judgments
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,776	| IOT052 |	Must suffice for everyone
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,056	| IOT052 |	Tesla Model
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:13,920	| IOT052 |	How scalable is something like that for me implementation standpoint
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:19,296	| IOT052 |	And most manufacturers feel like if they do an opt-in kind of model the lose
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:24,160	| IOT052 |	Like 80 to 90% of people who would otherwise be part of their kind of
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,440	| IOT052 |	Data samples
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,000	| IOT052 |	Is that in your experience
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:33,120	| IOT052 |	True and is it possible to actually implement this without destroying kind of some of the business models
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,680	| IOT052 |	You know I have a feeling
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,448	| IOT052 |	Until we try it
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,240	| IOT052 |	We won't really have great data
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:43,872	| IOT052 |	Until we have some this granularity and transparency we won't be able to figure out whether at the mall with it works well
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,152	| IOT052 |	Scalefast
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,968	| IOT052 |	I think that it's a design choice
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,784	| IOT052 |	That kind of gets built into your business model
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,320	| IOT052 |	In some ways
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,856	| IOT052 |	Hyannis
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| IOT052 |	It's one that might be
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:58,464	| IOT052 |	Stereo risky to summon facturas but
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,792	| IOT052 |	You can look at it
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,304	| IOT052 |	Delaware
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:05,120	| IOT052 |	You are the only one in the marketplace offering
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:06,400	| IOT052 |	That type of granularity
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,448	| IOT052 |	You might draw on a bigger group
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,496	| IOT052 |	Do I have the feeling this
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:13,568	| IOT052 |	Once one or two offer it several others
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,336	| IOT052 |	In the marketplace
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:16,128	| IOT052 |	Will start to come about an offer
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,408	| IOT052 |	And you can
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:20,736	| IOT052 |	These are the effects of those different files into different experimentation
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,808	| IOT052 |	Dozens and hundreds
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:24,320	| IOT052 |	Thousand
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:29,952	| IOT052 |	Maybe this can be a competitive differentiator for some of those devices and some of his companies
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,232	| IOT052 |	So that
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,280	| IOT052 |	Somebody by pick their device
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:37,120	| IOT052 |	I think that's like I said there's just not enough
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| IOT052 |	Yet
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:40,704	| IOT052 |	About some of those choices that people would make
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,472	| IOT052 |	If they had them
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,264	| IOT052 |	Which I don't think there are any device
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:49,664	| IOT052 |	There are a couple devices that allow you not to put your information on the cloud
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:52,224	| IOT052 |	But you're right there very few
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:55,296	| IOT052 |	I think I've mentioned them I know I've mentioned them before but
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:58,368	| IOT052 |	The welcome cam 400 is a
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:00,160	| IOT052 |	Video camera that allows you to
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,184	| IOT052 |	To keep all of your data
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:05,024	| IOT052 |	Inside an SD card in the device or
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,304	| IOT052 |	On your own server at home
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,608	| IOT052 |	Then there's also an up-and-coming project
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:11,680	| IOT052 |	From silk Labs called the sense
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,960	| IOT052 |	Video camera that does this
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,728	| IOT052 |	Same thing
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,008	| IOT052 |	So what we'll see
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,544	| IOT052 |	What about this
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,568	| IOT052 |	Because you got
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:19,616	| IOT052 |	A couple recommendations about
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:22,176	| IOT052 |	We'll call it what happens when the device isn't connected
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:29,856	| IOT052 |	Maybe you go out of business which I think is a really good one to talk about especially because in the beginning of the
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,904	| IOT052 |	What you bring up the fact that consumers
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,928	| IOT052 |	Aren't exactly
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,744	| IOT052 |	Adopting the stuff in droves like
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,512	| IOT052 |	We thought
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:41,376	| IOT052 |	Right yeah that's a great question one of the things that we that we found, really on our research shows that
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,680	| IOT052 |	Is there another thing sucks company they go
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,216	| IOT052 |	Bankrupt all the time
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:47,520	| IOT052 |	Alarm or just stop making the device
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,288	| IOT052 |	Or
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:50,336	| IOT052 |	Maybe they forget to renew the domain name
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:55,199	| IOT052 |	And you can have all these instances where those loss of digital assets
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,271	| IOT052 |	Really make the device on functional or
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:00,319	| IOT052 |	If I'm thinking like a criminal
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,599	| IOT052 |	I noticed that
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:04,927	| IOT052 |	Possibly forget to renew their domain name or they go out of business
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,975	| IOT052 |	Michael and snatch that domain name
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:09,791	| IOT052 |	And then just push out an update that will do something
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:11,583	| IOT052 |	The customer has not agreed
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,631	| IOT052 |	So
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:16,703	| IOT052 |	Having some kind of a capability to operate
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,983	| IOT052 |	When the company is
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,751	| IOT052 |	Got underland
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,543	| IOT052 |	Domain is not reachable
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:23,871	| IOT052 |	When you send out an update that
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:24,639	| IOT052 |	Somebody might die
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,199	| IOT052 |	Necessarily want to apply
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT052 |	Thinking about those types of things
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:32,575	| IOT052 |	It's really important and it's an important again at commitment to your customer
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:34,623	| IOT052 |	On how you will treat them
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:36,159	| IOT052 |	I think one of those
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,951	| IOT052 |	Interesting Dimensions that use
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,231	| IOT052 |	Got at the Forum past shows
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,511	| IOT052 |	Is
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,279	| IOT052 |	Changing
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,071	| IOT052 |	An arbitration clause
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:46,399	| IOT052 |	And bundling that along with some type of an update
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:46,911	| IOT052 |	System
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,983	| IOT052 |	Especially the case when you have something like a
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:53,055	| IOT052 |	A change in a binding arbitration clause or
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,847	| IOT052 |	Functionality update
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,127	| IOT052 |	That
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:59,455	| IOT052 |	Might be bundled with something much more essential much more important
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:02,015	| IOT052 |	Where you want a high degree of adoption update
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:04,063	| IOT052 |	And you want to separate out those two
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,367	| IOT052 |	Different pieces of the two different
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,415	| IOT052 |	Goals are choices
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,183	| IOT052 |	For the consumer
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:12,767	| IOT052 |	If they don't agree to a new arbitration
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,535	| IOT052 |	Claws
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:14,815	| IOT052 |	They can still agree to
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:18,911	| IOT052 |	The change in terms of service for the future set that they updated
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:22,751	| IOT052 |	Don't lie I totally agree and so
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,799	| IOT052 |	I have a couple quick questions for you
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:27,615	| IOT052 |	One being as someone who's got a deal with
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:28,383	| IOT052 |	Updates
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:32,223	| IOT052 |	I find it one of the most agonizing thing is firmware updates
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:34,271	| IOT052 |	Like around the connected devices so like
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,575	| IOT052 |	I go to like open the app
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,111	| IOT052 |	Control my lights
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,135	| IOT052 |	Cassette like dinner pretty lady
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,671	| IOT052 |	Firmware update required
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:47,327	| IOT052 |	Do you have any advice for people about when they should
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,119	| IOT052 |	Try to update something that
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:53,471	| IOT052 |	I don't say it's always on cuz it's not but it's not the sort of thing for your leg
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,775	| IOT052 |	Oh I really want to do this right now
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:58,847	| IOT052 |	In Isaac in a perfect world
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:43:59,615	| IOT052 |	Updates
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,127	| IOT052 |	ABCmouse
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:05,503	| IOT052 |	Are there wouldn't have to be some decision-making process on the part of the the customer
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:09,087	| IOT052 |	It would just happen and nothing would change except for beneficial
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:11,135	| IOT052 |	You get extra features to play with with
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,671	| IOT052 |	You could then read it out later
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,255	| IOT052 |	Just right now they're enough
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:17,535	| IOT052 |	Problems of Racine
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,303	| IOT052 |	Some of these
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,327	| IOT052 |	App updates
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,863	| IOT052 |	Firmware updates
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:23,167	| IOT052 |	That it really should be
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:23,935	| IOT052 |	Something that
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:27,519	| IOT052 |	The customer decides whether or not they want
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:28,799	| IOT052 |	I think imagine
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,847	| IOT052 |	Coming back from a long trip
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:33,407	| IOT052 |	You come in and none of your lights work
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,175	| IOT052 |	Because
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:40,831	| IOT052 |	Okay and final question for you before I let you go
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:44,159	| IOT052 |	Do you have connected devices in your house
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:45,695	| IOT052 |	I do not
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:47,487	| IOT052 |	I've spent the last
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,791	| IOT052 |	4 years without a permanent home
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,327	| IOT052 |	Moving about everyone
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:53,375	| IOT052 |	Six months in different parts of the world sale
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,911	| IOT052 |	I unfortunately
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:57,471	| IOT052 |	Don't have much of a home to connect
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:44:59,519	| IOT052 |	Okay that was the saddest answer ever
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:04,127	| IOT052 |	Have any connected devices
