EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,136	| IOT073 |	To talk about today
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,440	| IOT073 |	Waterbury
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:38,304	| IOT073 |	Cornucopia cornucopia
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,376	| IOT073 |	Show me all the stuff
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:42,400	| IOT073 |	What should we
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,216	| IOT073 |	We
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,616	| IOT073 |	You haven't talked about the Amazon Echo in a bit and I think we should because there's rumors of a new music service
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,152	| IOT073 |	And this is odd to me
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:56,224	| IOT073 |	Specific to the echo devices
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,272	| IOT073 |	Yeah I thought this was
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| IOT073 |	Crazy whack
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:02,880	| IOT073 |	Especially because just a few weeks ago the echo was like you know what
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:07,232	| IOT073 |	Do you want to switch from the default being the Amazon
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,000	| IOT073 |	Prime music
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,536	| IOT073 |	How do you say it
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,840	| IOT073 |	Yeah you can switch to I think it was to
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,888	| IOT073 |	Noah's Pandora or Spotify
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,984	| IOT073 |	Azure default switch I probably did because we use Spotify
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,032	| IOT073 |	And that has changed our life
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:20,544	| IOT073 |	Better
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| IOT073 |	Well that's important
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,128	| IOT073 |	Not.
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,432	| IOT073 |	Huge significant ways
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:29,248	| IOT073 |	My life is changed forever
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,040	| IOT073 |	Better
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,832	| IOT073 |	Decide by.
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,904	| IOT073 |	Yeah I kind of like
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,744	| IOT073 |	Is Amazon thinking here is it that
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:44,352	| IOT073 |	Necessary could you just make prom better I'm spending $100 a month on
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:51,776	| IOT073 |	Yeah it's it is kind of strange man Amazon is known for trying different things and different models or
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,848	| IOT073 |	Different takes on existing models of services so
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:59,456	| IOT073 |	So the newspaper folks who might not have heard the word from my country code
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:05,600	| IOT073 |	Sex yeah they they got information says Amazon facility cheaper music subscription service
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:11,232	| IOT073 |	Which is fine never disclosed a cheaper music that's great but it's only going to work on the
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:13,280	| IOT073 |	Echo devices and
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:19,680	| IOT073 |	That's kind of weird because you've already got as you said Amazon Prime music which is what I do use with my echo pretty much all day
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,448	| IOT073 |	Long when I'm at home
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,776	| IOT073 |	And I have the the echo Dot and the dash
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,080	| IOT073 |	Different places for different use cases
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:30,944	| IOT073 |	And I'm happy with that I'm a Prime member obviously so pay my 99 bucks and
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,480	| IOT073 |	Taking full advantage of it
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:37,088	| IOT073 |	But the deal here is it Amazon made do they second service that is going to
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:40,160	| IOT073 |	Cost either for $5 per month
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,464	| IOT073 |	And again it would be limited to
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:43,744	| IOT073 |	B
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,792	| IOT073 |	Amazon Echo devices
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:48,608	| IOT073 |	And I'm not sure I get that why would you
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,400	| IOT073 |	I want you close
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:56,800	| IOT073 |	Service not wear at a headache low service is probably better way to say it is opposed to you know using the more open service
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,568	| IOT073 |	Because
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:03,712	| IOT073 |	Prime music you can use on pretty much anything he's on my iOS devices my Android devices and obviously my echo devices so
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,760	| IOT073 |	I don't know everything
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:09,344	| IOT073 |	It just seems odd to me and I don't know that I'm going to pay an extra five bucks
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:13,184	| IOT073 |	If I'm already a Prime member music and am happy Prime music
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,232	| IOT073 |	Which I pretty much am for my purposes
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:16,768	| IOT073 |	Taipei
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,280	| IOT073 |	$10 a month
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:18,815	| IOT073 |	Spotify
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,143	| IOT073 |	Because they change the default now
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,471	| IOT073 |	It's so easy like it was kind of a pain to be like
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,495	| IOT073 |	Play Kanye West
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,287	| IOT073 |	Amazing on
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,335	| IOT073 |	Spotify
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,871	| IOT073 |	But
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,663	| IOT073 |	The other thing that's weird is
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,967	| IOT073 |	Spotify for me
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,527	| IOT073 |	And some of these other services that people can subscribe to
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| IOT073 |	They go after
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,111	| IOT073 |	Sprite and
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,647	| IOT073 |	Delimitation
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:50,303	| IOT073 |	And it's also like the only thing I can think of is you Spotify doesn't have a huge heart
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,095	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:58,239	| IOT073 |	If your Amazon and you want to work a deal with music companies to get more music cuz right now not
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,519	| IOT073 |	It's not a huge
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:05,919	| IOT073 |	Selection of like you are songs or esoteric songs on correct correct
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,431	| IOT073 |	These are like
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:13,087	| IOT073 |	You want to do this you want to make a reasonable here's how we're constructionists and they're going to have to acquiesce to
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:18,975	| IOT073 |	Give people more variety in these are people who may not be technically Savvy or interested in survival
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:26,143	| IOT073 |	And that makes sense except for one thing Prime music I already have the Amazon Prime music
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,655	| IOT073 |	Service
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:31,263	| IOT073 |	Is that the only Subscription Service have for music now I'm drawing a blank
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,639	| IOT073 |	I think so so
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:43,039	| IOT073 |	Instead of coming out with a Prime music that has more than the million or two million tracks that are currently Veil
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:45,343	| IOT073 |	Mobile for free included with Amazon Prime
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,879	| IOT073 |	This is their play to
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,927	| IOT073 |	Have a broad
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| IOT073 |	Basic music
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| IOT073 |	Available for subscription
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| IOT073 |	What time
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| IOT073 |	And it's fine
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,071	| IOT073 |	But why Limited
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,399	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:03,007	| IOT073 |	If their focus is on getting people to buy the echo
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:08,639	| IOT073 |	And use it for an into love it right because when you start streaming music
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,943	| IOT073 |	I feel like all this just has a timer
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:14,271	| IOT073 |	But if you're like hey for five bucks a month you also get all the music
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:19,903	| IOT073 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,767	| IOT073 |	No no that make sense
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,535	| IOT073 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:30,143	| IOT073 |	And as you were saying that I was double-checking myself there is a pair of there is no
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,959	| IOT073 |	Add on Prime music subscription that's just
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,519	| IOT073 |	You have Prime music with Amazon Prime
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,287	| IOT073 |	Or you don't
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:42,431	| IOT073 |	So this is they're taking maybe you're right maybe it is to sell more Echo devices and
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:45,247	| IOT073 |	As they get more of those devices in hand people will
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,831	| IOT073 |	Buy more things and use more Amazon services and really that's
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,111	| IOT073 |	Kind of their play so
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| IOT073 |	Just
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,927	| IOT073 |	People who don't have Amazon Prime
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,463	| IOT073 |	I mean I'm trying to think of
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:58,047	| IOT073 |	They're obviously our people who don't pay $100 for Amazon Prime
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,327	| IOT073 |	And for those people
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| IOT073 |	If you've got an echo
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,935	| IOT073 |	That's the question of how and we don't know
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:08,031	| IOT073 |	How many people have don't have Prime but do have an echo
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:08,799	| IOT073 |	Tumi
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,615	| IOT073 |	It's got to be a small amount of the overall
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,431	| IOT073 |	But this could be them trying to push out into the broader
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,503	| IOT073 |	I mean the echo is turned into
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:23,135	| IOT073 |	Even people who are not tech nerd so my friends who just don't even think about like smart light bulbs
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:32,351	| IOT073 |	I don't talk to those people and we talked to the text you want to be my friend you got to have a Smart Lipo
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,143	| IOT073 |	Belleville East
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,471	| IOT073 |	I don't know maybe I'll go hang out
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,287	| IOT073 |	Echo in Best Buy
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:45,151	| IOT073 |	I would be curious what they think because I'm struggling to see this as a
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| IOT073 |	Big big
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:50,015	| IOT073 |	Play you're just seems really really limited and I'm not sure I understand it yet
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,135	| IOT073 |	Everybody
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,415	| IOT073 |	Building a
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:56,927	| IOT073 |	Schedule for the
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:04,351	| IOT073 |	Between 3 and 4 million is kind of thought process and then imagine the overlap between
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,887	| IOT073 |	Has like certain connected devices
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| IOT073 |	You know it's probably
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:15,359	| IOT073 |	They won't want to leave money on the table if they can pick up a
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,919	| IOT073 |	Relatively small percentage it's still a lot of people
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,247	| IOT073 |	So it would add up so
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| IOT073 |	I was going to say so
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,831	| IOT073 |	I'm super intrigued by
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,415	| IOT073 |	The smart staging kit for selling your house
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,487	| IOT073 |	I want to know because you just sold your house
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:36,095	| IOT073 |	How you feel about this so what this is is Coldwell Banker the real estate firm
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,399	| IOT073 |	Has teamed up with Lucia
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT073 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| IOT073 |	In August locks
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,775	| IOT073 |	To create basically a package to Stage your house
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,567	| IOT073 |	That includes an August lock
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,871	| IOT073 |	Which I'm sure the realtor would love to
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| IOT073 |	Easier to go in and out
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,991	| IOT073 |	Two Lutron connected like light switches
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,783	| IOT073 |	+ + the affiliated
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,599	| IOT073 |	Pecos and whatnot plus a Lutron Bridge
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,367	| IOT073 |	And
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:03,231	| IOT073 |	Nest Thermostat one smoke detector in one drop kit
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,607	| IOT073 |	That's that's what's in here and it's basically the espresso the
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| IOT073 |	Hold if you wanted to get everything if
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,703	| IOT073 |	1135.
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,287	| IOT073 |	Which is what I would probably cost you if you did it on your own
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:20,895	| IOT073 |	There's no like super discount here it's just there and then they also offer
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,967	| IOT073 |	Professional install of all of this for 500
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,479	| IOT073 |	50
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| IOT073 |	Course they do
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:34,719	| IOT073 |	So I asked someone who just sold their home and I left my Nest behind but I took all of my
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,535	| IOT073 |	Hubs Bridges bulbs cameras Etc
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:42,143	| IOT073 |	I understand why Coldwell Banker is doing this
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,703	| IOT073 |	But I think you know they see an opportunity here
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:50,591	| IOT073 |	And I assume they're getting the the hardware at a discount so they're making some money there
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| IOT073 |	But
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,175	| IOT073 |	When I hear home staging I think of
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,199	| IOT073 |	Renting stuff
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:00,319	| IOT073 |	But if your stage your home with furniture and pictures and all that
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,879	| IOT073 |	You don't buy it and it stays in the house
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| IOT073 |	U-Rent It
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,463	| IOT073 |	And it's in there for the showings and then it goes away
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:09,535	| IOT073 |	This stays in the house if I understand correctly
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,631	| IOT073 |	You don't return it
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,143	| IOT073 |	I'm buying it
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,423	| IOT073 |	Right
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,447	| IOT073 |	SO2
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,775	| IOT073 |	If they're calling it staging which I think they're
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,567	| IOT073 |	Playing with the wording here cuz to me
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| IOT073 |	Yeah this is just
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:26,175	| IOT073 |	Let's make your homework charger by turning into a smart home
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,247	| IOT073 |	With these products that you could do this all yourself
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,015	| IOT073 |	Santana
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,063	| IOT073 |	Kind of Mitt Romney idea
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,087	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| IOT073 |	Baidu
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,439	| IOT073 |	Baidu
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,303	| IOT073 |	We have down the street from a somebody built of 1 Point
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:46,143	| IOT073 |	Dream is a home is being sold for 1.3 million dollars
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| IOT073 |	And
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,239	| IOT073 |	I'm looking at the listing for this home
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| IOT073 |	I was
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:57,407	| IOT073 |	Struck by the fact that they are advertising all these smartphone feature so they've got like a MyQ garage door opener
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:01,759	| IOT073 |	That's like a hundred and $2,930 garage door thing right
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,623	| IOT073 |	High-end homes anyway
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:10,463	| IOT073 |	Those are the big selling point so it used to be
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:17,375	| IOT073 |	Advertising the granite countertops there like pushing is 1.3 million dollar home with idea that it's smart and has like a
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,911	| IOT073 |	Connect to garage door and I was kind of like
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:24,031	| IOT073 |	And that's because they're selling the feature to people who don't understand
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,359	| IOT073 |	This Market the iot market because
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,663	| IOT073 |	People who do know like you
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,455	| IOT073 |	Let's honor $30 garage door opener
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,783	| IOT073 |	Install that in French
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:41,183	| IOT073 |	My house did not list for a million and change but it had you know the nest and I could have
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,487	| IOT073 |	Don't let some other things in there and
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:47,839	| IOT073 |	Anybody can do this you can have a $100,000 house and have these things so
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,399	| IOT073 |	It's people who don't yet understand
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:56,799	| IOT073 |	The cost of these products they just see over the garage door can tell me when its open and then the camera
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,103	| IOT073 |	Tell me what time is the front door this is amazing
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,919	| IOT073 |	Well it is but it's also not
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| IOT073 |	Matt expensive
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,271	| IOT073 |	So Coldwell Banker put out a survey
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,831	| IOT073 |	In response to this in the interview at 12
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,135	| IOT073 |	Again
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:16,255	| IOT073 |	Coldwell Banker sells real estate so it's important for you guys all to know their biases here
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,583	| IOT073 |	They asked some people about
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,375	| IOT073 |	How they Define move-in ready
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,655	| IOT073 |	And
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:28,031	| IOT073 |	44% said that the mood and ready home has Smart Home Technology already installed
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:33,151	| IOT073 |	45% said a move-in-ready homes new construction my husband the totally
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,455	| IOT073 |	These people must be in the south
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:38,015	| IOT073 |	But they also said
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,063	| IOT073 |	If two homes are exactly alike
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,367	| IOT073 |	Most Americans would choose the Smart Home
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:46,207	| IOT073 |	But they don't want to install the gear themselves
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:53,119	| IOT073 |	36% of us respondents believe that having smart technology is a major selling point when buying a home
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,959	| IOT073 |	But 32% said they would be scared to install by themselves
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:04,127	| IOT073 |	And I think the the demand numbers for that is only going to go up as you know younger people would be
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,151	| IOT073 |	Brought up in
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,687	| IOT073 |	Smartphone age
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:10,527	| IOT073 |	You know I'm leaving this house doesn't have a Nestor
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,319	| IOT073 |	And August lock or whatever you know
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:15,647	| IOT073 |	I think it's going to continue but I also hope
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| IOT073 |	That
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:20,767	| IOT073 |	The public starts to better understand what the actual cost of these things are and the fact that
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,815	| IOT073 |	Many of them are not that difficult to install
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:28,191	| IOT073 |	Because they took pay a premium for house or example because it has these things
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,727	| IOT073 |	Doesn't make sense to me
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| IOT073 |	Can I get myself on the cheap
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,567	| IOT073 |	You are
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,943	| IOT073 |	That's the kind way of Truth
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,479	| IOT073 |	Weather that we won't say
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,295	| IOT073 |	I understand understand
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,623	| IOT073 |	There's a second listen there's a sign of the population that
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:51,231	| IOT073 |	Doesn't want install doesn't want to know how these things work they just wanted their and they went to work
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,023	| IOT073 |	And they're willing to pay for it I get that I really do
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,607	| IOT073 |	Me too but I would hear seriously Stacy Higginbotham plug
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:04,543	| IOT073 |	You can install a Smart Lock even the August in like 15 minutes my daughter who was nine at the time helped me
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,055	| IOT073 |	Install it
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,151	| IOT073 |	You can swap out your switches that's a little scary because there is electricity
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,479	| IOT073 |	Especially in a home like a neutral wire so relatively new home
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,783	| IOT073 |	You can install the stuff
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,087	| IOT073 |	So easily and I encourage you
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,647	| IOT073 |	2 tribus super empowering
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,951	| IOT073 |	Now if you got two screaming kids you
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,999	| IOT073 |	Working all the time and you're like exhausted then
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,559	| IOT073 |	That may not be for you but
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,119	| IOT073 |	Try it it's awesome to be like these
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:35,775	| IOT073 |	I do again what Coldwell Banker is going for I still question the whole word staging but
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,823	| IOT073 |	You know what that's a marketing thing that up
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,591	| IOT073 |	Technical singing
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,895	| IOT073 |	That's their business so
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,687	| IOT073 |	I'm sure some people take advantage of it
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:46,015	| IOT073 |	The New York Times a couple weeks ago had a whole article on
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,807	| IOT073 |	Is staging really worth
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,599	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,927	| IOT073 |	We did not say to her mother
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:56,255	| IOT073 |	Okay and position is so it's like you know
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,047	| IOT073 |	Hey if you plan on moving
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:02,143	| IOT073 |	Maybe the better way to think of it as if you plan on moving
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,703	| IOT073 |	You know it's on your house or right
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,751	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:12,895	| IOT073 |	I will give them some Kudos though on the smart home staging. Com site which is where all this information is
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,943	| IOT073 |	They do say for sellers
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,223	| IOT073 |	What you sold your home
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:20,831	| IOT073 |	Here's how you should return Smart Home Products their factory default settings which is something I remember to do
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:26,719	| IOT073 |	When I left my house but it's easy to forget that if you're selling your house cuz you got a lot going on
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,511	| IOT073 |	I think that's really useful
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:29,791	| IOT073 |	I agree
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:34,143	| IOT073 |	There we go in at some point in time I'm going to have a realtor come on the show
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT073 |	And talk about
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,447	| IOT073 |	The investment
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,079	| IOT073 |	Solar panels do I can tell you that from experience
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,503	| IOT073 |	Southeast Pennsylvania
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,575	| IOT073 |	Okay let's talk about

EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,015	| IOT073 |	Rings that look like a normal ring
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,295	| IOT073 |	And have an NFC chip
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:27,647	| IOT073 |	Inside at no power needed it's just using the electromagnetic fields of a
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,951	| IOT073 |	Point-of-sale terminal you put the ring
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:34,047	| IOT073 |	Are your hand over a 20syl terminal you can pay for stuff using your Visa card
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:37,119	| IOT073 |	Tell tokenize insecure in songs Airport
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,167	| IOT073 |	Apple pay Android pay Samsung pay Etc
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:46,335	| IOT073 |	The thing is there weren't just for the Olympic athletes we find out because you can go to
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,639	| IOT073 |	Nfcring.com
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,663	| IOT073 |	And
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:55,039	| IOT073 |	Purchase your powered by Visa smart ring so it's open to anybody now
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT073 |	And
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,855	| IOT073 |	I really like
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| IOT073 |	Hey the look at these things
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,975	| IOT073 |	I'll be the price on a 50 bucks which isn't too too bad
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:09,631	| IOT073 |	And see the fact that you know it works with a very standardized system you know NFC and Beezus payment system so
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:16,031	| IOT073 |	I thought I was kind of neat don't know if you saw these at all that one looks just like my wedding ring for Crown but I can swap at my wedding ring cuz
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:20,383	| IOT073 |	I think I buy tungsten carbide ring now but I could replace you with a similar ceramic ring
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,663	| IOT073 |	I have NFC
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| IOT073 |	I love the ideas

EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:26,015	| IOT073 |	Replace our wedding band with
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:30,111	| IOT073 |	Best trust me that's no problem my wife just lost her second band
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:34,719	| IOT073 |	Power couple weeks ago and go to Amazon and get a wedding ring whenever she doesn't care
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,487	| IOT073 |	We're not like that
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:35,999	| IOT073 |	I want to
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| IOT073 |	These are very mask
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:42,399	| IOT073 |	I will maybe that's why I like them more
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,191	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:47,263	| IOT073 |	Yeah they're 50 bucks there's one that's 60
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,287	| IOT073 |	They look nice
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,591	| IOT073 |	If you want to pay for things I feel like
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,639	| IOT073 |	They don't do much other than payment
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:18:00,831	| IOT073 |	They symbolize your love for Nobel paint
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:08,511	| IOT073 |	With have you tried to pay for something using NFC like an NFC product or a wallet
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,815	| IOT073 |	I got your phone without being asked to show ID
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,351	| IOT073 |	Yeah man
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,631	| IOT073 |	Okay I'm asking
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,703	| IOT073 |	Then you just say this
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,103	| IOT073 |	We don't even need your phone I don't think with this
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:26,943	| IOT073 |	Straight up NFL
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:32,831	| IOT073 |	Yeah I don't think you I don't think you need your
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:36,671	| IOT073 |	Your phone at all and it and to be honest it's also not just for payment so you can
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:39,743	| IOT073 |	Use that chip to unlock doors
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,535	| IOT073 |	Ketorolac supports that
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:44,351	| IOT073 |	You can share information through NFC
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:47,423	| IOT073 |	You can program it with that so there's there's more to it than just payments even
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,519	| IOT073 |	Yes and they actually have their cheapest one Kevin
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,823	| IOT073 |	You should only 525 and it has it
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:57,151	| IOT073 |	I like that it's like basically there
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:57,663	| IOT073 |	Prototype
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| IOT073 |	Theaters
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,991	| IOT073 |	Just like
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,319	| IOT073 |	That's the Vintage model that makes sense
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,903	| IOT073 |	And you went did we ever think we would call NFC Rings vintage
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:14,815	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:18,399	| IOT073 |	I like the eclipse it's got that textured
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,679	| IOT073 |	Flip2it
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,943	| IOT073 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,711	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,223	| IOT073 |	Lychee
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,527	| IOT073 |	Next we should talk about
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,039	| IOT073 |	Ecobee
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:38,111	| IOT073 |	I got a notice on Twitter from
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,903	| IOT073 |	Dunk it
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,463	| IOT073 |	Who he is
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:44,255	| IOT073 |	He's a reporter at
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,279	| IOT073 |	Asteroid
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,071	| IOT073 |	So don't really know
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,351	| IOT073 |	What that is but
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,375	| IOT073 |	Public hello
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,143	| IOT073 |	Sent me
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,727	| IOT073 |	News that the FCC founded FCC filing
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,519	| IOT073 |	That says there's a new
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,383	| IOT073 |	And he's right because we check the FCC database
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:01,919	| IOT073 |	And it is the ecobee Lite
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,711	| IOT073 |	L i t e
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,783	| IOT073 |	Bike light bulb
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,295	| IOT073 |	Like
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,623	| IOT073 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,135	| IOT073 |	Sorry
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,671	| IOT073 |	No apology
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,231	| IOT073 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,743	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,535	| IOT073 |	This feeling
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,863	| IOT073 |	There's not much in the FCC database we know it works son but
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,655	| IOT073 |	2.4 gigahertz
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:26,495	| IOT073 |	And in the 900 megahertz range switch now that's it
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:33,919	| IOT073 |	Exactly so we were talking about this before the show were like what is he could be doing
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,687	| IOT073 |	IPhone get version
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:37,503	| IOT073 |	Maybe it's a sensor free version but then
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,039	| IOT073 |	It's got 900 megahertz support
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,831	| IOT073 |	Providence Support Center
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,415	| IOT073 |	What is it
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,439	| IOT073 |	So what is
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,719	| IOT073 |	What does ecobee light mean
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT073 |	We can't tell you
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,279	| IOT073 |	Rihanna
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,047	| IOT073 |	Because we don't know
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:50,815	| IOT073 |	I can't tell you
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,911	| IOT073 |	Stat ecobee recently took 35 million dollars from
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,703	| IOT073 |	The Amazon
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,727	| IOT073 |	PT's punch
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,799	| IOT073 |	Try not to say
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,823	| IOT073 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,871	| IOT073 |	So they're fun for the echo
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:07,711	| IOT073 |	And it's possible this could incorporate something like
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,015	| IOT073 |	Echo voice services
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:17,184	| IOT073 |	Right which means you wouldn't need to have an echo like I have an echo and I tell my echo to change the thermostat by voice and
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,696	| IOT073 |	And it does so
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| IOT073 |	Maybe this is native
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,280	| IOT073 |	Voice services
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,328	| IOT073 |	And that makes me wonder Maybe
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:28,448	| IOT073 |	The touch screen is not a touch screen that it's only voice control and that would be the light part
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:30,240	| IOT073 |	Yeah and if that's true.
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,264	| IOT073 |	A cheaper car
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:40,736	| IOT073 |	I got to refurb unit off Amazon ecobee3 so I don't remember what the cost nowadays
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,248	| IOT073 |	How is your son
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT073 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:52,512	| IOT073 |	So I did find interesting the Globe and Mail wrote up
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| IOT073 |	About ecobees funding
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:22:00,704	| IOT073 |	Time and day in their story mentioned some great shots that I thought were useful about a third of the
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT073 |	Users
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,288	| IOT073 |	Actually
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:07,872	| IOT073 |	Blink their devices to either homekit
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,176	| IOT073 |	Or the echo or SmartThings
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:13,248	| IOT073 |	So actually going to be a little bit higher
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:13,760	| IOT073 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,624	| IOT073 |	And ecobee has a 24% market share
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| IOT073 |	According to NPD
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| IOT073 |	So it's right behind nest
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| IOT073 |	And that's in the Smart Home
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,744	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:26,048	| IOT073 |	And personally I like the ecobee
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,072	| IOT073 |	Three more than
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:35,008	| IOT073 |	Same here I left my Nest behind at the old home and then I put the eagle be in here and have a sensor here in my office so
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:38,592	| IOT073 |	And I'm getting too warm in the summertime on the second floor
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:39,872	| IOT073 |	Yay
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:43,456	| IOT073 |	So the point here is we don't know what is happening
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:45,248	| IOT073 |	But will keep you apprised
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,064	| IOT073 |	I'm going for no touch screen
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,112	| IOT073 |	Voice control online
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,672	| IOT073 |	And that would be great cuz that would be
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:55,232	| IOT073 |	That would have to have a cheaper product
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,256	| IOT073 |	Touch screens
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,328	| IOT073 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,120	| IOT073 |	Let's see what else do we want to
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,400	| IOT073 |	Kevin YouTube
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:06,496	| IOT073 |	We got two little car tickets we can talk about
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,568	| IOT073 |	Going to talk about
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,128	| IOT073 |	Delphi
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:19,296	| IOT073 |	Identify yes yes yes so they Delphi forces with mobileye to develop AC
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,576	| IOT073 |	Self-driving system
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:26,976	| IOT073 |	And mobileye if you are not familiar they are the folks that I believe Tesla works with for their
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,744	| IOT073 |	Automatic
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,280	| IOT073 |	Driving abilities yes
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:39,776	| IOT073 |	That's right yeah yeah yeah so so I guess what Delphi mobile I are planning to do is kind of created
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,568	| IOT073 |	An autonomous driving system
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,360	| IOT073 |	That any car maker could just
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:49,760	| IOT073 |	I want to say plug-and-play cuz there's more to it than that but essentially create that solution that will work with any car and car makers
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:53,600	| IOT073 |	Easily just purchased the driving system and install it
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,624	| IOT073 |	Enter there
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,392	| IOT073 |	Vehicles
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:57,184	| IOT073 |	Yes in his cars become
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,952	| IOT073 |	Computers
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| IOT073 |	I think
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,000	| IOT073 |	The idea of
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:03,584	| IOT073 |	Creating these kabaddi parts for these modular parks
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,352	| IOT073 |	Computers went down and
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,376	| IOT073 |	Tremendously
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,656	| IOT073 |	Once we were like
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,168	| IOT073 |	Hey
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:12,800	| IOT073 |	A standardized on you know this kind of instruction sets osx86 let's standardized on
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,128	| IOT073 |	A graphics card slot in different buses
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,664	| IOT073 |	So if you think about
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:20,736	| IOT073 |	That's basically this model and I think it makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,528	| IOT073 |	So we'll see if
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,552	| IOT073 |	The carmaker's think so
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,112	| IOT073 |	Can I get a smart move
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,416	| IOT073 |	Anything else I got you
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,768	| IOT073 |	Notes for the next carpet
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,048	| IOT073 |	Connect Adobe
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,888	| IOT073 |	The plug-in module
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,472	| IOT073 |	These are devices
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:45,824	| IOT073 |	Every car made after 1996 has this slot below the steering wheel
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,336	| IOT073 |	Down there
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:51,456	| IOT073 |	You can plug in something to it and it's like on board diagnostics you can see date about the engine
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:54,272	| IOT073 |	Gas mileage all kinds of fun stuff
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:57,856	| IOT073 |	Automatic all of them
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,696	| IOT073 |	Have these products that can reduce data and give the data to your smartphone
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:07,328	| IOT073 |	So what automatic is done they have launched their second generation products which has
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,352	| IOT073 |	Cellular Bill Jen
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,424	| IOT073 |	And it's I believe 3-g cellular
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,984	| IOT073 |	And what it does is
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:18,848	| IOT073 |	Since that day. Not just to you over like when you get home
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:22,432	| IOT073 |	World connection
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,992	| IOT073 |	They also send now can send it wherever you are at
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,576	| IOT073 |	This is important for
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:32,416	| IOT073 |	People who like want to see the actual car locations of your parent
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:36,256	| IOT073 |	Or if your insurance firm

EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:43,168	| IOT073 |	Which I do I have fun module plug into a two-door cars
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,680	| IOT073 |	Sweet
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:48,032	| IOT073 |	It really the most interesting thing for my perspective on this is that it
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,568	| IOT073 |	Doesn't have a data subscription
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:55,968	| IOT073 |	So there to whisper sink
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,528	| IOT073 |	And it only cost $30 more than the original
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,576	| IOT073 |	People who are like
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| IOT073 |	What what
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,904	| IOT073 |	It's $100 for the
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:08,000	| IOT073 |	Anon 334b 3G
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,560	| IOT073 |	And
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:15,680	| IOT073 |	I'm wondering who's did a network they're using a money gesetz AT&T
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:23,872	| IOT073 |	But you're right AT&T is good for cars Verizon's been doing some really cool stuff though with
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,384	| IOT073 |	Connected
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,200	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:30,272	| IOT073 |	I don't know who funds them and that isn't
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,320	| IOT073 |	Really darn good question so
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,368	| IOT073 |	If we find out who let you guys know
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,440	| IOT073 |	We will find out it something time and
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,720	| IOT073 |	While we're on the subject
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:41,024	| IOT073 |	OBD ports and what not real quick
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:45,888	| IOT073 |	They're great for getting information but did you know that they're all so awesome for
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,448	| IOT073 |	Sending pushing information
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:56,640	| IOT073 |	So much as I have flashed the software of many Android devices in my time
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:59,968	| IOT073 |	I have flash the software of my car using the OBD
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:06,624	| IOT073 |	Yeah it's it's actually it's pretty common noun for 3rd party
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:12,000	| IOT073 |	Companies to create new engine mapping software that will boost your
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:14,560	| IOT073 |	Attorney Brewster turbo pressure boost the
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:17,120	| IOT073 |	The horsepower the torque and so on
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,448	| IOT073 |	All done through software and they push it through the OBD port
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,984	| IOT073 |	Huh
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:26,336	| IOT073 |	ECU engine control unit of the car which is also for bass
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,384	| IOT073 |	It's flash just like you flash a phone or tablet
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,176	| IOT073 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:37,088	| IOT073 |	Sorry I mean sorry the curveball
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:41,696	| IOT073 |	Listen to if this than that which is fine because then you can like
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| IOT073 |	Kinds of other fun stuff
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,560	| IOT073 |	And if you ever want
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,328	| IOT073 |	Time time-wasting
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:54,752	| IOT073 |	That they do actually offer like their blogs sometimes has fun posts like where the most aggressive drivers
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,336	| IOT073 |	Yeah I program my list
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,360	| IOT073 |	Upstart
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:03,456	| IOT073 |	That's what why do you think I made my car faster
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,504	| IOT073 |	Kevin your number one
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,552	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,280	| IOT073 |	And be most aggressive people
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:19,584	| IOT073 |	On highways are actually in Phoenix
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,096	| IOT073 |	In case you were wondering

EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:51,136	| IOT073 |	Taboo because I am super pumped about
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:54,976	| IOT073 |	How we make sense of all this data that's going to be coming in
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,048	| IOT073 |	So let's start off with
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:04,704	| IOT073 |	What you guys do so people can understand where you're coming from do you want to give me a quick 22nd view of Mara

EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,080	| IOT073 |	Human contact
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:17,248	| IOT073 |	In what we call the alternate to anything that's not working tonight we try to break down the avial and life into us
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,272	| IOT073 |	60 components
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:19,808	| IOT073 |	Then we allowed
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,600	| IOT073 |	Users to Shelby
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,880	| IOT073 |	Components for the environment
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,184	| IOT073 |	The environment can be response
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:29,536	| IOT073 |	A door lock can be sure it's locked after it realizes you fall asleep
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,072	| IOT073 |	Vulcan
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:33,888	| IOT073 |	An annotated realizes you're on your way home etcetera etcetera
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| IOT073 |	Got it
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:39,008	| IOT073 |	All right now you guys first right now have an app
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:41,056	| IOT073 |	And I actually downloaded it and it was fun
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:43,360	| IOT073 |	It focuses mostly though on
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,920	| IOT073 |	Health right now today yes
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,248	| IOT073 |	To our product is an SDK
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:52,064	| IOT073 |	We do have an app that dap is used for
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,344	| IOT073 |	Maybe either testing
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,648	| IOT073 |	Assistant manager
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:56,928	| IOT073 |	I just want to make sure
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,976	| IOT073 |	How cold it is an ingredient
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,000	| IOT073 |	Sits inside
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,024	| IOT073 |	Good healthy products
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,584	| IOT073 |	And did these products and then ask
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,888	| IOT073 |	SDK questions
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:09,984	| IOT073 |	Good answer for example you want to know any other fell asleep you want to know any users on
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:10,496	| IOT073 |	Sweet home
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,544	| IOT073 |	When user is starting to run
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:15,616	| IOT073 |	And as a result of the answers we provide
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,176	| IOT073 |	Theater solution can change its Behavior
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:25,600	| IOT073 |	Sounds kind of worrisome as a user I'm like God I don't know if I want something that knows all of this information
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,368	| IOT073 |	Json about me
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:28,928	| IOT073 |	Telling other devices unless I let it
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:33,024	| IOT073 |	Festival you really need to understand
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:33,792	| IOT073 |	Lights out
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:39,936	| IOT073 |	If you believe that door lock that make sure it's is it is locked after you fall asleep is beneficial
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:43,520	| IOT073 |	And you would like to have this functionality
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,312	| IOT073 |	And the question is how
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,080	| IOT073 |	To make it
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,360	| IOT073 |	The most secure and safe
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,128	| IOT073 |	Convection
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,664	| IOT073 |	That you can possibly make
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,992	| IOT073 |	But I do agree this thing
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,528	| IOT073 |	We must convey
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,344	| IOT073 |	To the users is what is the upside they're getting
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:00,160	| IOT073 |	So can the music player
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:03,488	| IOT073 |	Bring me that special music when I'm running or
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:07,584	| IOT073 |	When I'm running this phone can stop at pushing noise notifications
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,864	| IOT073 |	Do not disturb me
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:11,680	| IOT073 |	And the car will realize they just finished a run
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,960	| IOT073 |	And cool down the car
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:14,752	| IOT073 |	Can all of this
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:19,104	| IOT073 |	Be beneficial to me and if so let me share these pieces of my life
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:22,432	| IOT073 |	With these Solutions so that they can personalize themselves
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,712	| IOT073 |	Alright,
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:27,552	| IOT073 |	How are people going to use this what is this going to look like
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:30,368	| IOT073 |	If your vision of the world comes to fruition
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,904	| IOT073 |	Believe again
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,952	| IOT073 |	Similar to the internet
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:36,000	| IOT073 |	And devices
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,024	| IOT073 |	Mobile experience
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:39,328	| IOT073 |	Lily personalized insult to our needs
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,096	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:42,144	| IOT073 |	I can't think of a chronic disease
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:46,496	| IOT073 |	Be connected with my diabetes results
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,520	| IOT073 |	Hypertension
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,824	| IOT073 |	And the answer is definitely yes
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,360	| IOT073 |	A glucometer today
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,896	| IOT073 |	Is this a sensory
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,944	| IOT073 |	Takes your blood glucose cut, cable
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,224	| IOT073 |	Overtime
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:58,528	| IOT073 |	What is the glucometer look in real life
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,320	| IOT073 |	The time I just
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,624	| IOT073 |	Woke up and I'm on my way out of the home
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:05,696	| IOT073 |	Now would be a good time to interject
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,464	| IOT073 |	MessYourself
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:10,304	| IOT073 |	I understand that I am about addictively to start a run
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,352	| IOT073 |	And I haven't measured myself
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:14,144	| IOT073 |	For the last 3 hours
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:15,680	| IOT073 |	Enso mattress
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,240	| IOT073 |	Advise me to eat an apple
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| IOT073 |	Measurements
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,056	| IOT073 |	Now this glucometer
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:25,152	| IOT073 |	Changing the behavior to me versus to University or third person
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:26,944	| IOT073 |	And takes care of
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:29,760	| IOT073 |	And this can happen tomorrow
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,784	| IOT073 |	Technology
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,552	| IOT073 |	Make this
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,576	| IOT073 |	Happened to Momo
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:35,392	| IOT073 |	You can think of any type of medical
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,416	| IOT073 |	Solutionwhere
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:40,256	| IOT073 |	Example they want to provide you with Insight so today what's happening is
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:44,352	| IOT073 |	You have 6000 inside and they just throw some Matthew hoping that they would work
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:49,984	| IOT073 |	What is this solution realizes that I'm about sleeping so the inside tube
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,008	| IOT073 |	Potato to mining
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,568	| IOT073 |	Verses on my worst exercises
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:56,640	| IOT073 |	And so these inside need to be tailored to my niece
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,408	| IOT073 |	So now
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,456	| IOT073 |	Again you and me
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:01,248	| IOT073 |	Mike gets very very different
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,272	| IOT073 |	Experience
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,040	| IOT073 |	From this device
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,320	| IOT073 |	Solution
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:07,648	| IOT073 |	And so on and so forth I really believe
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:13,792	| IOT073 |	That the power of context of AI is relevant tomorrow and not necessarily
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,584	| IOT073 |	Innotech is from today
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:16,608	| IOT073 |	Awesome
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:19,680	| IOT073 |	This feels almost like magic so
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,960	| IOT073 |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:23,264	| IOT073 |	How this happens in
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:25,824	| IOT073 |	What do my devices need to know when how is the setup
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:30,432	| IOT073 |	It's important to realize that this
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,480	| IOT073 |	Interweb inter
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,272	| IOT073 |	It's nice if you and me
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,808	| IOT073 |	Clever wording to Google
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:42,720	| IOT073 |	Google try to understand what is it I mean when I say gift in you mean when you say gift in personalized results when you and me
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:43,488	| IOT073 |	Going to Amazon
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:46,304	| IOT073 |	Home page and why is that
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,072	| IOT073 |	Because
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:50,656	| IOT073 |	Amazon price to increase our conversion to make it more relevant to us
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:51,936	| IOT073 |	In what
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,728	| IOT073 |	I called the ultimate
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,520	| IOT073 |	Mobile experiences
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:59,104	| IOT073 |	In the experiences we're not there yet
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,920	| IOT073 |	Whole Space is much more today
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:07,296	| IOT073 |	I will stick to you like that will focus on Health and Wellness
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:12,928	| IOT073 |	And presently we work with a glucometer so think of a glucometer the tree lights
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,464	| IOT073 |	Feel about starting run
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,000	| IOT073 |	We are about to enter restaurant
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,768	| IOT073 |	And as a result
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:20,608	| IOT073 |	Advise you to admit to yourself or give you some insight on
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,632	| IOT073 |	Children shouldn't run
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,680	| IOT073 |	Aeromexico
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,472	| IOT073 |	Set a remind me to take that
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:27,264	| IOT073 |	Medication at 8 a.m.
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:32,640	| IOT073 |	Medisafe with another customer can remind you to take that medication before you leave home predictively or
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:36,480	| IOT073 |	Just after you wake up which for you might be 6 a.m. for me might be
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:36,992	| IOT073 |	10 a.m.
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,528	| IOT073 |	And so
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,296	| IOT073 |	Again
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,576	| IOT073 |	Little Things
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,344	| IOT073 |	That
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:43,392	| IOT073 |	Will take this opportunity
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:48,000	| IOT073 |	Into a a sweet same Evolution as the internet went through
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,792	| IOT073 |	Similarly
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,816	| IOT073 |	Will experience
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:53,888	| IOT073 |	Better engagement ring conversion better personalization
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,168	| IOT073 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:59,776	| IOT073 |	So many of these examples that you could have mentioned I see
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:04,896	| IOT073 |	One company that has the data in makes this change in their individual product
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,968	| IOT073 |	What's different about the Internet of Things is there
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,784	| IOT073 |	Lots of products and
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:15,136	| IOT073 |	We're trying to get them to work together so I'm curious if that changes how you build something
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:22,816	| IOT073 |	Solution to becoming a small solution you got all kinds of ways to do it
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,608	| IOT073 |	Some ways legal equal subject matter
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,192	| IOT073 |	Door locks in the oven
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,240	| IOT073 |	Whatever
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,008	| IOT073 |	Delightful
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:31,776	| IOT073 |	But some of them
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,360	| IOT073 |	Diesel 82
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,640	| IOT073 |	What is the human
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:37,920	| IOT073 |	Contacts
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:42,272	| IOT073 |	We talked about tomorrow call example typically what you say is
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,576	| IOT073 |	Talk about Entertainment System
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:48,416	| IOT073 |	Talk about telematics you talk about autonomous driving all of these
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,696	| IOT073 |	Ozone the car
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,000	| IOT073 |	Sleep deprived
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:55,328	| IOT073 |	Lights when you enter the car we just finished a run
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:57,888	| IOT073 |	You sweaty when you enter the car can impact
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:58,912	| IOT073 |	The car Behavior
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:01,216	| IOT073 |	Luck has nothing to do with the car
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:03,008	| IOT073 |	About understanding the person
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:03,776	| IOT073 |	Rental cars
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:07,104	| IOT073 |	Car playlist deep focus on what they do best
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:08,384	| IOT073 |	Which is their own device
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:10,432	| IOT073 |	In with we do
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:12,736	| IOT073 |	Philosophy we advocate for
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:16,064	| IOT073 |	Let's understand the human in a good holistic manner
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,600	| IOT073 |	And then
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:21,440	| IOT073 |	These understanding can benefit multiple facets
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:24,256	| IOT073 |	Standardization protocol play then
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,304	| IOT073 |	An action subject Methodist
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:30,400	| IOT073 |	Got it so then I would think that a company like Google
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:35,264	| IOT073 |	Or possibly even Amazon or Facebook that has a lot of information
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,056	| IOT073 |	About me is a
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,336	| IOT073 |	Person already
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:41,920	| IOT073 |	Might be a venom more powerful position to do this
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:46,784	| IOT073 |	You can bet the Google is not interested
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,832	| IOT073 |	To cool down my room
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:51,392	| IOT073 |	I did not why they buy Sims card company
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,416	| IOT073 |	They're interested in.
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:55,744	| IOT073 |	Odell doing building very proactive
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:59,584	| IOT073 |	To get this sort of what again what I called the outernet
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,120	| IOT073 |	Things are not Webbie
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:02,912	| IOT073 |	It's definitely
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,984	| IOT073 |	Specifically we feel
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:08,032	| IOT073 |	Technology
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:12,640	| IOT073 |	But the model by which we work which gives the user full transparency
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:16,992	| IOT073 |	Just think about
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:18,784	| IOT073 |	This amount of data
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:22,368	| IOT073 |	Is now being collected and aggregated around you
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,136	| IOT073 |	Anyone
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:26,720	| IOT073 |	Midlands action recipes Constantin very limited
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,488	| IOT073 |	Serve your needs
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,792	| IOT073 |	Which is not the Google Motorola
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:32,352	| IOT073 |	Old Amazon
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,656	| IOT073 |	Let's give you something free
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,960	| IOT073 |	And sell your life to a Nike phone ad
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,800	| IOT073 |	Okay so how does this how does this model work
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:44,128	| IOT073 |	How are you guys collecting all this data about me
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:47,968	| IOT073 |	Against the way we advocate for this new
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:49,248	| IOT073 |	Economy
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:51,040	| IOT073 |	Is to provide compelling
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:51,808	| IOT073 |	To the user
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:53,856	| IOT073 |	You want the door locked
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,392	| IOT073 |	HELOC after you.
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:59,488	| IOT073 |	Make it make sense for you to let the door lock know that you falling asleep
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,280	| IOT073 |	And in exchange
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,304	| IOT073 |	Get that value
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,328	| IOT073 |	The door being locked
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,864	| IOT073 |	You need to understand that
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:08,704	| IOT073 |	What doesn't need to get is the fact that you
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:11,264	| IOT073 |	Waking up or the fact that you are
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:16,896	| IOT073 |	Sleep Quality vs. Sleep Quality or how much time you sleeping are you sleeping next to
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,688	| IOT073 |	Interesting for the user
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:23,296	| IOT073 |	Let the door lock know if the door lock connect to just a Sleep Center
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,576	| IOT073 |	Then they get all of that
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:28,928	| IOT073 |	Type in to get the burden of only listening to a sensor or not
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,720	| IOT073 |	Utilizing algorithm
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:35,072	| IOT073 |	This is definitely the mother that we advocate
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,864	| IOT073 |	The way we do it then
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:42,496	| IOT073 |	Alcoa skillset is essentially algorithm we collect data from multiple channels app 200 channels
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:46,080	| IOT073 |	And we take all of that to put it into an agreement
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:50,176	| IOT073 |	Try to figure out what does this picture mean does it mean that use a fell asleep
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:52,992	| IOT073 |	In the falling asleep example
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:55,552	| IOT073 |	It can be anywhere from sensory activity like
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:58,112	| IOT073 |	Sleep sensing motion sensing
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,672	| IOT073 |	Mobile elements like
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,696	| IOT073 |	Is there lights
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:03,488	| IOT073 |	Are you charging
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:06,304	| IOT073 |	UPS to Patton Elementary this your home
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,096	| IOT073 |	This we typically sleep at
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:12,192	| IOT073 |	Have you home this is the time you color you typically fall asleep at the Tara Tara
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,264	| IOT073 |	Whatever we get would fit into very agile
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,056	| IOT073 |	Algorithm
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,592	| IOT073 |	Sin City 1 or 0
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,128	| IOT073 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:24,992	| IOT073 |	And then you sell your SDK and a company would say hey I want the results of this sleep data
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,296	| IOT073 |	Coolest I want to be today
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:31,904	| IOT073 |	Example when the user for the sleep wake up sore about to wake up predictive later.
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:34,464	| IOT073 |	As a result I'm going to change my
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:35,744	| IOT073 |	Solution
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,256	| IOT073 |	I'm going to
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,048	| IOT073 |	Turn off the lights
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:40,352	| IOT073 |	Lock the door reminder take a pill whatever
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:43,168	| IOT073 |	But again if you use all solution user
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,704	| IOT073 |	Must be involved
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:48,544	| IOT073 |	So the door lock will not come to dinner until he knew I want to know when
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,568	| IOT073 |	Stacey fell asleep
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:52,384	| IOT073 |	It would go to Stacy and say hey Stacy
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,919	| IOT073 |	I want to make sure the door is locked
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:58,271	| IOT073 |	After you fall asleep in exchange I ask that you would let me know
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:00,831	| IOT073 |	Understanding the value
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,367	| IOT073 |	Will approve the transaction
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,415	| IOT073 |	Got it
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:04,927	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,999	| IOT073 |	Where are we today with the deployment of
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,279	| IOT073 |	Will call at AI in the outer
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:13,631	| IOT073 |	I think it's the really initially think what you see is that
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,447	| IOT073 |	Fulton Health and Wellness
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:20,031	| IOT073 |	Received the spaces siloed some elements
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,823	| IOT073 |	Space amoeba world summer list
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:24,383	| IOT073 |	Examples most home today
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,943	| IOT073 |	People are still going to focus on the basics lollipop
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,247	| IOT073 |	When I tell you to lock u-lock
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,783	| IOT073 |	Michaela Conlin
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:31,551	| IOT073 |	That's it
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:33,343	| IOT073 |	If you can do that I'm good for now
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,135	| IOT073 |	In the space is not even there yet
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:40,767	| IOT073 |	In medical for example you have dozens of glaucoma till dozens of mobile apps
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,535	| IOT073 |	Today
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,071	| IOT073 |	And now they're seeking for that
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:45,375	| IOT073 |	Differentiate
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:48,703	| IOT073 |	Okay bye I can give you some basic lollipop position
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:50,239	| IOT073 |	And now let me
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,519	| IOT073 |	Personalize it like me
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,823	| IOT073 |	Hey make it more intuitive to you
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:56,383	| IOT073 |	It's very similar to the internet
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:56,895	| IOT073 |	Used to have
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,431	| IOT073 |	Dumb portal
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:59,711	| IOT073 |	One website fits all
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:02,527	| IOT073 |	Evolve evolve now
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,063	| IOT073 |	Your website
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:05,343	| IOT073 |	My website would not
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,391	| IOT073 |	The same lips that do not behave
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| IOT073 |	2 Yuan to mean the same as
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:12,511	| IOT073 |	Are you concerned that when people think about AI
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,815	| IOT073 |	They still think of Skynet in the end of humanity
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:16,863	| IOT073 |	And I would love to get
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,655	| IOT073 |	Your response to that
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:19,423	| IOT073 |	Because
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:24,799	| IOT073 |	Do you feel like we're anywhere close should we be worried about this or are we still so far off
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:27,359	| IOT073 |	Technologically
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,663	| IOT073 |	Technologically I think
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:31,711	| IOT073 |	Even if you scrape the boundaries of
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:33,503	| IOT073 |	Psychology today understanding
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:35,295	| IOT073 |	Human behavior
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,343	| IOT073 |	Predicting human behavior
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,367	| IOT073 |	Extremely difficult
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,671	| IOT073 |	I do think that the way
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,951	| IOT073 |	That has been handled
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,719	| IOT073 |	Is
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,767	| IOT073 |	Something of concern and I think you see it
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,583	| IOT073 |	You see how the market this concert like
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:50,399	| IOT073 |	Coyotes not about what websites do I serve
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:53,215	| IOT073 |	Select my home systems my car system
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,751	| IOT073 |	Health Systems
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,079	| IOT073 |	I think we have an offer
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:58,591	| IOT073 |	Tunity
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,151	| IOT073 |	Two again change the rules of the game
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:03,455	| IOT073 |	But
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:06,271	| IOT073 |	Honestly think he is being utilized
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:07,039	| IOT073 |	As a buzzword
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,575	| IOT073 |	Trading
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:10,111	| IOT073 |	Expectations article
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,391	| IOT073 |	Not really easy
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:15,487	| IOT073 |	And I think we're potentially getting going to get hit by that
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:20,607	| IOT073 |	Because two three years from now experienced are going to get better but you not going to see any Terminators roaming the streets
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:23,935	| IOT073 |	That's good yes the Terminator probably shoot me
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,703	| IOT073 |	Before I got here
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:26,751	| IOT073 |	So you mentioned
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:31,103	| IOT073 |	That we have a chance to change the way we handle this data to me it feels like a lot of
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:34,431	| IOT073 |	But that horse is already out of the barn so I'm kind of curious
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,223	| IOT073 |	Why you say that
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:36,991	| IOT073 |	And how we can
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,783	| IOT073 |	Put the horse back in the barn
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:42,111	| IOT073 |	Craigslist in the internet
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:45,695	| IOT073 |	No one reads terms of agreement before they press I agree
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:47,487	| IOT073 |	That's again descent of the things
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,279	| IOT073 |	Also this one set of.
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,071	| IOT073 |	Goodwill not used to sharing
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:57,215	| IOT073 |	Even Samsung you see the de-emphasized privacy
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,495	| IOT073 |	Very much
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:02,079	| IOT073 |	And so the Google way of doing things is being challenged
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:04,383	| IOT073 |	Even Google itself is taking measures to
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,919	| IOT073 |	Increase transparency
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:11,039	| IOT073 |	The way I look at it is this is as follows I think you have enough companies
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:12,575	| IOT073 |	The don't deal with data
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:16,671	| IOT073 |	But I'll players in the Internet of Things by Samsung hblg Lenovo
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:18,975	| IOT073 |	Good movies to give you valium
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:19,487	| IOT073 |	You buy some
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:23,071	| IOT073 |	And they have an embedded incentive
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:25,119	| IOT073 |	Increase that value
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,399	| IOT073 |	Enhance add value
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,447	| IOT073 |	You asked
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:28,959	| IOT073 |	So
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:31,007	| IOT073 |	You have multiple players
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:32,543	| IOT073 |	Will at least appreciate
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:35,615	| IOT073 |	An alternative to the Google way of doing
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:40,223	| IOT073 |	If we can present them with this alternative that is technologically good
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,783	| IOT073 |	They will use that
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,831	| IOT073 |	So I think now is essentially a race
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:47,903	| IOT073 |	Network effect Weber can get
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,439	| IOT073 |	What's a good AIC
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,975	| IOT073 |	Technology to enough hands
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:53,023	| IOT073 |	I will set the tone
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:56,607	| IOT073 |	Oh my gosh that's a huge burden for consumers because they don't
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:59,679	| IOT073 |	They may not understand the terms and
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,215	| IOT073 |	What is even going on here
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:06,847	| IOT073 |	I mean people are just as freaked out about Samsung televisions that are unicorn quote always listening
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:08,895	| IOT073 |	As they are about you know
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:09,407	| IOT073 |	Google
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,735	| IOT073 |	CM Nest thermostat in their house so
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:15,039	| IOT073 |	How to communicate that to the end user
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,831	| IOT073 |	I agree with you completely
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:18,879	| IOT073 |	Anythink
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:20,415	| IOT073 |	Against a lot of
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:22,207	| IOT073 |	Incentive to
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:24,767	| IOT073 |	Not make the screen still in to the user
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,559	| IOT073 |	This is why you have 50 days
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,607	| IOT073 |	Signs of a gay man that no one reads
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:32,447	| IOT073 |	And you expected to sign to get whatever a Gmail
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:33,727	| IOT073 |	And I do think you know
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,007	| IOT073 |	Christmas
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,031	| IOT073 |	Experience
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:41,151	| IOT073 |	Did the Fiasco that happened so far for example the Samsung TV
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,431	| IOT073 |	Something that it has
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:43,711	| IOT073 |	Card Samsung
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,735	| IOT073 |	Significant
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,527	| IOT073 |	They are actively seeking
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:49,855	| IOT073 |	I mean that's a perfect example of
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:51,903	| IOT073 |	A company realizing
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:53,439	| IOT073 |	Get this done wrong
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:54,463	| IOT073 |	Klein
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:56,767	| IOT073 |	Very profusely to change that
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:00,351	| IOT073 |	I honestly think
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:02,911	| IOT073 |	Consumer loan will not be able
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:03,935	| IOT073 |	2
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:05,471	| IOT073 |	She was at movement
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:10,335	| IOT073 |	You need both the demand side and the supply-side realizing that there is a business model
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:12,383	| IOT073 |	You're not being a spy
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:14,175	| IOT073 |	Letting being
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,199	| IOT073 |	A villi
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:19,295	| IOT073 |	Diligent with how you handled that there is money to be made in Gotti to be
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:21,599	| IOT073 |	All right I love it
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:25,439	| IOT073 |	And I can't wait to see if this works out so
