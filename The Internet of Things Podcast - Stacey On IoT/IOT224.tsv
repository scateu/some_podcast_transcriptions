EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,824	| IOT224 |	And he's going to talk about
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,384	| IOT224 |	Basically Financial engineering
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:26,016	| IOT224 |	For the iot and getting around this whole capex Apex thing when we start selling every
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:26,528	| IOT224 |	Living as a server
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:30,368	| IOT224 |	It's fun complicated and you will
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,136	| IOT224 |	Want to listen
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:31,904	| IOT224 |	If you want to know what's a
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,696	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:38,304	| IOT224 |	Let's get this party started with a message from another one of our sponsors
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:45,728	| IOT224 |	This week sponsor is a pharaoh are you doing multiple iot projects that are
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:47,264	| IOT224 |	Going to work well together
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:49,568	| IOT224 |	In a single app to strengthen your brand
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:55,968	| IOT224 |	It's a really tough so it requires the right platform and a pharaoh is the one to choose
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:02:02,368	| IOT224 |	With a pharaoh Kenmore launch 42 smart Appliance models in 2 years
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:07,232	| IOT224 |	Barrel customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:13,632	| IOT224 |	99% pure support calls and 10x higher activation rate plus they can
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:20,032	| IOT224 |	We use 90% of their work from one project to the next pick up Arrow just like him more Mitsubishi Bank
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:26,432	| IOT224 |	D-Link did it beat your competition with a solution that your team loves to build and your customers love to you
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:30,784	| IOT224 |	Use learn more at a pharaoh go big
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,320	| IOT224 |	Rite Aid
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,600	| IOT224 |	Let's get
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT224 |	Heineken
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,648	| IOT224 |	Kevin
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,672	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,208	| IOT224 |	Parsnip
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:42,816	| IOT224 |	Let's talk about the new Z-Wave plus version 2 certification
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,352	| IOT224 |	Good
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,120	| IOT224 |	Lord
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:48,704	| IOT224 |	For those of you guys are like what
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:53,056	| IOT224 |	Z-Wave is one of the connection Technologies we talked about
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,360	| IOT224 |	It's like a zigbee and that it's a mesh
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,896	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,664	| IOT224 |	It is
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| IOT224 |	Well is it
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:00,736	| IOT224 |	Proprietary I'm going to say yes
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,504	| IOT224 |	The
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:05,088	| IOT224 |	Chip company that makes zwave chips is silicon Labs now
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,136	| IOT224 |	Originally
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,488	| IOT224 |	I like it I have lots of Z-Wave gear in my house
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,792	| IOT224 |	Most people seem to be moving away
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,560	| IOT224 |	Play from it but
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,888	| IOT224 |	It's still out there and it will probably be out there for
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,656	| IOT224 |	For quite some time
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,424	| IOT224 |	I'm so
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,472	| IOT224 |	This is basically the latest update
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,288	| IOT224 |	This is for anything built on the
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,568	| IOT224 |	Next Generation Z Wave
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:29,664	| IOT224 |	What is has is SmartStart it is now required
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:34,016	| IOT224 |	And Smart Start is where you buy a device
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| IOT224 |	You can connect it
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,856	| IOT224 |	Automatically is pre-registered
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:41,440	| IOT224 |	For your existing Z-Wave Network so if you buy something from like Amazon
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,488	| IOT224 |	It will connect to your
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,280	| IOT224 |	Device that Sardinia
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:46,816	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,352	| IOT224 |	Yay on that
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,424	| IOT224 |	Do you have to scan something I think
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| IOT224 |	You do scan
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| IOT224 |	QR codes right
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,800	| IOT224 |	Other thing it does
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,104	| IOT224 |	Is it allows you to have
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| IOT224 |	A light
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,920	| IOT224 |	So all of these devices will have
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,760	| IOT224 |	A device identification through an LED light on the product
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,040	| IOT224 |	2
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:11,136	| IOT224 |	Confirm to people that the Hub is correctly set up and pairing in that sort of thing
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,440	| IOT224 |	This sounds silly
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:18,559	| IOT224 |	But as someone who has installed and reinstalled many a Z-Wave device
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,863	| IOT224 |	I can tell you that that light is actually really help
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,703	| IOT224 |	I have these Jasco outdoor switches
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,751	| IOT224 |	And that you just press a button and you're like
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| IOT224 |	I hope it's connected
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,543	| IOT224 |	I don't know
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:33,407	| IOT224 |	When you have the light like when I'm pairing to my wink Hub which does have a lie
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| IOT224 |	I've always a little bit more relieved
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,991	| IOT224 |	When I'm pairing to something
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,759	| IOT224 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,271	| IOT224 |	Just like
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,807	| IOT224 |	Hope it a prayer guy
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:43,903	| IOT224 |	You just don't know what's happening at the time you know the app
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,463	| IOT224 |	That you're using to maybe pair this
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:51,327	| IOT224 |	Device it's like spending and spending there's no notification so this is a huge
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,887	| IOT224 |	Huge benefit from a setup process
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,679	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| IOT224 |	This is
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,263	| IOT224 |	The second version of Z-Wave
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,799	| IOT224 |	Plus and Z-Wave Plus
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,567	| IOT224 |	Came out
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,895	| IOT224 |	April of 2 years ago actually
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,175	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,711	| IOT224 |	That was all about security
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,735	| IOT224 |	And securing your zeal
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,527	| IOT224 |	It's in this
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,295	| IOT224 |	SB
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| IOT224 |	Z-Wave Plus
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,599	| IOT224 |	Persian to Dido
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,903	| IOT224 |	It continues with that but
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,695	| IOT224 |	Basically those two things we talked about
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:22,303	| IOT224 |	Which is allowing you to more easily set up these devices
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| IOT224 |	Is WhatsApp
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,375	| IOT224 |	Sukhumvit Smart Start
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,191	| IOT224 |	Everything
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,727	| IOT224 |	It does
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| IOT224 |	In
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,007	| IOT224 |	Why not
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,799	| IOT224 |	Sounds a lot like summer
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,079	| IOT224 |	Other smart
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,871	| IOT224 |	Smart
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,383	| IOT224 |	Start
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,175	| IOT224 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,455	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,223	| IOT224 |	Look for that
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,503	| IOT224 |	Z-Wave device
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,831	| IOT224 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,599	| IOT224 |	Morphin
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:46,879	| IOT224 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,415	| IOT224 |	Scary hosp
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:48,927	| IOT224 |	Little news Kevin
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:55,839	| IOT224 |	Yeah it sounds scary in the surface and it's not a good thing but I don't think anybody's been actually hurt by this
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:59,167	| IOT224 |	Healthcare security firm cyber MDX
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:04,031	| IOT224 |	Has reported that the protocol and certain GE devices that
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| IOT224 |	AR
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,335	| IOT224 |	Used with
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,151	| IOT224 |	Anesthesia and respiratory machines
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,199	| IOT224 |	Can kind of be hot
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:13,759	| IOT224 |	Taxi very easy Homeland Security
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:17,087	| IOT224 |	Here in the US actually release an advisory saying with the flaws
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,647	| IOT224 |	Required low-level skill deck
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,159	| IOT224 |	Exploit
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:26,047	| IOT224 |	Basically if you know your way around terminal another ride commands you could silence alarms on the machines you could alter
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,559	| IOT224 |	The records
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:31,679	| IOT224 |	And this is the scariest part of it although again
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:35,519	| IOT224 |	I'm you could actually change the composition of
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,287	| IOT224 |	Aspirating
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,591	| IOT224 |	Gases in both of these devices which
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,895	| IOT224 |	I mean I guess you can make somebody
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,431	| IOT224 |	Sleep a lot longer or
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:48,063	| IOT224 |	I didn't want to go there but you could probably do that by removing other oxygen
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:48,831	| IOT224 |	I am the evil
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,183	| IOT224 |	Yeah so what
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:56,255	| IOT224 |	Not good she is actually said that
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:59,839	| IOT224 |	Yeah it knows about it and they said we determine that the
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:02,399	| IOT224 |	Potential implementation scenario
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:06,751	| IOT224 |	For such a hack doesn't really introduce clinical Hazard to direct patient risk
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,335	| IOT224 |	I don't know about that I continue to do something about this
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,383	| IOT224 |	Even if they do something
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,431	| IOT224 |	The medical is a tough
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,223	| IOT224 |	Because medical devices
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:20,319	| IOT224 |	Even if the device manufacturer Shoji in this case fixes it
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,647	| IOT224 |	An issues a patch may not actually
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,671	| IOT224 |	Download
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,767	| IOT224 |	In talking to both cesos at hospitals
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,327	| IOT224 |	Companies in the medical device space I am
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:35,167	| IOT224 |	Kind of appalled at the lack of rigor around
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| IOT224 |	Patching in
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,519	| IOT224 |	There I know for a fact that there are unpatched
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,567	| IOT224 |	Vulnerable devices in Benny
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,591	| IOT224 |	Us hospitals
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,895	| IOT224 |	Actually talk to somebody on the show
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,711	| IOT224 |	A few months back from a security firm who
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:48,991	| IOT224 |	He told us about
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| IOT224 |	A hospital that
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,087	| IOT224 |	Discovered one of their
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,647	| IOT224 |	Infusion pumps was
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,159	| IOT224 |	Hackable
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,951	| IOT224 |	And that
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,023	| IOT224 |	There was a vulnerability out there that
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,303	| IOT224 |	People were exploiting
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,095	| IOT224 |	And they had to actually put a nurse
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,167	| IOT224 |	Next to the patient who had that particular
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,935	| IOT224 |	Pump on the
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,727	| IOT224 |	At the time
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:14,079	| IOT224 |	They mistakenly use that pump and so then they had to have a whole person sitting there making sure that
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,103	| IOT224 |	The patient didn't die
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,127	| IOT224 |	Which
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,663	| IOT224 |	That is not scale
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,199	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,015	| IOT224 |	The only good news and
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| IOT224 |	I'm trying to make
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,807	| IOT224 |	Some good news out of this
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,367	| IOT224 |	Gaskin City hack
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,951	| IOT224 |	Is only on anesthesia devices sold prior to 2009
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,791	| IOT224 |	So that's a good thing however I know that
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:39,167	| IOT224 |	Devices don't get updated like every year in the hospital as well so I'm sure there's a bunch of these still out there
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,191	| IOT224 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,775	| IOT224 |	Alright let's move to something more fun
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,847	| IOT224 |	Let's talk about why there's two big updates
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,639	| IOT224 |	Trump lies
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| IOT224 |	One everyone got
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| IOT224 |	Or everyone should have
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,991	| IOT224 |	Is the availability of
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| IOT224 |	Person detection
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| IOT224 |	71a tells about the
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,111	| IOT224 |	I actually just
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:03,487	| IOT224 |	Updated the firmware on my wyze cam and I should say this is only for wyze cam version 2
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:07,327	| IOT224 |	Were the pancam that they sell so if you have the original wyzecam
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,607	| IOT224 |	You do not have this feature but
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| IOT224 |	Once you update your firmware
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,959	| IOT224 |	You get a new
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,775	| IOT224 |	Option to enable person detection
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:19,103	| IOT224 |	Which is powered by you say if they see cuz I
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,639	| IOT224 |	I don't want to
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:23,199	| IOT224 |	Axon or x n o r.
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,735	| IOT224 |	This is
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,807	| IOT224 |	On device person detection which is awesome
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,623	| IOT224 |	Something worth the edgemoore Machine Vision at the ads
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:33,183	| IOT224 |	So I have a wyzecam
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,719	| IOT224 |	Obviously because I update the firmware
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| IOT224 |	And I get
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,839	| IOT224 |	Tons of notifications so many that I turned it off because the motion detection
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,351	| IOT224 |	Trips
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:45,471	| IOT224 |	Notification system all the time and usually it's just a car driving by my house
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,519	| IOT224 |	I don't care really
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:53,151	| IOT224 |	Frankly about that I do want to know when there are people around my house or walking up to the house and that's a person detection will do
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| IOT224 |	And in fact
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:58,783	| IOT224 |	You can even just hit a button in the wyze cam app
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,295	| IOT224 |	Angie
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,831	| IOT224 |	Only see person
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,903	| IOT224 |	Notifications and events which is awesome so
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:07,743	| IOT224 |	I'm not going to be flooded with him and turn my notifications back on solely for person detection
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:11,583	| IOT224 |	Well and you know what you can also do they have an away mode in an honorable
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| IOT224 |	You can also
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,423	| IOT224 |	Organize your
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,495	| IOT224 |	Notifications by that so if your
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,007	| IOT224 |	In
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,823	| IOT224 |	Non away mode it won't send you anything
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,615	| IOT224 |	But when you click away
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,175	| IOT224 |	Since I'm really never away
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,991	| IOT224 |	Oh that is you
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:35,903	| IOT224 |	That's just me so what you're right for people who have normal life and leave the house everyday and come home
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:39,231	| IOT224 |	Good idea but for me I want the notifications all the time because I'm always home
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,047	| IOT224 |	That's right and if you're looking for people around
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| IOT224 |	Your house this makes much more
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,863	| IOT224 |	Alright I like him too
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,631	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,399	| IOT224 |	That's free
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,447	| IOT224 |	Just enable it on your wife
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| IOT224 |	The other thing
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,335	| IOT224 |	Is I was one of the early purchasers of their smartphone
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,127	| IOT224 |	So I got those yesterday
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,919	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,735	| IOT224 |	I paid a total of 4140
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,759	| IOT224 |	44 bulbs
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,271	| IOT224 |	The
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,575	| IOT224 |	Shipping and tax return
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,111	| IOT224 |	Yes tax and shipping
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,671	| IOT224 |	Your lists price is going to be 2999
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,743	| IOT224 |	And these are tunable White
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,279	| IOT224 |	Bulbs with dimmer
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,863	| IOT224 |	I set them up their wifi-enabled
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,655	| IOT224 |	So you can just have
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,215	| IOT224 |	Don't even think you need a wyze camera
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,263	| IOT224 |	I wouldn't think you need
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,287	| IOT224 |	Annie
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:26,591	| IOT224 |	Hanging Minister supported by
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,871	| IOT224 |	Matinee
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,919	| IOT224 |	The chi
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,479	| IOT224 |	You should be okay with that
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,063	| IOT224 |	I just occurred to me I'm like I have a wyze camera so I just
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,903	| IOT224 |	But when I set it up it was just a straight-up
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| IOT224 |	Install Wi-Fi bulbs so
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| IOT224 |	I put the bulbs in
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,583	| IOT224 |	They are lovely
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,863	| IOT224 |	The lake quality is good
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,191	| IOT224 |	The Deming quality is good I don't get Flickr
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,471	| IOT224 |	When I'm dipping
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:54,751	| IOT224 |	Lower
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,055	| IOT224 |	Did you hear any humming
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,663	| IOT224 |	Check right now
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,943	| IOT224 |	Let's all listen
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,455	| IOT224 |	Right now
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| IOT224 |	I don't hear any humming
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,927	| IOT224 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,207	| IOT224 |	So no humming
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,535	| IOT224 |	You can group your lights
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| IOT224 |	You can
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| IOT224 |	Do some weird schedule
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:25,215	| IOT224 |	So here's the thing this is Early Access I think everybody will be able to buy them at some
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,727	| IOT224 |	Point soon
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,007	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:29,823	| IOT224 |	I'm hoping we see a little bit more refinement here
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,871	| IOT224 |	Right now I can
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,919	| IOT224 |	Turn the lights off
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:38,271	| IOT224 |	Ouran after a certain number of hours but I can't schedule something like
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,039	| IOT224 |	Days and times
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,599	| IOT224 |	So that's a little weird for weird
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:42,879	| IOT224 |	It it's like
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,159	| IOT224 |	Turn them on
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,951	| IOT224 |	X number of hours and minutes
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,999	| IOT224 |	Not like turn them on at 8 a.m.
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,023	| IOT224 |	Sound like
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:53,119	| IOT224 |	8 a.m. would be 23 hours from now
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,655	| IOT224 |	So that's
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,167	| IOT224 |	Bizarro
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,191	| IOT224 |	But
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,727	| IOT224 |	They do let you
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:00,543	| IOT224 |	Do scenes so you can set your
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,359	| IOT224 |	I created a bright day and a
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| IOT224 |	Warm night
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,151	| IOT224 |	Scene
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:10,271	| IOT224 |	So and then I can activate those by talking to my Google assistant or Madam a
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,599	| IOT224 |	Because wise integrates with both of those
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,903	| IOT224 |	The other thing I can't do that surprised me
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,695	| IOT224 |	I have the wise sense sensors
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:20,511	| IOT224 |	And I was hoping to be able to
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:24,351	| IOT224 |	Do a motion detection because this is a much cheaper option than the
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| IOT224 |	My Hue motion.
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT224 |	Detection
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:29,215	| IOT224 |	So I was hoping to do it so like when the light
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:33,311	| IOT224 |	Either when motion is detected or when a contact sensor opened and closed
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,615	| IOT224 |	I would be able to turn the light on
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,895	| IOT224 |	And then also have it
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| IOT224 |	Turn off after certain time
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:38,943	| IOT224 |	Minutes
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,223	| IOT224 |	But I can't do that yet
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,575	| IOT224 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,087	| IOT224 |	Doesn't it
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:49,183	| IOT224 |	Because the sensors are not yet communicating with
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,487	| IOT224 |	And I don't know
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:56,095	| IOT224 |	The can't be a trigger event for anything but a notification
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| IOT224 |	Or
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,655	| IOT224 |	Turning the camera
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,423	| IOT224 |	Honor off
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,703	| IOT224 |	Right
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,471	| IOT224 |	Now
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,751	| IOT224 |	I can't do vacation
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:07,359	| IOT224 |	If I turn that on its going to turn my wise bulbs on and off so it looks like I'm
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,895	| IOT224 |	Which is nice
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,967	| IOT224 |	I find it weird that that's called vacation mode
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,015	| IOT224 |	Yen isn't part of away mode
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,039	| IOT224 |	But you know
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,063	| IOT224 |	I'm just going to roll with it
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| IOT224 |	Because I think this is early
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:21,183	| IOT224 |	Yeah it mean if you have Early Access end
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:24,255	| IOT224 |	The software and firmware updates just
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,047	| IOT224 |	Running to support this and also.
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,887	| IOT224 |	It sounds like there's still things in the works you could
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,263	| IOT224 |	Use the motion sensor
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| IOT224 |	Where
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| IOT224 |	EFT
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,847	| IOT224 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| IOT224 |	I'm trying to simplify my life here
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| IOT224 |	Are people I am not
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,175	| IOT224 |	I'm done with
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:48,063	| IOT224 |	I need native is always better and we'll talk about why a little bit actually another one of our top
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,879	| IOT224 |	Let's move on
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,159	| IOT224 |	Little bits of news
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,439	| IOT224 |	Hello
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:59,327	| IOT224 |	Yeah this is interesting on 95 Google routinely looks at Android app
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,375	| IOT224 |	Packages basically the software you install
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,911	| IOT224 |	It's called an APK file
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:06,751	| IOT224 |	They open these things up using Android studio and other
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,775	| IOT224 |	It's a software
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:10,079	| IOT224 |	And they look and see what's coming
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,847	| IOT224 |	Because
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,383	| IOT224 |	Google will usually
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:17,247	| IOT224 |	Put certain bits of information in there about future features to prepare for them
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:22,111	| IOT224 |	And the one I found was package detection which I love this I forget it
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,159	| IOT224 |	Package protection for nest hello
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,439	| IOT224 |	And what this
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:29,535	| IOT224 |	Will do according to the data that's currently in the nest hello
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,095	| IOT224 |	App with an s that I should say
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,631	| IOT224 |	Is it will
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:39,519	| IOT224 |	Tag your hello doorbell footage when it thinks a package was delivered and or picked up
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,079	| IOT224 |	So that's very cool because
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,127	| IOT224 |	Sometimes I get
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,967	| IOT224 |	Like I said before notifications too many notifications say from my cameras
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:53,855	| IOT224 |	When morning was actually very important but I can't tell the difference between
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,135	| IOT224 |	So this sounds awesome
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,159	| IOT224 |	It's
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,487	| IOT224 |	Not sure if this will come to pass or when it will
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,535	| IOT224 |	Looks like Google is actually working on it
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,071	| IOT224 |	Yay
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,703	| IOT224 |	Show me the nest aware subscription just so you know for this
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,263	| IOT224 |	Just just saying
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,407	| IOT224 |	Let's go for a cheaper
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,431	| IOT224 |	A less Rich option
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| IOT224 |	Ikea's
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| IOT224 |	Crabtree
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:27,391	| IOT224 |	I can't do it you guys I'm sorry for all the I can't people who listen or the Swedish people who listen
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,183	| IOT224 |	Tradfri
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:32,767	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,535	| IOT224 |	What do we have
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:40,447	| IOT224 |	We have some new products nootropic products a filament style light bulb
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,519	| IOT224 |	That's either a19 or e26
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,079	| IOT224 |	A19 is the normal light bulb size
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,127	| IOT224 |	The king 826 is
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:52,735	| IOT224 |	Itsy 26
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| IOT224 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,343	| IOT224 |	So the bulb
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,903	| IOT224 |	$16 has three different color temperatures
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,279	| IOT224 |	Temps on porch light
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:09,119	| IOT224 |	806 lumens of brightness obviously works with the chakra system
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,167	| IOT224 |	Also a candelabra
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:13,727	| IOT224 |	E12 base color and white light bulb
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,263	| IOT224 |	$30
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT224 |	Yowza
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:17,823	| IOT224 |	That's expensive
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,615	| IOT224 |	Answer
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,407	| IOT224 |	I know
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,943	| IOT224 |	I know but they're so small
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,759	| IOT224 |	You should be paying less for that topic
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,807	| IOT224 |	Anyway and one other
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:30,879	| IOT224 |	Interesting I'm going to say this wrong when interesting product
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:34,975	| IOT224 |	The float float alt maybe it's blowout
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| IOT224 |	Light panels
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:40,095	| IOT224 |	They're similar to what maybe like Nana race mix
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:41,887	| IOT224 |	They're bigger
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,215	| IOT224 |	Have all the cool fancy pictures of Natalie
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| IOT224 |	Can house
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:50,335	| IOT224 |	But they so you can get a square Light Panel 12 by 12 for $70
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,615	| IOT224 |	You would like it
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:55,199	| IOT224 |	Square white panel is 129
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:58,783	| IOT224 |	And then finally a 12 x 35 inch panel also for 129
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:03,647	| IOT224 |	So against three different color temperatures Warm Glow Warm White and cool White
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,951	| IOT224 |	Nice
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,999	| IOT224 |	I think with those kind of light panels I think
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,023	| IOT224 |	Colors are super
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,071	| IOT224 |	But that's cuz I use mine
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:11,839	| IOT224 |	Art installation
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:18,751	| IOT224 |	Yeah we have the microphone as well which of the light panels change colors based on what it hears
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,543	| IOT224 |	Yo
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,079	| IOT224 |	Okay so
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,103	| IOT224 |	I should tell you
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:26,175	| IOT224 |	The wise light bulbs are 800 lumens for
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,967	| IOT224 |	For the people who are counting their lumens
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,247	| IOT224 |	So there
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,783	| IOT224 |	But they're cheaper
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,063	| IOT224 |	Yay
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,343	| IOT224 |	What's cheaper
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:36,927	| IOT224 |	They're not homekit compatible but the freezer
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,767	| IOT224 |	All right
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,303	| IOT224 |	Brighter homekit compatible
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,607	| IOT224 |	Adjust the to nobility
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,119	| IOT224 |	Is
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,143	| IOT224 |	Truncated
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,471	| IOT224 |	Slightly slightly joinable
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,543	| IOT224 |	Fully dimmable
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,591	| IOT224 |	Alright so
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,895	| IOT224 |	Next up also doorbell news
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,991	| IOT224 |	Exciting doorbell news if you are a member of the ADT

EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:05,855	| IOT224 |	Program I don't run
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,927	| IOT224 |	Lifeshield is
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,463	| IOT224 |	A
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,743	| IOT224 |	DIY
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:16,095	| IOT224 |	Program for ADT that lets you buy products connector products
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,375	| IOT224 |	Dual monitor
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,143	| IOT224 |	Bring in that sort of thing
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:22,751	| IOT224 |	They have released a new HD video doorbell
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:26,079	| IOT224 |	Yay has 2-way audio
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,615	| IOT224 |	It has people detection
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:34,271	| IOT224 |	It has 180 HD resolution video 170 degrees weidler
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,063	| IOT224 |	That's actually pretty good
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:36,831	| IOT224 |	Many stop it
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:37,855	| IOT224 |	35 or 1/4
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,647	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,671	| IOT224 |	You can
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,207	| IOT224 |	Locations in
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,743	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,023	| IOT224 |	It's not cheap
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,047	| IOT224 |	It's not
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,071	| IOT224 |	How much is it
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,143	| IOT224 |	It's $200
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,959	| IOT224 |	That's that's pretty money in the nest hello is
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,239	| IOT224 |	Isn't that true
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,799	| IOT224 |	Where is one more expensive
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:58,079	| IOT224 |	But it also works
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,383	| IOT224 |	System
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,735	| IOT224 |	Right now you can get the nest hello for 189
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,271	| IOT224 |	There you go
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:11,391	| IOT224 |	If you want it if you want to try the doorbell do anything with
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:14,207	| IOT224 |	The lifeshield HD video don't you have to use
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:14,975	| IOT224 |	If it's from that
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,255	| IOT224 |	Can
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,023	| IOT224 |	Really do much
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,351	| IOT224 |	So if you've already
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,631	| IOT224 |	He got your own system
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,935	| IOT224 |	Maybe deal with either ringer
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,239	| IOT224 |	Nest
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,263	| IOT224 |	PayPal Amazon
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT224 |	It pains me to say that
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,663	| IOT224 |	Depending on Amazon
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:35,967	| IOT224 |	But
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,759	| IOT224 |	Speaking of Google
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,575	| IOT224 |	Let's talk about local home
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,599	| IOT224 |	Control
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,695	| IOT224 |	Yes and this gets back to what I said earlier about Native
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,975	| IOT224 |	Voice type
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:50,815	| IOT224 |	Activities at Rio Google IO back in May
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,607	| IOT224 |	They showed off
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:56,191	| IOT224 |	Renounce I guess I should say they're local SDK
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:58,239	| IOT224 |	Basically what that does is
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:02,847	| IOT224 |	It's a way for device makers in the Google ecosystem Google St
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,151	| IOT224 |	2
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,687	| IOT224 |	Allowed
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,711	| IOT224 |	Local
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,991	| IOT224 |	Processing of
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,039	| IOT224 |	Smart home commands
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,319	| IOT224 |	Weed States and so on
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:18,976	| IOT224 |	So what that means is instead of going out to the cloud every time to process language in commands
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,256	| IOT224 |	Which can take some time
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,072	| IOT224 |	It'll happen Basie on a
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT224 |	Google home device
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,376	| IOT224 |	Somebody
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:29,216	| IOT224 |	Previews out now they've already announced the early Partners which is
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| IOT224 |	GE
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:33,056	| IOT224 |	Lifx Philips Hue tp-link and WeMo
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:35,872	| IOT224 |	None of those Partners have announced any local home support yet
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:40,224	| IOT224 |	Although I'm sure they got access to this before the developer preview in life
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| IOT224 |	This week
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,064	| IOT224 |	So hopefully very soon we will
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,112	| IOT224 |	See local home commands
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,416	| IOT224 |	I would fall back to the cloud
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,208	| IOT224 |	In the Google home ecosystem
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,792	| IOT224 |	I'm hoping I'm going to see if I can find some time to try
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,608	| IOT224 |	INXS one of the apis for one of these
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,144	| IOT224 |	Device makers and
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,936	| IOT224 |	Actually test it and time
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,264	| IOT224 |	The local versus the cloud-based commands
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,312	| IOT224 |	Nice alright
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:09,152	| IOT224 |	If it's anything based on like Google's local voice transcription
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,432	| IOT224 |	That is so much faster in
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,456	| IOT224 |	It's so cool
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,248	| IOT224 |	I'm serious
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,528	| IOT224 |	All right
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,040	| IOT224 |	And now
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,624	| IOT224 |	I thanks to a wonderful listener thing
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| IOT224 |	I have been testing an echo
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,720	| IOT224 |	Auto
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:26,048	| IOT224 |	Which I had wanted forever because I wanted the Amazon Echo in
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,560	| IOT224 |	In my car
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:30,912	| IOT224 |	My car happens to be a Tesla which is not play nicely with a lot of the other
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,728	| IOT224 |	Android 8 doesn't play nice with Android auto
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:34,752	| IOT224 |	Or
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:35,776	| IOT224 |	What's the other one
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,104	| IOT224 |	Are plecos like apples something
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:45,760	| IOT224 |	And so I was like really excited because I constantly I have questions like I'm thinking in the car and I'm like
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:49,088	| IOT224 |	What was that what date was that
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:50,880	| IOT224 |	Battle of
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,672	| IOT224 |	How many teeth does a cat have
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,696	| IOT224 |	Yeah just
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| IOT224 |	Just silly question
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:58,816	| IOT224 |	I don't mind just never sleeps
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,352	| IOT224 |	It shouldn't sleep I'm driving okay
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,656	| IOT224 |	So I tested this out
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,960	| IOT224 |	It works basically from your phone
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:08,288	| IOT224 |	So it creates a constant Bluetooth connection to your phone
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:12,640	| IOT224 |	And what it does is it allows you to do
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,176	| IOT224 |	Calling
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:18,016	| IOT224 |	Send text messages and it has all the basic features of Madame a so I can
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,296	| IOT224 |	The weather icon
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,576	| IOT224 |	Commute times I can ask
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,160	| IOT224 |	Keep the cat hats
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:27,232	| IOT224 |	So all of that is available now
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,000	| IOT224 |	In my car
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,792	| IOT224 |	And it
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,072	| IOT224 |	Also
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:35,680	| IOT224 |	Hook me up to Spotify and granted I had this in my car cuz I have a Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,448	| IOT224 |	Connection to my phone
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,496	| IOT224 |	But it's really cool cuz
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:42,080	| IOT224 |	In might and I drive a Tesla so in my Tesla I can say
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,896	| IOT224 |	I press a button on my steering wheel and I say
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,408	| IOT224 |	Play
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,712	| IOT224 |	Mega Sonic on El Toro by Rosalie
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:48,992	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,528	| IOT224 |	It will
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,040	| IOT224 |	Play that
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,064	| IOT224 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,344	| IOT224 |	It's a little nip
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:57,440	| IOT224 |	It's a little fussy and it doesn't work from Spotify it works from
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,976	| IOT224 |	Different service
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,768	| IOT224 |	Recall the name of the service
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,792	| IOT224 |	The comes with the Tesla
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| IOT224 |	But now
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,352	| IOT224 |	I just say
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,632	| IOT224 |	Matinee
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,912	| IOT224 |	Play Con El Torah
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:07,936	| IOT224 |	And
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:12,032	| IOT224 |	You don't have to have to hit the voice button on your steering wheel for that
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:15,616	| IOT224 |	I don't hit the voice button and it's pulling from Spotify
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,384	| IOT224 |	Which is
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,200	| IOT224 |	Awesome because I'm already at
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,992	| IOT224 |	Like I prefer Spotify to whatever
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:24,832	| IOT224 |	The Tesla has because it doesn't always play the song he wants sometimes a try something
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:25,856	| IOT224 |	Close to it
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,416	| IOT224 |	So yeah
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,184	| IOT224 |	I was really excited
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,208	| IOT224 |	Unleavened
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,744	| IOT224 |	The downside
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,536	| IOT224 |	The cost the cost is not downside itsfunneh
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,840	| IOT224 |	The downside is
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:36,864	| IOT224 |	I'm having trouble
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:40,192	| IOT224 |	It's only works when my phone is in the
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:40,704	| IOT224 |	Car repair
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,800	| IOT224 |	Amazon says I can bring in
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,080	| IOT224 |	Another phone
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,616	| IOT224 |	Like my partner's phone for example
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,920	| IOT224 |	And it will pair two
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,432	| IOT224 |	His phone
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:53,504	| IOT224 |	It basically connects to the last phone that was in the
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,552	| IOT224 |	Car with most bones are present
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:58,880	| IOT224 |	Into parrot you're supposed to be able to say
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,648	| IOT224 |	Madam a
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,672	| IOT224 |	Pair
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,488	| IOT224 |	That does not seem to work
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,256	| IOT224 |	At this moment
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,048	| IOT224 |	In time so we have not been able to
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:06,560	| IOT224 |	Parrot yet
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,584	| IOT224 |	To his phone
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,656	| IOT224 |	But theoretically it's possible
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,192	| IOT224 |	When I figure out why this isn't work
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,240	| IOT224 |	I'll let y'all know
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,056	| IOT224 |	Or if you have paired to phone successfully
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:20,128	| IOT224 |	I don't think that's a huge
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:26,016	| IOT224 |	Issue though because typically if it's your car you're the primary driver you want this
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,040	| IOT224 |	Echo 2
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:31,904	| IOT224 |	Be connected to your phone if I'm a passenger I can open up my matinee happen
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:34,720	| IOT224 |	Hit a button and do all the same things when I'm not driving
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,000	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:38,816	| IOT224 |	I don't think it's a huge issue but maybe others will disagree
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,376	| IOT224 |	I just think the seamlessness is now
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| IOT224 |	Nice when you think you could just
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,424	| IOT224 |	Walk-in in
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,960	| IOT224 |	Works for you in it
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,240	| IOT224 |	We also share
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,264	| IOT224 |	Like if you share a car
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:50,592	| IOT224 |	Which we do cuz all right we've been electric in
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,616	| IOT224 |	Combustible
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,944	| IOT224 |	Gatsby c i c e
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,272	| IOT224 |	And so we tend to drive the elect
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,296	| IOT224 |	Vehicle whatever we
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,320	| IOT224 |	Cancel
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,856	| IOT224 |	We don't have to get gas
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,648	| IOT224 |	But that's just us
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:07,488	| IOT224 |	It's a little specific but I know there's lots of people who do share
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,536	| IOT224 |	Like a minivan with all the car seats in
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,072	| IOT224 |	Those people probably
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:13,120	| IOT224 |	Don't trade the car seats out all the time anyway
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| IOT224 |	Know that going in
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,216	| IOT224 |	When I figure out how to solve that
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,752	| IOT224 |	I will let you know it'll probably be up
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,288	| IOT224 |	It's part of my exhaustive review
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| IOT224 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,128	| IOT224 |	Okay and Kevin
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,408	| IOT224 |	Now
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,456	| IOT224 |	I feel like it's time for the voice mail what do you think
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,760	| IOT224 |	I think so
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,528	| IOT224 |	All right

EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:22,240	| IOT224 |	This week we have a question from Jerry
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,800	| IOT224 |	Who's looking for a smart
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,568	| IOT224 |	Button
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,080	| IOT224 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,192	| IOT224 |	Palatable
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| IOT224 |	With my day
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,544	| IOT224 |	All right Sherry
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:57,824	| IOT224 |	Actually
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:01,920	| IOT224 |	You already have most of what you need because you said you have SmartThings if you want
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,456	| IOT224 |	A button for scenes
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,504	| IOT224 |	Samsung actually makes a SmartThings button
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,552	| IOT224 |	It works topically natively with
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,344	| IOT224 |	The SmartThings Hub that you have
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,392	| IOT224 |	Cost $15
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,184	| IOT224 |	Which is not too expensive
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:18,560	| IOT224 |	And you can program it to do whatever you like could be for seeing that could be for
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,608	| IOT224 |	Turning lights on and off
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,656	| IOT224 |	Anything that you would like to program
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,192	| IOT224 |	So that's
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,984	| IOT224 |	Actually the way I would go
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:31,104	| IOT224 |	I originally had thought about the fibaro button just cuz it's a really nice-looking button
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,384	| IOT224 |	Looks more like a button
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| IOT224 |	But
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,432	| IOT224 |	It's not
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:39,040	| IOT224 |	Natively supported that I know of you may have to install like a separate device Handler for SmartThings for that
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:43,904	| IOT224 |	Probably wouldn't bother that I would just go out and spend 15 bucks on the
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:47,232	| IOT224 |	On the Samsung SmartThings button
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,280	| IOT224 |	You can even have a bunch of different
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:52,608	| IOT224 |	Actions on it like a double click does one thing a single click does another
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:56,704	| IOT224 |	Press and hold or something else so one button can do multiple things for her
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,520	| IOT224 |	I was going to offer an even more expensive option
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,800	| IOT224 |	Just because that's me
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,360	| IOT224 |	Especially if you have a lot of
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,896	| IOT224 |	Of things this Airtech
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:05,920	| IOT224 |	They make a lot of
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:07,712	| IOT224 |	Z-Wave stuff
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,760	| IOT224 |	They sell a Z-Wave button
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:16,160	| IOT224 |	That is their minimote to it is $45 but you can control 8 scenes
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:19,488	| IOT224 |	If you have eight whole scenes and you don't want to buy
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,792	| IOT224 |	History of the SmartThings buttons
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,328	| IOT224 |	Actually that's the same
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,096	| IOT224 |	Cost so
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,632	| IOT224 |	I really don't know why you would buy this
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,912	| IOT224 |	Let's just go
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:30,240	| IOT224 |	Like I really flummox but if you want
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:33,312	| IOT224 |	A smart button that is a reliable smart button
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,080	| IOT224 |	I've used it
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,944	| IOT224 |	Control
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:40,992	| IOT224 |	Actually the problem I have with
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT224 |	The smart button
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,272	| IOT224 |	Is
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,552	| IOT224 |	A lot of them
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,088	| IOT224 |	Control many scenes and then I can
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,600	| IOT224 |	Never forget what
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,880	| IOT224 |	I'm supposed to be like
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:50,208	| IOT224 |	4 klicks plus a right click + left click in a shake
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:50,976	| IOT224 |	Turn these lights on
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,024	| IOT224 |	I just go with voice
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:57,632	| IOT224 |	But this one is rechargeable
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:02,496	| IOT224 |	So you can either recharge it via a USB which is nice or there's a battery
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:07,872	| IOT224 |	And I don't know about the SmartThings one if it's rechargeable but you could end up buying a lot of battery
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,640	| IOT224 |	Hibiscus
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,432	| IOT224 |	Using a smart button is fun
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,200	| IOT224 |	And you tend
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,480	| IOT224 |	Run out the battery in
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,528	| IOT224 |	I think I run out my battery in
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,576	| IOT224 |	Bees in about 6 months
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:19,136	| IOT224 |	Probably this is a rechargeable battery
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,208	| IOT224 |	Cr2450 battery replace
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,000	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,024	| IOT224 |	Those are your options
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,840	| IOT224 |	There's tons of Z-Wave buttons out there there's tons of zika
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,608	| IOT224 |	B button spec
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,400	| IOT224 |	If you have SmartThings you have that
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,704	| IOT224 |	Enjoy
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,984	| IOT224 |	Let us know actually what you
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,544	| IOT224 |	I'm curious if anyone buys the
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:41,152	| IOT224 |	All right that feels pretty good for
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:43,968	| IOT224 |	This week show please stay tuned

EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:52,928	| IOT224 |	How companies were trying to sell their products as a service can match their revenue stream
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:57,024	| IOT224 |	Dreams in the future and the role of insurance on the
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,304	| IOT224 |	Corporate Industrial
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,584	| IOT224 |	Coyote size
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:00,608	| IOT224 |	So
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,656	| IOT224 |	All of that and more
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,424	| IOT224 |	Is coming up
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:07,776	| IOT224 |	After a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:14,176	| IOT224 |	Hey everyone we are taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:16,736	| IOT224 |	Is Dell Technologies and I have
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,016	| IOT224 |	Craig Wetzel
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:20,320	| IOT224 |	Who is director of iot channels
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,344	| IOT224 |	Intel
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:24,416	| IOT224 |	Here to talk to you about their relationship with Dell
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:30,304	| IOT224 |	So Intel Works closely with Dell Technologies as they've been building their Edge and iot business for the last few
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,608	| IOT224 |	How would you describe that partnership
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,912	| IOT224 |	Saudi Dell Intel relationship
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:37,472	| IOT224 |	Has had a long history success
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:42,592	| IOT224 |	Starting with the first PCS that Michael Dell created in his dorm room we've worked together on
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,384	| IOT224 |	Desktops in
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:48,480	| IOT224 |	Servers and Anna conversion for structures in Cloud Solutions in
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,016	| IOT224 |	Together along this journey
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:52,064	| IOT224 |	It's been very tight-knit and close
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:54,112	| IOT224 |	And now we're moving into the iot
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,392	| IOT224 |	SeaWorld together
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,952	| IOT224 |	And this engagement with Delta critical one
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,000	| IOT224 |	Specifically when we collaborate a Numark
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:00,512	| IOT224 |	It's like a coyote
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:03,328	| IOT224 |	Dell has their seven individual companies
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:07,680	| IOT224 |	And David able to use the technology to create function-specific capabilities
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,216	| IOT224 |	Stickley brought together
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,240	| IOT224 |	To make complete list
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,008	| IOT224 |	Solutions
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:14,080	| IOT224 |	As you know iot Solutions aren't created using a
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,848	| IOT224 |	Single
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:21,248	| IOT224 |	Electronic Solutions are created by different layers of technology and products coming together which allow customer not just
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,016	| IOT224 |	To collect data
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,040	| IOT224 |	But use it for businesses
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:26,624	| IOT224 |	With Dell we have partnered with an organization that has the
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:30,464	| IOT224 |	Key infrastructure and capabilities to which our partners and customers
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,512	| IOT224 |	Can add that analytics another pieces
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:34,048	| IOT224 |	Jamaica complete solution
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:39,680	| IOT224 |	Can you give us an example of where Dylan and tell if collaborated to deliver a solution into the iot market
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:43,264	| IOT224 |	Actually let me give you two examples of our joining key
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,824	| IOT224 |	In one case Dylan until work
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,848	| IOT224 |	Together with a large
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:47,616	| IOT224 |	US city
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:50,176	| IOT224 |	Templum in a situational awareness solution
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,736	| IOT224 |	It will allow the city to implement a matrix
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:54,784	| IOT224 |	Cue components from cameras to servers
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:56,064	| IOT224 |	To collect and analyze data
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:59,136	| IOT224 |	Those analytics create actions that provide one
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,440	| IOT224 |	AC4 living and working condition for residence
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:05,280	| IOT224 |	To better management planning for infrastructure improvements
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,328	| IOT224 |	Reduce pedestrian-vehicle traffic
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,352	| IOT224 |	+ 3
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:11,424	| IOT224 |	Provide additional analytic insights that were needed to make better
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:16,032	| IOT224 |	By the city's urban planners in short the collaboration improve the lives of
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,312	| IOT224 |	The city's residents today
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| IOT224 |	And for years to come
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT224 |	And the second reason
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:23,968	| IOT224 |	Still work with the US based entertainment company to develop a solution for their golfing
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:30,624	| IOT224 |	This solution allows a golfer to analyze their swing real time and make adjustments immediately on the driving range
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:36,000	| IOT224 |	This example of collaboration by Dell and Intel enable this us retailer to write Cutting Edge
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:37,792	| IOT224 |	Experiences for their golfers in
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,888	| IOT224 |	And what does Intel see is the main barrier of adoption
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:45,472	| IOT224 |	And iot market and how are Intel and Dell working together
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,240	| IOT224 |	To break through that barrier
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,544	| IOT224 |	Weixin incredible interest from comp
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:51,104	| IOT224 |	But almost all of them are struggling with
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:55,712	| IOT224 |	How can we turn data into actionable information that drives meaningful business outcomes
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,504	| IOT224 |	We are working with Delta
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,552	| IOT224 |	Deploy solutions that allow for Analytics
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,600	| IOT224 |	To happen where it matters
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,368	| IOT224 |	While it matters
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,904	| IOT224 |	And often this is at
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:10,560	| IOT224 |	By moving analytics closer to the point of data collection introduces latency improve real-time responses
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT224 |	And relieves Demand on network bandwidth
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:19,520	| IOT224 |	Thank you Craig and where can we go to find out more about the packages that Intel has created for the Internet of Things

EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:19,072	| IOT224 |	And said hey you know if you can really make things smart
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,608	| IOT224 |	We have
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:25,472	| IOT224 |	4 million Dixon industrial think that we would love to make smart
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:26,752	| IOT224 |	And get intelligence
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:35,968	| IOT224 |	Compressor
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:37,504	| IOT224 |	Today I mean
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,600	| IOT224 |	Equipment breakdown insurance
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,696	| IOT224 |	I did not know
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,536	| IOT224 |	They have 1600 + PhD
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,328	| IOT224 |	Likely right models
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,864	| IOT224 |	Do understand equipment failure
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,912	| IOT224 |	Cisco's all these models
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:37:01,056	| IOT224 |	Coyote
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,848	| IOT224 |	Real-time data
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,408	| IOT224 |	Starting to put in the Bible
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,688	| IOT224 |	Better Solutions
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,712	| IOT224 |	That would be
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,992	| IOT224 |	Viniq liqueur
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:13,088	| IOT224 |	So you don't eat with us for three years really like what you doing
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:17,184	| IOT224 |	Nimble iot
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:20,256	| IOT224 |	Independence
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:26,656	| IOT224 |	Prospectors but we have the luxury of having the credibility in the balance sheet of the day
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:29,728	| IOT224 |	How do we help the other industrial companies to do similar
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:32,032	| IOT224 |	Equipment breakdown that equipment breakdown
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,616	| IOT224 |	Electrical terminal service
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:39,712	| IOT224 |	Real data
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,992	| IOT224 |	Disconnected products
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,784	| IOT224 |	Better
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:44,832	| IOT224 |	Or prevent failures
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:49,696	| IOT224 |	Alright so let's dig into that because the first thing I would think of
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,976	| IOT224 |	When
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:55,072	| IOT224 |	Listening to what you do is why do we need an insurance element
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:59,168	| IOT224 |	I'm in a lot of ways this is a deal between to come
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,936	| IOT224 |	Kinesis is the
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:03,008	| IOT224 |	Equipment provider saying here you go
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:06,336	| IOT224 |	This is going to work and when it breaks down I'm going to know in advance
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,616	| IOT224 |	So I will
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,896	| IOT224 |	Send someone out proactive
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,664	| IOT224 |	Italy to fix it
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,968	| IOT224 |	Until it feels like a two-party relationship
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:13,760	| IOT224 |	Adding insurance why it is that needed
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:18,624	| IOT224 |	The first element of whether risk prevention happens on insurance
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:22,976	| IOT224 |	Perspective
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,768	| IOT224 |	Connecting a product and making it
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:29,376	| IOT224 |	Smart and connected are not sure if this is working then I'm sure they should invest
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:31,936	| IOT224 |	And that's the delivery warranties
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:36,544	| IOT224 |	Are almost giving the peace of mind for these equipment manufacturers that
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,848	| IOT224 |	They can go to this digital transformation
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,384	| IOT224 |	And this would work
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:46,528	| IOT224 |	He can't get it out of school old school machines like more than Thompson in a boilers give them a lot of confidence
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,392	| IOT224 |	II
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:39:01,888	| IOT224 |	All services equipment I will guarantee you up time but you know because it's new to them
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,960	| IOT224 |	You're somebody else will that be playing
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:06,752	| IOT224 |	Northeast Equipment Sales
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:10,080	| IOT224 |	You're so confident that it will actually pay you money
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:17,760	| IOT224 |	That should be the two areas when insurance comes out to be a teacher
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:21,088	| IOT224 |	Excellent so we are going to get you those examples in a minute
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:25,184	| IOT224 |	But let's dig into one of the elements hair which is always fascinated
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,232	| IOT224 |	Which is this idea that
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:30,304	| IOT224 |	If I am a small to medium-sized manufacturer
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,352	| IOT224 |	And I'm making a pick-and-place machine
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,656	| IOT224 |	And now I'm selling it as a service
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,936	| IOT224 |	What happens is
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:38,240	| IOT224 |	I'm taking something that used to be
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,264	| IOT224 |	Big lump sum
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,032	| IOT224 |	Peanut
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,568	| IOT224 |	And now it's going to be
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:43,104	| IOT224 |	Paid out over time
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:48,480	| IOT224 |	And if you're Amazon in doing something like that or one of the big companies maybe you have a capital to do that
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,272	| IOT224 |	But if you're a smaller
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,040	| IOT224 |	Company
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:53,600	| IOT224 |	It seems impossible you can't turn hay
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:56,672	| IOT224 |	Products business into a Services business overnight
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:40:00,512	| IOT224 |	The cost of making the product and then your incoming Revenue stream
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,536	| IOT224 |	Just don't match up
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:03,328	| IOT224 |	So is there a way for you guys to
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,352	| IOT224 |	Open that
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:08,704	| IOT224 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:15,104	| IOT224 |	Perspective
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,640	| IOT224 |	Spotify
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:22,784	| IOT224 |	I think it did something old school records our kids know we're saying that in a why not the stuffed every other Market
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:28,160	| IOT224 |	Discuss the big challenge with you talk about it be that expensive capital
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:31,232	| IOT224 |	So then been going off the expense of Capital Equipment
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,256	| IOT224 |	Like you just said
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,536	| IOT224 |	I got a big check up song
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,584	| IOT224 |	Lost equipment sale
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,632	| IOT224 |	The disadvantage of course is that
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,680	| IOT224 |	I only get that check maybe 10 years
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:46,080	| IOT224 |	Leader again and then it's kind of weird that I don't touch my customer for
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:46,848	| IOT224 |	Aneurysm
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:54,784	| IOT224 |	I was making a million dollars at Frankford and she treatment plant
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,832	| IOT224 |	Equipment
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,160	| IOT224 |	And then suddenly Out start making on a 200000 a year
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,464	| IOT224 |	Which is great over 10 years
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,744	| IOT224 |	But it's not great
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,536	| IOT224 |	Because we won by
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:09,632	| IOT224 |	Unsteady Capital heavy are large balance sheet organization
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:11,424	| IOT224 |	Is some balance sheet the engineering tools
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,984	| IOT224 |	They want to do is be take the assets
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:16,288	| IOT224 |	Eliza manufactures an art books
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:21,408	| IOT224 |	Create an object 70 model for the End customer temporary
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:24,736	| IOT224 |	Like I said you don't want us to customers see this working
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:28,832	| IOT224 |	They get the money upfront and of course you know that there is some cost
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:32,672	| IOT224 |	They understand that the market will expand because the
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:34,976	| IOT224 |	And you leave the state
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,256	| IOT224 |	It would just not get it
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:44,448	| IOT224 |	In the middle
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:48,288	| IOT224 |	It's which the good news is that a lot of companies which I make Market on North
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:50,336	| IOT224 |	Publicly traded
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:53,919	| IOT224 |	So I'll look at it as a concern is not as much concern to show
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:56,223	| IOT224 |	Explain it to the market
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:42:00,575	| IOT224 |	I mean that's that's how we being sold
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:02,367	| IOT224 |	Technology
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:04,671	| IOT224 |	Without getting this data out of these.
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:11,071	| IOT224 |	On top of that we can do some Dollar Tree flea engineering to give them tomorrow
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:13,887	| IOT224 |	Transition it to me and still get that money up front
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:17,215	| IOT224 |	I just found myself and my leaving company
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,687	| IOT224 |	A hundred thousand a year I'll give you the heat treatment plant
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT224 |	Animal getting beat up time
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:32,063	| IOT224 |	Very compelling value prop
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:38,207	| IOT224 |	Excellent and what is the things that I thought was really intriguing about
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,231	| IOT224 |	Having
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:42,047	| IOT224 |	You guys involved in the financial insurance side
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:47,167	| IOT224 |	Was how it helps make small to medium-sized businesses a real player in this market
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:49,215	| IOT224 |	Can you elaborate Maybe by giving an example
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:54,591	| IOT224 |	One of the examples close to my heart is the small company Taco Barn
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:57,407	| IOT224 |	Public case study the UK
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:04,319	| IOT224 |	This is a company that sells very specialized CNC machines are diamond polishing and grinding
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:07,391	| IOT224 |	These machines cost anywhere from 300 to 400 thousand
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:09,951	| IOT224 |	Svn customers using cider
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:16,351	| IOT224 |	Gemstones
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:16,863	| IOT224 |	Spectre
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:27,615	| IOT224 |	But the challenge was twofold one
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:31,967	| IOT224 |	10-second was really missing out on the smaller Target segments
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,759	| IOT224 |	The smaller binder sometimes
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,551	| IOT224 |	Don't want to be that 400000
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,343	| IOT224 |	Grunt when they don't know their Market
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:40,671	| IOT224 |	Zoeva B&B NSB
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:42,975	| IOT224 |	Create an offer now we're Coburn
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,791	| IOT224 |	Machines
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,839	| IOT224 |	And that coupon care is there
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:51,935	| IOT224 |	These machines are interested in
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,959	| IOT224 |	Peter collection
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:55,775	| IOT224 |	Secrets in particular groups on top of that
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:58,847	| IOT224 |	Which is sold as a fixed price service
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:02,687	| IOT224 |	13 certain versions of that be also getting PDF.
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:04,223	| IOT224 |	Coupon machine
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:05,759	| IOT224 |	Uptime guarantee
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:11,391	| IOT224 |	And give the end customers of penalty or like a better word it's a machine.
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:14,463	| IOT224 |	So that's the first way there cuz I'm going to Market
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| IOT224 |	Hey you know
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:23,935	| IOT224 |	If you have Coban care and Coburn together instead of buying a $400,000 machine
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,983	| IOT224 |	6000 a month
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,263	| IOT224 |	Mayport base
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,543	| IOT224 |	Utilisation
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:32,383	| IOT224 |	Like I said the financial engineering of taking these
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,407	| IOT224 |	Kubernetes
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:36,223	| IOT224 |	Used books
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:37,759	| IOT224 |	Thousand
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:41,343	| IOT224 |	The biggest mistake by the 6018 elation
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:42,879	| IOT224 |	Everybody makes money if
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,647	| IOT224 |	They use more
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,183	| IOT224 |	But also
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,999	| IOT224 |	In the Sky 5000b iot plays because
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:55,423	| IOT224 |	And besides guarantee eternity acid
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:58,495	| IOT224 |	This is the other beauty of having your own iot connect
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:07,455	| IOT224 |	Aftermarket Revenue with Services which is never that before
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,479	| IOT224 |	As well as
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:12,575	| IOT224 |	Opex model do really expand the market
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:17,951	| IOT224 |	So let's talk about elevators and you guys are helping some of the smaller operators
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:20,511	| IOT224 |	On the insurance site so can you talk to us about
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,023	| IOT224 |	What you're doing there
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:24,351	| IOT224 |	Interesting
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,887	| IOT224 |	The smallest service providers
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:27,935	| IOT224 |	Not the dog Force
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:34,335	| IOT224 |	But you know who serviced a lot of the older elevators after the contract with the oldest ocean that expires
