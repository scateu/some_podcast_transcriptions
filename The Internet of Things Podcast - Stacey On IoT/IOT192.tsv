EDL	00:00:08,960	00:00:11,264	| IOT192 |	Everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:12,032	| IOT192 |	This is your house
EDL	00:00:12,032	00:00:13,824	| IOT192 |	Stacey Higginbotham and Jericho
EDL	00:00:14,336	00:00:14,848	| IOT192 |	Kevin tofu
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,384	| IOT192 |	And today
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:18,688	| IOT192 |	We have an awesome show for you
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:20,224	| IOT192 |	We are going to be talking
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:20,992	| IOT192 |	Talking about
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:22,784	| IOT192 |	Actually sensors on planes
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:26,624	| IOT192 |	All of the AWS iot news that we have
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:27,392	| IOT192 |	So far
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:28,928	| IOT192 |	The ocf
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:31,744	| IOT192 |	Iot standard is now an ISO standard
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:33,280	| IOT192 |	And could we have crammed more accurate
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:36,096	| IOT192 |	I don't know we'll see when we talk about it later
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:36,864	| IOT192 |	Mg
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:41,472	| IOT192 |	We did all right we've got a new Google Assistant
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:42,240	| IOT192 |	Speaker
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:46,336	| IOT192 |	Kevin's going to talk about smart robots and Jarvis he's building his own Jarvis
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,384	| IOT192 |	And it's cute
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:49,152	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:50,432	| IOT192 |	We've got an update
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:52,992	| IOT192 |	On Amazon smart device sales that will talk to
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:54,528	| IOT192 |	Just to give you a sense of how the world
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:57,088	| IOT192 |	Does going this week we have gone to
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:00:58,624	| IOT192 |	Limerick from UL
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:02,720	| IOT192 |	And she's going to be talking about these cybersecurity standard that UL is developing
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:06,048	| IOT192 |	I have some tough questions and she mostly answer them
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:08,864	| IOT192 |	So all of this is sponsored by a pharaoh
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:09,632	| IOT192 |	You're going to hear from them
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:10,656	| IOT192 |	Then later and
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:11,936	| IOT192 |	In a few moments
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:13,984	| IOT192 |	So let's get the show started
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:15,264	| IOT192 |	With a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,288	| IOT192 |	A pharaoh
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,080	| IOT192 |	Looking for an iot
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:20,128	| IOT192 |	Deplatform find out why Kenmore and D-Link
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:21,408	| IOT192 |	The pharaoh
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:25,760	| IOT192 |	Affero customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to Market
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,576	| IOT192 |	99% pure support calls
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:30,112	| IOT192 |	M10x higher activation rate
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,392	| IOT192 |	Bus
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:34,464	| IOT192 |	Bakery use 90% of their work from one project to the
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:37,280	| IOT192 |	To learn more visit a pharaoh
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:37,792	| IOT192 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,328	| IOT192 |	That's a f
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,352	| IOT192 |	Ero
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,376	| IOT192 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,936	| IOT192 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,960	| IOT192 |	Let's get this started with
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,776	| IOT192 |	Sad story
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:49,568	| IOT192 |	So this is really sad story
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:54,432	| IOT192 |	I felt like crying but it was also hugely important to talk about I felt.
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,712	| IOT192 |	Because of the iot Inc
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:02:00,832	| IOT192 |	Girls here so data from the Black Box recovered from The Lion Air flight
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,624	| IOT192 |	The crash into the Java sea
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,392	| IOT192 |	Last month
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,160	| IOT192 |	Is now available
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,208	| IOT192 |	And basically what it shows
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,280	| IOT192 |	Was that the Boeing 737
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,560	| IOT192 |	That was being
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,072	| IOT192 |	Flown
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,120	| IOT192 |	Had bad censored
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:16,448	| IOT192 |	Reporting bad sensor data which made the autopilot behave in
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:20,032	| IOT192 |	Terrible way it kept try the nose of the plane kept trying to go down in the
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,056	| IOT192 |	The pilots kept trying to
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| IOT192 |	The correct it
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,592	| IOT192 |	They
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| IOT192 |	Actually did
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:23,872	| IOT192 |	Correct it
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,920	| IOT192 |	More than two dozen times
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,944	| IOT192 |	String deflate
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,456	| IOT192 |	But
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,736	| IOT192 |	They failed to
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,016	| IOT192 |	Maintain it and
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,040	| IOT192 |	It crashed in the ocean
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,600	| IOT192 |	They actually corrected it manually
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:37,440	| IOT192 |	Like you said more than two dozen times within 5 minutes I'm looking at the timeline.
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,464	| IOT192 |	5 minutes
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:43,072	| IOT192 |	They had to fight against the automatic anti-stall system which is why the
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,840	| IOT192 |	Clean cab
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:46,656	| IOT192 |	Putting its nose down automatically thought the plane was
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,168	| IOT192 |	Stalling
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,496	| IOT192 |	So they're two things that I thought
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,520	| IOT192 |	We're really important here
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,824	| IOT192 |	Kevin's has got his own things that are also
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,616	| IOT192 |	So one is
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,896	| IOT192 |	The sensor data
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| IOT192 |	That was causing the system
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,968	| IOT192 |	Fail
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| IOT192 |	The sensor was
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,248	| IOT192 |	Reporting bad
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,296	| IOT192 |	And I think it's important
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| IOT192 |	To notice that
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,344	| IOT192 |	Not just because
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,392	| IOT192 |	Why did they replace the sensor
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,416	| IOT192 |	How to replace a
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:14,560	| IOT192 |	But there is a lot of research right now going into malicious attacks and how to spoof
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,072	| IOT192 |	Censored
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,352	| IOT192 |	In
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,400	| IOT192 |	I think it's worth noting that there are
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,192	| IOT192 |	Things like physical attacks like
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,728	| IOT192 |	Certain frequencies of noise can
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,288	| IOT192 |	Confuse accelerometers for example
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT192 |	There's no evidence
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,592	| IOT192 |	This happening in this case
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,640	| IOT192 |	But you something
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,664	| IOT192 |	Researchers are looking at
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,224	| IOT192 |	And having this sensor
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,760	| IOT192 |	Report bad information
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,552	| IOT192 |	Funnel that through the system
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,344	| IOT192 |	In a way that took control of the
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| IOT192 |	A plane
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,392	| IOT192 |	We have to start thinking
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,416	| IOT192 |	About those
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:40,928	| IOT192 |	Hack Avenue
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,232	| IOT192 |	And I talked to
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,280	| IOT192 |	Their biggest on the show Alistair Allen is
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,816	| IOT192 |	Who talked about
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,352	| IOT192 |	Reading like a truss system
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:48,864	| IOT192 |	4 sensor
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| IOT192 |	Basically having sensors on
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,472	| IOT192 |	Our automated systems
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| IOT192 |	He talks about doing it
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,520	| IOT192 |	The black sheep
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,312	| IOT192 |	Basically what would happen
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| IOT192 |	When is Every sensor
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,128	| IOT192 |	The report's information
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,408	| IOT192 |	Into the system gets
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,176	| IOT192 |	Credibility
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| IOT192 |	Basically like
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,712	| IOT192 |	What's this
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:04,736	| IOT192 |	Yes or no
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| IOT192 |	In overtime the system would
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| IOT192 |	Would learn
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,832	| IOT192 |	Whether or not
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,344	| IOT192 |	You can trust that
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:12,416	| IOT192 |	So in this case it may be that every time the
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,440	| IOT192 |	Pilot's manual
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,464	| IOT192 |	Corrected the data
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,024	| IOT192 |	Import overrode descent
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,327	| IOT192 |	And that's the system with stop
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,863	| IOT192 |	Pay attention to that sensor
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| IOT192 |	That didn't happen obviously
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,423	| IOT192 |	I did not have
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| IOT192 |	So that's one aspect
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:28,031	| IOT192 |	Does like homie iPad sensor data we need to start.
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,543	| IOT192 |	Designing for
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,103	| IOT192 |	The second element
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| IOT192 |	Isabel
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,407	| IOT192 |	This was a soft
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:33,919	| IOT192 |	Software update
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| IOT192 |	Boeing issue
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:37,759	| IOT192 |	And bowling basically said
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,807	| IOT192 |	When they did the software update their like
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,599	| IOT192 |	Everything is going to work the same way
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,623	| IOT192 |	Used to work
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| IOT192 |	But that wasn't actually the case
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,463	| IOT192 |	To fix this error
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,255	| IOT192 |	The pilots did what they had always done
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,023	| IOT192 |	It didn't work
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,815	| IOT192 |	Boeing later issues
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,399	| IOT192 |	Correction of clarification saying that Pilots actually
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,191	| IOT192 |	How to manually take control head to do
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| IOT192 |	Two additional step
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,775	| IOT192 |	When I looked at that I was like
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| IOT192 |	I was frustrated because
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,639	| IOT192 |	Assume that soft
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,407	| IOT192 |	Where is just soft
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,479	| IOT192 |	But when we start letting software
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,503	| IOT192 |	Garden sensors
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:13,343	| IOT192 |	As the input into the real world and controlling the real world
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,879	| IOT192 |	We actually have to think about
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| IOT192 |	Software
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,183	| IOT192 |	Isn't just software
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:20,511	| IOT192 |	It's something we could actually cause an actual event like
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,047	| IOT192 |	The plane crash like a car
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,815	| IOT192 |	Crash
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| IOT192 |	In the case of a smart home
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,167	| IOT192 |	Am I allow someone into the house and I don't think
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:30,495	| IOT192 |	Corporations are really thinking along those lines
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| IOT192 |	Just yet
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT192 |	How software will
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,103	| IOT192 |	And Kevin you have a Corollary
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:39,967	| IOT192 |	Yeah you kind of stole my thunder because this is the first thing I thought of
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:46,367	| IOT192 |	Is wilty this is a plane it is awful but we are seeing some progression in automated Vehicles cars
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:49,951	| IOT192 |	And all these threat actors and sensors all exists
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,999	| IOT192 |	Any Vehicles as well and
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,583	| IOT192 |	To totally turn over control when the systems
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,119	| IOT192 |	Maybe shouldn't have control
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:01,727	| IOT192 |	Or reading faulty data and therefore are basing their control based on bad information
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,031	| IOT192 |	That is a huge huge challenge
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| IOT192 |	And I just
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:09,663	| IOT192 |	Granted a plane obviously has more passengers it's terrible how many people passed away in this
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT192 |	Plane crash
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:15,551	| IOT192 |	There's so many more cars on the road in a sense I I look at that as a bigger issue quite honestly for future
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:19,135	| IOT192 |	Purposes additionally unreal
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| IOT192 |	Boeing response
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,927	| IOT192 |	It's like saying
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,231	| IOT192 |	All this information was in the user
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:24,511	| IOT192 |	Pilots flight manual
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,815	| IOT192 |	And I think they had updated the flight manual and
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,863	| IOT192 |	They follow the flight manual the Pilots Dead
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:35,263	| IOT192 |	But the system kept overriding their overrides and I said my question is and I asked is because when I first IT jobs with us
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,055	| IOT192 |	Software tester and
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:37,823	| IOT192 |	User manual
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,639	| IOT192 |	Documents are used to create user manuals for software
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,663	| IOT192 |	Who tested it
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,199	| IOT192 |	How did the test it I mean
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:47,551	| IOT192 |	If somebody is tested in a real plane that might be dead to right I get that but
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,087	| IOT192 |	Simulators
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:49,855	| IOT192 |	What is this
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:53,183	| IOT192 |	Tested / the manual not how do I get to work
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,231	| IOT192 |	But how does the manual say it works
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,279	| IOT192 |	And how does the manual say to proceed when it doesn't work
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,815	| IOT192 |	I want to know who Tessa that but
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| IOT192 |	I'm sure we'll never find that out it's just
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,375	| IOT192 |	It's something
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,655	| IOT192 |	Has to be considered
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,935	| IOT192 |	Trinity smart system
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,263	| IOT192 |	And let's not forget that underlying
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:10,079	| IOT192 |	All of these issues in this is why it's so important
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,127	| IOT192 |	189 people
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,199	| IOT192 |	I mean and they died I don't know what it's like
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,223	| IOT192 |	The fall for the area
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,503	| IOT192 |	But I imagine that it's not
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| IOT192 |	And so
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,599	| IOT192 |	This just drives home that we are
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,647	| IOT192 |	Putting a lot of reliance
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,927	| IOT192 |	On software
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,207	| IOT192 |	On sensors
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,767	| IOT192 |	Automated systems and I'm not saying that we should
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,071	| IOT192 |	Because I mean planes have been drive-by-wire
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,351	| IOT192 |	For decades
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:36,703	| IOT192 |	And there are lots of safety protocols in place but I do feel that
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,471	| IOT192 |	As we are
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,239	| IOT192 |	Pushing
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| IOT192 |	More friendly
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,311	| IOT192 |	The plane automations
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,359	| IOT192 |	And drive-by-wire systems have been built
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,127	| IOT192 |	In
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,663	| IOT192 |	The vacuum it were built
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,687	| IOT192 |	Hainan airline
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,199	| IOT192 |	Regulation
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,759	| IOT192 |	Right so very safe
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,575	| IOT192 |	Where is now we've got a lot of
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,367	| IOT192 |	Companies building
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| IOT192 |	Their software
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,415	| IOT192 |	Tech review
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,183	| IOT192 |	Which
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| IOT192 |	Has been kind of bad breath fast and break things
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,791	| IOT192 |	And those things are colliding in a way that
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| IOT192 |	We need to borrow
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| IOT192 |	From that highly
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,423	| IOT192 |	Highly focused testing
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,191	| IOT192 |	Kind of world
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| IOT192 |	When we start applying these things to
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT192 |	Cars
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| IOT192 |	Airplanes
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,287	| IOT192 |	Medical device
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:13,823	| IOT192 |	And so on
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:18,687	| IOT192 |	So breaking things is fine I get that it's part of the process but not when those things are people
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,503	| IOT192 |	And maybe it's move fast and break things
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,527	| IOT192 |	In a simulator
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,319	| IOT192 |	Maybe it's an emphasis on testing
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,855	| IOT192 |	Kevin said
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,623	| IOT192 |	Maybe it's
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,159	| IOT192 |	Now it's probably an emphasis on
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,439	| IOT192 |	We should focus on
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,255	| IOT192 |	Is unfun and as not exciting
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,327	| IOT192 |	I think that's probably where we need to
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,863	| IOT192 |	Pause slow down
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,399	| IOT192 |	And take a few moments to
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:38,911	| IOT192 |	Get it right
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,447	| IOT192 |	Because it really matter
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,495	| IOT192 |	So that is our take
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,799	| IOT192 |	On this plane crash and
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,103	| IOT192 |	Yeah iot didn't do so well there
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,479	| IOT192 |	I don't know if it's happy
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,295	| IOT192 |	It's interesting it's interesting
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,599	| IOT192 |	So this week
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,391	| IOT192 |	User conference
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| IOT192 |	Non-stop so much exciting
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,583	| IOT192 |	First up we're going to talk about a WIC
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,375	| IOT192 |	Space Network
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:11,935	| IOT192 |	They have a new service called AWS
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:14,239	| IOT192 |	Ground station which is basically
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,775	| IOT192 |	Providing you satellite
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| IOT192 |	Antennas on the ground
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| IOT192 |	They will work with iridium
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,615	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,687	| IOT192 |	You will have a satellite connection that you can buy on demand
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| IOT192 |	Through AWS
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| IOT192 |	Which is pretty cool
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,063	| IOT192 |	Especially if you think about for iot
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,367	| IOT192 |	Services so you could actually
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,391	| IOT192 |	Maybe you've got a connected
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,695	| IOT192 |	Okstate dog collar but you probably don't
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:37,023	| IOT192 |	It's a sad life her that
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,839	| IOT192 |	Attract Norm where's where's Norm
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,655	| IOT192 |	I'm going to retest with satellite to find my dog
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| IOT192 |	Let's talk about container ship
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,687	| IOT192 |	Becomes an interesting option where we go
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,455	| IOT192 |	To have
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,247	| IOT192 |	12 in operation by the middle of neck
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| IOT192 |	Skyr
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:01,855	| IOT192 |	They said they're saying that you can ingest and process your data from the satellites
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:08,255	| IOT192 |	Direct to AWS very cool. I am curious about the cost that because I mean we all know about
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,279	| IOT192 |	Everybody
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:15,423	| IOT192 |	Probably knows about iridium and how it's been a spectacular fail so far and is pivoted at 3 for different times
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:19,263	| IOT192 |	Which was originally going to be satellite-based phone technology
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,847	| IOT192 |	Over the cloud anywhere and there's only satellites up there
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,871	| IOT192 |	Really don't do that
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,895	| IOT192 |	They still developer
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,479	| IOT192 |	Now it's not making any money because we have great cellular network
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:32,063	| IOT192 |	Brightwell and you still need satellite phones for super remotely
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,575	| IOT192 |	Location
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,903	| IOT192 |	It's super expensive
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,439	| IOT192 |	For the data connection because
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| IOT192 |	I can't scale relay
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,351	| IOT192 |	Is expensive
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| IOT192 |	Require special
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,655	| IOT192 |	Radios
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,423	| IOT192 |	Search
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,447	| IOT192 |	Huge
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| IOT192 |	There is no Moore's Law
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,823	| IOT192 |	Fitting satellite technology right now so you get these massive phones
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,847	| IOT192 |	Right
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,359	| IOT192 |	Can you set them up
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:02,271	| IOT192 |	ICM
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,855	| IOT192 |	Takes a second or two for that voice to travel up and carry back down
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,135	| IOT192 |	When does space
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,671	| IOT192 |	So you know
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| IOT192 |	This will be an interesting
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,463	| IOT192 |	Pink
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,535	| IOT192 |	The pricing will see so also in relevant
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,047	| IOT192 |	Coyote
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,119	| IOT192 |	There's an update to security for AWS
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,887	| IOT192 |	Coyote green
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,935	| IOT192 |	Green grass is the
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,727	| IOT192 |	Service that lets you run
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| IOT192 |	AWS
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:25,311	| IOT192 |	Beer AWS instances on
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,079	| IOT192 |	The edge
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:26,847	| IOT192 |	Basically
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,871	| IOT192 |	So now what you can
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,175	| IOT192 |	Can do with this is you can have connections to
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,199	| IOT192 |	Use third-party app
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:35,295	| IOT192 |	Location that other AWS services that are secure they're going to have Hardware root of
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,575	| IOT192 |	Trust storage
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,647	| IOT192 |	The isolation of permission settings that lets you
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,927	| IOT192 |	Basically just take
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,439	| IOT192 |	More control
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| IOT192 |	And this is really important
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,279	| IOT192 |	Because there are a lot of
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,559	| IOT192 |	Enterprises
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| IOT192 |	And even Industrial
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,399	| IOT192 |	Using AWS Greengrass
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:50,911	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,959	| IOT192 |	Necessary service
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,983	| IOT192 |	More secrets
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:54,751	| IOT192 |	Moore security
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,359	| IOT192 |	Yeah it looks like they also have another service that's
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:05,247	| IOT192 |	Password related it doesn't necessarily require green grass but I saw this IRT sitewise which was interesting
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,015	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,295	| IOT192 |	Sounds like it's a piece of
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,879	| IOT192 |	Hardware because they said there's an on-premises Gateway device.
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,903	| IOT192 |	That collects data
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:18,303	| IOT192 |	And far is it to AWS or further processing so then you can build representations of production lines and processes safer
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| IOT192 |	Industrial iot
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| IOT192 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:23,167	| IOT192 |	The big focus seems to be here on AWS
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,215	| IOT192 |	Really making sure that they have something
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| IOT192 |	Industrial and
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,311	| IOT192 |	Plant cell in addition to sitewise
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:29,823	| IOT192 |	Which australians
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,127	| IOT192 |	They have 8.
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,687	| IOT192 |	Events that that you do iot sensors
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| IOT192 |	It's scale
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:35,967	| IOT192 |	So that's
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,783	| IOT192 |	And then they have AWS iot
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,551	| IOT192 |	Things graph
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,343	| IOT192 |	It's basically letting you do
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,183	| IOT192 |	Locations for Edge gateways
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| IOT192 |	So
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,231	| IOT192 |	It's basically like
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,255	| IOT192 |	Would I look at this and I see
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,071	| IOT192 |	Microsoft is done with
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,839	| IOT192 |	With Asher
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,863	| IOT192 |	In iot
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:55,935	| IOT192 |	What kind of screw this up guys cuz everybody Nancy Rio.
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,471	| IOT192 |	Hardcore
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| IOT192 |	Score
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,823	| IOT192 |	Before I believe I think it's core
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,591	| IOT192 |	So this is
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,919	| IOT192 |	Play to get some of that business cuz Asher
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,455	| IOT192 |	Just owns the industrial
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,735	| IOT192 |	Because
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,015	| IOT192 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:13,343	| IOT192 |	And everybody in the industrial World works with Microsoft
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,879	| IOT192 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:19,999	| IOT192 |	It's hot by my bad it's not core Google I think it's core
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,511	| IOT192 |	FC
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,047	| IOT192 |	It Is Ash
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,351	| IOT192 |	Is everybody pick one and stick with it
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,399	| IOT192 |	We'll just you know pick something different in
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:29,471	| IOT192 |	Instead of iot Hub parkour
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:29,983	| IOT192 |	Function
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT192 |	Brain
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,543	| IOT192 |	Green grass
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,823	| IOT192 |	Skynet
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,967	| IOT192 |	Okay so those so far are the big iot related
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,271	| IOT192 |	AWS news stories out there
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,063	| IOT192 |	You also found one that you like
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,879	| IOT192 |	Yes I saw this
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:52,255	| IOT192 |	On the AWS news blog this is the AWS robomaker service and
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| IOT192 |	You can go
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:56,863	| IOT192 |	That is read to you by a robot or a robotic voice if you'd like
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:00,191	| IOT192 |	I found a press release which is kind of cool it is a service to help develop
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:04,031	| IOT192 |	Simulate test and deploy the robot of your dreams Amazon says
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:10,431	| IOT192 |	I doubt that because they're open My Dreams or something to talk about little bit later I think this is more for heavy-duty robotics
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:10,943	| IOT192 |	Companies
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:14,271	| IOT192 |	These are packages for the robotic operating system that
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:20,671	| IOT192 |	People used to build robots and it supports a TV services such as Lex Polly as I just mentioned recognition
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,207	| IOT192 |	Which we talked about before the
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| IOT192 |	Facial recognition
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| IOT192 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| IOT192 |	Natural language processing
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| IOT192 |	Kinesis video streams
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,911	| IOT192 |	Don't use that never heard of it
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT192 |	Just for videos
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,263	| IOT192 |	And Amazon Cloud
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| IOT192 |	I don't either
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:44,479	| IOT192 |	But you can watch the clouds that's not true
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:48,831	| IOT192 |	But anyways because of interest in robotics I thought this was neat could we see this
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:52,927	| IOT192 |	Move into the iot space so I think we might and we'll talk about that in a few
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| IOT192 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,255	| IOT192 |	Alright before we get too excited
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,047	| IOT192 |	Talk about the ocf
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| IOT192 |	The open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| IOT192 |	Which is now
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:03,935	| IOT192 |	Holy cow you guys an ISO standard
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,239	| IOT192 |	So we talked about ocf
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:08,287	| IOT192 |	Before they've actually sponsored the podcast
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:10,079	| IOT192 |	A couple times for a special CES episode
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,871	| IOT192 |	Which by the way we're going to have again
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,151	| IOT192 |	So
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| IOT192 |	These guys build
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| IOT192 |	Universal standard for connected devices is there
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,855	| IOT192 |	And everything will have a data schema
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,879	| IOT192 |	And everything will be
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,415	| IOT192 |	How to talk to everything else as long as
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,951	| IOT192 |	Sports Asia
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,487	| IOT192 |	The challenge
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:27,999	| IOT192 |	Has been
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,303	| IOT192 |	Did they really delayed issuing
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,119	| IOT192 |	Version of the standard with security in
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,447	| IOT192 |	They recently did do that this summer
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,007	| IOT192 |	But we haven't seen a lot of devices
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,287	| IOT192 |	It support it there lots of
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,591	| IOT192 |	Companies that are involved in Asia
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| IOT192 |	But we haven't seen
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,407	| IOT192 |	Devices
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,199	| IOT192 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:52,831	| IOT192 |	Hopeful that we'll see some this year at CES that are not just rehashes up
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,855	| IOT192 |	The old stuff
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,367	| IOT192 |	What they had
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:59,487	| IOT192 |	I think we will in the only reason I say that is because it's the ocf
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,767	| IOT192 |	Standard
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,351	| IOT192 |	11.0 spec that has been ratified and
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:10,239	| IOT192 |	They are working on two. Oh and I believe you can correct me if I'm wrong cuz I very well could be
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:14,591	| IOT192 |	That the two. I was back really brings more of a cloud into things
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,895	| IOT192 |	Smaller device
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,943	| IOT192 |	Abrams security
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,223	| IOT192 |	And the ability to run it
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,247	| IOT192 |	Plus
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,783	| IOT192 |	Make smaller
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,295	| IOT192 |	Not
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,319	| IOT192 |	Fletched
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,623	| IOT192 |	Smaller chips
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,671	| IOT192 |	Dumber chips for
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,303	| IOT192 |	But they're still smart they just useless
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:34,815	| IOT192 |	Power
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| IOT192 |	Yes but they're not as
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| IOT192 |	Between like
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| IOT192 |	Nmcu
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| IOT192 |	Andar May 7
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,983	| IOT192 |	But yes
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,751	| IOT192 |	So that's
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,519	| IOT192 |	Kind of WhatsApp
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,311	| IOT192 |	To be inside
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:48,383	| IOT192 |	ISO standard I just thought was interesting because you know
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:52,223	| IOT192 |	ISO is actually a very legitimate very powerful standards organization
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,039	| IOT192 |	The fact that they ratify this is
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:55,807	| IOT192 |	Probably
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,343	| IOT192 |	It means
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,879	| IOT192 |	Basically if
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,951	| IOT192 |	I so want it could develop a standard that didn't
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,975	| IOT192 |	Appraise ocf
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,791	| IOT192 |	And if it does then everyone has to do it
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,327	| IOT192 |	Ocf is pivoted someone
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,095	| IOT192 |	On the smart
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| IOT192 |	Home Space 2
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,887	| IOT192 |	To focusing on
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| IOT192 |	Automotive
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,191	| IOT192 |	Medical device
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| IOT192 |	Standards
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,471	| IOT192 |	So
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:18,335	| IOT192 |	That might be I don't see this impacting the smart that much if at all
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,639	| IOT192 |	It used to be very smart
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:23,199	| IOT192 |	Home focused in a lot of the companies that are involved are smart
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,735	| IOT192 |	They have
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,807	| IOT192 |	Home Appliance devices like LG Huawei
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:28,831	| IOT192 |	Samsung
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:35,487	| IOT192 |	So but they're all using other things and there's such a big audience already for the Eastside
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| IOT192 |	I don't know
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| IOT192 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| IOT192 |	So
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,655	| IOT192 |	But since we're talking about I so we should talk
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:46,495	| IOT192 |	Hey they just actually ratified a drill stand
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,543	| IOT192 |	Is not crazy
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:53,151	| IOT192 |	Set of standards for drone operations this draft
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:58,783	| IOT192 |	21st of January and they're expected to be adopted later
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,807	| IOT192 |	Some of the things that are in there
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:04,159	| IOT192 |	Are no fly zones so drones won't fly into airplanes
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,183	| IOT192 |	That's a big deal
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,207	| IOT192 |	It also talks about
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| IOT192 |	Like sensitive
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| IOT192 |	Locations
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:13,119	| IOT192 |	Yeah they could actually shut your drone down if it comes within a certain geofence area for example
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:15,167	| IOT192 |	And actually in the USA law was
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,727	| IOT192 |	Allows the government
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,495	| IOT192 |	To shut down
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,799	| IOT192 |	Drones
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| IOT192 |	That is actually
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,847	| IOT192 |	A little bit
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,407	| IOT192 |	Controversial because it's unclear
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,479	| IOT192 |	What areas might be deemed too sensitive so you could see something
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,527	| IOT192 |	Very good reason exam
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,063	| IOT192 |	Trying to
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,111	| IOT192 |	Fly a drone over the tornado
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,159	| IOT192 |	Camps where they're keeping the
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:36,671	| IOT192 |	Undocumented
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| IOT192 |	Children
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,535	| IOT192 |	The government may be like you know what media I don't want you looking at
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,303	| IOT192 |	To close it that
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,351	| IOT192 |	And they could just shoot those down which would be
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:49,471	| IOT192 |	That's a different story
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,007	| IOT192 |	We're going to want some clarity in that law
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,567	| IOT192 |	Probably
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| IOT192 |	It talks about
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,127	| IOT192 |	Flight logging
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,431	| IOT192 |	Training maintenance requirements so that would be
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:04,063	| IOT192 |	Really useful cuz I don't know how often you've been hit in the head by a drone but it's happened to me once it was
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:10,207	| IOT192 |	I haven't been you know I hope to never hit anybody because I had to register mine with the FAA so they would know what it was
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,303	| IOT192 |	My hair for a week
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:19,167	| IOT192 |	Not that I didn't think this was a big deal because it is but this surprise me
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,727	| IOT192 |	Currently the head of the UK's air safety board
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:25,311	| IOT192 |	It said that half of air traffic incidents now involve drones
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,103	| IOT192 |	Is
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,383	| IOT192 |	Surprising
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,687	| IOT192 |	Cuz that's a lot but I also
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,711	| IOT192 |	Recall unit
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,527	| IOT192 |	The firefighters not recently in California
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:39,903	| IOT192 |	Probably last year's firefighters talked about like they had to stop helicopter flights because drones were in the way
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,671	| IOT192 |	Siri call Dad
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,231	| IOT192 |	This is shared airspace
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,743	| IOT192 |	We got to figure this out
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,279	| IOT192 |	All right
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,815	| IOT192 |	Sogo ISO
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,095	| IOT192 |	Working on that if you have comment
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,863	| IOT192 |	You should tell them
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,143	| IOT192 |	Let's talk now
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,727	| IOT192 |	Let's talk now about a new Google Assistant speaker
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,079	| IOT192 |	Just came out of nowhere I did not expect it but then again
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:01,919	| IOT192 |	Pretty much any speaker these days it's on the market anybody's making them
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,991	| IOT192 |	I'm betting they're coming out with models that have
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:08,575	| IOT192 |	A microphone and some smart sync connectivity cuz that's what
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,855	| IOT192 |	Klipsch has done
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:13,183	| IOT192 |	They make high-end speakers they have for years and years
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,207	| IOT192 |	Eclipse
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:20,607	| IOT192 |	The three now has Google assistant and being a high-end speaker system it'll cost you 409
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,143	| IOT192 |	$9
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,447	| IOT192 |	Which is an awful lot for a smart speaker but
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,983	| IOT192 |	If you
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:29,055	| IOT192 |	Want that mid-century modern design and
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,823	| IOT192 |	Pig sound
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| IOT192 |	I know
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,639	| IOT192 |	There you go last minute
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,967	| IOT192 |	No cuz I'm not an audiophile I always like
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,015	| IOT192 |	Does it sound okay
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:43,391	| IOT192 |	I'm not an audio file for say cuz my hearing is starting to go but I do
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,159	| IOT192 |	Like
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:47,231	| IOT192 |	Good speakers you know I'm not going to get this because I don't like
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,767	| IOT192 |	Good speakers under $500
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,047	| IOT192 |	So is your
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,327	| IOT192 |	What qualifies
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| IOT192 |	Just a good speaker in your
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| IOT192 |	What's your favorite
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:57,215	| IOT192 |	Good sounding speakers the best sounding speakers in my house are the Sonos
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,519	| IOT192 |	Call my dad
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:06,687	| IOT192 |	Which still still has not Google Assistant which we mention I'm thinking the last podcast it's not happening
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,711	| IOT192 |	Hopefully early 2019
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:09,247	| IOT192 |	He'll let us know
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,271	| IOT192 |	Oh I will
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,551	| IOT192 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:15,903	| IOT192 |	Speaking of assistance we should talk about Amazon because
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,696	| IOT192 |	They put out a press release
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,464	| IOT192 |	Talk about
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| IOT192 |	There
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,512	| IOT192 |	Turkey five
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,328	| IOT192 |	Black Friday to Cyber Monday which day
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,864	| IOT192 |	Turkey 5 holiday
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:29,728	| IOT192 |	We will turkeys turkey from now it's not a thing don't make it if you don't ever be a thing Amazon
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,264	| IOT192 |	We're not on board
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,544	| IOT192 |	What's that but
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,080	| IOT192 |	We are on board with
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,592	| IOT192 |	Finding out
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:38,176	| IOT192 |	You know and just do this with a big heavy load of salt
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:42,016	| IOT192 |	Which is Amazon's press releases are notorious for not actually
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,552	| IOT192 |	Real information
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,064	| IOT192 |	Astounding
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:51,744	| IOT192 |	They give information but it's nothing compared to because they're not providing that extra bit that we give you the comparison
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,816	| IOT192 |	So let's see but they did say
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,096	| IOT192 |	That
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,864	| IOT192 |	They sold
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:59,168	| IOT192 |	A lot of echo dots the best selling products at
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,448	| IOT192 |	The Amazon pop-up device
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,728	| IOT192 |	Kiosk
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,752	| IOT192 |	Over here is that where it's at
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,776	| IOT192 |	35 weekend
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| IOT192 |	So basically Thanksgiving
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:05,824	| IOT192 |	Black Friday
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| IOT192 |	That weekend and then
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,408	| IOT192 |	Cyber Monday
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,944	| IOT192 |	It was the echo Dot
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,712	| IOT192 |	In the Amazon smart
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,248	| IOT192 |	Which
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,784	| IOT192 |	By the way
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| IOT192 |	Was on sale
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,832	| IOT192 |	25 bucks
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,856	| IOT192 |	Was crazy cheap
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,880	| IOT192 |	Sounds great
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,160	| IOT192 |	And it's sold out
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:20,928	| IOT192 |	Which is
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,696	| IOT192 |	Amazing
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,720	| IOT192 |	And I saw a
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,232	| IOT192 |	A tweet
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,024	| IOT192 |	From Ryan
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:25,792	| IOT192 |	Ramallah
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,584	| IOT192 |	Who is a voice first kind of
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,352	| IOT192 |	Person
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| IOT192 |	I don't know how else to describe
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,424	| IOT192 |	He's an expert there but he said
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,448	| IOT192 |	The source
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,472	| IOT192 |	Told him
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,008	| IOT192 |	Did the sales of the echo Dot
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:38,080	| IOT192 |	More than a thousand units
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:38,592	| IOT192 |	Hersey
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:40,896	| IOT192 |	Witches
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| IOT192 |	It is
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,784	| IOT192 |	And just we can put some minor perspective around this
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,320	| IOT192 |	Because Amazon said that
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,344	| IOT192 |	Customers ordered
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:53,696	| IOT192 |	180 million items about those five days obviously they were not I'll.
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| IOT192 |	Of course not
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,000	| IOT192 |	But the best selling
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| IOT192 |	Products
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,328	| IOT192 |	Cyber Monday for example
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,376	| IOT192 |	What's the new Echo Dot
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,680	| IOT192 |	As fate was in the kiosks as you said
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:06,752	| IOT192 |	So the only kind of idea they gave us on
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:11,360	| IOT192 |	Total sales for Echo devices was Millions sold worldwide
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,920	| IOT192 |	And that the all new Echo dot was the number one
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:18,528	| IOT192 |	Selling price on Amazon globally from manufacturer in any category
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:22,368	| IOT192 |	We know they sold 180 million items and they sold millions of
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:22,880	| IOT192 |	Echo devices
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:26,208	| IOT192 |	We don't know how many millions obviously less than 180
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,000	| IOT192 |	Yes which is still
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,048	| IOT192 |	Other things
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,120	| IOT192 |	The ring video doorbell 2
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,144	| IOT192 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:38,240	| IOT192 |	But they also sold the iRobot Roomba 690
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:38,752	| IOT192 |	Robot vacuum
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,056	| IOT192 |	That is not the one that actually Maps
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,336	| IOT192 |	Your data and can send it to your
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,104	| IOT192 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,664	| IOT192 |	They sold a lot of TP Link mini Wifi smart plug
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,944	| IOT192 |	And the Amazon smart plug
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:50,528	| IOT192 |	This is part of hopefully the mainstreaming of the smart
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,808	| IOT192 |	So yay
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:52,832	| IOT192 |	All right
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,880	| IOT192 |	Let's see what else do
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,928	| IOT192 |	Speaking of Amazon
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,512	| IOT192 |	And the robots that we were talking about it is now time
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,816	| IOT192 |	To talk about Kevin's
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,584	| IOT192 |	Tri Merle.
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,120	| IOT192 |	Well
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,400	| IOT192 |	The next thing on my
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,448	| IOT192 |	Want less I guess so
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:12,288	| IOT192 |	This is not mainstream are going from mainstream to just what Kevin wants but I think
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,568	| IOT192 |	Other people will want
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,848	| IOT192 |	They just don't know it yet
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,872	| IOT192 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,152	| IOT192 |	Wait before you
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,432	| IOT192 |	One day
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,456	| IOT192 |	YouTube
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,040	| IOT192 |	I want an iPad mini and guess what
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,344	| IOT192 |	They did
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,392	| IOT192 |	People don't realize that but that's another story
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:27,904	| IOT192 |	Anyway
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,208	| IOT192 |	So I mentioned vector
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:34,304	| IOT192 |	The little robot from Anki that I had bought in October last month
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:37,120	| IOT192 |	He's gotten some software updates he is much
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| IOT192 |	More expressive
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,704	| IOT192 |	That's the new thing for him was when it's
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:47,104	| IOT192 |	It's cold outside on the weather when it's below a certain amount
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:52,224	| IOT192 |	Please got another update coming and this one gets me really excited not just for the near future but the
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,016	| IOT192 |	Faraway 5-year future
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,296	| IOT192 |	He is getting
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:58,112	| IOT192 |	Amazon's matinee integration
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:58,880	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:01,952	| IOT192 |	The funky folks shared a video
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,720	| IOT192 |	Of
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,000	| IOT192 |	What it looks like and how it works
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:06,048	| IOT192 |	Because you don't have to ask
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,096	| IOT192 |	Vector to ask Madame a something
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,888	| IOT192 |	Nature's literally at Amazon
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,704	| IOT192 |	Echo device for all intensive purposes with this update
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:15,264	| IOT192 |	Is coming in a few weeks and I'm super excited to get it
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:19,360	| IOT192 |	It made me think about though is and I proposed to
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,384	| IOT192 |	Earlier this week
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:24,992	| IOT192 |	For people who are familiar with the Iron Man movies which I suspect most people are you know about
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,760	| IOT192 |	Jarvis
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,808	| IOT192 |	If you're not familiar Jarvis is basically a
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,136	| IOT192 |	Bodiless digital assistant just like matinee
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,672	| IOT192 |	Eventually becomes
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:38,304	| IOT192 |	Put into a synthetic body and he's a robot in a sense is real
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:43,168	| IOT192 |	Yeah you're right
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,960	| IOT192 |	Geek cred for you
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,496	| IOT192 |	Oh my God was that a spoiler
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:51,872	| IOT192 |	No not well it is for the Age of Ultron as well being
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:56,224	| IOT192 |	What I saw with the doctor and Madame a integration and then
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:01,088	| IOT192 |	In reality and then the movie where and digital assistant becomes a movable object
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,368	| IOT192 |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:08,256	| IOT192 |	Why do we want all these speakers and microphone throughout the house okay speakers yes we want to music
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:11,840	| IOT192 |	Do we need all these microphones I literally have more
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:18,240	| IOT192 |	Smart speakers than I have rooms in my house right now and I just bought another one I just bought a Google home hub over the holidays for the kitchen I'll
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:20,288	| IOT192 |	Silence we can watch YouTube TV or coffee
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,336	| IOT192 |	But I'm tired of buying them and quite honestly
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,384	| IOT192 |	It doesn't make sense in the long run
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,664	| IOT192 |	Why not have
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,480	| IOT192 |	Movable object I a robot
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,552	| IOT192 |	That can definitely humanoid is enough to be enlarged
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:37,952	| IOT192 |	It is a bit bigger than Vector because Vector only lasts 45 minutes on a charge but just had that microphone near me when I want to
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:41,024	| IOT192 |	Near me
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:44,608	| IOT192 |	Robot go stand in the corner I'm going to watch Ironman for the 10th time
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:51,776	| IOT192 |	Whatever you know what I mean because it takes away a lot of the Privacy things now
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:58,176	| IOT192 |	Because you can be a way you can be in a room that doesn't have a microphone or camera Decker as cameras I presume
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,456	| IOT192 |	Robot like this would have cameras to
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:06,368	| IOT192 |	Yeah I can go into the non robot and do my thing and be private and then still have the robot within earshot and I can say
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:08,416	| IOT192 |	What's the weather or whatever I want
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,440	| IOT192 |	Thomas Martin
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:15,840	| IOT192 |	I don't know I know it's a radical idea I never most my ideas so I can use a radical and some of them actually come true
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| IOT192 |	And I like the idea
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| IOT192 |	Like following me around
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,192	| IOT192 |	And you know
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,728	| IOT192 |	Hanging out doing things
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:23,520	| IOT192 |	Look it over in
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:26,592	| IOT192 |	Imagine like a Sony aibo like a little robot dog
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,616	| IOT192 |	Having yes
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:28,640	| IOT192 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:29,920	| IOT192 |	That would be so fun
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,992	| IOT192 |	I do think Mobility will add a lot
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:37,856	| IOT192 |	To this experience I don't know that everybody is ready for the right now and I can't that
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:43,744	| IOT192 |	You know the update on the smart speakers have been ridiculously fast and granted
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,304	| IOT192 |	I love my pretty inexpensive fat it certainly helps
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:50,656	| IOT192 |	I don't know I think there's a lot of value I didn't mobile virtual assistant such as this
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,936	| IOT192 |	There are privacy
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,728	| IOT192 |	Questions about this
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,312	| IOT192 |	If it's something that can
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,616	| IOT192 |	Can follow you around you to lose elements
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,384	| IOT192 |	Privacy Law
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,944	| IOT192 |	Like if you only want your digital assistant in certain play
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,968	| IOT192 |	Places but I guess you could say
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:07,296	| IOT192 |	The kitchen
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:10,112	| IOT192 |	Having dinner with my wife in candlelight dinner
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:13,952	| IOT192 |	I think that's manageable it's more manageable than it is now these speakers are just there
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| IOT192 |	I have one of my back
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,840	| IOT192 |	Gervais get out of the bathroom
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,352	| IOT192 |	Slave
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,400	| IOT192 |	I'm going I didn't want to be

EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,016	| IOT192 |	So sorry rest of world
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,064	| IOT192 |	It's a great lock
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,832	| IOT192 |	I like it
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,624	| IOT192 |	Now
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,416	| IOT192 |	Let's hear our voice mail who is
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,208	| IOT192 |	From somebody
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,000	| IOT192 |	But I'm guessing they're from the south
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,024	| IOT192 |	Just like me
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:24,608	| IOT192 |	Stacy Kevin how y'all have a question regarding
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,888	| IOT192 |	Using the most
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,168	| IOT192 |	Current
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,960	| IOT192 |	Intelligence which is but in an old building
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:32,800	| IOT192 |	Helping my daughter and son-in-law do some updating and their new house
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,848	| IOT192 |	And he wanted to automate a couple switch location
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,432	| IOT192 |	Today they're using Madame age connected direct Outlets
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:38,944	| IOT192 |	So Gateway
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,992	| IOT192 |	Stinky shoes I understanding this
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,784	| IOT192 |	Building was built and we're guessing the
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,552	| IOT192 |	60s
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,856	| IOT192 |	This wiring it is two conductors no neutral
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:51,232	| IOT192 |	And that's just about every other ladies Racing shirt
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:53,536	| IOT192 |	A suggestion for wall switches
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,072	| IOT192 |	We could use an old house
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:57,120	| IOT192 |	Thanks for being so nice in the right direction
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:59,936	| IOT192 |	Oh this is such a common question
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,984	| IOT192 |	Unfortunately for you I have
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:02,752	| IOT192 |	Literally want ants
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,544	| IOT192 |	Because it is the only one
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:08,640	| IOT192 |	So the only option they have
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,944	| IOT192 |	Is a dimming switch
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,456	| IOT192 |	From Lucia
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:13,760	| IOT192 |	And you will find this it is
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,296	| IOT192 |	Lutron caseta switch
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,832	| IOT192 |	Which it is model number
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:17,856	| IOT192 |	TD
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,136	| IOT192 |	-
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| IOT192 |	6w
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| IOT192 |	CL
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,232	| IOT192 |	And there's going to be another
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:26,304	| IOT192 |	Series after that that's going to denote color in this case it is
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:31,168	| IOT192 |	6wcl - wh
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:31,936	| IOT192 |	That's white
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:32,960	| IOT192 |	It comes in Black
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT192 |	Almond
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,240	| IOT192 |	Some of their
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,032	| IOT192 |	So this is a
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,848	| IOT192 |	$55 switch
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:41,152	| IOT192 |	But it does not require
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:44,224	| IOT192 |	It does however require
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,736	| IOT192 |	The Lutron
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,040	| IOT192 |	Stop the smart Bridge hub
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,808	| IOT192 |	And that
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,576	| IOT192 |	Right now
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:52,416	| IOT192 |	Is $117 sometimes I see it on sale for as low as 80
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,440	| IOT192 |	This is ratehub
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,488	| IOT192 |	And if you're going to buy a Lutron switches
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,024	| IOT192 |	This Hub is going to be
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,048	| IOT192 |	Your best friend
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:02,144	| IOT192 |	Makes it compatible with Madame a show at the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:04,704	| IOT192 |	The Google Assistant ecosystem and even home
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,728	| IOT192 |	So
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:07,008	| IOT192 |	It is a hub
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,288	| IOT192 |	But it's a really useful
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,104	| IOT192 |	And it's going to work with all of your switch
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:16,736	| IOT192 |	This particular switch does not require neutral wire it says so very clearly so make sure you do see those
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,296	| IOT192 |	The downside of this
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,576	| IOT192 |	I just called you to switch it's actually
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:21,856	| IOT192 |	Is if
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:24,160	| IOT192 |	If you don't have dimmable bulbs this isn't good
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,976	| IOT192 |	So for example if you have a fluorescent bulb
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,768	| IOT192 |	You're not going to be able
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,536	| IOT192 |	To use it
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,304	| IOT192 |	And
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,328	| IOT192 |	That is
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:31,840	| IOT192 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,120	| IOT192 |	And I
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:36,192	| IOT192 |	They used to have a switch that didn't require neutral wire now they do not
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:41,312	| IOT192 |	And I suspect that these aren't going to be around that much longer I'm not saying
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:44,128	| IOT192 |	Days are weeks but I don't know about that
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:47,456	| IOT192 |	Keeps them on their website they talk about it being a perfect option for
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:49,248	| IOT192 |	An older home
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,784	| IOT192 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:53,856	| IOT192 |	Which year there's obviously there's plenty of older homes out there
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,672	| IOT192 |	It's only words
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:01,536	| IOT192 |	Dimming lights I mean it does have an on-off two buttons one for almost four off at the top and bottom
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,584	| IOT192 |	Turn off the dimmer in the middle so
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,632	| IOT192 |	If you use a dimmer though with
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,168	| IOT192 |	Incompatible lights
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:08,960	| IOT192 |	Liquor in
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| IOT192 |	Yes
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:17,152	| IOT192 |	I was just thinking you're saying this is a dimmer which it is but it could be used as a switch
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,200	| IOT192 |	Only on lights to the caveat is
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:19,712	| IOT192 |	Your lights have to be
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:23,040	| IOT192 |	You can't put non dimmable lights with this
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,088	| IOT192 |	I did not know that
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,112	| IOT192 |	Yes I have done that
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,672	| IOT192 |	I have not
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:29,952	| IOT192 |	Obviously
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:30,720	| IOT192 |	Don't do that
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:35,840	| IOT192 |	So that is the caveat if you have weird if you have normal
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:36,864	| IOT192 |	So
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,656	| IOT192 |	Dimmable LED
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:41,216	| IOT192 |	I think like lights that won't work or fluorescence
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,496	| IOT192 |	Halogen light
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:43,776	| IOT192 |	So
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,824	| IOT192 |	Those are going to be a little bit more difficult
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,848	| IOT192 |	But normal lights
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,384	| IOT192 |	Yay
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,200	| IOT192 |	That's my
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,992	| IOT192 |	Are you so easy answer
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,272	| IOT192 |	It is expensive but
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,808	| IOT192 |	I recommend Lutron lights
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,088	| IOT192 |	Everybody who asked me
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:59,648	| IOT192 |	If they're installing switches I know it's expensive
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,160	| IOT192 |	These lights are
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,696	| IOT192 |	They just work
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:03,232	| IOT192 |	The work well
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,536	| IOT192 |	And the Lutron support is amazing
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,304	| IOT192 |	Also
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,352	| IOT192 |	I know you guys know I love
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:08,864	| IOT192 |	How do you spell
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,936	| IOT192 |	For this case it is literally the only option so
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:13,984	| IOT192 |	Problem solved
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,264	| IOT192 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,312	| IOT192 |	Well that brings us to the end of the News segment
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| IOT192 |	Of the show and now
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,616	| IOT192 |	We're going to be
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:21,152	| IOT192 |	To our guests who is
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,432	| IOT192 |	Honda limerick
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:26,784	| IOT192 |	From ul and we're going to be talking about the UL cybersecurity standard
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,320	| IOT192 |	Gosh where is it
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,600	| IOT192 |	Why does it cost so much
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,880	| IOT192 |	What are you guys trying to do
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,928	| IOT192 |	You will like this especially if
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,512	| IOT192 |	Like standards and certifications it who does it
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,328	| IOT192 |	Get started with this but first
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,096	| IOT192 |	A word from our sponsor
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:46,496	| IOT192 |	Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast from our sponsor
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,032	| IOT192 |	This week sponsor is a
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:52,128	| IOT192 |	And I've got Joe Britt who is the CEO of a pharaoh here to talk to
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:55,968	| IOT192 |	So first off would you reminder audience who afero is
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| IOT192 |	Fair was fundamentally
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:00,064	| IOT192 |	A platform for connecting all kinds
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:03,136	| IOT192 |	Sensors and devices to the cloud but the most important
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,928	| IOT192 |	Vocero is that
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:07,488	| IOT192 |	We put together everything just works
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,768	| IOT192 |	And we also feel like
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,536	| IOT192 |	It's very
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,304	| IOT192 |	Design
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,328	| IOT192 |	Easy to use
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:12,864	| IOT192 |	And very very secure
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:15,168	| IOT192 |	And our customers tell us that it's
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:18,240	| IOT192 |	The best choice for great end user experience
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| IOT192 |	And developer
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:19,776	| IOT192 |	Productivity
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:22,336	| IOT192 |	You may remember that many of us out of pharaoh came for
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:24,128	| IOT192 |	From places like apple nest
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,176	| IOT192 |	Google Android Netflix
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:30,016	| IOT192 |	And we really wanted to bring the best of those engineering and Design District
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:31,296	| IOT192 |	To the world of iot
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:34,624	| IOT192 |	Excellent so who are some of your customers and why do they pick up
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,672	| IOT192 |	Customers like hemorrhoid
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:39,488	| IOT192 |	D-Link chose a pharaoh really because of three key reasons
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,024	| IOT192 |	Time to Market
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,840	| IOT192 |	They can cut down their development Time by as much as 80%
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,120	| IOT192 |	Technology reuse
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:49,984	| IOT192 |	Their Engineers are able to reuse over 90% of their work from Project to project
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:50,752	| IOT192 |	For example
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:52,032	| IOT192 |	Kenworth connected more than
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:52,800	| IOT192 |	The 25 Appliance
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,592	| IOT192 |	In less than 2 years
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,616	| IOT192 |	And finally custom
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,384	| IOT192 |	Experience
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,664	| IOT192 |	Our partnership founded
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:35:02,016	| IOT192 |	The Pharaohs substantially increases the number of devices that are actually connect
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,808	| IOT192 |	Thanks to our onboarding technology
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,832	| IOT192 |	And substantially
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,392	| IOT192 |	Reduces the number of conductivity related
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,672	| IOT192 |	Customer support calls
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,976	| IOT192 |	So what is new since the last time
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:11,744	| IOT192 |	Time we talked
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:12,512	| IOT192 |	Great Wolf
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:13,536	| IOT192 |	I'd like to highlight
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,304	| IOT192 |	To really excited
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,632	| IOT192 |	The first is around our patent port
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,704	| IOT192 |	Few weeks ago we were identified as having the
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,472	| IOT192 |	V large
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:23,776	| IOT192 |	Just patent portfolio in the iot space
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,848	| IOT192 |	Find large companies like Samsung Qualcomm
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,872	| IOT192 |	Intel and IBM
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,664	| IOT192 |	Now this is a really huge test
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:32,480	| IOT192 |	Funny to the quality of the engineering talent that a pharaoh has a
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,272	| IOT192 |	But it's also a test
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,552	| IOT192 |	To the market
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:39,136	| IOT192 |	Get Gap that existed for a fully integrated and secure iot platform
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,928	| IOT192 |	Are patent portfolios
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| IOT192 |	Reflection
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,232	| IOT192 |	Of the benefits that are custom
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,768	| IOT192 |	Get by using the affair of platform
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,048	| IOT192 |	End
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,840	| IOT192 |	What about this Bank of things
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,424	| IOT192 |	We've also been doing some really inspiring work
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,216	| IOT192 |	Work with Mitsubishi ufj Bank
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,288	| IOT192 |	And this is fundamentally about enabling
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,056	| IOT192 |	Billions
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,336	| IOT192 |	Of tiny micro Tran
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:35:59,616	| IOT192 |	Micropenis
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,920	| IOT192 |	Through smart devices all kinds of
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:04,480	| IOT192 |	The project is called Bank of
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:05,760	| IOT192 |	Because
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:08,064	| IOT192 |	It marries iot with banking
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,600	| IOT192 |	And also really lays the
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,368	| IOT192 |	Groundwork
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:12,160	| IOT192 |	4 things to pay each other
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:12,928	| IOT192 |	Directly
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,208	| IOT192 |	Sarah provide CIA
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:14,976	| IOT192 |	Party platform
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:16,768	| IOT192 |	A Mitsubishi Bank provides
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,792	| IOT192 |	The payment processing
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:20,608	| IOT192 |	And this kind of solution demands very secure conductive
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,424	| IOT192 |	And very secure payment processing with minimum over
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,216	| IOT192 |	Each device
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,752	| IOT192 |	Then becomes its own payment
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,056	| IOT192 |	There's no need for the traditional paint
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,360	| IOT192 |	Terminal is an add-on device you get insta
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| IOT192 |	Step response
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,152	| IOT192 |	Highscalability
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,432	| IOT192 |	Reliable operation
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,456	| IOT192 |	Low overhead

EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:39,552	| IOT192 |	And all of this has to be there to create this
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,576	| IOT192 |	Very unique solution
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,880	| IOT192 |	That sounds really cool so where can

EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,664	| IOT192 |	Since
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:40,480	| IOT192 |	Oh I don't know a couple years ago we've been talking about
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| IOT192 |	An iot
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,040	| IOT192 |	Security standard
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,320	| IOT192 |	So talked about
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:46,880	| IOT192 |	Why you all decided to get into this
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:47,648	| IOT192 |	Game
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,184	| IOT192 |	Like you outside

EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:19,392	| IOT192 |	To ask you out what are you guys doing to protect us from these new risks
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:21,952	| IOT192 |	That's why we have been trying to engage with industry
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:24,768	| IOT192 |	Around security thinking about security requirement
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,840	| IOT192 |	Cabana some of these security risks that have been
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,864	| IOT192 |	Paramount life
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,888	| IOT192 |	For example
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,912	| IOT192 |	Losing control of your device
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,984	| IOT192 |	Having someone reached your data
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,776	| IOT192 |	And related types of risk
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:39,104	| IOT192 |	So that's where we have gotten involved as physical product
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:39,872	| IOT192 |	Senior home
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:42,944	| IOT192 |	Computers Network connectable products
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:47,808	| IOT192 |	We want to network with industry I'm with consumerism smart homeowners

EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,856	| IOT192 |	Associated with those products
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,928	| IOT192 |	Okay so there is a little bit of a
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:57,024	| IOT192 |	Prince here historically if you follow the rules of various physical
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,328	| IOT192 |	Sex right so if I want to create an outlet
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:04,448	| IOT192 |	PetSafe I have to follow set rules about you know the amount of voltage that goes through that sort of thing
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,216	| IOT192 |	Testing
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:09,824	| IOT192 |	In the product stays relatively the same but will be start connecting things to the internet
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,104	| IOT192 |	It almost becomes a
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,128	| IOT192 |	Impossible 2
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,920	| IOT192 |	Secure it because things on the internet
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:16,224	| IOT192 |	Always changing software is always going out
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,784	| IOT192 |	So how do you guys think about
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:19,808	| IOT192 |	That because that is
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:22,880	| IOT192 |	At the core of iot security that seems to be
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,904	| IOT192 |	Biggest issue
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:26,464	| IOT192 |	Extremely relevant

EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:45,920	| IOT192 |	It's no longer Hardware itself and then the risk
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:46,688	| IOT192 |	Scenarios
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,736	| IOT192 |	You think about it
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:52,064	| IOT192 |	Scenarios they evolve over time but they are more

EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,880	| IOT192 |	Email leaving the factory
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:28,928	| IOT192 |	That's where I stopped caring about it
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,208	| IOT192 |	You know it has to be
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:36,608	| IOT192 |	Miami Heat Reddit shooting turn left and that's where you all need to step up and help
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:38,912	| IOT192 |	Ultimately
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:39,936	| IOT192 |	Society as well
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:41,472	| IOT192 |	What does ongoing
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:46,848	| IOT192 |	Insurance that products are being used
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:49,408	| IOT192 |	So that implies a continuous
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,432	| IOT192 |	Testing process
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:53,504	| IOT192 |	So something like more like a nice so kind of standard
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:57,088	| IOT192 |	Approved and then you go back in every now and then they come in and
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,624	| IOT192 |	Certify you again or make sure that
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:02,720	| IOT192 |	Up-to-date so is that something that you all has done in the pasture does
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:03,744	| IOT192 |	The plan to do this
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,280	| IOT192 |	For the cyber security program

EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,560	| IOT192 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:43,168	| IOT192 |	The broad Strokes of what you guys are thinking about when you talk about coyotes
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:45,472	| IOT192 |	Security what is the program
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:50,336	| IOT192 |	That we have done a few things are actually has
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:55,455	| IOT192 |	A lot of experience and also strong reputation in markets that are currently
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,759	| IOT192 |	Redlands I mean there is

EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:54,335	| IOT192 |	To think about how come
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:43:01,247	| IOT192 |	Security do you envision a company having to get WL certification so if I'm making a connected
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:05,087	| IOT192 |	Kitchen product for example
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:09,439	| IOT192 |	Fire safety kind of aspects but then I'm also going to possibly need a

EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:11,999	| IOT192 |	Certifications
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:16,095	| IOT192 |	What is that look like for a company that's like
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,655	| IOT192 |	It's going to cost too much
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:22,751	| IOT192 |	Feeling of course you want to avoid to the extent possible
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,031	| IOT192 |	Products need to be

EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:13,183	| IOT192 |	Let's run down some security features and let's see where they fit into the UL scheme so this will be kind of quick and short
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,975	| IOT192 |	Hopefully so in corruption
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,999	| IOT192 |	Necessary
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:16,767	| IOT192 |	Where
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| IOT192 |	Very important
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:21,375	| IOT192 |	For example you think about day that other thing, decayed it's from a product
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:28,287	| IOT192 |	Example of a IP camera security camera
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:29,823	| IOT192 |	Is protecting a building

EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:47,487	| IOT192 |	That is data that ideally you encrypt
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,279	| IOT192 |	When you communicated from the device
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:53,375	| IOT192 |	Okay what about encryption of data at rest
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:53,887	| IOT192 |	On the cloud
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,935	| IOT192 |	Very important as well
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:45:02,079	| IOT192 |	Addressed in the cloud or data at rest in the device sensitive data you should be considering
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:05,919	| IOT192 |	Adequately

EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:22,047	| IOT192 |	What about password
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:23,583	| IOT192 |	Default passwords on devices
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:30,239	| IOT192 |	That's what's important actually useful password those are not the greatest security practice so I having you

EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,999	| IOT192 |	Some more and more data
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:58,143	| IOT192 |	Used in devices and also and devices pick up user-specific data
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:04,031	| IOT192 |	Devices you need to give up some of your data in most of the cases.

EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:39,359	| IOT192 |	In general when you think about software
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:41,407	| IOT192 |	One thing that is important
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:47,039	| IOT192 |	Considered as well as whatever functionality you enable with it if you want to protect yourself or adequately
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:49,343	| IOT192 |	Any insecure functionality
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,135	| IOT192 |	Albuquerque accident
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:47:00,863	| IOT192 |	Grenadine in the right way
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:03,679	| IOT192 |	Operate a certain function and if it's not needed
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:04,703	| IOT192 |	Why am I enabling
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:05,983	| IOT192 |	For example remote
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,287	| IOT192 |	And maybe have a mindset
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:10,335	| IOT192 |	Disabled and stops Networks
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:12,383	| IOT192 |	Security in general even though it maybe
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,943	| IOT192 |	It's still important
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:17,247	| IOT192 |	To consider and it will remain important
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:21,087	| IOT192 |	Lansing Social Security office and forms and devices you can consider
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:25,439	| IOT192 |	Whatever
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:29,535	| IOT192 |	Device is your navel make sure they're behind a router or a firewall
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:32,351	| IOT192 |	And I think about Network segmentation
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:36,703	| IOT192 |	So do you want your computer for example to be linked
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:40,543	| IOT192 |	Are connected to the same network as your device
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:42,335	| IOT192 |	Maybe you should apply some smart
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:45,663	| IOT192 |	Organize your device
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:50,271	| IOT192 |	That is something that I think about but I'm very curious because
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:52,319	| IOT192 |	That is not something my company's
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,855	| IOT192 |	Who I'm buying the products
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:57,439	| IOT192 |	Tell me to do so that feels like not something
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:59,487	| IOT192 |	It feels out of the UL Lane
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:00,255	| IOT192 |	Is that
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:03,583	| IOT192 |	Increasingly though when you buy these smart Spotify
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:09,727	| IOT192 |	Devices there should be Industries user guide
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:16,127	| IOT192 |	Insecure Protocols of protocols being used
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:16,895	| IOT192 |	How to
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:23,039	| IOT192 |	Example use your router together with the product to make sure that it's not recording session is still secure
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:25,343	| IOT192 |	I look forward to that okay
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:27,647	| IOT192 |	When did criticism of UL
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:29,439	| IOT192 |	Is that in order to
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:32,511	| IOT192 |	See the standard you have to pay to get a copy of the license
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:34,815	| IOT192 |	Which makes it really difficult
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:36,607	| IOT192 |	For companies to evaluate
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:37,375	| IOT192 |	Program
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,423	| IOT192 |	And I'm curious how you guys
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:43,007	| IOT192 |	Like when I talk to the security Community they're like well I don't know if it's
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:44,543	| IOT192 |	Straight or not I don't want to buy it
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,847	| IOT192 |	So how do you address that kind of
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:50,175	| IOT192 |	Need for transparency and security with your business motto
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:52,479	| IOT192 |	That's a good question
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:58,879	| IOT192 |	Dennis r u l i p where they're also belong to the community so typically like
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:01,951	| IOT192 |	Standard
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:08,351	| IOT192 |	Requirements and working with industry in the way
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:09,375	| IOT192 |	General Studies
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:13,727	| IOT192 |	Okay and when should we see a finalized version of this
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:19,615	| IOT192 |	Do you want a 900 as a standard and design to it
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:28,319	| IOT192 |	So we gained some traction with that program with that standard and addressing it security
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:30,879	| IOT192 |	Security number of various products
EDL	00:49:30,879	00:49:31,647	| IOT192 |	And embarrassing
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:33,695	| IOT192 |	Stop there
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:36,255	| IOT192 |	So when you really think about it you know adoption
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:37,791	| IOT192 |	Security in a
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:40,607	| IOT192 |	Scalable way
EDL	00:49:40,607	00:49:42,655	| IOT192 |	I really want to work with in this
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,703	| IOT192 |	Leveraging industry programs
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:50,847	| IOT192 |	Example of
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,895	| IOT192 |	Program
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:53,663	| IOT192 |	We Are One
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,735	| IOT192 |	Drive adoption of the program
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:57,759	| IOT192 |	Then Amazon
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:59,039	| IOT192 |	Example
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:00,831	| IOT192 |	Building Alder Alexa
EDL	00:50:00,831	00:50:02,879	| IOT192 |	System they care about device
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:06,463	| IOT192 |	With Alexa and the security of those devices
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:10,815	| IOT192 |	Speaker devices for example we work with Amazon to test those devices
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:13,375	| IOT192 |	Industry initiatives to get to gradle
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:16,447	| IOT192 |	Windows
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:22,079	| IOT192 |	And we also proceed you know developing multiple programs that can really comfortable wide
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:22,591	| IOT192 |	Variety
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:24,639	| IOT192 |	Products that manufacturers
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:26,431	| IOT192 |	Centaur building
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:28,991	| IOT192 |	Security Insurance on Baseline all the way up to
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:29,503	| IOT192 |	Hirelevel
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:30,783	| IOT192 |	Security assurance
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:33,343	| IOT192 |	Okay so if I wanted to look for a
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:35,391	| IOT192 |	UL certified cyber
EDL	00:50:35,391	00:50:36,159	| IOT192 |	Secure
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:41,279	| IOT192 |	Product so if I'm working with my echo devices or something like that I should be looking for
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:42,559	| IOT192 |	UL 2900
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:47,423	| IOT192 |	Yes currently that's or certification program so you can find any you want to know how much
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:53,311	| IOT192 |	Certification database and then
EDL	00:50:53,311	00:50:56,383	| IOT192 |	Including collaboration within the
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:51:00,735	| IOT192 |	Awesome alright we'll come to thank you so much for coming on the show today
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:02,527	| IOT192 |	For sure
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:05,087	| IOT192 |	That's it for this week
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:06,623	| IOT192 |	Thanks so much for listening
