EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| IOT208 |	So
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,584	| IOT208 |	Chris
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,632	| IOT208 |	Let us get started with
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,704	| IOT208 |	News about securing our cars
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,776	| IOT208 |	Didn't which is a security company
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,824	| IOT208 |	They have added a new program
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| IOT208 |	That basically
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,664	| IOT208 |	Brings all of those OBD
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,432	| IOT208 |	To Port
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,968	| IOT208 |	Devices
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:04,576	| IOT208 |	So does things you plug into your car they're connected they can tell you where the car is been they could tell you
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,368	| IOT208 |	How it's breaking all of that
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,904	| IOT208 |	They now tie that into your smartphone
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:08,928	| IOT208 |	What's a villain
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,232	| IOT208 |	Security package you can get
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,512	| IOT208 |	A OBD port
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,048	| IOT208 |	Monitor device and
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:17,376	| IOT208 |	Then it will do things like if someone bumps into your car
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,704	| IOT208 |	It will trigger the accelerometer inside that device
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,728	| IOT208 |	That device
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,288	| IOT208 |	Will go over a cellular modem connection
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:24,800	| IOT208 |	Into the cloud
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,848	| IOT208 |	Clown calls back down to your house
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| IOT208 |	And it turns on
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,152	| IOT208 |	Camera
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,456	| IOT208 |	It's watching your driveway
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,224	| IOT208 |	And it'll be like
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,760	| IOT208 |	Oh dude it was your neighbor
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,272	| IOT208 |	I totally back today
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,552	| IOT208 |	What do you think
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,392	| IOT208 |	Well
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,928	| IOT208 |	Is it something you would get like
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,720	| IOT208 |	Let me ask you that cuz I don't
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,744	| IOT208 |	I don't think I would
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,560	| IOT208 |	But I live in a pretty room
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,584	| IOT208 |	Rural area
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,608	| IOT208 |	So
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,424	| IOT208 |	I'm not as concerned about it but is this something you would want
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,704	| IOT208 |	Plugged in
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,752	| IOT208 |	Tight end do you need to know that much about what's going on
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| IOT208 |	So I don't but I don't park my car in the street
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,104	| IOT208 |	I think if I did
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,128	| IOT208 |	My car in the street
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,152	| IOT208 |	Might be nice
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,944	| IOT208 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,480	| IOT208 |	Apparently
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,040	| IOT208 |	According to the people at Vivint a lot of people
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,600	| IOT208 |	Don't really know much about these OBD
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| IOT208 |	We got to find a better name
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| IOT208 |	I hate saying this
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,744	| IOT208 |	Basically they're little things you plug into your car they're connected usually cellular
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,791	| IOT208 |	Via cellular modems and
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| IOT208 |	Again they monitor where cars been
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,887	| IOT208 |	How fast is going
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,399	| IOT208 |	Breaking
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,935	| IOT208 |	Bumps all kind of
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:30,591	| IOT208 |	We actually just answered a question last week from somebody who's like I'm a teen driver and I'm thinking that might be a good thing to get
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,639	| IOT208 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:36,479	| IOT208 |	Do you need to link it to your house Vivint is going to charge you
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,271	| IOT208 |	$10 a month for
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:43,391	| IOT208 |	One and then $5 a month for every subsequent device you want to connect in through their platform
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,695	| IOT208 |	And then you'll also need a camera
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,231	| IOT208 |	Right pointed at your car
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,255	| IOT208 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,791	| IOT208 |	They also offer that
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,071	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,119	| IOT208 |	I think for some people this is going to be
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,399	| IOT208 |	Relatively
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,167	| IOT208 |	I mean it's
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,703	| IOT208 |	It's not terribly expensive
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,519	| IOT208 |	If you think about like it's got a data plan associated with it.
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,031	| IOT208 |	They're paying
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,311	| IOT208 |	So
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,103	| IOT208 |	Some people will like it there probably like
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:07,967	| IOT208 |	More so than like weren't being worried about their car getting bumped they probably will want
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,783	| IOT208 |	The Peace of Mind of being able to look and see where their car is
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,111	| IOT208 |	I know that because I have a Tesla I can see where the
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| IOT208 |	The Tesla is parked
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,671	| IOT208 |	And so I always know like
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,695	| IOT208 |	Where am I
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:20,255	| IOT208 |	My car is gone with like my husband and child
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,791	| IOT208 |	For they are
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,303	| IOT208 |	Which country
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,119	| IOT208 |	Get you don't part of me
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,423	| IOT208 |	As I think about these things and I think about
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,215	| IOT208 |	Protecting my home
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:33,311	| IOT208 |	And property or whatever I get some point I just I don't want to go down a rabbit hole on it
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,103	| IOT208 |	For something like this
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,407	| IOT208 |	If someone bumped my car and they take off
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,479	| IOT208 |	Do I really want to go through the process of tracking them down
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,015	| IOT208 |	Finding them confronting them
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,319	| IOT208 |	Making it like a big
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:44,831	| IOT208 |	Deal
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,903	| IOT208 |	You know depending on the size with dang
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:51,999	| IOT208 |	Just taking care of it like I just think of the number of times that my car whether I've lived in a city or not
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,535	| IOT208 |	Has actually been hit
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:59,167	| IOT208 |	And you know I don't know this could just be the old curmudgeon in me but I just wear like a you know what sometimes
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:02,751	| IOT208 |	Life happens and I can't prepare for everything and I don't need to know
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:07,103	| IOT208 |	Yeah I don't need to be able to track down whoever done me wrong every single time
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,175	| IOT208 |	I think you wouldn't do it cuz this is not like a
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:15,039	| IOT208 |	A Jack Reacher novel I think what would probably happen is that you would give it to the police in the insurance
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,807	| IOT208 |	Couple and they will take care of
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,391	| IOT208 |	What yeah I know I don't forget I am not saying that I would
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,159	| IOT208 |	I am not saying I would
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,975	| IOT208 |	Right
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,303	| IOT208 |	Yeah it was just a matter of like how much more
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:30,399	| IOT208 |	Work is going to go into it versus just taking care of it and just you know
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:33,471	| IOT208 |	On the ongoing again get ive lived in dense cities
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,495	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:41,151	| IOT208 |	In the case of a car being. Again you said there's something with like a teenager there might be something of value that and maybe
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,967	| IOT208 |	10 years down the road I could see value in it with my own kid
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:48,575	| IOT208 |	But I don't know for right now it's you can really you can over ensure things
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| IOT208 |	Thanks to a point to where it's
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,135	| IOT208 |	Statues of going to happen man
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,719	| IOT208 |	Yes I feel even better about this since you know I'm
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,791	| IOT208 |	Actually going to live near you at some point in the very near-term
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,351	| IOT208 |	If I didn't your car I'm going to be like
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,631	| IOT208 |	Stuff happens
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:07,007	| IOT208 |	If you make the trip to ding my car I'm going to let it go
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,311	| IOT208 |	Did you get to put the work in I'll respect that
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,847	| IOT208 |	Excellent so
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,431	| IOT208 |	In other car related news on Amazon
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:18,783	| IOT208 |	What color Madame a Blog and if you remember what we called
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,087	| IOT208 |	Amazon digital assistant so as not to set off every
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,367	| IOT208 |	Devices
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,695	| IOT208 |	They actually with the launch of the echo Auto
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:29,791	| IOT208 |	Which again I talked about a couple weeks ago cuz I really want Madam and my car
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:31,839	| IOT208 |	Kevin Dixon crazy but I'm all for it
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,119	| IOT208 |	What
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:37,727	| IOT208 |	Madam
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,335	| IOT208 |	To build skills for these devices to recognize what kind of device there are
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:46,175	| IOT208 |	This is really important because it gets to our favorite topic
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,687	| IOT208 |	Fake witches contacts
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,479	| IOT208 |	So if someone
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| IOT208 |	What is the weather
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,855	| IOT208 |	And The Echoes
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,159	| IOT208 |	Realize there in a car
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,463	| IOT208 |	They can pick the most appropriate weather to that low
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:01,535	| IOT208 |	Location or maybe they can tailor something a little bit more specific to
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| IOT208 |	The car
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| IOT208 |	I don't really know what
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| IOT208 |	You would do with weather in the car that was terrible
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,679	| IOT208 |	But this is really good I think it's really
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| IOT208 |	It also
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:15,103	| IOT208 |	Anna speaks to the fact that Madame is getting embedded in more and more devices so this will become more and more important
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,151	| IOT208 |	Because there are certain things you want
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT208 |	If you ask it on like a dick
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:19,967	| IOT208 |	Display
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,759	| IOT208 |	Versus if you ask it
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| IOT208 |	Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,087	| IOT208 |	I don't know if your thoughts
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,623	| IOT208 |	Tennis grass or if you want the ecowatt
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,903	| IOT208 |	Do you want Amazon in
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,463	| IOT208 |	I really don't
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:36,095	| IOT208 |	This whole conversation is setting me up to be an old curmudgeon get off of my lawn
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,375	| IOT208 |	But what I have
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| IOT208 |	So I drive a Chevy Volt
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:42,239	| IOT208 |	I have a hard enough time getting
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| IOT208 |	Carplay to work
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:50,175	| IOT208 |	Like it for some reason I don't know if I just have a bad thing or whatever but it is super infuriating to try and use apple carplay
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,479	| IOT208 |	Play the car if the phone is plugged in
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,783	| IOT208 |	I don't really use all the time needing the
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,831	| IOT208 |	A question answered or some kind of
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,879	| IOT208 |	Smart assistant other than Mike Maps
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,927	| IOT208 |	However what is kind of interesting is if you can
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,463	| IOT208 |	Pull the camera back right
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,767	| IOT208 |	So in terms of contacts
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,583	| IOT208 |	And the assistant and an echo in your car
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| IOT208 |	As Amazon
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,447	| IOT208 |	Start building out more things like an Amazon grocery store
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,471	| IOT208 |	Right
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,287	| IOT208 |	That talks possibly to your
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,335	| IOT208 |	Amazon fridge or Dash replenishment
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:23,455	| IOT208 |	System it could say hey you're near an Amazon grocery remember you needed to get coffee
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:27,039	| IOT208 |	Do you want to pop in and get it we can have somebody waiting for it you know automated I'm just
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,951	| IOT208 |	Obviously a long enough timeline sure
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,023	| IOT208 |	Or just pour the coffee directly into your mouth but
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,327	| IOT208 |	It is interesting to think of context
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,143	| IOT208 |	In terms of connecting all your Amazon Services which I use a lot of
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,703	| IOT208 |	I haven't found that I use
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,775	| IOT208 |	Or have been wanting a smart assistant too much in my car
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,799	| IOT208 |	Let alone one
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:52,895	| IOT208 |	That requires an extra step so I already have carplay so I can use Siri
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,687	| IOT208 |	Whenever I want should I want
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:59,295	| IOT208 |	The idea I get it Siri is not the greatest
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,599	| IOT208 |	Voice Assistant platform in the world however
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,415	| IOT208 |	It is there and four basic questions
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,439	| IOT208 |	She could answer
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,535	| IOT208 |	But can I put a side note in here about the problem with Madam a
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,095	| IOT208 |	Yeah just personal anecdote
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:16,191	| IOT208 |	So I read to my son every night and we are currently reading the Wildwood series of books
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,775	| IOT208 |	And two of the main characters in this book
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,823	| IOT208 |	Are named Alexandra and Alexei
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,895	| IOT208 |	And so when you trying to get your son to go to sleep
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,711	| IOT208 |	And every time you mention one of the characters
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| IOT208 |	And then there's a beep
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,295	| IOT208 |	Because misses a pop song
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| IOT208 |	I just kind of
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,135	| IOT208 |	Authors of the world please stop using those two names
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,183	| IOT208 |	Will my solution for you
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,695	| IOT208 |	Sleepy
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,535	| IOT208 |	Oh yeah I guess I couldn't I would require work
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,815	| IOT208 |	Already got him trained
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| IOT208 |	To say
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:48,447	| IOT208 |	You know my son already knows how to use Alexa I don't need to switch it up on him now
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:53,567	| IOT208 |	I think that would be a lot of fun actually to to suddenly change all the a digital assistant names in your house
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,079	| IOT208 |	Watch how long it
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,151	| IOT208 |	Teehee
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,455	| IOT208 |	Fun up until like 4 in the morning
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:03,295	| IOT208 |	When he wants Astoria is trying to go back to bed and keeps yelling anywhere
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,063	| IOT208 |	Hayward
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,391	| IOT208 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,439	| IOT208 |	Moving along to
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,487	| IOT208 |	Federal government
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,767	| IOT208 |	The US federal government
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,863	| IOT208 |	That's where we are based even though not all of her audience is there
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:17,887	| IOT208 |	This week
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| IOT208 |	For senators
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,215	| IOT208 |	Co-authored and introduced
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:24,543	| IOT208 |	The Internet of Things cybersecurity Improvement Act of
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,055	| IOT208 |	2019
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,615	| IOT208 |	Is the following act when they introduced
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| IOT208 |	T17
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,175	| IOT208 |	Images of
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,943	| IOT208 |	Very different
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,759	| IOT208 |	And I would say it a lot of ways it's much better
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,807	| IOT208 |	The prior act required
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,087	| IOT208 |	Lots of
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,647	| IOT208 |	Things it spent time to finding firmware
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,951	| IOT208 |	Time to finding a server
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:44,255	| IOT208 |	It's bedtime saying hey you
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,327	| IOT208 |	You can't sell a device to the government that has hard-coded passwords in
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,607	| IOT208 |	How to cut of a long list of things
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,679	| IOT208 |	A lot of those things were perfectly fine
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,495	| IOT208 |	The idea of setting
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,007	| IOT208 |	Something like
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,079	| IOT208 |	What you need to be secure and stone like that
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,615	| IOT208 |	Felt really
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| IOT208 |	Dumb
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,431	| IOT208 |	Because security is an ever-changing
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,991	| IOT208 |	Moving Target as it were
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,295	| IOT208 |	We're so this next version basically says
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:07,807	| IOT208 |	Hey
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,391	| IOT208 |	Before the federal government buys connected devices
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,415	| IOT208 |	They need to
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,951	| IOT208 |	Golang
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:19,839	| IOT208 |	Make sure they follow security guidelines that are set forth by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,351	| IOT208 |	Earnest
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| IOT208 |	So
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:25,727	| IOT208 |	When a Sac passes nist has 180 days to basically say
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:28,799	| IOT208 |	Here's some of the rules we think you should follow here some of the vulnerabilities out there
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,591	| IOT208 |	Don't do this
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| IOT208 |	And then
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| IOT208 |	The
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:38,527	| IOT208 |	OMG the Office of Management and budget is going to basically say okay nist thank you and it will tell each agency
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| IOT208 |	How they should follow those rules
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,599	| IOT208 |	And then presumably
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,135	| IOT208 |	The agencies will follow the rules
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,439	| IOT208 |	And then it also says
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,279	| IOT208 |	Over every five years missed Will Come Back in
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,559	| IOT208 |	Do this whole process over again
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,095	| IOT208 |	So it also recognizes the fact
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,887	| IOT208 |	Hey
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| IOT208 |	Security
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,679	| IOT208 |	Again
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:59,519	| IOT208 |	Will change vulnerabilities will change and it lets the government update
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,055	| IOT208 |	In some cases
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,871	| IOT208 |	Industries have been reluctant
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,895	| IOT208 |	Patch because I feel like
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:09,759	| IOT208 |	They're not allowed to patch and in some Industries they're actually not allowed to patch so this could
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,295	| IOT208 |	Possibly alleviate
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,319	| IOT208 |	It's kind of
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,111	| IOT208 |	That's what I said
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,463	| IOT208 |	Do you think five years is too long
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,047	| IOT208 |	But I also think that this is the federal government
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,327	| IOT208 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,375	| IOT208 |	There's a couple things I'd like to say
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,447	| IOT208 |	I'd like to see a budget set aside for something
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,471	| IOT208 |	I like this is part of the bill
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,007	| IOT208 |	Because you know
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,543	| IOT208 |	Unfunded mandates are everybody's
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,615	| IOT208 |	And I would like to see the time limit shrink a little bit
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,663	| IOT208 |	But I recognize
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,175	| IOT208 |	That
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,991	| IOT208 |	When your is huge as the federal government
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| IOT208 |	You can't just be
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,551	| IOT208 |	There is no agile
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,063	| IOT208 |	And the Federal
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:49,439	| IOT208 |	Most companies when I talked to them about how they're thinking about security they're following kind of
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,743	| IOT208 |	A devops or an Agile development Strat
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| IOT208 |	Around it
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,327	| IOT208 |	The government really isn't great at that
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,375	| IOT208 |	I'd love for them to get there but I don't think
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,935	| IOT208 |	A bill is the best place to start
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,447	| IOT208 |	Necessarily
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,263	| IOT208 |	It's like turning a battleship
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:08,383	| IOT208 |	And then turning it again in 5 years and then turn at me like it is there is a lot of inertia behind it
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,199	| IOT208 |	So you said you don't think this is going to go anywhere this bill
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,735	| IOT208 |	You know I don't know
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,015	| IOT208 |	Maybe it will
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:18,623	| IOT208 |	You know what's it's being introduced to both the House and Senate this is a senate version
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,927	| IOT208 |	We'll have to see if it gets too
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| IOT208 |	Committee
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,487	| IOT208 |	I mean it's about darn time
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,511	| IOT208 |	We need something
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:28,095	| IOT208 |	And this is a decent way of going about
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,607	| IOT208 |	Not doing it
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:34,495	| IOT208 |	I don't know if it's goes into effect it won't go into effect until March 31st
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,287	| IOT208 |	But you know
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| IOT208 |	Hey
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,895	| IOT208 |	Almost a year away and government timeline
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,175	| IOT208 |	That is true
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:45,247	| IOT208 |	That's that's pretty good
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:49,855	| IOT208 |	You know what this article got me thinking about I actually grew up in military housing
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:53,439	| IOT208 |	And it got me thinking cuz I know you've written stuff about like
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,999	| IOT208 |	Smart home stuff in apartments
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:58,047	| IOT208 |	And what you can and can't do
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,327	| IOT208 |	But the idea of
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,143	| IOT208 |	You know Security in iot
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:05,471	| IOT208 |	And consumer adoption when that consumer adoption happens to be
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,287	| IOT208 |	On a military base with military families
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:11,359	| IOT208 |	I just thought that was kind of I hadn't thought about before
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,895	| IOT208 |	Because you never ate while I am
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| IOT208 |	Confident
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,943	| IOT208 |	But you know
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,503	| IOT208 |	People aren't spilling Secrets over the dinner table
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,295	| IOT208 |	Are you dumb
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,599	| IOT208 |	In military housing you know there are still
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:27,487	| IOT208 |	People get together and chat and if you've got microphones everywhere that's just I wonder if there are any
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,279	| IOT208 |	Regulations around that
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,839	| IOT208 |	What people are allowed and aren't allowed to do
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:34,911	| IOT208 |	I'm sure people have thought about it but it just something you know
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,703	| IOT208 |	I never thought about you know
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:43,103	| IOT208 |	Growing up we didn't have these kind of things but they're still especially with like the nest Revelation and I don't know if you would put a nest if you were in a
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,127	| IOT208 |	Military home buy
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,175	| IOT208 |	I don't know maybe you like to Tinker and you would
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:51,551	| IOT208 |	Or just an echo device listens to the show military housing
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:57,183	| IOT208 |	Let us know do you have an attitude or their documents are guidelines about that sort of thing
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,231	| IOT208 |	I know that the
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:02,559	| IOT208 |	Department of Defense after the whole Strava
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,327	| IOT208 |	That really wasn't
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:03,839	| IOT208 |	And it was just
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| IOT208 |	Widespread release of public data on
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,447	| IOT208 |	The Strava running app
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,007	| IOT208 |	And then it showed
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,823	| IOT208 |	The location of military bases could be
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,847	| IOT208 |	Construed from looking at
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,431	| IOT208 |	Everybody
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,967	| IOT208 |	Don't use Strava
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:24,319	| IOT208 |	Especially if you running on an undisclosed military base
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,111	| IOT208 |	Which
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:30,463	| IOT208 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,743	| IOT208 |	Let us know
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,535	| IOT208 |	Can call and tell us something
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:35,071	| IOT208 |	Flight at 5 12623
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,583	| IOT208 |	7
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,119	| IOT208 |	That was early
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,959	| IOT208 |	Okay another piece of legislation
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,751	| IOT208 |	We're not just caring about internet
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:44,287	| IOT208 |	Security
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| IOT208 |	We are also caring about
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,383	| IOT208 |	Facial recognition
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:52,735	| IOT208 |	So I think it was last week Kevin and I talked about using facial recognition
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,807	| IOT208 |	US airports for
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:59,135	| IOT208 |	Basically tracking people as they come into the country to make sure they're not on
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,415	| IOT208 |	Crazy watch list
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:01,695	| IOT208 |	We were like
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:02,719	| IOT208 |	Hey
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,047	| IOT208 |	That's kind of iffy because nobody actually
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,071	| IOT208 |	With the none of this went through public
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| IOT208 |	Comment
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:13,215	| IOT208 |	I'm and there were no limitations placed on the Airlines and how they decided to use that facial
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,727	| IOT208 |	Recognition data
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,007	| IOT208 |	So
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,031	| IOT208 |	Kevin and I worry
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:16,543	| IOT208 |	We're not in Peru
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,079	| IOT208 |	But
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,359	| IOT208 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,151	| IOT208 |	Might have
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:21,663	| IOT208 |	I don't know what real
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,455	| IOT208 |	This
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:26,783	| IOT208 |	Is a bipartisan acts that means a Democrat and a Republican
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,343	| IOT208 |	Holy cow working together submitted this
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,903	| IOT208 |	This is the commercial facial recognition privacy
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,463	| IOT208 |	And basically
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:34,975	| IOT208 |	It's
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,535	| IOT208 |	Saying that users would be notified
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:41,375	| IOT208 |	Whenever their facial recognition data is used or collected
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:44,447	| IOT208 |	This is also part of the backlash we saw
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,471	| IOT208 |	Probably a week ago
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| IOT208 |	About
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,799	| IOT208 |	IBM pulling data from
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,311	| IOT208 |	Flickr
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,591	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,127	| IOT208 |	Using that to build
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,407	| IOT208 |	Best biased
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,687	| IOT208 |	Facial recognition
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:58,783	| IOT208 |	And people who had their photos on Flickr we're kind of like
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,343	| IOT208 |	Hey what you did what with my foot but I didn't say
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:01,855	| IOT208 |	Yes to that
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,135	| IOT208 |	And it upset people
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,183	| IOT208 |	So this law would prevent that
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,023	| IOT208 |	Again who knows if it will pass
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| IOT208 |	It could be useful
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:10,815	| IOT208 |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,351	| IOT208 |	You want to get currently
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:15,679	| IOT208 |	So let's tie this in with the Vivint story from earlier
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:22,079	| IOT208 |	How does that work in terms of like if your facial if your security camera captures my face
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| IOT208 |	And is used
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,943	| IOT208 |	Howl like a bystander basically captures a bystander
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:30,271	| IOT208 |	In a case like that my hunches
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,831	| IOT208 |	If your Vivid you can't actually use that
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,367	| IOT208 |	Image data
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,647	| IOT208 |	From that camera
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,671	| IOT208 |	To train an algorithm
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,719	| IOT208 |	For facial
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,511	| IOT208 |	Cognition
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,559	| IOT208 |	Use a facial recognition
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,095	| IOT208 |	Let's say you have a database
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:47,423	| IOT208 |	You probably couldn't run it against a database
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,495	| IOT208 |	Especially for a consumer used in the
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:51,519	| IOT208 |	Or something like that
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,311	| IOT208 |	Is my gas without permission
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,103	| IOT208 |	Like I have cameras that record
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,151	| IOT208 |	But I have actually opted
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,455	| IOT208 |	And I've tried
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:01,503	| IOT208 |	Help me hear
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,807	| IOT208 |	He helped me understand the importance of it
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,319	| IOT208 |	Because
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,367	| IOT208 |	There are so many things
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,903	| IOT208 |	But I know I should care about
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:14,815	| IOT208 |	And this is one where I just had sort of resigned myself and it's like I'm always going to be under surveillance I'm always somebody's always going to be
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,095	| IOT208 |	The appearing somewhere on
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,375	| IOT208 |	Camera at some point
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,167	| IOT208 |	And it's going to be used for something
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| IOT208 |	And I know I should
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:24,799	| IOT208 |	Mindful and care about it I get the big like macro pictures and
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,847	| IOT208 |	Issues surrounding it but help me like
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,895	| IOT208 |	Help me want to
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,711	| IOT208 |	You care more about it
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,551	| IOT208 |	I think surveillance in public areas is something that has
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,367	| IOT208 |	We all acknowledge that there are cameras everywhere
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:40,415	| IOT208 |	There are fewer actually in the US Senate
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,463	| IOT208 |	Places that there are cameras everywhere in Pueblo
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:46,815	| IOT208 |	The question is if you are going to use facial
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,839	| IOT208 |	Recognition ansan
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,911	| IOT208 |	Right now the cameras just see you going about you
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,447	| IOT208 |	Your day but the computer system doesn't
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,007	| IOT208 |	Special recognition
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:55,775	| IOT208 |	The system
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,055	| IOT208 |	With tag you
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,335	| IOT208 |	And what's
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,615	| IOT208 |	Really worrisome to lots of pee
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,175	| IOT208 |	Is it might tag you and also have
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,479	| IOT208 |	Scary information about you
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| IOT208 |	Even this is actually happening
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,527	| IOT208 |	King in China so
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,551	| IOT208 |	It might be like
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,063	| IOT208 |	Oh
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| IOT208 |	That guy walking
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,879	| IOT208 |	Where is Chris Albrecht
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,903	| IOT208 |	And he has a parking
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,183	| IOT208 |	At the
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,975	| IOT208 |	In the city of Seattle
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,487	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,559	| IOT208 |	He is delinquent on his student loans
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,839	| IOT208 |	That it might share that information
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:20,351	| IOT208 |	Information with people
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,655	| IOT208 |	So the key
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,423	| IOT208 |	Here I think
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,983	| IOT208 |	Isn't the surveillance other that's good
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| IOT208 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,311	| IOT208 |	It's the surveillance of the actual knowledge
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:34,175	| IOT208 |	And the ability to tie that knowledge to other data to derive insights about you
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,943	| IOT208 |	That is so
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,455	| IOT208 |	Worrisome to me
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,247	| IOT208 |	Part of me is just like
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,063	| IOT208 |	You actually
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:43,903	| IOT208 |	Bring up a really great points right at I totally understand that
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,439	| IOT208 |	And it's also
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,231	| IOT208 |	Target has feels like it's a sort of
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT208 |	Inevitable
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,351	| IOT208 |	And bearing down on us and I realized that the sort of an A-list a point of view but like
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,167	| IOT208 |	What chance does this bill have of passing out
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,703	| IOT208 |	In its current form
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:00,031	| IOT208 |	Probably not much although both Texas and
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:00,543	| IOT208 |	I believe it's
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,567	| IOT208 |	Iowa
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:05,151	| IOT208 |	It's a nice State there's Iowa Idaho in
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| IOT208 |	Illinois
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| IOT208 |	Illinois
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,223	| IOT208 |	It's Illinois
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:13,087	| IOT208 |	However it is Illinois in Texas
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:13,855	| IOT208 |	Have
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,416	| IOT208 |	Laws actually against collecting and using
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,744	| IOT208 |	Which means like cool things like
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,048	| IOT208 |	Google look like your art
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:25,632	| IOT208 |	It was a Google thing a couple years ago were there like what
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,656	| IOT208 |	Art do you look like
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,192	| IOT208 |	You take a picture and it would
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,960	| IOT208 |	Show you
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:31,264	| IOT208 |	That was actually just a grab to get a bunch of a state
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,800	| IOT208 |	And also I'm sorry
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| IOT208 |	Sorry show you the world's museums
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:38,176	| IOT208 |	So stuff like that wasn't actually legal in those places so I couldn't do it
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,688	| IOT208 |	For example
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,736	| IOT208 |	There are rules about that
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,528	| IOT208 |	That I think we're actually going to come down for
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| IOT208 |	Pretty hard on
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,088	| IOT208 |	Not necessarily the surveillance
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,880	| IOT208 |	But how we link
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:53,024	| IOT208 |	That surveillance to knowledge and especially how we link the knowledge of who a person is to other data
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,608	| IOT208 |	That third step is really what
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,120	| IOT208 |	Is dicey
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,168	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:02,496	| IOT208 |	Is very easily done but I don't think we're going to do it except in a few
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:06,080	| IOT208 |	Cases I do think we'll probably do it wherever lights to light
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,616	| IOT208 |	Like security inside countries
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:12,224	| IOT208 |	Maybe there will be places where when you enter them you'll have to voluntarily sign
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:12,992	| IOT208 |	Away those rights
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:16,320	| IOT208 |	And that's going to feel kind of iffy
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,344	| IOT208 |	Weird and we may not
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:17,856	| IOT208 |	I like that
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:18,880	| IOT208 |	Right
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:19,904	| IOT208 |	But that's my thought
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,184	| IOT208 |	Maybe look at you go to school
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,464	| IOT208 |	Pick up your kid
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,256	| IOT208 |	It's so creepy I don't like it
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,024	| IOT208 |	You convinced me
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,816	| IOT208 |	Have I
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:29,376	| IOT208 |	You can't just be like I was going to happen
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,520	| IOT208 |	To not be seen
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,872	| IOT208 |	That's staying in
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,152	| IOT208 |	It yes yes it will
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| IOT208 |	In other news
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:46,016	| IOT208 |	A video did a big conference this weekend at it
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,040	| IOT208 |	They announced
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,064	| IOT208 |	The Jetsons
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,832	| IOT208 |	Nano
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,904	| IOT208 |	Device this is basically machine learning at the edge which
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:54,208	| IOT208 |	Holy cow might sound familiar cuz we talked about it with
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,512	| IOT208 |	Google's Coral project
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,280	| IOT208 |	I believe it was last week
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:00,608	| IOT208 |	And then we've also talked about it with Intel's movidius project
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,424	| IOT208 |	This is noteworthy because
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,448	| IOT208 |	A lot
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,472	| IOT208 |	Of people
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,800	| IOT208 |	Industrial iot are using Nvidia Jetson
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:13,152	| IOT208 |	They have a board basically and people are building a lot of industrial iot gateways on
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,432	| IOT208 |	Because it is
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,736	| IOT208 |	Crazy powerful
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,528	| IOT208 |	This is $99
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:23,648	| IOT208 |	Can basically get you 472 gigaflops of computing power
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:28,000	| IOT208 |	It's got a quad-core arm a57 processor
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:31,072	| IOT208 |	Set 128 quart Nvidia Maxwell GPU
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,120	| IOT208 |	And 4 gigabytes of
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,144	| IOT208 |	Ram
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,448	| IOT208 |	It's going to support tensorflow
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| IOT208 |	Caffe
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:40,544	| IOT208 |	Pytorch all these other Frameworks for AI
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:41,824	| IOT208 |	This is going to be crazy
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,616	| IOT208 |	You will have to plug it in
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,432	| IOT208 |	This is not battery powered
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,760	| IOT208 |	This is going to be awesome
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,784	| IOT208 |	It should open
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,064	| IOT208 |	Machine learning at the edge
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,600	| IOT208 |	Uptmor peep
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:58,720	| IOT208 |	Cuz the original boards for like three hundred and $400 so you actually in a lot of cases had to
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,000	| IOT208 |	Requisition
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,304	| IOT208 |	But this at a hundred bucks
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,840	| IOT208 |	Easy peasy
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,888	| IOT208 |	You just go out and get one and you play with it and you do something cool
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:11,264	| IOT208 |	$250 autonomous robotics kit
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,592	| IOT208 |	And if you want to play with that
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:18,176	| IOT208 |	And it also has like a little robot chassis Motors
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,200	| IOT208 |	Battery pack
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,736	| IOT208 |	It's battery powered
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,064	| IOT208 |	And you can build your own little robot
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:27,904	| IOT208 |	I don't know Chris Do you want to build your own robot maybe you or your son
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:31,488	| IOT208 |	You know we've gone through that phase and you build it and then
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,048	| IOT208 |	You kind of make it move back and forth and get a little bits one
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,352	| IOT208 |	R2D2 little bits
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:40,448	| IOT208 |	He programmed it
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,984	| IOT208 |	So
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,544	| IOT208 |	Now I have a dismantled R2D2 sitting in a box somewhere
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,336	| IOT208 |	But I want to know
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:46,848	| IOT208 |	Like this
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:50,176	| IOT208 |	Explain to me just cuz you know obviously I don't write about iot
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,992	| IOT208 |	And all this industrial stuff can you tell me what it like
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,808	| IOT208 |	Are there other products like this out there
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,320	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:59,648	| IOT208 |	Where do you think the big opportunity for this Nano is
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:03,488	| IOT208 |	So there are there's like a pension the Intel movidius stick
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,536	| IOT208 |	And the Google
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,048	| IOT208 |	Oral
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:11,168	| IOT208 |	And I think the opportunity for this is basically for people who are both obvious
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,448	| IOT208 |	It also
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:16,800	| IOT208 |	People inside companies that are trying to figure out how to use iot
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,848	| IOT208 |	They're the people who these things are
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,408	| IOT208 |	And the idea is
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,944	| IOT208 |	You will say to yourself
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,712	| IOT208 |	Man
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:26,016	| IOT208 |	If I you know I got this great model
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:29,600	| IOT208 |	It says if my engine sounds like this could you put some kush
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,136	| IOT208 |	That it's going to fail with it
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,160	| IOT208 |	2 days
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,184	| IOT208 |	And
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,976	| IOT208 |	If I could just get something
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,280	| IOT208 |	To recognize that could chunk chunk chunk
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,072	| IOT208 |	And then send an alert
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,608	| IOT208 |	We have this awesome monitoring system
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,144	| IOT208 |	And so
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,448	| IOT208 |	What you would do is you would basically
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| IOT208 |	Train it to
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,752	| IOT208 |	Recognize that ketchup Coachella
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,824	| IOT208 |	And put it on this device and then stick this device
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,848	| IOT208 |	Somewhere near your mission
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| IOT208 |	And then all of a sudden you've got this late
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,432	| IOT208 |	Maybe you spent like
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,712	| IOT208 |	130 bucks
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:58,528	| IOT208 |	Are they monitoring project save you some serious down
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:25:59,808	| IOT208 |	That's the idea
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| IOT208 |	Is that
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:03,648	| IOT208 |	You'll find all kinds of crazy use cases
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,696	| IOT208 |	That you never even thought of
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,720	| IOT208 |	Before and
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,256	| IOT208 |	You'll do it because it's cheap and
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,304	| IOT208 |	And I think that's right
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,584	| IOT208 |	Oh good
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,864	| IOT208 |	Is it out now
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,400	| IOT208 |	Is not available
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,936	| IOT208 |	Today at you can pre-order it
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:18,240	| IOT208 |	On the Nvidia website and it supposed to ship
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,264	| IOT208 |	At the end of March
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,312	| IOT208 |	You probably should by now be
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,640	| IOT208 |	Because I remember when Intel launch their movidius stick
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,200	| IOT208 |	Get on it
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:27,712	| IOT208 |	You guys
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,248	| IOT208 |	All right
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,272	| IOT208 |	Next up

EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,392	| IOT208 |	Rejoice
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:39,232	| IOT208 |	Because fibaro which makes a line of popular Z-Wave
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,000	| IOT208 |	Sensors
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:46,912	| IOT208 |	They have finally collaborated with SmartThings so you no longer have to download basically these separate device Handler stick
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:50,240	| IOT208 |	Get the football gear to work as intended on the SmartThings platform
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,288	| IOT208 |	Yay
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,824	| IOT208 |	That's basically all we have
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| IOT208 |	And then in other
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,152	| IOT208 |	Sun News
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,176	| IOT208 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,712	| IOT208 |	Is announcing a new
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,272	| IOT208 |	System-on-a-chip DQ SC400
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:09,184	| IOT208 |	It is basically going to go its design for smart speakers and it should let them hear you better even with background
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,976	| IOT208 |	And it should
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:13,024	| IOT208 |	Let them basically respond a little bit more
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,536	| IOT208 |	Quickly to you
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:17,632	| IOT208 |	Yay so so yes please
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,424	| IOT208 |	It's incremental but it's important increments
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:23,008	| IOT208 |	Yeah no like anything that improves that
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,312	| IOT208 |	To get cuz you can just stand in our house
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,872	| IOT208 |	If someone says misses a or
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:32,736	| IOT208 |	You know the mr. G or Miss G or gender-neutral Geodon
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,528	| IOT208 |	Locate Haji
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,600	| IOT208 |	Then you know there's nothing more frustrating
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,136	| IOT208 |	For both the person trying to
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:45,536	| IOT208 |	Ask a question or listening to that person ask a question then not finding that connection right not being heard
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,352	| IOT208 |	And then having to repeat it anyway I'm just saying there's no down
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,704	| IOT208 |	You're right there isn't a downside and they announce
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,240	| IOT208 |	Another new chip
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:57,056	| IOT208 |	Fit basically it puts a higher-quality amplifier
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,592	| IOT208 |	On your smarts
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,360	| IOT208 |	Speaker switch
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,408	| IOT208 |	It's not going to be magic
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:05,760	| IOT208 |	You know you're not going to suddenly have these masterful Bose sound systems or anything but
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,552	| IOT208 |	It will sound better
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:11,136	| IOT208 |	So go Qualcomm for incremental improvements to Smart speakers
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:14,720	| IOT208 |	This was a category that did not exist a few years ago and now we're at
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:17,792	| IOT208 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,144	| IOT208 |	What are you listen to your music on now
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:29,312	| IOT208 |	In-ceiling speakers that are powered by my Sonos we almost exclusively listen to it on
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,360	| IOT208 |	On the echo or the Google
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,152	| IOT208 |	Yeah I am the same way
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,944	| IOT208 |	Just to make you sad
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,504	| IOT208 |	You know what actually it doesn't cuz I sold
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,040	| IOT208 |	Oh that my Sonos stuff
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:43,648	| IOT208 |	A while back but it was amazing how quickly I've gave up Fidelity for
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,160	| IOT208 |	Convenience
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,488	| IOT208 |	Don't let your wife
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,048	| IOT208 |	All right
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,328	| IOT208 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| IOT208 |	Cool thing that I would totally Buy
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,424	| IOT208 |	I don't know about you
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:59,008	| IOT208 |	So this is a Kickstarter I'm going to tell you that so you don't
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,336	| IOT208 |	This is not something that may ever come to
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:04,640	| IOT208 |	Fruition however I thought it was so darn cute.
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,152	| IOT208 |	And I really want one
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,944	| IOT208 |	This is a therapy dog
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,992	| IOT208 |	It is called the tomboc puppy
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,040	| IOT208 |	It is being funded now in
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:11,808	| IOT208 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:16,416	| IOT208 |	It has reached its $20,000 goal and basically this is a $500 robot
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,696	| IOT208 |	Puppy
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,720	| IOT208 |	Is 4
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:21,536	| IOT208 |	Patients with dementia and Alzheimer's and it just interacts with them
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,328	| IOT208 |	It's dark cute
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:26,912	| IOT208 |	Man I just wanted and I think my daughter would want it because
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,192	| IOT208 |	Bissell Pet
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,728	| IOT208 |	That flaps its ears up and down at
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,752	| IOT208 |	Looks adorable
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:35,616	| IOT208 |	It's kind of like the aibo except it's only going to be like $500 when it launches its
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,640	| IOT208 |	$300 if
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,664	| IOT208 |	Support the kickstarter
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,688	| IOT208 |	But
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,992	| IOT208 |	I really well and also it's got fur
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,808	| IOT208 |	Ribose just digit hard plastic
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,344	| IOT208 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,112	| IOT208 |	Exactly
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,648	| IOT208 |	It's it's just supposed to be this
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,416	| IOT208 |	Companion dog
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:49,440	| IOT208 |	I mean
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,464	| IOT208 |	Yeah I want it
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:53,792	| IOT208 |	I don't know if I told the guy it is hard for me to
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,840	| IOT208 |	Dump on this idea when it's
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:30:01,216	| IOT208 |	For the target audience where you know it's older people with dementia who just needs a companion in this
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,776	| IOT208 |	Potentially provide some sort of relief
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:04,800	| IOT208 |	It's just a bummer that it
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,360	| IOT208 |	On Kickstarter because
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:11,456	| IOT208 |	Kickstarter I just I write about projects at Hardware projects in particular
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,760	| IOT208 |	On Kickstarter that just
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,040	| IOT208 |	Never see the light of day
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,344	| IOT208 |	Because people just miss
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,880	| IOT208 |	Plan in terms of
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,928	| IOT208 |	How much manufacturing is going to cost and what
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,464	| IOT208 |	Things are going to happen
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:29,376	| IOT208 |	But it is cute and it certainly is something that you know for me I wouldn't get it on to let it out at the middle
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,656	| IOT208 |	Schneider you don't have to
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,704	| IOT208 |	Board it when you go on vacation
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,520	| IOT208 |	Now
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:40,384	| IOT208 |	That probably doesn't for this week's news announcements let's go now to our

EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:33,120	| IOT208 |	This week's voicemail is from
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,632	| IOT208 |	Casey
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| IOT208 |	Hey Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,704	| IOT208 |	Circassian
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,728	| IOT208 |	Welcome uses
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,008	| IOT208 |	On the show
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,800	| IOT208 |	I'm receiving emails from Monoprice
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,640	| IOT208 |	I see things from their overtime
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:47,456	| IOT208 |	And I see that they have some kind of
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,480	| IOT208 |	Smart home home automation
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:53,088	| IOT208 |	I haven't really been able to find much information on it so
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:55,136	| IOT208 |	If you have a chance
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:58,208	| IOT208 |	Okay Casey I looked up this
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:58,720	| IOT208 |	Product
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:03,584	| IOT208 |	Bee Stitch by Monoprice and it sounds kind of good right you're like
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,864	| IOT208 |	Hey it's a hubless
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,656	| IOT208 |	Sensor thing
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,680	| IOT208 |	Sensor Network
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,704	| IOT208 |	Yay
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:11,008	| IOT208 |	The pricing is not unreasonable it's in Lima
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:11,520	| IOT208 |	With other devices
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,080	| IOT208 |	But my concern here
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,360	| IOT208 |	Is twofold one is Wi-Fi
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:18,944	| IOT208 |	Which means a lot of these sensors that you place around your house
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:23,552	| IOT208 |	Depending on how enthusiastic you get your going to have to change their batteries probably within six to eight months is
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:28,672	| IOT208 |	And that may be fine for one particular sensor but I'm going to tell you
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,464	| IOT208 |	When you have a bunch of these
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,256	| IOT208 |	Or if you have one another
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,536	| IOT208 |	Place where it goes off often
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,072	| IOT208 |	It's going to happen
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:36,352	| IOT208 |	Rapidly and you're going to get really
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,936	| IOT208 |	So that's why WI-Fi sensors I tend to
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:40,960	| IOT208 |	Billy just not go
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,496	| IOT208 |	So that's one part
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,056	| IOT208 |	I feel like the Grinch yourself
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,080	| IOT208 |	Think I'm the commissioner now
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:47,872	| IOT208 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:50,432	| IOT208 |	I don't know who makes this and
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,968	| IOT208 |	I don't like that
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:54,784	| IOT208 |	I don't like that there's not a lot of information
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:57,088	| IOT208 |	In here about the underlined platform
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,600	| IOT208 |	Provider
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,904	| IOT208 |	I don't see a lot about it
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,696	| IOT208 |	It's security efforts
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,000	| IOT208 |	Usually when I look for a product
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:06,048	| IOT208 |	Smart home product I try to
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:06,816	| IOT208 |	Google
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,096	| IOT208 |	The maker obviously
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,632	| IOT208 |	And I look for hay
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,680	| IOT208 |	Does it have a bug Bounty program
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:14,240	| IOT208 |	If there has been a vulnerability disclosure
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,776	| IOT208 |	How is it handled it
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:19,104	| IOT208 |	What other people say about how it handles it I look for information about a
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,896	| IOT208 |	Encryption I didn't see anything
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,664	| IOT208 |	2
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,200	| IOT208 |	I have some questions about
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,968	| IOT208 |	I thought overall security
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,248	| IOT208 |	Against you made
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:28,320	| IOT208 |	Those are kind of thoughts in
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,624	| IOT208 |	I also just looking at it
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,648	| IOT208 |	It got really terrible
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:36,768	| IOT208 |	And for the price I would recommend going with something
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:40,864	| IOT208 |	That maybe isn't Wi-Fi maybe do Abode that is a wonderful system
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,400	| IOT208 |	People love it
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,424	| IOT208 |	It's high performance
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:47,264	| IOT208 |	If you're focused mostly on security than do SimpliSafe
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:51,360	| IOT208 |	It's another option if you really want smart home automation efforts
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,896	| IOT208 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:55,456	| IOT208 |	Has a learning curve but it's pretty high quality
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,272	| IOT208 |	And Kevin if he were here would tell you
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,552	| IOT208 |	Hey there's always the wink
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,880	| IOT208 |	And I wouldn't especially type in on this thinking that
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:04,928	| IOT208 |	You're going to build it and it will work for a while
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:09,280	| IOT208 |	And now it's time to say goodbye to

EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:49,376	| IOT208 |	The bank of things in the work you guys did with Mitsubishi bank and we also talked about building a platform
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,144	| IOT208 |	Approach
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:50,912	| IOT208 |	Chayote
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,472	| IOT208 |	This week I'd like to talk to you about
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,496	| IOT208 |	Radios
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:55,264	| IOT208 |	But
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,032	| IOT208 |	First
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:59,360	| IOT208 |	I'd love for you to remind our listeners what it is that a pharaoh does
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:02,432	| IOT208 |	Acero provides an iot platform
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,968	| IOT208 |	Simplify
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:07,296	| IOT208 |	How you connect anything to the internet we can help you build

EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:14,976	| IOT208 |	For whatever your connect
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:15,488	| IOT208 |	The product is
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,560	| IOT208 |	Our customers tell us that a pharaoh is the best choice
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,584	| IOT208 |	Sprint user experience
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,632	| IOT208 |	And developer productivity
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:23,424	| IOT208 |	It's also beautifully designed
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,448	| IOT208 |	Really easy to use
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,728	| IOT208 |	Fast
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,752	| IOT208 |	Very very secure
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,544	| IOT208 |	So down onto the radio
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:32,896	| IOT208 |	Recently I did an article that talks about combining bleh
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:39,296	| IOT208 |	And cellular on the same chip in the main point was that you could get to the internet through Bluetooth
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,112	| IOT208 |	And last week you actually made a pass a Brethren stew
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,648	| IOT208 |	Solution that your team
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,160	| IOT208 |	He created a
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| IOT208 |	So what's your take
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:47,744	| IOT208 |	Bluetooth or
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:52,864	| IOT208 |	Specifically ble Bluetooth low energy is really interesting technology because
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:54,400	| IOT208 |	We've already got it and all of our smart
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:59,776	| IOT208 |	And you can probably guess from the name Lou energy it uses very little power so
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,056	| IOT208 |	You can build battery operated
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,360	| IOT208 |	Is that run for a long time but
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,640	| IOT208 |	Unlike
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,432	| IOT208 |	Networking Technologies such as
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:11,040	| IOT208 |	Is LTE or WiFi ble devices don't connect to the internet Direct
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,064	| IOT208 |	Play it on their own
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:14,880	| IOT208 |	They need to have some help you use a pharaoh
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,648	| IOT208 |	We provide
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,928	| IOT208 |	Technology in the form of
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,440	| IOT208 |	The software St
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,512	| IOT208 |	That you can embed in your mobile application
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,048	| IOT208 |	To enable
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:22,816	| IOT208 |	Pharaoh power
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,352	| IOT208 |	Ble device
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:27,168	| IOT208 |	To securely and automatically
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,472	| IOT208 |	Connect through whatever connection
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:31,264	| IOT208 |	Caesars mobile phone already has
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,336	| IOT208 |	What Pharaoh was really done is
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:38,432	| IOT208 |	Created a custom ble profile that not only ensures that
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:38,944	| IOT208 |	Secure connection
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,480	| IOT208 |	But also enables
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:44,064	| IOT208 |	Acero ble devices and gateways such as phones
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,856	| IOT208 |	To find each other
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:46,880	| IOT208 |	And set up internet
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:47,904	| IOT208 |	Connections automatically
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,184	| IOT208 |	This way
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:53,536	| IOT208 |	As your phone comes within range of these Sakura Pharaoh ble device
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,864	| IOT208 |	They will automatically form a connection back
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:57,632	| IOT208 |	To the internet
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:38:01,216	| IOT208 |	Using policies that are entirely set and governed by rules
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:02,752	| IOT208 |	Running in the cloud
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,800	| IOT208 |	We call a table for a fair of ele
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,616	| IOT208 |	That sounds a lot like what we talked about
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:10,688	| IOT208 |	When we talked about the bank of things idea
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:13,760	| IOT208 |	Let's talk a little bit about data piece of AI
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:19,392	| IOT208 |	Before we go please remind us where people can go to get more information
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,440	| IOT208 |	Sounds great Stacy

EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,448	| IOT208 |	We're going to be talking
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:08,544	| IOT208 |	Why it's so hard to sell connected devices at retail
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:11,360	| IOT208 |	And get a little bit more information on these blinds
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,152	| IOT208 |	When is super excited about
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,712	| IOT208 |	Let's start with the Kinect
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:17,504	| IOT208 |	Sublime's what was your vision there
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:24,672	| IOT208 |	But I think it's coming back to what we always do at Ikea Wheatley always start with the dilemmas
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:27,488	| IOT208 |	I'm trying to solve problem to make things better
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:32,608	| IOT208 |	That was really the starting point for our connected lines as well as well
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:34,912	| IOT208 |	Spotlighting
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:37,984	| IOT208 |	Are equate severe on and how to make people feel
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,288	| IOT208 |	Safe at home using using lighting
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:43,616	| IOT208 |	The journey started
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,176	| IOT208 |	Many years ago when Ikea actually on the
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:47,456	| IOT208 |	Norma blinds
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:53,344	| IOT208 |	Took away the street
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,624	| IOT208 |	Help with children and so on
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,952	| IOT208 |	Same day dental course you can have applications
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:59,232	| IOT208 |	Are you completely blind
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,768	| IOT208 |	If you don't have the strength to
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,536	| IOT208 |	To put it down
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:04,608	| IOT208 |	And that is a little bit of a problem at home
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:08,448	| IOT208 |	And coming together with us working with HomeSmart what we
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,984	| IOT208 |	The wireless
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:12,032	| IOT208 |	We can actually control things
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:14,336	| IOT208 |	Atwood
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:17,152	| IOT208 |	Adding the two and say why don't we start controlling the blinds
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,688	| IOT208 |	In a wireless
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:23,552	| IOT208 |	I need to reach them you can just use voice or use the app
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:26,880	| IOT208 |	Controlling
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,696	| IOT208 |	Journey together without fencing
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,744	| IOT208 |	Textile department at Ikea where
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:34,560	| IOT208 |	What they seek the old insights and knowledge that you need to know about
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:38,400	| IOT208 |	Rolling up and down the blinds will put it down the correct answer
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:43,520	| IOT208 |	And so on so it's
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:48,384	| IOT208 |	Publix we took it on as a Sears task and wanted to make sure that we don't something that is said
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:50,944	| IOT208 |	12 class and then the u16 status
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,456	| IOT208 |	Street tacos
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:55,296	| IOT208 |	I feel like when I visited Ikea about a year ago
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:41:01,440	| IOT208 |	I saw an early iteration of them and it was kind of very exciting for me because it was a huge Prada
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:05,792	| IOT208 |	The people have been demanding for a long time in the smart home space
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,096	| IOT208 |	And I'm curious what did you learn
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,632	| IOT208 |	Along the way
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,192	| IOT208 |	Have superheroes relief
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:15,776	| IOT208 |	Really fun having you in Alma Thomas Estates it was a privilege to
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:19,360	| IOT208 |	Show Yorkie and that's kind of hard to like Kia Soul. You have to come
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:21,408	| IOT208 |	And the connected lines
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:22,944	| IOT208 |	Associative starting with that
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:26,784	| IOT208 |	I shouldn't say simple tasks but at least a fairly commission will be want to touch it
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,344	| IOT208 |	If you going to
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:32,160	| IOT208 |	Dual Wireless blind there's no point having
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:32,672	| IOT208 |	Apollo Court
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,488	| IOT208 |	Because then you're
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:38,304	| IOT208 |	Norman string to pull them up and down you get the power cord
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:43,424	| IOT208 |	We learn from amanda initiativ stats
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,704	| IOT208 |	Taking away
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,520	| IOT208 |	Power chords it's a good way of making your home more beautiful
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,336	| IOT208 |	So we need to put the task and then
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,384	| IOT208 |	The challenge quite high in order to make them
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:58,015	| IOT208 |	Completely wireless so will therefore we also put the bar saying that they needed to be battery operated
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,039	| IOT208 |	We don't know
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:01,599	| IOT208 |	Do you know how big
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,111	| IOT208 |	Can you make
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,927	| IOT208 |	The power pack and how long should it last
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:09,023	| IOT208 |	How often do you need to recharge the battery because we don't want that disposable batteries
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:13,887	| IOT208 |	So we put the ball really high to make
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:20,031	| IOT208 |	Blind that works in many locations is super easy to install completely wireless
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:22,847	| IOT208 |	I bought some the control limits on the power perspective
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:28,479	| IOT208 |	Visa to recharge and so on so you continue to use it over and over and over again
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:29,759	| IOT208 |	A bit of a challenge of course
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,551	| IOT208 |	But right now
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:35,391	| IOT208 |	What we have learned
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:36,159	| IOT208 |	Again
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,951	| IOT208 |	Good-looking and I can't stop.
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,487	| IOT208 |	We're going to try to be stubborn about
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:43,583	| IOT208 |	Not letting go of a functionality and also not letting go
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:47,679	| IOT208 |	Leading with the lowest price sewing
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,215	| IOT208 |	We design the price tag
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:50,751	| IOT208 |	First reset the
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:57,151	| IOT208 |	Tri-City want to reach and saying this is what we think it's an important that we should achieve with this product
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:03,551	| IOT208 |	Both the functionality on the Aesthetics
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:05,087	| IOT208 |	Outsole

EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,231	| IOT208 |	Just for the audience these blinds
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:13,023	| IOT208 |	Are going to range from between
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:17,887	| IOT208 |	113 u.s. dollars to $181 US dollars and that's
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:18,911	| IOT208 |	Dependent on the wit
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:20,447	| IOT208 |	Correct that's correct
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:21,727	| IOT208 |	Excellent
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:24,799	| IOT208 |	Alright in the widest they're going to go is 76
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,359	| IOT208 |	Y'all so
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,639	| IOT208 |	It's a pretty big window
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,919	| IOT208 |	Dauin might guess
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:33,759	| IOT208 |	Is the reason you can't go bigger is because it's hard
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,807	| IOT208 |	For a battery-operated motor
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,575	| IOT208 |	The pull that much battery
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,623	| IOT208 |	Right
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,415	| IOT208 |	Yeah I think it's also for us
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:46,559	| IOT208 |	To to give ourselves a decent starting points in order to meet the masses in elections I'm pretty
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,887	| IOT208 |	Expand the range symbols
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:51,679	| IOT208 |	More expression Santander

EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,623	| IOT208 |	I appreciate this in
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:11,903	| IOT208 |	For reference
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,951	| IOT208 |	If you guys want to just be like
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:19,071	| IOT208 |	I have automated Shades in my house and they cover a 10-foot wide window so it's very big
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,351	| IOT208 |	Much larger
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,119	| IOT208 |	Netspot
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:22,911	| IOT208 |	They cost 10000
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:23,679	| IOT208 |	Dollars
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,447	| IOT208 |	That is
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:24,959	| IOT208 |	Insane
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:29,823	| IOT208 |	And a lot of that was for the motor and because there wasn't a lot of competition in this
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:31,103	| IOT208 |	Space so
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,895	| IOT208 |	Yay Ikea
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:38,783	| IOT208 |	In the US you're doing the blackout Shades those are the I'm going to make you say it so everyone knows the proper way to say it
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:39,807	| IOT208 |	The future
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:40,319	| IOT208 |	How do you say
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,879	| IOT208 |	I was pretty good they call C2
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,647	| IOT208 |	Future
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:46,207	| IOT208 |	All right and then
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:51,327	| IOT208 |	You have the semi-transparent ones in those are like to me it looks like
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:53,375	| IOT208 |	Typical Ikea butcher
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,399	| IOT208 |	Consonance

EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:13,855	| IOT208 |	So we will see if you also open this up to USA
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:15,391	| IOT208 |	However we expanding
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,695	| IOT208 |	The range of connected lines in the US
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:22,303	| IOT208 |	This is not a technical question but as a person who has to live with blinds at my house
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:23,839	| IOT208 |	Do these come in different Fabrics
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:30,239	| IOT208 |	It only coming into Fabrics to start off with so they come in the in the in the block out on the semi share about again
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,263	| IOT208 |	We made
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:34,847	| IOT208 |	The solution we made it support scalable so we can build on this Ranch
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:41,247	| IOT208 |	Moving forward so I'm sure we could learn some in the first years outside so we can we can expand ourselves more expressions
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,551	| IOT208 |	Sound and color variations on and so on and so on
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:46,879	| IOT208 |	Okay so right now if you want smart blinds that are affordable
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,647	| IOT208 |	Your choice
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,159	| IOT208 |	Is Darkrai
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:53,791	| IOT208 |	Alright it's kind of like Henry Ford and his Model T
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:54,303	| IOT208 |	T4 little
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:55,327	| IOT208 |	All right
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:58,399	| IOT208 |	These are coming out in April
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,959	| IOT208 |	But you have had the tradfri lights
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:01,983	| IOT208 |	Out for
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:05,311	| IOT208 |	80 months to years a really long time it feels like
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,103	| IOT208 |	Internet of Things face
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:08,127	| IOT208 |	And I
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:14,271	| IOT208 |	Curious to hear what you've learned after having those on the market I know the last time we talked I was in a bit of a snit
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:15,807	| IOT208 |	Because my
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:18,367	| IOT208 |	Tradfri lights were not working well with my
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:19,647	| IOT208 |	Home assistance
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:20,671	| IOT208 |	I put them back
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,695	| IOT208 |	And there better now
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,207	| IOT208 |	Also that's
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:23,999	| IOT208 |	But what if you learned
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:29,631	| IOT208 |	Yeah you mentioned Appliance will be on Salem in April they will actually be on sale in Europe
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:33,471	| IOT208 |	Before summer time and day will it be on sale in US

EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:36,543	| IOT208 |	Disappointing August is a pig
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,823	| IOT208 |	But what if you learned
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:42,687	| IOT208 |	I think we're learning lost in the space and I think it's one thing that we have really
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:43,711	| IOT208 |	Taking all me now
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:47,039	| IOT208 |	In a serious manner East importance of having a system that is
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,367	| IOT208 |	Stable anambra boss does not fail on you when it comes to
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,391	| IOT208 |	Nativity Mendoza
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:56,255	| IOT208 |	It made some efforts in order to improve the
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:59,583	| IOT208 |	The trophy Aspen and experience without the making sure that it
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:03,167	| IOT208 |	Safeway
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:05,983	| IOT208 |	Work to ensure that we stay in compliance
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,007	| IOT208 |	I mean working with
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:09,311	| IOT208 |	Amazon Apple and Google
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:10,591	| IOT208 |	We need to make sure that
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:15,967	| IOT208 |	Doc user experience is also to the best possible that you take two
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:18,783	| IOT208 |	Constantly make sure that this is what needs to be but
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,831	| IOT208 |	Of course the beauty of working with
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:21,855	| IOT208 |	Food product that is
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:28,767	| IOT208 |	Is a life that you have to take care of any proven and bites lice all the time so I think we are super excited
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:31,071	| IOT208 |	We are also taking it in a very serious way
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:32,863	| IOT208 |	Okay in French
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:34,911	| IOT208 |	Kiss from a business perspective
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:37,215	| IOT208 |	How does the tribe free product line
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:42,591	| IOT208 |	In terms of employees and people working on the project has it stayed relatively consistent to
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:45,151	| IOT208 |	Because as you mentioned it's alive so I'm
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:48,223	| IOT208 |	Very curious how that's changed how you
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:49,247	| IOT208 |	Port and
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,039	| IOT208 |	Maintain that purses
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:52,319	| IOT208 |	I don't know
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,087	| IOT208 |	The mom
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:53,855	| IOT208 |	Dressers or
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:57,695	| IOT208 |	That's a good question of course our heritage is our
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:47:59,487	| IOT208 |	Conventional Furniture pieces
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:02,047	| IOT208 |	Furniture Airport
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:05,119	| IOT208 |	Coworkers in the stores and Ambien customers
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,655	| IOT208 |	Fortis want to relate to our
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:08,703	| IOT208 |	It's good products so far
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:10,239	| IOT208 |	So there you have it
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:12,287	| IOT208 |	A pretty steep learning curve and also how we are
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:14,591	| IOT208 |	Putting resources behind our
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,871	| IOT208 |	All connected products
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,663	| IOT208 |	So I think what you will see
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:23,551	| IOT208 |	Looking at this as we are investing by traveling to this face and we of course want to put more
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:29,439	| IOT208 |	More efforts on and make our safe solution better in the stores we want to educate that we staff
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:35,583	| IOT208 |	Want to get a customer support
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:40,703	| IOT208 |	Learning a lot right now and it is a space that just been identified as being really important for Ikea moving forward
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:43,263	| IOT208 |	So a my last trip
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:46,079	| IOT208 |	Through the IKEA store which was only
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,103	| IOT208 |	Only a week ago
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:50,175	| IOT208 |	I noticed that I had a hard time finding
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:50,943	| IOT208 |	The tradfri light
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:52,735	| IOT208 |	And I wondered if
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,783	| IOT208 |	There was a reason behind
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:56,575	| IOT208 |	That and I asked because
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:59,135	| IOT208 |	I saw a Bluetooth speakers prominently to
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:02,463	| IOT208 |	Displayed also in the last few months we also saw
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:03,487	| IOT208 |	Lowe's
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:05,279	| IOT208 |	Take out their Iris
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,303	| IOT208 |	Smart home platform
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:08,607	| IOT208 |	And prior to that we've seen
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:10,911	| IOT208 |	Tons of retailers
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,447	| IOT208 |	Try and then just
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,215	| IOT208 |	Hoback
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:16,031	| IOT208 |	On smarthome in iot things so I feel like
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:19,871	| IOT208 |	Maybe we don't know how to sell this well yet or what's happened
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:26,527	| IOT208 |	It's not that we are trying to hide a name and it's all three lights are on is not lighting the stores.
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:28,319	| IOT208 |	In the car but we are building up
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:32,671	| IOT208 |	The rain should wear building off the retail solution it takes a little bit of time in the
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:35,231	| IOT208 |	Ikea Machinery to get everything sorted
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:39,583	| IOT208 |	After summer I'm sure you will see some really good Improvement in a
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:42,399	| IOT208 |	Store nearby you because we are launching you
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:45,727	| IOT208 |	Eureka concert pole for the smart home arena
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:46,751	| IOT208 |	After summertime
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:49,311	| IOT208 |	Started with a big sound
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:53,407	| IOT208 |	Together with the complete smart home solar
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:57,247	| IOT208 |	I'm really excited about this and I'm pretty confident that we would have them
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:59,807	| IOT208 |	Ace that can be encouraged to
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:01,087	| IOT208 |	Amtrak
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:03,391	| IOT208 |	Play with the products and also learn a lot to buy
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:05,183	| IOT208 |	Enjoy your sin in the starting lineup
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,743	| IOT208 |	Okay it sounds like
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:09,791	| IOT208 |	You don't want to tell me too much more about
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:12,863	| IOT208 |	But can you give us any hints about
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:15,167	| IOT208 |	What's some of the issues that
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:16,959	| IOT208 |	You guys had seen and are trying to solve
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:20,287	| IOT208 |	I think they are being reminded every now and then
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:24,895	| IOT208 |	Getting the day fixing place in a sentence on the way saying when I went to speakers
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:26,687	| IOT208 |	Bluetooth speaker for accomplish
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:27,711	| IOT208 |	Is turned on
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:28,991	| IOT208 |	We sent twice as many
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:29,503	| IOT208 |	Amedisys
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:33,855	| IOT208 |	Simple us. That people want to interact and see and touch and feel
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:35,391	| IOT208 |	The greatest compliment that we have
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:39,231	| IOT208 |	I could webpage son and a good eCommerce solution.
EDL	00:50:39,231	00:50:41,023	| IOT208 |	The touching feeling playing around in the
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:42,559	| IOT208 |	Neglected
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:45,119	| IOT208 |	It's really important to have that
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:48,959	| IOT208 |	And I think that's what we are male excited about that we can desecrate the space
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:53,567	| IOT208 |	So are you able to play with the blinds table
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:55,615	| IOT208 |	Symphonic speakers and pinyin
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:56,383	| IOT208 |	See what
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:58,431	| IOT208 |	Capable of playing what type of music
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:04,063	| IOT208 |	Okay and we've talked about them now
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:09,695	| IOT208 |	For a while. You guys have a partnership coming up with Sonos where you're going to be releasing
EDL	00:51:09,695	00:51:10,463	| IOT208 |	Much
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,743	| IOT208 |	Anticipated speaker
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:13,535	| IOT208 |	And that's going to also happen in August
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:15,839	| IOT208 |	Account disabled start is in August
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:18,655	| IOT208 |	They will be safe
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:23,263	| IOT208 |	North America same time but we are having a big
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:25,823	| IOT208 |	Launch event in April in the Bronx
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:29,151	| IOT208 |	This year so
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:34,271	| IOT208 |	That's what we really going to reveal in first to the public which is going to be very fond of course
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:36,319	| IOT208 |	Can you tell me anything more about the speaker
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:38,367	| IOT208 |	Should I cook my dinner
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:40,159	| IOT208 |	I wish they could bust
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:43,231	| IOT208 |	Innocence of collaboration with
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:48,095	| IOT208 |	So much fun and the such a good journey from from day one.
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:49,887	| IOT208 |	We literally reached out to
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:53,727	| IOT208 |	To take the next step in
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:56,031	| IOT208 |	In creating atmosphere we had that
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:52:02,943	| IOT208 |	Quite a few insights about what it is to create atmosphere at home
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:04,479	| IOT208 |	People we talked to Rich
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:09,087	| IOT208 |	Should do quite a lot of the year with you quite a few people
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:10,879	| IOT208 |	59% of those two
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:13,695	| IOT208 |	Music is the number one factor
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:14,975	| IOT208 |	Creating atmosphere
EDL	00:52:14,975	00:52:18,815	| IOT208 |	So having smart Lighting in place or at this grasping up on we thought it was
EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:22,911	| IOT208 |	I needed that we also took on the task of the
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:23,679	| IOT208 |	Having
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:24,703	| IOT208 |	Music and Sound
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:27,007	| IOT208 |	In order to do that then
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:28,287	| IOT208 |	We reached out to Sonos
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:31,103	| IOT208 |	And the same thing was said when we did reach out to them
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:32,127	| IOT208 |	The other day
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:36,991	| IOT208 |	Maybe they would like to reach out to Ikea that work with us
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:39,551	| IOT208 |	Okay let's see so far you guys have
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:42,111	| IOT208 |	Connected lights so you have connected blinds
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:43,135	| IOT208 |	We're going to see
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:45,951	| IOT208 |	The partnership with the Sonos / speakers
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:48,767	| IOT208 |	And that's all about creating this this atmosphere
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:52,351	| IOT208 |	We've also seen I introduce wireless charging
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:53,887	| IOT208 |	You guys have embraced
EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:56,703	| IOT208 |	Connectivity and Technology where it seems to make sense in the home
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:52:59,519	| IOT208 |	Where do you think you'll go neck
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:01,823	| IOT208 |	We know where we going next
EDL	00:53:01,823	00:53:05,919	| IOT208 |	But I think it's more to say I think that the luxury we have on
EDL	00:53:05,919	00:53:07,711	| IOT208 |	Being home smart
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:08,735	| IOT208 |	Reading Ikea
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:09,503	| IOT208 |	History of Acts
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:11,039	| IOT208 |	To every rule
EDL	00:53:11,039	00:53:14,367	| IOT208 |	And I think this is really a luxury in this space.
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:19,231	| IOT208 |	Dictated to a certain space or a certain activity we can actually
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:24,863	| IOT208 |	Nothing to whatever activity or scenario or identify a big nose
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:27,167	| IOT208 |	Most important elements in Life
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:30,239	| IOT208 |	Right now it's very lucky
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:36,383	| IOT208 |	Keep hiding in fear being working with lighting and shadows of darkness and
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:40,223	| IOT208 |	Sliding in
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:42,271	| IOT208 |	Sound of Music 2
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:44,063	| IOT208 |	Of course Ruston
EDL	00:53:44,063	00:53:50,463	| IOT208 |	Next step is a course to start combining the two but you know when you really can get the the scenes going with
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:55,839	| IOT208 |	Appliance of the music and the lighting and everything in in harmony
EDL	00:53:55,839	00:53:56,351	| IOT208 |	Thing that we are
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:54:01,471	| IOT208 |	What comes after summer time and work with Dustin and also release set of course
EDL	00:54:01,471	00:54:05,055	| IOT208 |	To the greater area stuff we will enter after that then turns off
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:08,895	| IOT208 |	Today we have to
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:13,759	| IOT208 |	To keep your eyes and ears open for that moving help but we are definitely serious about the categories
EDL	00:54:13,759	00:54:14,783	| IOT208 |	Orbitz Amsterdam

EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:30,399	| IOT208 |	That just blew me away
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:34,239	| IOT208 |	And I think that actually indoor air quality
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:37,055	| IOT208 |	And health and wellness we're seeing a bunch of come

EDL	00:54:38,847	00:54:40,639	| IOT208 |	That's just me you don't have to answer
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:42,175	| IOT208 |	Guys if I'm kidnapped this is
