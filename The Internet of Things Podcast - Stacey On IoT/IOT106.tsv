EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:18,848	| IOT106 |	Before that let me do a quick
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:20,640	| IOT106 |	Message from

EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,800	| IOT106 |	But there is a lot less Kevin
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,592	| IOT106 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,128	| IOT106 |	Let's get
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,664	| IOT106 |	Started
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:54,688	| IOT106 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:55,712	| IOT106 |	Google home
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,224	| IOT106 |	But first off
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:04,160	| IOT106 |	I guess I am a contractor working a Google not on Google home or anything coyote related so funny opinions
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:08,256	| IOT106 |	Are my own and I'll even disclose I don't own a Google home
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,536	| IOT106 |	Doesn't yet meet my needs
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,072	| IOT106 |	I'm just flattered
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:15,424	| IOT106 |	Okay well last week's big news was like
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,216	| IOT106 |	That's very honest
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:17,728	| IOT106 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,800	| IOT106 |	So last week's big news was that Google added
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,336	| IOT106 |	11 partners
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,128	| IOT106 |	For its Smart Home
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,688	| IOT106 |	Integrations not all of them are live yet
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,504	| IOT106 |	But many of them are including Kevin's favorite hope which is be
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:34,368	| IOT106 |	And almost with that that integration almost got me to buy one
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:34,880	| IOT106 |	To be honest
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:38,976	| IOT106 |	See so I'm going to say that that integration
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,744	| IOT106 |	Plus
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,816	| IOT106 |	A new one that they announced a little later in the week but after
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,328	| IOT106 |	The podcast app
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,656	| IOT106 |	The Logitech
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,936	| IOT106 |	Harmony Hub
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT106 |	Which is
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,752	| IOT106 |	Integrates basically your television
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,776	| IOT106 |	If you're not chromecasting
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:52,800	| IOT106 |	It's always hats
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,616	| IOT106 |	Comcast but it does have great
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,920	| IOT106 |	This adds
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,944	| IOT106 |	The Logitech Harmony Hub
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,480	| IOT106 |	To your Google home
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,808	| IOT106 |	That plus the wink
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:10,208	| IOT106 |	Means that this week I am putting it downstairs putting the Google home downstairs in the Amazon Echo that
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,232	| IOT106 |	House with downstairs
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,512	| IOT106 |	This is going up into my daughter's room
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:17,120	| IOT106 |	I will say Logitech for its Google home integration
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,656	| IOT106 |	Does something a little different
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,472	| IOT106 |	So you don't actually add it from the
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| IOT106 |	Apps on the phone
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,032	| IOT106 |	The home app
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,800	| IOT106 |	The home app
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:28,128	| IOT106 |	Instead you say Okay g ask Harmony to
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:28,640	| IOT106 |	Connect
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,688	| IOT106 |	And then what's supposed to happen
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,224	| IOT106 |	When is the Google Assistant
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:32,992	| IOT106 |	Will display a
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,016	| IOT106 |	Hard in the Google home
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,576	| IOT106 |	You launch the app
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,368	| IOT106 |	You tap discover and then link
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,672	| IOT106 |	You're going to sign in using your Logitech
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,184	| IOT106 |	Harmony account
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,464	| IOT106 |	Information
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,512	| IOT106 |	And then you get the option
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,816	| IOT106 |	You'll see all your activities
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| IOT106 |	Activities
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| IOT106 |	Watch Netflix
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,656	| IOT106 |	Turn on television
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:52,960	| IOT106 |	All of those and you actually get to name them
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:02,432	| IOT106 |	I was just going to say I was actually hang out with some people at Google the other day talking about Google home
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,480	| IOT106 |	And the common theme is
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,504	| IOT106 |	That when they
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| IOT106 |	Use the hot word
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:11,904	| IOT106 |	Their phones also start listening and kind of hoses things up so does that
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,696	| IOT106 |	Still happen for you
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,976	| IOT106 |	Multiple tries
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,351	| IOT106 |	It does say specifically it says turn to your Google home
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:20,863	| IOT106 |	And say this
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,143	| IOT106 |	It maybe I wasn't
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:29,055	| IOT106 |	Like I did eventually get right up in his face and leave my phone away
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,567	| IOT106 |	Run to the phone
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,151	| IOT106 |	What happened was it kept opening
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| IOT106 |	My phone and my phone is like
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,015	| IOT106 |	Because it has to be
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:43,391	| IOT106 |	It has to be done through the assistant or the unturned through Google home and sell the can be done through the phone
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:43,903	| IOT106 |	Right
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,207	| IOT106 |	Because you need the phone
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:50,047	| IOT106 |	Your first instinct is going to be like I'll bring my phone with me
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,815	| IOT106 |	Because I'm going to
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,631	| IOT106 |	But you're better off putting your phone in another room
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,423	| IOT106 |	Standing with the Google home
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| IOT106 |	Say What You Need to Say
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| IOT106 |	This is my Pro tip for you
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,847	| IOT106 |	Start stringify is another app that does
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:06,431	| IOT106 |	The integration this way and I see Mrs indicatives
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,735	| IOT106 |	Kind of skills versus
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,271	| IOT106 |	Native support
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,111	| IOT106 |	I would kindergarten
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:21,279	| IOT106 |	Yeah because of that the Integrations the native Integrations all take place in the
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,327	| IOT106 |	Home app in the settings
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:26,655	| IOT106 |	Carrier getting off a Google Now card essentially so
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT106 |	There's some other
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:34,591	| IOT106 |	Mechanism or interface involved I tend to agree with you it's probably not a native thing is probably a skills types
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| IOT106 |	Cards thing
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,663	| IOT106 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,199	| IOT106 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| IOT106 |	Once it's done
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,039	| IOT106 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:49,439	| IOT106 |	And because I feel that Google home is a better listener than the echo I'm actually really excited about tearing the
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,231	| IOT106 |	Google home has been in
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,743	| IOT106 |	My master bathroom
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| IOT106 |	Which is actually worked out really well cuz what I'm showering I
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:02,495	| IOT106 |	You think then from a hardware perspective the microphone array
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,311	| IOT106 |	Works better for you with Google home in post for the echo
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,383	| IOT106 |	Worlds
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,479	| IOT106 |	Google home is a better listener
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,503	| IOT106 |	And it's a
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:16,575	| IOT106 |	More accurate like gives you better results
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:20,927	| IOT106 |	Right right I think it passed into a much broader database of information
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,231	| IOT106 |	How much is one of the things I don't like about the echo
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:24,767	| IOT106 |	Having a lot of questions
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,047	| IOT106 |	I can ask my phone
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,583	| IOT106 |	I use Google assistant on
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,655	| IOT106 |	Similar to home
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,447	| IOT106 |	And I get better results
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:37,311	| IOT106 |	What with Google assistant so I can I get that and if it listens better maybe maybe your smile
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,615	| IOT106 |	It listens better and it's more flexible in its
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,127	| IOT106 |	Command structure
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,199	| IOT106 |	From a natural language processing
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,759	| IOT106 |	Json
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| IOT106 |	I don't know so
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,855	| IOT106 |	After this week will I'll come back with the
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,879	| IOT106 |	The definitive
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,463	| IOT106 |	And the Logitech Harmony
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,487	| IOT106 |	Hub
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,791	| IOT106 |	I think it was $99 a month
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,303	| IOT106 |	99
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,095	| IOT106 |	99.
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:06,495	| IOT106 |	And that does not include any of the remotes your phone becomes your remote or in our case we use our same remote sandwich
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| IOT106 |	We just use
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,823	| IOT106 |	So basically I spent $99
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,335	| IOT106 |	To have voice
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,895	| IOT106 |	Right
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:19,807	| IOT106 |	Obviously it works with Logitech remotes are they required or could one person just say I'm just going to add voice
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:22,367	| IOT106 |	Voice to my TV through Google home
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,439	| IOT106 |	So I only spent $90 on the Hub
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,743	| IOT106 |	How comes with a little IR Blaster so
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,767	| IOT106 |	And that has to be out
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:34,655	| IOT106 |	Right so basically if you want to change channels or not that you can do that all by voice
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,959	| IOT106 |	I can bring up the program
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,495	| IOT106 |	A channel that I
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,031	| IOT106 |	I want and I can say
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,823	| IOT106 |	Turn on Disney
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,591	| IOT106 |	But I can't
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,151	| IOT106 |	Volume up and volume down
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,943	| IOT106 |	For my system
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,503	| IOT106 |	Do not work some people systems it will work
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:50,783	| IOT106 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:54,111	| IOT106 |	How to depend on your TV Hardware in Sun
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| IOT106 |	So my activities that I use
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,463	| IOT106 |	Is our turn on Netflix
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| IOT106 |	Turn on television
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,559	| IOT106 |	Turn off entertainment center
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| IOT106 |	The default settings so
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,167	| IOT106 |	Amazon Prime
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:13,823	| IOT106 |	And the reason I'm asking about this is because we get older TV through the internet
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:18,943	| IOT106 |	We don't use the smart TV apps built into our TV we use a Fire TV
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:23,039	| IOT106 |	And what are use a Nvidia Shield TV in my office
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,319	| IOT106 |	So it's all
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,343	| IOT106 |	App-based
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:29,183	| IOT106 |	TV and channels and I'm not curious how that would work maybe I have to
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,463	| IOT106 |	Create presets and such
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,535	| IOT106 |	Okay and the other is Kevin you pointed out to me
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,119	| IOT106 |	If the Google home sounds
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,631	| IOT106 |	Interesting to
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:40,959	| IOT106 |	New smartphone
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,055	| IOT106 |	You can get both of those
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,871	| IOT106 |	Well without paying for the Google home and I don't
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:51,967	| IOT106 |	I don't know that we talked about this before we don't talk about smartphones
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,991	| IOT106 |	210e
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:55,295	| IOT106 |	Can you tell Whitney level detail here with
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:00,159	| IOT106 |	The LG G6 actually got my attention when it launched in February and it's still
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:05,791	| IOT106 |	I believe it's available for Verizon customers in the US now and everywhere else it's pre-order through the carriers
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,863	| IOT106 |	An LG will be selling a unlocked version
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,143	| IOT106 |	If you like in the future
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| IOT106 |	This was
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:17,311	| IOT106 |	One of the first smartphones to be almost all display the top and bottom bezels are mostly on the Galaxy S8
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,615	| IOT106 |	Actually has even smaller bezels so whatever
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,407	| IOT106 |	Depends on what you want
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:27,807	| IOT106 |	But the nice thing is LG not the carriers but LG is giving people a free Google home if you buy
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,599	| IOT106 |	Buy a G6 smartphone
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,367	| IOT106 |	And I
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:35,487	| IOT106 |	Look at this because it's a pretty nice phone and I can get a free Google home
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:40,351	| IOT106 |	The deal is when you purchase your phone you had to do so between March 17th
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:46,495	| IOT106 |	Which is already passed out asleep and Sunday April 30th service there are still plenty of time to pre-order in-store purchase
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:49,055	| IOT106 |	Ag6 and qualify for this promotion
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:53,151	| IOT106 |	I mean to submit through LG through May 15th or by May 15th
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,967	| IOT106 |	They will send you a free Google home
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,271	| IOT106 |	Which is $129 value so
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,623	| IOT106 |	I don't know $650 for that smartphone on my carrier
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,159	| IOT106 |	Free Google home
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,207	| IOT106 |	Some of the new Innovations Maybe
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:08,255	| IOT106 |	Maybe I don't want to put it but maybe
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,303	| IOT106 |	Will you have
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,327	| IOT106 |	Foreca
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,935	| IOT106 |	Hi dive two dots are tap and an echo
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,727	| IOT106 |	Yeah I'm tapped out
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,311	| IOT106 |	I just don't know where
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,359	| IOT106 |	I would have to do what you're doing like swap it with
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,151	| IOT106 |	It's something I swap out in that go and put you know
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,711	| IOT106 |	There's no room right now that needs more listening
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,759	| IOT106 |	Do you have one in your bath
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,319	| IOT106 |	No I don't
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,855	| IOT106 |	I'm telling you it's going to be
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,463	| IOT106 |	The amount of time that I'm in the bathroom in a given day is literally
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,511	| IOT106 |	.1% of my day
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,815	| IOT106 |	Showering
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,327	| IOT106 |	Doing
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,607	| IOT106 |	I guess you don't do
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,119	| IOT106 |	Do your hair and makeup
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,191	| IOT106 |	Not so much I'm not on camera anymore
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:53,055	| IOT106 |	I work from home and I don't
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:59,199	| IOT106 |	Yeah I'm in sweatpants right now though I have not yet showered this morning so again
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,991	| IOT106 |	It might not be the best place
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:05,087	| IOT106 |	I'll tell you what I'll find a place I'll find a home for Google home
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:05,855	| IOT106 |	If
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:11,231	| IOT106 |	I do take advantage of this G6 free offer I'm on the fence I might do it
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| IOT106 |	Am I heading wink really went a long way
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:14,815	| IOT106 |	Yeah well
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:18,911	| IOT106 |	But but but we should say just before the show we realize this
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,935	| IOT106 |	We realize that
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:23,007	| IOT106 |	Even though the wink integration is there in Google home
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:27,103	| IOT106 |	It does not work with locks neither your lock nor my luck
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| IOT106 |	Are showing up there
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,407	| IOT106 |	Right
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,431	| IOT106 |	So both of us have our locks
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| IOT106 |	Cubs
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,991	| IOT106 |	Right
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:36,063	| IOT106 |	They are not on there neither is the MyQ garage door
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,855	| IOT106 |	Which is something else I have in
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:43,487	| IOT106 |	Isn't surprising my guess is there's probably some security
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,535	| IOT106 |	Same security issues that
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| IOT106 |	Echo had
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,399	| IOT106 |	But it's actually a little weird because
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,215	| IOT106 |	The echo right now I can ask that
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,007	| IOT106 |	Garage door unlocked
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,519	| IOT106 |	And it will say
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| IOT106 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:00,895	| IOT106 |	It'll check the state of the locks absolutely and you can still lock lock
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,663	| IOT106 |	Walks through
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,687	| IOT106 |	The echo
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:05,503	| IOT106 |	And you can unlock
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,039	| IOT106 |	Yet with the echo
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,087	| IOT106 |	You cannot unlock
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,391	| IOT106 |	Those locks you can unlock the
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| IOT106 |	August
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,743	| IOT106 |	Right and that requires like a pin
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,767	| IOT106 |	To make sure it's you
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,303	| IOT106 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,863	| IOT106 |	So that is the current status status
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,399	| IOT106 |	Fancy we went
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| IOT106 |	Let us move
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,495	| IOT106 |	Two more Industrial
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,775	| IOT106 |	Specs
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,799	| IOT106 |	Welcome back
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,103	| IOT106 |	But I think this is actually
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,383	| IOT106 |	Pretty freaking cool
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,407	| IOT106 |	Zebra
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,199	| IOT106 |	Which is a
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,735	| IOT106 |	Gosh they are
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| IOT106 |	What do they do
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:43,135	| IOT106 |	They were big in RFID and NFC
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,647	| IOT106 |	Kind of
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,439	| IOT106 |	Helping
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:49,023	| IOT106 |	Big companies handle Logistics and transport
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,815	| IOT106 |	Retail operation
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,863	| IOT106 |	National Sports business that
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:53,887	| IOT106 |	Tracks
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,215	| IOT106 |	Football and soccer players
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,031	| IOT106 |	Yeah they have failed a lot
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,055	| IOT106 |	A really cool
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,871	| IOT106 |	Iot Staffing they've been doing it before
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,175	| IOT106 |	Since before i t i o t was
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| IOT106 |	They have a new
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,527	| IOT106 |	King Anu
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:15,391	| IOT106 |	Product for the transportation Logistics business it's called the smart Pack trailer
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:16,671	| IOT106 |	And
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:20,767	| IOT106 |	It's basically a tiny little 3D sensor / camera that you
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,071	| IOT106 |	Pop in the top of a a trailer
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,351	| IOT106 |	Tractor trailer truck bed
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,191	| IOT106 |	Basically check the status of
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,983	| IOT106 |	Whatever is in that truck
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT106 |	Which is
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,799	| IOT106 |	Really cool and it
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,871	| IOT106 |	If they've also packaged analytics on top of this
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,919	| IOT106 |	So this camera
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,223	| IOT106 |	Obviously sees things but then it can also be like
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,991	| IOT106 |	Hey
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,527	| IOT106 |	This is how fast is getting loaded
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,831	| IOT106 |	Fishing it is
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,391	| IOT106 |	Come up with your own metrics I believe
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,927	| IOT106 |	I work with them on that
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:51,231	| IOT106 |	I don't know I think this is like super cool
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:57,631	| IOT106 |	Oh it's it's a brilliant use of the technology I mean you know it's all about speed and efficiency when you're transporting matter
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| IOT106 |	Orioles and
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,935	| IOT106 |	They're talking about
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,471	| IOT106 |	The hardware This Afternoon lyrics
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,519	| IOT106 |	Can determine
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:07,615	| IOT106 |	Like things like volumetric efficiency load rate when a load is near completion
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:12,223	| IOT106 |	I want to load is about to be freed up so that the new load can begin I mean
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:16,575	| IOT106 |	Again it's all about as you said Logistics and I think it's a brilliant application
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:21,183	| IOT106 |	And it also works with other people's grpc
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,999	| IOT106 |	Enterprise resource planning systems so like your sap
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,535	| IOT106 |	Software
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,071	| IOT106 |	This is actually so
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:30,399	| IOT106 |	I remember watching a video about the port of Hamburg
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,679	| IOT106 |	In Germany
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:34,495	| IOT106 |	And it was really fascinated like a giant essay
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,775	| IOT106 |	Case study
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,287	| IOT106 |	But
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,591	| IOT106 |	What it does is basically
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,895	| IOT106 |	Because it's so small
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,175	| IOT106 |	The
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:45,503	| IOT106 |	Companies that are the trucks that are taking the containers away
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| IOT106 |	They have to
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,063	| IOT106 |	Like basically state park outside of the
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,647	| IOT106 |	And what happens is as below zar
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,671	| IOT106 |	Getting
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,231	| IOT106 |	It's like as they're getting ready to
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:59,327	| IOT106 |	Finish a load basically they're like already notifying that trailer
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| IOT106 |	There is
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,375	| IOT106 |	Trailer guy
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,655	| IOT106 |	To be like all right
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| IOT106 |	Start your engines
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| IOT106 |	Come on in and so it's like
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,519	| IOT106 |	Instant you know like
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,567	| IOT106 |	This guy drives away this guy pulls
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,103	| IOT106 |	It's all fancy
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,919	| IOT106 |	You know again this is a case study so I'm sure it
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,455	| IOT106 |	They should be only the perfect things
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:15,967	| IOT106 |	But
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:20,831	| IOT106 |	The stuff is actually really cool it reduces like idling time which has Allah
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| IOT106 |	Fishing
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,695	| IOT106 |	You're a small port with no
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:29,023	| IOT106 |	Please put things are if you got a small loading dock this is really cool
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,815	| IOT106 |	I would agree and just think
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,375	| IOT106 |	Taking it to the next level
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,423	| IOT106 |	There's a lot of work being done on
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,215	| IOT106 |	Autonomous tractor trailer driving
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:43,359	| IOT106 |	And when you start pairing these two things together you're going to have even more efficiency so it's really really interesting
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:47,711	| IOT106 |	Course that may get to like oh how long till people stop
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,271	| IOT106 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,855	| IOT106 |	The robots are coming to take a stickler jobs
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,207	| IOT106 |	I can't take it podcast
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| IOT106 |	Bruker
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:03,327	| IOT106 |	Oh I don't know Kevin we probably could be easily replaced by robots
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:09,215	| IOT106 |	Somebody smarter than me yes I agree with that
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:14,847	| IOT106 |	Also on the industrial side and this is what the industrial and Enterprise
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,615	| IOT106 |	I don't know
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,383	| IOT106 |	We really want to get into
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,175	| IOT106 |	But this is
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:24,319	| IOT106 |	This is about beacons I was a Bluetooth World last week and they were little estimate beacons just everywhere
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,367	| IOT106 |	I was reminded
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| IOT106 |	How inefficient
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,415	| IOT106 |	I think pékin
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,463	| IOT106 |	Because the battery powered
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,767	| IOT106 |	Stuck in gear places people
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| IOT106 |	Boobs
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,303	| IOT106 |	But
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,887	| IOT106 |	A company called missed that I have written about before
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,423	| IOT106 |	And I think we may have talked about
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,703	| IOT106 |	They have come up with
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,471	| IOT106 |	A
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,263	| IOT106 |	Technology that lets you do virtual bee
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,823	| IOT106 |	So what it is it software that you
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,871	| IOT106 |	Put on your Wi-Fi access Play
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT106 |	Points
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT106 |	I think you have to buy the
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT106 |	Hardware for them
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,551	| IOT106 |	You get this image overlay of your offices basic
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,111	| IOT106 |	And then you take it
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| IOT106 |	And you can like
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:05,279	| IOT106 |	Establish virtual beacons silver virtual Bluetooth beacons basically using their technology
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,863	| IOT106 |	You're like oh I want one by the bathroom so I can see
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,399	| IOT106 |	How many people are using their phones on the toilet
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,679	| IOT106 |	You probably should not do
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:13,983	| IOT106 |	But
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,775	| IOT106 |	You can see how many people are in the bathroom
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:20,383	| IOT106 |	Could even tell you that you need more bathroom facilities
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,663	| IOT106 |	7 yes
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,479	| IOT106 |	This is
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| IOT106 |	So but
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:31,391	| IOT106 |	Companies are actually using this for things like wayfinding so you can put these virtual beacons
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,927	| IOT106 |	Along the long hallway
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,439	| IOT106 |	Beard
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:36,255	| IOT106 |	University of Stanford University is actually using it
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| IOT106 |	And
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,863	| IOT106 |	They're also using it in warehouses
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,935	| IOT106 |	4like Logistics efforts to like
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:47,007	| IOT106 |	Track where people are getting gummed up
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:52,127	| IOT106 |	You can even use it for asset tracking if you put sensors on like machinery
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:56,223	| IOT106 |	So if you put a Bluetooth sensor module on like a big robot that you love
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,783	| IOT106 |	You can always know where that robot is
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:03,135	| IOT106 |	By creating like this Forest a virtual begins around it as opposed to the physical begins
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,439	| IOT106 |	I've Loved missed four
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,279	| IOT106 |	Yeah I think cell most common sense
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,815	| IOT106 |	To actually move the
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:13,375	| IOT106 |	Beacon technology into existing
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:16,191	| IOT106 |	It Network infrastructure because
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,727	| IOT106 |	8 more flexible
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:21,823	| IOT106 |	Can use theoretically devices you already have
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:26,943	| IOT106 |	Bekins nothing is estimate and all the pain now the others can make the physical beacons
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,967	| IOT106 |	But just
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| IOT106 |	Having
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,575	| IOT106 |	Piece of Hardware that's dedicated to just basically Bluetooth signals
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,367	| IOT106 |	I just doesn't make sense to me
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,951	| IOT106 |	You know what in terms of cost and efficiency and so on so I love this idea
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| IOT106 |	Mist
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,791	| IOT106 |	That's the company
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:42,815	| IOT106 |	It's pretty cool
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:43,839	| IOT106 |	All right
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| IOT106 |	Smart home data
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,423	| IOT106 |	We in the last week or two
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:57,919	| IOT106 |	Both came out at the same time
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,711	| IOT106 |	Yes Euro put out
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,015	| IOT106 |	Report called a peek inside the connected home
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,111	| IOT106 |	Put out some data about devices
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,159	| IOT106 |	So let's start with
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,671	| IOT106 |	Eero
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,695	| IOT106 |	Because
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,743	| IOT106 |	What I felt like it was a little bit more
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:15,327	| IOT106 |	One thing it was only five pages versus 33
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,887	| IOT106 |	Thanks wink
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:22,751	| IOT106 |	It is device-specific so we're heroes are
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:25,055	| IOT106 |	Definitely
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| IOT106 |	Few people who bought it for
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,175	| IOT106 |	Can I hear
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,943	| IOT106 |	A lot of that
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:34,271	| IOT106 |	And they're probably upper-upper income
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,319	| IOT106 |	So with that in mind though
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,135	| IOT106 |	The Eero guy said hey
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:42,463	| IOT106 |	There's an average of 10 device Types on Eero Network
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,791	| IOT106 |	Now that's not number of devices that's device types
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,071	| IOT106 |	The top one
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,655	| IOT106 |	Are iPhones than iPad Spotify Sonos
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| IOT106 |	Then Android
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,215	| IOT106 |	Then Apple TV
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| IOT106 |	The nest
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,567	| IOT106 |	MacBook Pros HP printers
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,103	| IOT106 |	Candles in Amazon echos
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,943	| IOT106 |	So that's actually surprised since
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,967	| IOT106 |	25 + 6 million
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,503	| IOT106 |	Sowell represent
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,319	| IOT106 |	Well yeah
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:12,415	| IOT106 |	I'm not surprised too but it's interesting that they're considering
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,975	| IOT106 |	Phones and tablets traditional Computing devices as
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,255	| IOT106 |	Separate device types
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:16,767	| IOT106 |	Chris Wright
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,095	| IOT106 |	You know like an iPhone an Android device
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,143	| IOT106 |	Likely phones
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:25,215	| IOT106 |	Obviously iPhone isn't Android devices will likely at a phone
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| IOT106 |	South butt
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,335	| IOT106 |	There is value in knowing
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:30,847	| IOT106 |	What type of
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,991	| IOT106 |	Sonos
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:37,759	| IOT106 |	Stowe
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,039	| IOT106 |	Data about
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,551	| IOT106 |	Sonos
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:42,623	| IOT106 |	Crazy 25% of all Eero Network
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,647	| IOT106 |	Have Sonos
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:49,023	| IOT106 |	That actually makes sense to me because I consider Sonos it's a great product
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:52,095	| IOT106 |	I considered a higher-end product in terms of pricing
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,143	| IOT106 |	In its category
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,447	| IOT106 |	And so is the year of a kind of just fits
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,727	| IOT106 |	It does
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,495	| IOT106 |	So maybe
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,799	| IOT106 |	Maybe Sonos and Eero should get together and
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| IOT106 |	And do a little
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,431	| IOT106 |	Imesh WiFi
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:07,967	| IOT106 |	So
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,575	| IOT106 |	Was someone has
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| IOT106 |	494
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT106 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,135	| IOT106 |	Sunny single net
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,672	| IOT106 |	I kind of think that's an awful
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:19,488	| IOT106 |	Either that or that's somebody
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,536	| IOT106 |	That does this for a living
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:23,840	| IOT106 |	Does IRT type stuff for a living
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,608	| IOT106 |	I don't know
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| IOT106 |	Cuz
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:28,192	| IOT106 |	I will I will tell you that my Eero
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,216	| IOT106 |	My network
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,752	| IOT106 |	Which has a lot of crazy stuff
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:36,384	| IOT106 |	So I've got 32 online but many of my computers and phones are not running around
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,408	| IOT106 |	Right now
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,224	| IOT106 |	That's probably the most
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,784	| IOT106 |	Anything else jump out at you from the Eero stuff
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,112	| IOT106 |	So much for the Eero stuff I we talked about the wink
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,416	| IOT106 |	Edits
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:51,488	| IOT106 |	Here Wego 2.3 million products are connected to the
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,000	| IOT106 |	Link platform
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| IOT106 |	Yeah that's a lot
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| IOT106 |	Cuz I only have
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,984	| IOT106 |	Yeah I think I have about 2:12 or 12
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,544	| IOT106 |	What else
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,384	| IOT106 |	This is interesting and we're kind of
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:15,552	| IOT106 |	Scratching their heads over the definition of this but it says weeks has the 27% of Americans which is overseas
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,344	| IOT106 |	66 million Americans
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,904	| IOT106 |	I purchase a connected product for their home
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,464	| IOT106 |	Smith sounds like a high percentage
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:27,840	| IOT106 |	But there's a question of is it is it actual people or is it household and
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,632	| IOT106 |	What's a connected product
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| IOT106 |	Kira was including
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,728	| IOT106 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,544	| IOT106 |	Big number I just wish they would
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:42,688	| IOT106 |	Explain to have expunged little bit more yeah because Forrester put out data in 2016 saying that only 6%
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,200	| IOT106 |	At homes
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,224	| IOT106 |	Bought
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,064	| IOT106 |	Household salary house
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,600	| IOT106 |	And so
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,392	| IOT106 |	These numbers feel
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:51,904	| IOT106 |	Wildly
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,696	| IOT106 |	But again
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:58,304	| IOT106 |	And they have 20% of households with
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,608	| IOT106 |	Household income under 50000
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,888	| IOT106 |	Purchased a connected product
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:05,216	| IOT106 |	This a few minutes but
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:07,264	| IOT106 |	I can't say it enough
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,824	| IOT106 |	Making your Home Smart does not need to cost that much money
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:14,688	| IOT106 |	That was the other big take
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,712	| IOT106 |	Json
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:16,736	| IOT106 |	Kevin Nutella
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,552	| IOT106 |	Let me let me scroll down the 33 page
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:27,488	| IOT106 |	Wink ask people how much they think it would cost to turn your home into a smart home and 34% of American and said
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,024	| IOT106 |	About $5,000 or more
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:32,096	| IOT106 |	Still seems kind of high but whatever
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,888	| IOT106 |	9% of Americans
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:37,728	| IOT106 |	$20,000 and I have to assume that either a
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,752	| IOT106 |	They're not really
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,800	| IOT106 |	Conscious of the
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,872	| IOT106 |	Inexpensive products are out there or be
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:47,712	| IOT106 |	They really want to go with a hardwired system which will certainly add cost
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:50,528	| IOT106 |	Yes maybe maybe they called it a Crestron
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,576	| IOT106 |	Chris Savant dealer was like
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,088	| IOT106 |	Hey
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,136	| IOT106 |	I want Nathan myhrvold house
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,160	| IOT106 |	Interlinc
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,440	| IOT106 |	Here you go that's my thoughts
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:01,024	| IOT106 |	I will tell you guys though that I spent about $9,000 on
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:02,560	| IOT106 |	In my house
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,632	| IOT106 |	Granted I am an edge case really weird
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,728	| IOT106 |	Ahead of the curve trying lots of different things I'm not surprised at
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,496	| IOT106 |	I would think
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,080	| IOT106 |	I didn't add it up but I gotta believe I spent
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,616	| IOT106 |	Less than $1,000
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,896	| IOT106 |	Beasley
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,944	| IOT106 |	Yeah cuz most hubs cost about a hundred
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,064	| IOT106 |	Connect to thermostat you can L buy it
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,344	| IOT106 |	70
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,232	| IOT106 |	At 154 my lock
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:35,584	| IOT106 |	So we're closing in on a thousand but then you end but the rest of the products are all
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,632	| IOT106 |	$40 switches
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,936	| IOT106 |	$15 light bulbs
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:44,544	| IOT106 |	It's not like I'm a hundred light bulbs are connected in my house if I have 6 or 8 Maybe
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,824	| IOT106 |	I was like the light bulbs Canada
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| IOT106 |	I've spent
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:47,872	| IOT106 |	Probably 300
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,712	| IOT106 |	My motion like
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:56,064	| IOT106 |	Motion sense putting motion sensing in my utility room in my closet
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,856	| IOT106 |	And my
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| IOT106 |	Hold on
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,464	| IOT106 |	I'm counting light bulbs
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,768	| IOT106 |	$3,600
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,280	| IOT106 |	2
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:06,560	| IOT106 |	Automate 3
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,888	| IOT106 |	Sa36
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,960	| IOT106 |	That's better
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,776	| IOT106 |	That's better I'm not crazy
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,848	| IOT106 |	Did the nice thing is
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:24,992	| IOT106 |	With that there's there's a ranger product then it doesn't matter what platform product you choose you got to choose what's best for you
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,784	| IOT106 |	No matter what you choose
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,576	| IOT106 |	You know you can get started for
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,368	| IOT106 |	Like I said a hundred bucks
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:34,720	| IOT106 |	You can just add some switches are light bulbs for you know anywhere from 15 to $40
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,256	| IOT106 |	Apopka
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| IOT106 |	Sapulpa
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:37,792	| IOT106 |	Switch whenever
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,096	| IOT106 |	You can get started and add-on
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,632	| IOT106 |	Very simple and very cheap
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,168	| IOT106 |	Oh hey by the way
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,704	| IOT106 |	I should tell you
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,496	| IOT106 |	That you can buy
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,776	| IOT106 |	All of April
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,056	| IOT106 |	499
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| IOT106 |	That's what I have
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,920	| IOT106 |	Although
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,456	| IOT106 |	Since there is a
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,760	| IOT106 |	SEC privacy
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:03,136	| IOT106 |	Keep that in mind but if you like to ecobee3 with sensor you can buy it for $200
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,160	| IOT106 |	And it's homekit
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,744	| IOT106 |	That's a random little note there
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,792	| IOT106 |	Okay moving on
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,072	| IOT106 |	Little bits of news
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,352	| IOT106 |	Fun things
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,400	| IOT106 |	August has a
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,168	| IOT106 |	Pro
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,680	| IOT106 |	Lock
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,984	| IOT106 |	This is a Z-Wave based
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,520	| IOT106 |	August lock
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:22,080	| IOT106 |	This is for professional installers is called a Smart Lock
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,848	| IOT106 |	Lock Pro
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:28,992	| IOT106 |	It is only available to August Pro members and those are people who sell the security dealers and integrators who do custom homes
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:33,088	| IOT106 |	Does anybody know why
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,624	| IOT106 |	It's
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,392	| IOT106 |	Kind of
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,720	| IOT106 |	It's not something you can't buy you have to get it through a security distributor
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,792	| IOT106 |	Probably because it's
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,840	| IOT106 |	I don't know maybe
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,400	| IOT106 |	I mean I have a Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,192	| IOT106 |	I do too
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,520	| IOT106 |	Installed it I bought it at Lowes
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,080	| IOT106 |	I'm guessing they want to push more people to
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,640	| IOT106 |	There are more money
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,664	| IOT106 |	Well I imagine
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,040	| IOT106 |	Oh I mean on the installation
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,344	| IOT106 |	Regardless of the product
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:08,672	| IOT106 |	The Mindy Project has a price yes but then you're going to pay for installer
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:11,488	| IOT106 |	Well so and I will say actually cuz this just happen
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,768	| IOT106 |	The news
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,328	| IOT106 |	Security protocol actually went live
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:19,424	| IOT106 |	And so now everything that is Z-Wave has to follow the Z-Wave
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,704	| IOT106 |	S2 security
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,800	| IOT106 |	And that happened as of this weekend
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,824	| IOT106 |	I think it's April 2nd
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| IOT106 |	So
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:33,760	| IOT106 |	It's probably a security thing if I'm doing a custom install in a client wants an August lock and probably go to be like look I can't man
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| IOT106 |	App for you
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:38,624	| IOT106 |	Because it's Wi-Fi and that's that's too far gone but
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:40,672	| IOT106 |	A lot of these they can manage
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,696	| IOT106 |	To Rahab
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:45,024	| IOT106 |	Does that mean that
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,584	| IOT106 |	As the weather gets more secure
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:51,680	| IOT106 |	We will have less products that you can purchase and install yourself
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:56,032	| IOT106 |	I hope not cuz that would be very bad thing for Z-Wave in my opinion
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,336	| IOT106 |	Yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't sweat
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,384	| IOT106 |	The security is more retroactive
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,688	| IOT106 |	Holy crap people are hacking everything
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:03,968	| IOT106 |	Yeah
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:09,088	| IOT106 |	Oh I should also say I've been saying August uses Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,624	| IOT106 |	It doesn't it uses Bluetooth
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:15,232	| IOT106 |	It has Wi-Fi capabilities like if you wanted to talk to your Google home or the echo
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| IOT106 |	You have to have
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,048	| IOT106 |	Abridge
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,840	| IOT106 |	Basically have an August connect
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,448	| IOT106 |	I know
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,984	| IOT106 |	I know I meant I'm inside Bridge
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:26,496	| IOT106 |	I know your aunt
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:27,776	| IOT106 |	Sorry
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,568	| IOT106 |	Tyson
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,616	| IOT106 |	Titans
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| IOT106 |	Security holes
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,248	| IOT106 |	Will this is not good
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:40,064	| IOT106 |	Take on Samsung particular because every platform is
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,344	| IOT106 |	Constantly under
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,368	| IOT106 |	Threat of
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,160	| IOT106 |	Malware and other
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,440	| IOT106 |	Issues
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,208	| IOT106 |	Butts
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:48,512	| IOT106 |	This is not good so
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:55,680	| IOT106 |	Tyson is the iot platform that Samsung uses a platform that use variety I should say for the LG devices such as SmartThings
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,216	| IOT106 |	I believe so yes
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,032	| IOT106 |	That's the plan
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,824	| IOT106 |	That's the plan
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:06,176	| IOT106 |	I'll bet they're smart TVs for example of do their watches do
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,712	| IOT106 |	They're they're connected watches and such
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,736	| IOT106 |	In any case
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,296	| IOT106 |	So an article came out
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:17,440	| IOT106 |	That's a researcher in Israel discovered
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:17,952	| IOT106 |	Kaizen
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,232	| IOT106 |	That would
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,304	| IOT106 |	Yeah 40 that would allow hackers
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:24,864	| IOT106 |	Remote access to the millions of tizen device
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,144	| IOT106 |	Around the world
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,936	| IOT106 |	This is an actual quote
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,960	| IOT106 |	From the researcher
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| IOT106 |	Talk about Tyson
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,824	| IOT106 |	It may be the worst code I've ever seen
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,384	| IOT106 |	Everything everything you can do wrong there they do it
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:37,920	| IOT106 |	Yikes
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:38,432	| IOT106 |	Yasso
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:45,344	| IOT106 |	Happily Samsung has reached out to the researcher and said we're going to work with you on your findings and close these holes and so on
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:48,416	| IOT106 |	Haven't heard anything more official from Samsung that is so
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:55,584	| IOT106 |	All I'm going to say is if you're using tizen at all just keep an eye on things because this information
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,608	| IOT106 |	Wildin
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:58,400	| IOT106 |	Doesn't mean you're being hacked or exploited
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,472	| IOT106 |	Opportunity certainly there
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:07,616	| IOT106 |	Yes and I should know that the vulnerabilities allow hackers to take control of a tizen device
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,128	| IOT106 |	Remotely
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:13,248	| IOT106 |	Superbad which is super bad cuz a lot of a lot of iot stuff is actually
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:15,808	| IOT106 |	You need physical access to hack it or you need to be within a few
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,088	| IOT106 |	Of the device
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,624	| IOT106 |	On the same network
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:25,024	| IOT106 |	That's not great news for tizen
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,584	| IOT106 |	But let's move on I have found
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,864	| IOT106 |	A fantastic
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,632	| IOT106 |	Be interesting
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,168	| IOT106 |	Product it's called Nora
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:34,240	| IOT106 |	And you can fight it at smartnora.com
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:40,128	| IOT106 |	What it does is it to text snoring and then it inflates your pillow
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,968	| IOT106 |	So your head position change
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:44,992	| IOT106 |	Presumably
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,016	| IOT106 |	Stop snore
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:49,088	| IOT106 |	I just going to come out to you guys I snore
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:52,416	| IOT106 |	My husband will
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:57,536	| IOT106 |	Always tell me about it he actually has earplugs and is a very sad man because I
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:00,864	| IOT106 |	I do snore so I'm looking at this it's $279
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,912	| IOT106 |	Which feels like a lot of money
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,728	| IOT106 |	But but it's a smart
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:09,568	| IOT106 |	Pillows with a sensor that you put on your nightstand and listens for snoring
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,336	| IOT106 |	Brook Soso
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,360	| IOT106 |	I like the prices too bad
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,664	| IOT106 |	Well yeah that actually stops
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,456	| IOT106 |	Snoring there is a pek
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:19,040	| IOT106 |	There is a pebble thing the pebble thing is what listens for
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,344	| IOT106 |	The snoring and there is a
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:21,856	| IOT106 |	Case
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:25,440	| IOT106 |	Apparently holds the other apparatus
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,976	| IOT106 |	People seem to like it
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,280	| IOT106 |	So I may just
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,304	| IOT106 |	See how this works
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:34,144	| IOT106 |	A little bit though on the website whenever someone purchases it
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:37,216	| IOT106 |	You see Rachel from Sugarland
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,240	| IOT106 |	Just purchased one of these
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,336	| IOT106 |	DC Stacy
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,616	| IOT106 |	From Austin just purchased
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,432	| IOT106 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,224	| IOT106 |	Adding to that $9,000 bill
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:54,624	| IOT106 |	You can use this with any pillow I thought they ask at a specific pillow but now it's that you put the sum
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,440	| IOT106 |	Module underneath
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,464	| IOT106 |	The pillow that you use
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,488	| IOT106 |	Yeah it looks like
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,280	| IOT106 |	It kind of looks like my
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,048	| IOT106 |	Ice packs
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,096	| IOT106 |	Yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,376	| IOT106 |	It's a little air pump AC
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,912	| IOT106 |	Interesting to me
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,960	| IOT106 |	I will not buy to talk and I'll tell you I ate I don't
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| IOT106 |	Which is good
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:14,080	| IOT106 |	My wife and I we invested in the
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:17,408	| IOT106 |	Sleep Number beds a couple years back
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,432	| IOT106 |	And we got
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:20,224	| IOT106 |	The kind that you can actually
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,272	| IOT106 |	Raise or lower your head in your feet and such
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,808	| IOT106 |	And it uses air pump to inflate
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:27,136	| IOT106 |	The mattress to your suite number whatever
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:30,976	| IOT106 |	It's very similar technology this is just automatic on the pillow specifically
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:34,048	| IOT106 |	Yeah there's a 60-day satisfaction
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,096	| IOT106 |	Brad in Winston-Salem
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:36,608	| IOT106 |	Chess purchase
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,400	| IOT106 |	Way to go grad
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,704	| IOT106 |	There's like a telephone
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:43,264	| IOT106 |	I might buy one.
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:48,128	| IOT106 |	The shout-out to Brad who will no longer snore thanks to Nora
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,176	| IOT106 |	This is what I'm going to
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,224	| IOT106 |	I will test this out
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,504	| IOT106 |	Spy Carly
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,808	| IOT106 |	It seems like it's a good
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:59,904	| IOT106 |	Lattice 60-day money-back guarantee I mean if it's if it's terrible
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:04,512	| IOT106 |	It's Jeremy in Tempe
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:07,072	| IOT106 |	Arizona desert
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,376	| IOT106 |	And one final bit of news
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,144	| IOT106 |	Because
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:10,912	| IOT106 |	AT&T
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,472	| IOT106 |	They got a contract
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:17,568	| IOT106 |	About what is they got the contract for the First Responders system that
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:19,104	| IOT106 |	We have been waiting for since 911
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,664	| IOT106 |	Nationwide
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,200	| IOT106 |	16 years in the making
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:26,528	| IOT106 |	Now it's going to maybe start
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:32,928	| IOT106 |	Interested in is
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,696	| IOT106 |	Contract with B
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:38,816	| IOT106 |	Maxwell Air Force Base to bring the internet of things to base operations
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:41,632	| IOT106 |	Which means that they are going to
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:43,168	| IOT106 |	First off create a proof-of-concept
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:48,032	| IOT106 |	It will demonstrate smart parameters gate monitoring notifications
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:50,336	| IOT106 |	Weight management all partes making
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,128	| IOT106 |	You know Air Force bases more
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,920	| IOT106 |	I have many questions
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:57,760	| IOT106 |	Stop this and I am going to ask AT&T or maybe Maxwell Air face
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,784	| IOT106 |	Air Force Base
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:00,064	| IOT106 |	To talk about this because
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:01,856	| IOT106 |	1
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,392	| IOT106 |	It scares the bejesus outta me
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,952	| IOT106 |	Put sensors on our Air Force Base given the security problems
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,464	| IOT106 |	We have been happy
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:07,744	| IOT106 |	2
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:10,048	| IOT106 |	This is going to kill a major plot device for many
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,328	| IOT106 |	Many movies
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,144	| IOT106 |	Having well monitored
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,960	| IOT106 |	Perimeters on our bases that aren't just like
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,496	| IOT106 |	You know barbed wire
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,264	| IOT106 |	And maybe a century
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,824	| IOT106 |	And I'm thinking this because in stranger things
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,384	| IOT106 |	They had to sneak into an Arab
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:25,152	| IOT106 |	Air Force
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:25,664	| IOT106 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:34,624	| IOT106 |	And they were able to do so which helped Advance the plot and then to
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:36,928	| IOT106 |	I am currently watching the Americans and
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:39,744	| IOT106 |	FaZe nikan Twitter
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:41,536	| IOT106 |	Actually it may not be
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,072	| IOT106 |	A some sort of
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,096	| IOT106 |	Bass and
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,144	| IOT106 |	By golly they just
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,192	| IOT106 |	Right
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:50,752	| IOT106 |	So I'm overly distressed
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:55,360	| IOT106 |	I understand that I'm curious
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| IOT106 |	Weather beijing today for like
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| IOT106 |	Keep monitoring and such
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,968	| IOT106 |	You know probably
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,296	| IOT106 |	Isabel Madre
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,576	| IOT106 |	So what yeah yeah
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:05,600	| IOT106 |	Sitting
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:09,440	| IOT106 |	Then we don't know the scope of this yet
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,976	| IOT106 |	But I mean they could be
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:14,048	| IOT106 |	RFID swipe cards and such don't know yet
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:18,144	| IOT106 |	I'll be curious to see what they're using what the hell they're going to smartify base
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:23,264	| IOT106 |	Okay and as we are closing at the show the information just published
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,544	| IOT106 |	Lovely little story
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,568	| IOT106 |	That talks about
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,360	| IOT106 |	Google's new hardware
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,640	| IOT106 |	How to take on the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,688	| IOT106 |	The information is saying that
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:31,968	| IOT106 |	Google
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:36,320	| IOT106 |	Well combined their Google home intelligent speaker device with a mesh WiFi
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,088	| IOT106 |	Router such as
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,136	| IOT106 |	Wi-Fi Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,672	| IOT106 |	Time the name
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:44,256	| IOT106 |	So
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,560	| IOT106 |	Basically this makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:49,120	| IOT106 |	Unless
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:52,192	| IOT106 |	This makes a lot of sense if you keep your router's Etc out
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,520	| IOT106 |	And I see a lot of
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:36:00,128	| IOT106 |	People considering making everything from light switches to speakers into Wi-Fi
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:03,456	| IOT106 |	This is not crazy
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,992	| IOT106 |	B almonds
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,528	| IOT106 |	3 actually is
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,088	| IOT106 |	It works
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:12,416	| IOT106 |	They actually have all the Smart Home
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:12,928	| IOT106 |	Hubstaff
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,208	| IOT106 |	The Browder itself
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,488	| IOT106 |	So
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:17,536	| IOT106 |	Basically sticking a speaker in your router
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,120	| IOT106 |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:25,984	| IOT106 |	It does make sense I'm going to look at it. I added a Google Wi-Fi unit
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,752	| IOT106 |	To the
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,544	| IOT106 |	Onhub that I previously purchased
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:33,152	| IOT106 |	I even thought about adding another Google Wi-Fi unit to expand the network further
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:35,712	| IOT106 |	It would just make sense of those could double
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,480	| IOT106 |	You know as
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,808	| IOT106 |	Intelligent assistance in sonder already in several rooms
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,624	| IOT106 |	If you can have a mesh Network right you're going to
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,928	| IOT106 |	Have these things in multiple rooms so maybe make sense
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:47,488	| IOT106 |	Boxes
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,000	| IOT106 |	More ports
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,024	| IOT106 |	Yay
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,352	| IOT106 |	That's our new theme
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| IOT106 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,400	| IOT106 |	Well we have talked enough
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,192	| IOT106 |	Let us move
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,984	| IOT106 |	To a message from our sponsor and then
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,520	| IOT106 |	To Our Guest
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,336	| IOT106 |	Who is going to talk about how iot
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:08,736	| IOT106 |	Changes R&D everyone we are interrupting the podcast with a message from
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:11,808	| IOT106 |	Our sponsor
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:14,368	| IOT106 |	And I have Mark Wright director of product management
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,392	| IOT106 |	At Samsung
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,184	| IOT106 |	Arctic from the very beginning
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:22,816	| IOT106 |	I have heard much about Samsung artik module Hardware side and also on the cloud side
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,864	| IOT106 |	Can you just give me a quick overview.
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,888	| IOT106 |	Put the salt
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:32,288	| IOT106 |	Together for me Arctic is an antonym platform that integrates modules with security at pre-pro
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:35,872	| IOT106 |	Grand the connectivity so that they have secure transport
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:36,896	| IOT106 |	Into a cloud
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:38,944	| IOT106 |	So where we can virtualize products
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:42,016	| IOT106 |	We can then store data from those products
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,808	| IOT106 |	Control products manage those products
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,088	| IOT106 |	And then
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,880	| IOT106 |	It's also wrapped
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:50,464	| IOT106 |	In an API first design methodology so people can
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,768	| IOT106 |	Then also write strong apps
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,304	| IOT106 |	For those products
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,584	| IOT106 |	And also do connections
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,888	| IOT106 |	Two other services and other clouds
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:02,752	| IOT106 |	Okay so this sounds a lot like something bit manufacturers might be interested in
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:07,872	| IOT106 |	Systems integrators and I heard you say security a couple times so I'd love for you to talk to me
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:08,896	| IOT106 |	About what's unique
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| IOT106 |	Cheer on Arctic
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:12,736	| IOT106 |	We have an end-to-end platform
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,016	| IOT106 |	For manufacturers
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,552	| IOT106 |	Systems integrators
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:18,368	| IOT106 |	To use in creating product iot connect
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:20,416	| IOT106 |	Good products but as We Know
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,720	| IOT106 |	You know from many of the reports and
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:27,072	| IOT106 |	Even things that are going on in the world right now security is top-of-mind
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:28,864	| IOT106 |	Sweetfields platform development
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,400	| IOT106 |	That's the best place to put
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:32,448	| IOT106 |	Security think it through at the beginning
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:33,728	| IOT106 |	And
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,496	| IOT106 |	Been implemented
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:40,896	| IOT106 |	And what we've implemented for security is a best-in-class methodology known as AAA security
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:42,176	| IOT106 |	It's Authentication
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,456	| IOT106 |	Authorization
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,992	| IOT106 |	And the ability to audit
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,808	| IOT106 |	So what we do there is we authenticate
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,856	| IOT106 |	The user and a device
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:57,024	| IOT106 |	So that falls into the module offering that we have right and in the software we have for that software for
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:57,792	| IOT106 |	Onboarding
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,816	| IOT106 |	The end product
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:00,096	| IOT106 |	We
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:02,912	| IOT106 |	Them secure the transport into the cloud
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:06,240	| IOT106 |	So the second thing we offer is authorization
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,288	| IOT106 |	So what authorization is
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,872	| IOT106 |	Is the user that utilizing this product
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:15,968	| IOT106 |	Do they have the proper role are they authorized to do what they are trying to
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:19,296	| IOT106 |	What to do and we use certificate-based Authentication
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:25,696	| IOT106 |	For that process and then we have the ability to audit what has happened in addition to security what are the other benefit
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,232	| IOT106 |	Fits of having an end-to-end
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:30,816	| IOT106 |	Tell the benefits of an end-to-end platform
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:34,400	| IOT106 |	Are that when a manufacturer is looking at
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:36,960	| IOT106 |	Building a thing to be iot connected
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,496	| IOT106 |	It's a change in their business
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,800	| IOT106 |	Generally for a manufacturer
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:43,872	| IOT106 |	There's the electronics there's the software there's the product
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,176	| IOT106 |	But now on top of that they have taken
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:51,040	| IOT106 |	Consider RF design they have to consider protocol they have to consider cloud
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:52,576	| IOT106 |	We also have to consider
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,600	| IOT106 |	Mobile app development
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,392	| IOT106 |	And each of these
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:40:01,280	| IOT106 |	Are additional software development efforts that they have to do on top of their normal product developer
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:04,608	| IOT106 |	So utilizing an end-to-end platform
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,888	| IOT106 |	Simplify stock
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:08,704	| IOT106 |	And gives them single SDK
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:12,032	| IOT106 |	To find out more about Samsung artik Cloud

EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:38,912	| IOT106 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your hope Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:44,288	| IOT106 |	Today's guest is Simon Bomgaars who is the co-founder and CEO of a
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,568	| IOT106 |	Gitlab
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,616	| IOT106 |	Hi Simon how are you doing
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,944	| IOT106 |	Hello sexy I'm good how are you
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:52,224	| IOT106 |	I am excellent
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:53,248	| IOT106 |	So we have you
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:55,808	| IOT106 |	Voting in all the way from Germany
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:59,648	| IOT106 |	And we're here to talk about what the Smart Lab of the future is in
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:03,232	| IOT106 |	What we're talking about is basically how people do research
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:08,352	| IOT106 |	And University labs and bio pharmaceutical Labs or maybe it's just pharmaceutical labs and biology labs
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,144	| IOT106 |	There's a real
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,912	| IOT106 |	Potential
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:12,704	| IOT106 |	Iot to change kind of
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:16,544	| IOT106 |	The way research is done in the lives of
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,056	| IOT106 |	People doing the research
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:18,336	| IOT106 |	So Simon
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,640	| IOT106 |	Why don't you lay it out for me
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,664	| IOT106 |	What is the lab
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,176	| IOT106 |	The future
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:23,968	| IOT106 |	If you
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:26,528	| IOT106 |	Singapore
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:30,112	| IOT106 |	Have a look at the house today looks like they to get the traffic looks like
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:34,976	| IOT106 |	And guess you have to to see that that's a lot of manual work involved still so
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:37,024	| IOT106 |	And there's some apps that I cried
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:43,168	| IOT106 |	Automated already for example in English pharmaceutical production so I'm like the production of a dragon
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:51,872	| IOT106 |	We're closing Research Laboratories is kind of what of handwork
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:52,895	| IOT106 |	Hand cross
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,687	| IOT106 |	That that's going on there so
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:42:01,087	| IOT106 |	Is it 79 in the state of transition everything is going to be getting more digital
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:07,487	| IOT106 |	Devices instruments in the laboratory getting more intelligent and connected to other
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:09,279	| IOT106 |	Assassin in platforms
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:15,679	| IOT106 |	This is beta Chi also look like in any area in recession chemistry
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:17,471	| IOT106 |	Biotech
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,519	| IOT106 |	And the evening and dos
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:25,663	| IOT106 |	Many workers still happening lots of process will be at the alternator to end it would be easy for people
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:30,015	| IOT106 |	Set up stay where I used to do
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:30,783	| IOT106 |	Mendeley
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:39,743	| IOT106 |	And then just let the wrong and let the black run for its also by the kitchen ultimate eating time
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:43,327	| IOT106 |	Experiments and Tiny bits of data research
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:48,959	| IOT106 |	So if for example I was I don't know preparing tissue samples by hand
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:49,983	| IOT106 |	I might have to
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,519	| IOT106 |	Scrapy
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,311	| IOT106 |	Beat it something and then
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:57,151	| IOT106 |	You know I'm a little pipettes dropping things in
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:43:02,015	| IOT106 |	200 x across my samples and then sticking them somewhere and letting it grow so
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:03,039	| IOT106 |	That's where the thing
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:06,623	| IOT106 |	There's been Machinery like machine advances in the last couple
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,391	| IOT106 |	Full of yourself
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,415	| IOT106 |	Automated some of that
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:14,047	| IOT106 |	It's the truth but this was all this kind of like Island solution so that they robbed a kind of
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:18,655	| IOT106 |	Only liking able to do with 1 pound of Travis's like one
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:19,679	| IOT106 |	Giacometti
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,447	| IOT106 |	1
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:21,727	| IOT106 |	Entire process
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,775	| IOT106 |	That's being changed
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:30,175	| IOT106 |	It's transforming into that eating dose electrostatics that you are not automated
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,967	| IOT106 |	Before also can be automated
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:38,111	| IOT106 |	Very easy way meaning of it will be always like kind of manual steps in between but you will be able to
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:43,999	| IOT106 |	Flexibly combined different steps that you did she have to do in a laboratory. When mixing something
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:48,607	| IOT106 |	Using device to device I am adding some substance substance p
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,167	| IOT106 |	And we can combine these steps and
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:55,007	| IOT106 |	Get this into a much more automated workflow
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,799	| IOT106 |	So how does this change
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,335	| IOT106 |	Science like how science is
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:05,759	| IOT106 |	Of course it will be a huge change in X update on if that's going to to be produced at 6
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:07,295	| IOT106 |	Going to the generator because
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:12,927	| IOT106 |	Like alternating the workflow is not only one side and you will also be like
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:16,511	| IOT106 |	That it would be awesome by July 7th
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,535	| IOT106 |	Analyze
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,559	| IOT106 |	Buy instruments
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,423	| IOT106 |	Flow back to the tuna to the researcher
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:25,727	| IOT106 |	So that's that his task will be more
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:31,103	| IOT106 |	Really analyzing them then they sat and then actually generating it so now I would say
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:35,455	| IOT106 |	The time research has bands in the lab doing experiments using his hands
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:38,271	| IOT106 |	Shaking the reagent tubes
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:40,831	| IOT106 |	That model S 60 to 70%
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:45,183	| IOT106 |	This will be in the future. Maybe only 10% or 20% of his time
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:50,303	| IOT106 |	The rest of this time will be more on the side of analyzing the data going really index
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:53,119	| IOT106 |	There was a chance of data crunching
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:55,679	| IOT106 |	I'm finding more details
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,983	| IOT106 |	Happy overlooked before because the data was not that
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:04,383	| IOT106 |	Stan's and not that affect quality and it's it's becoming to automated data generation
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:08,479	| IOT106 |	Wow okay so then how does that change the skills needed
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:09,759	| IOT106 |	A scientist
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:12,063	| IOT106 |	Become a scientist
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,879	| IOT106 |	I had four really boring repetitive work but
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:19,999	| IOT106 |	So what
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,791	| IOT106 |	Do you need to know
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:27,167	| IOT106 |	I guess some people will read it misses a day today at work
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:33,567	| IOT106 |	I think I still think it's it's a good skill to to have to to know what's really going on in lap so because of
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:36,383	| IOT106 |	Comedian stand for
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:42,783	| IOT106 |	But yeah you're right I mean it will be more like you'd like to discuss a recession
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:49,183	| IOT106 |	The future is like not really analyzing data and being a prostitute
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:55,583	| IOT106 |	Connect data from different sources to make the available or not
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:56,863	| IOT106 |	Another way that they do it right now
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:46:03,263	| IOT106 |	It would be more in front of the computer
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,287	| IOT106 |	Standing in the laptop
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:09,151	| IOT106 |	Okay it what does this mean for sciences that involve going out into
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:13,503	| IOT106 |	The real world for part of the time I'm thinking of like you nobody your geology year
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:19,647	| IOT106 |	I don't know the people go check to Antarctica to pull up by scores of the world
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:21,183	| IOT106 |	How does that change
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:21,951	| IOT106 |	Their jobs
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,463	| IOT106 |	Out in the world
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:29,375	| IOT106 |	What is just out going upstairs now much more material
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:35,775	| IOT106 |	Toys R Us to Manchester
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:37,567	| IOT106 |	Do something
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:43,967	| IOT106 |	Video of selling animals in the wild Zora digging in the soil or something
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:50,367	| IOT106 |	Something at Aeropostale has been not saying she would not be done by robots in the future so that's something that's it
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:53,695	| IOT106 |	What is the Subspace for adventure Inn in research
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,719	| IOT106 |	Okay
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:57,023	| IOT106 |	What about it
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:47:00,351	| IOT106 |	Let's think about
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:07,519	| IOT106 |	We talked about kind of skills as a scientist does this mean they'll spend less time overall in the lab cuz I think about
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:09,823	| IOT106 |	The Graduate students in their lives are like
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:11,359	| IOT106 |	Pretty awful in Subway
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:14,431	| IOT106 |	Nazareth are married to their lives in
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:15,711	| IOT106 |	Trying to
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:18,015	| IOT106 |	Perform experiments does that change things
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:23,391	| IOT106 |	Well yeah I think so but nothing else it's so it's right I mean I can experience it
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:30,303	| IOT106 |	I was wondering why I still have to dissect to some insects and like each other mind some plans and
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:36,703	| IOT106 |	Lisa plants something
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:40,799	| IOT106 |	Aquatic exercise to get some basic skills
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:45,919	| IOT106 |	In the lab to see what's really going on to it to really understand how some things work and then I
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,455	| IOT106 |	But at the same time I think.
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:49,247	| IOT106 |	Time the people
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:50,271	| IOT106 |	Spans
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:56,415	| IOT106 |	On
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:59,999	| IOT106 |	I think it's going to be much more important in the future
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:00,767	| IOT106 |	All right
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:04,095	| IOT106 |	In what about obstacles to making all of this worked
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:09,727	| IOT106 |	Because you mentioned earlier that tanks were essentially siloed and now things are kind of coming together a little bit more
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:12,031	| IOT106 |	How is that happening are people
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:15,103	| IOT106 |	Killik scientist build so much of their own stuff
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:16,383	| IOT106 |	Their budget constraint
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:17,663	| IOT106 |	Really smart
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:18,687	| IOT106 |	How old is come about
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:23,807	| IOT106 |	I think actually in comparison to other areas the lab environment
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,087	| IOT106 |	Snow in Byram
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:27,903	| IOT106 |	It's also why it because lost it
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:36,095	| IOT106 |	Builds for for for ages like ability to endure
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:42,495	| IOT106 |	I mean the depreciation time for for Terry devices at 15 years old
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:47,103	| IOT106 |	Everyone with being in the lab most attended a lot of all the equipment around in this
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:53,247	| IOT106 |	All the cooking going to be able to connect Xfinity software iot
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:49:00,159	| IOT106 |	So this is definitely an obstacle that you have a lot of older cooking the wrong and yeah you're right I mean
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:05,535	| IOT106 |	Like ideas DIY people and then blockable their own stuff so
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:10,143	| IOT106 |	But it's just getting more and more tools available so that people can actually connect
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:12,959	| IOT106 |	What day does to other environments
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:19,359	| IOT106 |	Proprietary system software problem that's the steel manufacturers out there that think that
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:25,759	| IOT106 |	They can build their own solution that the best applications for fall for devices and epidemiology is only going to stay with
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:32,159	| IOT106 |	I don't think
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:33,951	| IOT106 |	Laboratory equipment
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:40,351	| IOT106 |	Now you guys created that folder is actually a company that helps bring together disparate parts of the lab so can you tell me a little
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:42,399	| IOT106 |	If it's not hardware-based
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:42,911	| IOT106 |	Can you think of software
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:44,959	| IOT106 |	Softworks
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,007	| IOT106 |	Can you tell me just a little bit
EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:47,519	| IOT106 |	What you're doing there
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:52,127	| IOT106 |	We started to build a electronic lock
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:55,967	| IOT106 |	Replace the paper that people
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:58,783	| IOT106 |	Used to like that they don't
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:00,575	| IOT106 |	On Lake Valley today.
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:03,135	| IOT106 |	Why do they turn into PhD accessibility office
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:08,511	| IOT106 |	But we soon realized that building an addition
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:12,095	| IOT106 |	I don't like this
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:14,911	| IOT106 |	Piece of the entire workflow
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:17,215	| IOT106 |	But in reality it's reader
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:21,823	| IOT106 |	The car off the entire left environment because of connect so my sister.
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:28,479	| IOT106 |	Center of data is collected or being at the store
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:32,063	| IOT106 |	But also the center where baby kitten experiments are planned
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,111	| IOT106 |	So
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:40,511	| IOT106 |	Flexing after having that we we should get that people also want to have a
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:43,071	| IOT106 |	Repository to Saudi
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:45,375	| IOT106 |	Standard procedures
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:48,703	| IOT106 |	Stand By the Sea one thing led to the other and now we're
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:56,127	| IOT106 |	Yes I'm kind of splat for Mrs because of the operating system for Laboratory
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:51:00,735	| IOT106 |	Being able to connect to devices and receive data from devices
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:01,503	| IOT106 |	So that's basically
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:03,295	| IOT106 |	Throw it away.
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:04,831	| IOT106 |	If we were
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:09,183	| IOT106 |	Science is right now dealing with a replication
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:11,999	| IOT106 |	Were they just can't reproduce the experiments
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:14,559	| IOT106 |	The same way that they had in the past
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:15,583	| IOT106 |	And
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:19,935	| IOT106 |	I'm very curious how it is having this level of granular data and
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:21,215	| IOT106 |	More objective data
EDL	00:51:21,983	00:51:22,751	| IOT106 |	Well
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:24,543	| IOT106 |	Maybe help solve this problem
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:28,639	| IOT106 |	Yes sir I I really think so because
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:34,783	| IOT106 |	This application
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:39,647	| IOT106 |	Already too much data from too many different sauces around
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:46,047	| IOT106 |	Pieper electric problems managing this situation
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:46,815	| IOT106 |	Cancel data
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:52,959	| IOT106 |	Just needs to the possibility that people can treat that a tire or only showed those results that they
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:57,311	| IOT106 |	Infected area hypothesis
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:52:00,383	| IOT106 |	And I really think that's giving people a platform
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:03,711	| IOT106 |	So that a tattoo to reading manage their research data
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:06,783	| IOT106 |	And also do this and that in the easy and transparent way
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:08,063	| IOT106 |	Reedy house
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:14,463	| IOT106 |	To change the mindset the Plex on the TV can collect data and combination within within two alike with it with an
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:15,231	| IOT106 |	Environment
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:17,279	| IOT106 |	Either they have two EZ shouted
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:21,375	| IOT106 |	They actually are the most straightforward way to just solving two-step problem
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:23,423	| IOT106 |	All right
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:24,447	| IOT106 |	Thank you Simon
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:25,727	| IOT106 |	And I am so glad we had this
