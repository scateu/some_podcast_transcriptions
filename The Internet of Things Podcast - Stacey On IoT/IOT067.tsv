EDL	00:00:14,336	00:00:14,848	| IOT067 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,616	00:00:17,152	| IOT067 |	And this week on the show we got to
EDL	00:00:17,152	00:00:18,176	| IOT067 |	Awesome stuff
EDL	00:00:18,176	00:00:20,224	| IOT067 |	Kevin installed an ecobee3 in
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:20,992	| IOT067 |	Discovered
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:21,504	| IOT067 |	Something
EDL	00:00:22,016	00:00:23,808	| IOT067 |	Difficult
EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:26,112	| IOT067 |	We're talking about Pokemon go
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:28,160	| IOT067 |	Just because everyone's talking about
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:28,672	| IOT067 |	Pokemon go
EDL	00:00:29,184	00:00:31,744	| IOT067 |	We got a new outdoor camera from nest
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:33,024	| IOT067 |	Its first product
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:33,792	| IOT067 |	Forever
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:37,632	| IOT067 |	We got smart car news and some other big news in the IRT space
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:38,400	| IOT067 |	But first
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:41,216	| IOT067 |	For my sponsor

EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,328	| IOT067 |	That's
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,864	| IOT067 |	X i v e
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,216	| IOT067 |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,496	| IOT067 |	Let's go
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:16,032	| IOT067 |	Take it off with
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:18,592	| IOT067 |	I don't know let's talk about your LG experience
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:24,992	| IOT067 |	Yeah what's up I think I said in the last show that I was moving and we did move in between then and now
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,272	| IOT067 |	Still unpacking but
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:29,344	| IOT067 |	I want the first things I did once I had
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:31,904	| IOT067 |	Found my new ecobee3 that I ordered
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:33,440	| IOT067 |	I try to install it
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:35,232	| IOT067 |	Well as anybody who
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:37,792	| IOT067 |	Has any covino's in for those who don't
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,072	| IOT067 |	It really needs
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:42,656	| IOT067 |	5 wires coming out of wall for the thermostat
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,704	| IOT067 |	Tips on being a common wire
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:49,824	| IOT067 |	And that is for I'm not mistaking just for the power the power up to
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:52,384	| IOT067 |	Keep the power on on the ecobee thermostat itself
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,176	| IOT067 |	Because if the ecobee has a
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,200	| IOT067 |	Touch screen
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:56,992	| IOT067 |	Explains on sofa
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:57,760	| IOT067 |	What's so
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,784	| IOT067 |	I only have 4 wires
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,832	| IOT067 |	Oh
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:04,928	| IOT067 |	Yeah but the townhouse that I moved into his Fulton mm so I'm not terribly surprised
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:09,792	| IOT067 |	You still have the original thermostat which was fine just a regular
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,560	| IOT067 |	Programmable
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,072	| IOT067 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:17,216	| IOT067 |	That shouldn't be a problem because included in any ecobee3 box is
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:18,496	| IOT067 |	Say happy birthday call
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:19,520	| IOT067 |	Tek
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,568	| IOT067 |	I forget what it stands for basically
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,176	| IOT067 |	Standard kit
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,456	| IOT067 |	So
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,016	| IOT067 |	If you use that or need that which I did
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:34,880	| IOT067 |	You actually have to crack open your HVAC system and find the circuit board of it which
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,160	| IOT067 |	Found no problem
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:40,256	| IOT067 |	And there I found 5 wires and 5 terminal
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,560	| IOT067 |	I'm like okay cool
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,584	| IOT067 |	The PCAT
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,144	| IOT067 |	As I understand it would essentially does is
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,472	| IOT067 |	You connect the 5 wires of the PE
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,240	| IOT067 |	Hey
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:52,544	| IOT067 |	To the circuit board of the HVAC system
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:56,128	| IOT067 |	And the wires you from HVAC system
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,944	| IOT067 |	You connect to the inside of the p e k
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,480	| IOT067 |	Any basically Bridges
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| IOT067 |	5 wires into 4 I think it
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:08,928	| IOT067 |	Ty's the power through the yellow or green wire don't quote me on that but essentially kind of creative virtue
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,952	| IOT067 |	Show common wire
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,232	| IOT067 |	Got it
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:13,280	| IOT067 |	Yeah that's how it's supposed to work
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,352	| IOT067 |	Well no matter what I did once I hooked it all up and
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,424	| IOT067 |	And putting HVAC system back together and all that
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:25,312	| IOT067 |	Then showed power like the screen was on which was awesome cuz it wasn't on the first time
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,360	| IOT067 |	Without a common just to see what
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,152	| IOT067 |	I knew it was kind of
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,176	| IOT067 |	But basically
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| IOT067 |	The thermostat work
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,992	| IOT067 |	You couldn't control it because you couldn't see it
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,576	| IOT067 |	So once I use the p e k
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,136	| IOT067 |	I had power d4b everything was good
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,952	| IOT067 |	Except when the air conditioning won't turn on
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:46,560	| IOT067 |	You would actually only blow the fan so the compressor outside was not on there was no
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,584	| IOT067 |	Cold air coming in
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,120	| IOT067 |	You have to realize
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,400	| IOT067 |	When we move last week
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:56,032	| IOT067 |	It was. 95 degrees and 90% humidity so we couldn't live without
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:56,544	| IOT067 |	Are
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:59,360	| IOT067 |	So am I, I don't have time to deal with this right now
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:05,504	| IOT067 |	Unconnected everything and reconnect it back to the original thermostat and then reconnected everything correctly
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,576	| IOT067 |	The HVAC system and just had air Michael do with his later
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:12,416	| IOT067 |	I found an excellent article on
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:15,488	| IOT067 |	Steve Jenkins blog and hopefully we can put it in the show notes
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,256	| IOT067 |	We will
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,815	| IOT067 |	Super it explains exactly what you need to do
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,351	| IOT067 |	What my issue was
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,167	| IOT067 |	In particular in every HVAC system is different of course
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,007	| IOT067 |	I had multiple wires in the HVAC
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,567	| IOT067 |	System control board connected to the same terminal
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,103	| IOT067 |	Send
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:35,199	| IOT067 |	Instructions are clear but they're not going to deal with every single
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,735	| IOT067 |	Nielsen arioso
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:41,855	| IOT067 |	I didn't realize I needed to keep certain wires connected and remove other wires and all that
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,903	| IOT067 |	And the last time I did this
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,951	| IOT067 |	I thought I had hit the
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:49,535	| IOT067 |	Switch on the HVAC system to flip the breakers in a power is going on and I
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,303	| IOT067 |	Didn't
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,095	| IOT067 |	And fortunately
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:55,167	| IOT067 |	When I was connecting some wires in there it's pretty tight space
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,679	| IOT067 |	Two waters
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| IOT067 |	Are supposed to touch
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,239	| IOT067 |	Actually did
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,263	| IOT067 |	I had a spark
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:02,591	| IOT067 |	All of a sudden a little LED on my HVAC control board
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:07,455	| IOT067 |	Went dead and like all know I've got to control board
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:09,503	| IOT067 |	And it's really hot outside but I was
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:11,039	| IOT067 |	How to say was in a panic
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:17,439	| IOT067 |	I sat there after retinol over the shock as well I sat there just rubbing my fingers getting feeling back
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| IOT067 |	And
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,743	| IOT067 |	Then I realize
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,583	| IOT067 |	There's a fuse on my control board in the HVAC system
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| IOT067 |	I pulled it out
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,143	| IOT067 |	Turn off at 3
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,911	| IOT067 |	Fuse was
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,679	| IOT067 |	Alone
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:30,495	| IOT067 |	Which is that's yeah that's better than losing
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,799	| IOT067 |	Exactly
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,079	| IOT067 |	Exactly of course
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:37,663	| IOT067 |	We still had boxes everywhere I didn't have spare fuses so I went out to my
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,431	| IOT067 |	Car
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:42,271	| IOT067 |	When is the fuse box in my car that lowest amperage I can find them
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:42,783	| IOT067 |	Spare fuses
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,879	| IOT067 |	I make money just put this in and see if it
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,647	| IOT067 |	Brings back
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,671	| IOT067 |	Controller back to life
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,951	| IOT067 |	I did that
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,999	| IOT067 |	My LED popped up
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,351	| IOT067 |	I connect everything properly / Steve Jenkins article
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,143	| IOT067 |	Upstairs cast of the air
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:58,911	| IOT067 |	We had air condition
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,471	| IOT067 |	It all worked out in the end
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,287	| IOT067 |	It can be tricky and even say an eagle be instructions
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,847	| IOT067 |	If you need to install the Tek
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:10,431	| IOT067 |	They warned you you're going to have to mess with your control board of your HVAC system
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,039	| IOT067 |	You may can I come without you may want to get electrician etcetera etcetera of course
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,831	| IOT067 |	On everything
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| IOT067 |	So I can do that
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,879	| IOT067 |	Yeah well
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,951	| IOT067 |	So Kevin's like
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,975	| IOT067 |	The wire hot
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:31,423	| IOT067 |	I'm going to install an HVAC system in the summer which is also the only time I install my new age
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,983	| IOT067 |	Back hurt my new thermostats and I
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,775	| IOT067 |	When we installed
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,543	| IOT067 |	Ecobee
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:41,151	| IOT067 |	And we did the ecobee smart SI cuz I installed 9 years ago
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,919	| IOT067 |	I know I need a
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,967	| IOT067 |	I'm sorry but
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,759	| IOT067 |	We actually had a similar problem
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT067 |	We actually had a
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,855	| IOT067 |	Because we had a 2-stage heat pump
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:52,927	| IOT067 |	You messed up our wiring a little bit but
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,231	| IOT067 |	Peekaboo people were super nice they haven't
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| IOT067 |	Awesome support
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,535	| IOT067 |	2
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:02,399	| IOT067 |	If I don't know if Steve Jenkins had written his article cuz that did not come up in my Google searches
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,935	| IOT067 |	When I was dealing with this but
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,215	| IOT067 |	Let Kevin
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,751	| IOT067 |	Experience piano lesson
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,799	| IOT067 |	Not a lesson that
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,567	| IOT067 |	It's too hard
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,335	| IOT067 |	You shouldn't do it
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:13,663	| IOT067 |	Because you totally should I have never wire to thermostat and things are really
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:14,943	| IOT067 |	It's not hard
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:19,039	| IOT067 |	It's not I mean pretty much every HVAC system has
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,343	| IOT067 |	At least four wires maybe five
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,671	| IOT067 |	The ecobee system the kit
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| IOT067 |	Should be able to manage it
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| IOT067 |	No matter what
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,559	| IOT067 |	Give or take him in or what your situation is
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:35,679	| IOT067 |	Don't go what one word of advice don't go by the color of the wires because not every installer
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:42,335	| IOT067 |	Puts a red wire on the red terminal Green Mountain Regional Center Etc so make sure you're looking at what the terminals are more
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,151	| IOT067 |	As opposed to just looking at wire colors
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,711	| IOT067 |	But it really is easy it is
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:51,807	| IOT067 |	Honestly if I knew what I was doing the very first time if I had Steve's instructions
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| IOT067 |	That would work for mice
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:53,855	| IOT067 |	Scenario
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:58,207	| IOT067 |	It probably was a 10-minute install literally maybe 15 is
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,487	| IOT067 |	It's not that difficult
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,303	| IOT067 |	Bright but would you like
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| IOT067 |	I have no AC
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| IOT067 |	It's 95 degrees
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,375	| IOT067 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:13,055	| IOT067 |	The clock was running and I didn't want to everybody in my house to be like super hot especially if we have you know
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,151	| IOT067 |	Pakistan Pakistan live pets and it's just not good for anybody in this heat so
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:20,991	| IOT067 |	Needless to say it's all working yes I blew the fuse hello spark fixed it
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:26,111	| IOT067 |	Diego beats working fantastic I have included remote sensor which does presents and temperature
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,391	| IOT067 |	That's in
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:31,231	| IOT067 |	Right here in my office cuz that's where I am most of the day up on the second floor so
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:36,095	| IOT067 |	Ecobee will not go to away mode when I'm not downstairs like my Nest ID
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,375	| IOT067 |	Because of the sensor
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,191	| IOT067 |	Nice and you can actually buy extra sensors
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:44,543	| IOT067 |	Pro tip
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,823	| IOT067 |	Amateur tip
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,591	| IOT067 |	Is
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,359	| IOT067 |	1
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:49,663	| IOT067 |	Don't wire hot make sure you turn off your breaker
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,711	| IOT067 |	Into
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,015	| IOT067 |	I know, I thought you knew but
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,039	| IOT067 |	My bad
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,831	| IOT067 |	The other two
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,623	| IOT067 |	Is take a photograph
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:02,207	| IOT067 |	Of your wiring before you start removing wires
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,975	| IOT067 |	I do this
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,255	| IOT067 |	Before any install
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,047	| IOT067 |	You know I take off that plate
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,839	| IOT067 |	I'm faced with wires
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,143	| IOT067 |	It's stuck under Terminals and I'm like
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| IOT067 |	Oh
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,703	| IOT067 |	This is so awesome in your gut
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,751	| IOT067 |	Changes like to start on wiring
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| IOT067 |	No
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,335	| IOT067 |	Close up photo you are dead on
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:24,223	| IOT067 |	Correct on that and I actually did do that both at the thermostat and the HVAC control board before I mess with
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,991	| IOT067 |	Anything
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:28,063	| IOT067 |	I'm glad I did since I had to redo my wiring at the thermostat
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,391	| IOT067 |	Dancehall the first time
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:36,767	| IOT067 |	And I would have forgotten it like that a red jumper cable was actually between two terminals
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,303	| IOT067 |	My old thermostat so
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT067 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,375	| IOT067 |	I still have the photos I probably will never get rid of them
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,167	| IOT067 |	You just never know
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,983	| IOT067 |	Dropbox file
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| IOT067 |	Wiring photos
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,567	| IOT067 |	All right
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,615	| IOT067 |	So that's Kevin's experience
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:58,015	| IOT067 |	Don't let it scare you it's not scary please install and uninstall thermostats to your heart's content
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,319	| IOT067 |	It's super fun and worthwhile to feel like
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,599	| IOT067 |	I am the master of my home
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,671	| IOT067 |	Badoo turn off the breaker though okay
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,463	| IOT067 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,487	| IOT067 |	The hottest
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:08,255	| IOT067 |	Staying since
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,279	| IOT067 |	My God
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,631	| IOT067 |	A Nintendo Wii maybe I can remember how people were like so hot
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,679	| IOT067 |	Now we're hyped up on
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,215	| IOT067 |	Pokemon go
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,007	| IOT067 |	It's interesting its and it's
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:19,775	| IOT067 |	You know
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,335	| IOT067 |	Nintendo mobile
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:28,735	| IOT067 |	Market that's transformed everything the past couple years until recently they put out me told me game
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| IOT067 |	I think that's what it's called
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:36,159	| IOT067 |	Avatars basically it's a little social network he kind of thing and it was okay I installed it
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:39,743	| IOT067 |	I did not install Pokemon go which is an augmented reality game
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:43,839	| IOT067 |	From the same folks that created Ingress which I did used to play
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:47,679	| IOT067 |	Both of these rest created in conjunction with nianticlabs
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,727	| IOT067 |	Which was a Google company
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,311	| IOT067 |	Then was spun off as an independent company when Google
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:57,663	| IOT067 |	Transform into alphabets we can not an alphabet company it's now a standalone company
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,455	| IOT067 |	And
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:04,831	| IOT067 |	Basically you just like Ingress or people are familiar with that you run around you know how the real world and
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,135	| IOT067 |	There might be a Pokemon nearby and
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,463	| IOT067 |	You look at your camera on your screen on your phone which has access
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| IOT067 |	Set the camera
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| IOT067 |	So the screen is showing your
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:18,143	| IOT067 |	World around you that you can see and then occasionally will show a Pokemon that you have to capture and so on so forth
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,935	| IOT067 |	I didn't install it
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:25,055	| IOT067 |	I did ask my stepdaughter to yesterday and she's like I don't want to do it and then sure enough once she did
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,079	| IOT067 |	She's been playing it all the time
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,663	| IOT067 |	Awesome and I haven't installed it because
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,431	| IOT067 |	The one
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:30,943	| IOT067 |	When I was
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,991	| IOT067 |	Ready to install it
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:37,087	| IOT067 |	The servers were down or having trouble so I was like all I'll come back and get it then I was like
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,647	| IOT067 |	Plus I'm on vacation in
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,463	| IOT067 |	Nowheresville made so actually might be interesting
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:42,975	| IOT067 |	To see if there are
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:48,607	| IOT067 |	The points cuz there's probably far fewer people out there in general
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,911	| IOT067 |	And that doesn't mean there's fewer Pokemon capture
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| IOT067 |	That's true
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,215	| IOT067 |	So
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,775	| IOT067 |	What's interesting in there a couple things that are interest
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,055	| IOT067 |	1 is
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,079	| IOT067 |	A lot of the social
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,639	| IOT067 |	Any other is this is a really
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,967	| IOT067 |	This might be the first mass-market use of AR
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,247	| IOT067 |	Which is augmented reality
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,039	| IOT067 |	Which is different from PR
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:07,551	| IOT067 |	AR
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,087	| IOT067 |	Superimposes
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,623	| IOT067 |	Digital stop on the real world
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:14,719	| IOT067 |	As opposed to BR which is like immersing all of you into an imaginary
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,231	| IOT067 |	Virtual world
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,535	| IOT067 |	And I've always been kind of
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:21,375	| IOT067 |	Alex Fierro had an AR game I don't know if you remember the little
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:27,263	| IOT067 |	I mean that they had this like game where you roll the ball and in like capture things
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| IOT067 |	It was It was kind of fun but
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:34,431	| IOT067 |	And I think it over the real world is really with me
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:34,943	| IOT067 |	Making this
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,735	| IOT067 |	So compelling.
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,271	| IOT067 |	But
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,575	| IOT067 |	It's also posing a bit of a challenge
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,647	| IOT067 |	Because we've had people setting up Pokemon lures to grab
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,183	| IOT067 |	Tumblr people there with a then
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| IOT067 |	Rob them
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,743	| IOT067 |	Their concerns from
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| IOT067 |	People who
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| IOT067 |	Are saying
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:54,143	| IOT067 |	That their homes or places like the Holocaust Music Museum
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,191	| IOT067 |	People are trying to catch
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,471	| IOT067 |	Pokemon
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,495	| IOT067 |	Fair
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,335	| IOT067 |	I think it's a really fun social
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:06,431	| IOT067 |	It is an end of the Holocaust Museum
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:10,271	| IOT067 |	Has me questioning why isn't there or should there be rather
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:15,647	| IOT067 |	A way to say my personal property or this Museum
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| IOT067 |	Whatever this Landmark is
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:21,535	| IOT067 |	How do we make this out of bounds for these ar-type games because we don't want people
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:25,631	| IOT067 |	Visiting Holocaust Museum and not paying attention which really important there
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,679	| IOT067 |	Instead they're capturing imaginary Pokemon
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,519	| IOT067 |	There doesn't seem to be a way to do that yet and I think there should be
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| IOT067 |	Well in and I stink
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:36,639	| IOT067 |	Niantic is probably recognized
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,175	| IOT067 |	Such a mess
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,711	| IOT067 |	Hector like holy cow
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,015	| IOT067 |	So I don't know if it'll be like
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,783	| IOT067 |	Their database
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,855	| IOT067 |	You know you can submit things kind of like you did
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:51,743	| IOT067 |	Google Maps
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,767	| IOT067 |	Crowdsourcing
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| IOT067 |	Information
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,303	| IOT067 |	Like
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,351	| IOT067 |	And that would be kind of more interesting it
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:01,471	| IOT067 |	Infinitely more scalable probably
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,519	| IOT067 |	You know you'd want to quickly be able to like
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:07,615	| IOT067 |	No this is this is not where you want to go
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,431	| IOT067 |	And that that would be kind of like a wave extra
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| IOT067 |	Taobao
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| IOT067 |	It'll be
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,503	| IOT067 |	I can't wait to see what they come
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:18,623	| IOT067 |	Hopefully they're coming up with something I know people are very impatient to hear this so
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,671	| IOT067 |	We'll see but
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,439	| IOT067 |	I think it's great
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,231	| IOT067 |	Only the best
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,535	| IOT067 |	The best use of AR that I've seen
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| IOT067 |	People use it
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,863	| IOT067 |	For you know
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,935	| IOT067 |	Fixing machines I've always said it could be interesting
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,727	| IOT067 |	Assembly like Ikea furniture
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:41,151	| IOT067 |	It's worth noting for people who have not yet installed it they might have read some stories that
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:47,039	| IOT067 |	The app actually if you sign in with your Google account cuz you can either sign with Google or with a Pokemon account
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,319	| IOT067 |	Bassani with Google
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,111	| IOT067 |	Literally the app had
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,415	| IOT067 |	Full access to your Google account
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,183	| IOT067 |	Massive scope
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,719	| IOT067 |	That's a bad thing
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,487	| IOT067 |	Apus
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,047	| IOT067 |	And since that
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,095	| IOT067 |	Report came out it which was confirmed
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,631	| IOT067 |	At 9 second said it was a mistake
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:05,727	| IOT067 |	And they have actually created an update for the app that you can
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:11,871	| IOT067 |	You basically revoke all the permissions and then reapply permissions and it only has maybe your email address in your you're
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| IOT067 |	Have your account name and your name and so on
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:17,247	| IOT067 |	They reduce the scope from like everything to
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,783	| IOT067 |	A lot less what it should only have
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,551	| IOT067 |	Not
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:23,647	| IOT067 |	No option have access to your full Google account save for maybe a Google app
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,207	| IOT067 |	Essay for Google
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,743	| IOT067 |	All right
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,767	| IOT067 |	We should o
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,047	| IOT067 |	Because we mention the word
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| IOT067 |	We mentioned the G word
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,095	| IOT067 |	We should mention
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| IOT067 |	Google home
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:35,935	| IOT067 |	Time
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:36,959	| IOT067 |	Not an idiot
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,263	| IOT067 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,311	| IOT067 |	Which is good because we're moving into nest
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,103	| IOT067 |	We're not going to talk a lot about the
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| IOT067 |	Because
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,175	| IOT067 |	Our Guest today is
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,711	| IOT067 |	Google
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,247	| IOT067 |	What is a product manager
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,271	| IOT067 |	Of Nest outdoor
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,039	| IOT067 |	Camera
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,319	| IOT067 |	They don't have another camera
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| IOT067 |	I know but now they do
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:56,671	| IOT067 |	New products from nest
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,463	| IOT067 |	So this is actually nest
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,743	| IOT067 |	What is launching an outdoor camera
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,279	| IOT067 |	And
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,071	| IOT067 |	What's notable here is
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,863	| IOT067 |	There's there's
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,655	| IOT067 |	That's just watching it
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,423	| IOT067 |	First new product
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,447	| IOT067 |	It was acquired by
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,495	| IOT067 |	If we
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,031	| IOT067 |	We don't count its revised
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,079	| IOT067 |	Dispersion of Dropcam which was kind of just like
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,103	| IOT067 |	Every brand
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,687	| IOT067 |	It was a Rebrand of a slight design shift but nothing like
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:23,039	| IOT067 |	We could debate whether it outdoor cameras really a design shift
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,063	| IOT067 |	But it is
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,111	| IOT067 |	You because
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,159	| IOT067 |	In this camera
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,463	| IOT067 |	What they did this is a very nice thing to do
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:38,911	| IOT067 |	Something that most people probably wouldn't think about which is the adapter so this is actually a wired camera for outdoors
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:42,495	| IOT067 |	And everyone's like
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,799	| IOT067 |	They make the adapter so weatherproof
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:47,615	| IOT067 |	Could sit under a bank of snow or in a puddle of water
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,455	| IOT067 |	And still work which means you can plug it into any outdoor
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,479	| IOT067 |	Outlet on
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,503	| IOT067 |	If you have
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,319	| IOT067 |	And so it makes it much easier install so
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,599	| IOT067 |	I actually thought that was
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,183	| IOT067 |	Did they say what this is going to retail for
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| IOT067 |	This is going to retail for 199
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,767	| IOT067 |	Pre-order it as of
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| IOT067 |	Today
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,327	| IOT067 |	Today being Thursday
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,095	| IOT067 |	And
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,911	| IOT067 |	It won't ship though until September
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,007	| IOT067 |	And we'll talk we'll talk about some of the other stuff
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,799	| IOT067 |	In the interview but we did wanted
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,591	| IOT067 |	But you guys know that that's out there
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,871	| IOT067 |	It is going to compete with
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,431	| IOT067 |	There's outdoor cameras from Arlo which
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,223	| IOT067 |	I'm working with now
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,783	| IOT067 |	I'm also in the fall we're going to get
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,855	| IOT067 |	An outdoor camera from netatmo
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,391	| IOT067 |	Call the presents camera
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,927	| IOT067 |	And then there's the stick up cam
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| IOT067 |	I'm laying
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| IOT067 |	Which is
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,535	| IOT067 |	Wireless but has its own solar panel
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:39,583	| IOT067 |	And they're all in
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:40,863	| IOT067 |	French they're all
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,911	| IOT067 |	At Darla's are bit more
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,447	| IOT067 |	Tampa Bay stations
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:48,031	| IOT067 |	Stick up cam
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:48,799	| IOT067 |	Presents
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,591	| IOT067 |	1-99 range
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,895	| IOT067 |	Cool and then
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:55,967	| IOT067 |	I see that if you have a nest aware so
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,735	| IOT067 |	Subscription
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| IOT067 |	It person alerts
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,271	| IOT067 |	As well
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,295	| IOT067 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:03,135	| IOT067 |	Then and we talked about that it's basically the camera
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,903	| IOT067 |	What's a dog
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,183	| IOT067 |	Car
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,975	| IOT067 |	Useful for
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,511	| IOT067 |	Send a text Sharon
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,071	| IOT067 |	UA new products
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,119	| IOT067 |	New products
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,399	| IOT067 |	You can learn a lot more
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,703	| IOT067 |	Frowned upon this camera
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:18,239	| IOT067 |	After later messages
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:23,615	| IOT067 |	I was going to sing a little after these messages
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,687	| IOT067 |	Talk about
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:27,711	| IOT067 |	Smart cars
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT067 |	And not Tesla
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,527	| IOT067 |	Not Tesla
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| IOT067 |	Alibaba
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,391	| IOT067 |	Which is the
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:37,951	| IOT067 |	I will call it China's Amazon
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:41,791	| IOT067 |	Yeah that's fair I I did not know I mean we knew they weren't e-commerce
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,351	| IOT067 |	Play before I did not know that
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,143	| IOT067 |	Working on
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:49,215	| IOT067 |	Their own operating system for iot
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| IOT067 |	Yeah it
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,799	| IOT067 |	Well they had the Arduino board
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:56,895	| IOT067 |	And they have the you know a switch is there iot OS
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| IOT067 |	And
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:01,503	| IOT067 |	They're putting that in this car that's going to retail for
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,783	| IOT067 |	I think it's about 23,000
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| IOT067 |	Now they're not selling at us so
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| IOT067 |	Don't get your hopes up
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:13,535	| IOT067 |	But what's Happening Here is there putting this OS in there with the idea of creating
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,327	| IOT067 |	A smart car that can
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:15,839	| IOT067 |	Payments
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:23,263	| IOT067 |	Work with internet services like radio services I don't know all the type of things in this
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,031	| IOT067 |	Because
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:28,895	| IOT067 |	This makes sense because they are an e-commerce as we said like the Amazon of
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:33,759	| IOT067 |	China and it seems to me that most of the at least initial features in the you know s
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,783	| IOT067 |	Inside this car
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,343	| IOT067 |	Are all Commerce related so you can
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,391	| IOT067 |	Reserve and pay for parking spaces
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| IOT067 |	You can pay for gas you can
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,951	| IOT067 |	Pay for coffee so it
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,743	| IOT067 |	The key word is pepepe where I guess
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| IOT067 |	Bye bye bye
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,095	| IOT067 |	So it makes sense it's almost like if Amazon weird
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,607	| IOT067 |	Put
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,631	| IOT067 |	It's
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| IOT067 |	Don't say her name but
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,703	| IOT067 |	The Voice services
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:58,079	| IOT067 |	Voice services in cars natively
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,895	| IOT067 |	So that you could do the same thing just you know
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,687	| IOT067 |	I'm heading out to the movies
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,455	| IOT067 |	Histamine
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,247	| IOT067 |	Buy some tickets for me
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:08,831	| IOT067 |	Pay for my parking let me order food whatever it maybe
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:09,855	| IOT067 |	Anythink Commerce
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| IOT067 |	Cremated ashes
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,647	| IOT067 |	It just kind of fit
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:16,255	| IOT067 |	I don't know that I want that in my car and I granted I can't get this car but
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:20,095	| IOT067 |	Could this be a trending if so I don't I don't know that I want to let me know
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,631	| IOT067 |	It just moves everything from the phone to the
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:22,655	| IOT067 |	Car
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,263	| IOT067 |	It's going to move everything
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,031	| IOT067 |	To the phone
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,079	| IOT067 |	And of the car and your home hub
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:34,175	| IOT067 |	The idea is that it'll be so deeply integrated
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,199	| IOT067 |	And hopefully
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:39,039	| IOT067 |	Like they're talking about this is a platform that works with Chinese smart cities
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,599	| IOT067 |	Imagine if you
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,391	| IOT067 |	You pulled up to a parking meter
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:46,975	| IOT067 |	It communicated with your car like a 2 hours of parking
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,999	| IOT067 |	It's going to cost you ten bucks
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:53,887	| IOT067 |	And the accounts already there so you don't have to download like an app for every city that you're in
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:54,911	| IOT067 |	I mean
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| IOT067 |	That's why
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,983	| IOT067 |	It done well
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,543	| IOT067 |	Adam poorly than yes you're going to be like
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,615	| IOT067 |	Play Everybody's shouting at me to buy stuff
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,383	| IOT067 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:10,271	| IOT067 |	Yeah we can definitely reduce barriers to make it easier to buy things and
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:16,672	| IOT067 |	And get Services you know maybe that maybe going to a parking garage in your example and as you check in you know normally we get a ticket
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,208	| IOT067 |	Google search for space
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:21,024	| IOT067 |	He could actually say there's a space on level two
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,560	| IOT067 |	Spot47
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT067 |	And
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,888	| IOT067 |	Is it $10 do you want it
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| IOT067 |	You know so yes
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,704	| IOT067 |	Makes things easier
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,008	| IOT067 |	But I worry because
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:35,360	| IOT067 |	All these different operating systems and platforms moving to
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,408	| IOT067 |	Other devices now you
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:40,224	| IOT067 |	I want to use the F-word Bonnie's at fragmentation you know
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:43,296	| IOT067 |	So I pull in with my car that maybe it runs a voice
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:45,344	| IOT067 |	Services not using her name
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,112	| IOT067 |	Not
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,880	| IOT067 |	You know s
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,928	| IOT067 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,208	| IOT067 |	Play services
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,768	| IOT067 |	So you know then
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:55,072	| IOT067 |	I mean I'm sure I could pay through normal means
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:55,584	| IOT067 |	But
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:57,376	| IOT067 |	It's not a major mishap
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,680	| IOT067 |	But I just worry that you don't send
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:02,496	| IOT067 |	It adds complexity at the endpoints
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,264	| IOT067 |	You know
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,592	| IOT067 |	When things don't work it's going to be
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,128	| IOT067 |	Worse than ever
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,968	| IOT067 |	When you can't park in the garage or you can't
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:16,320	| IOT067 |	Well I mean I know people now that won't shop at places that do not take Apple pay
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,624	| IOT067 |	Android pay or Samsung pay
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,672	| IOT067 |	Gogoat someplace else
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,976	| IOT067 |	Because to them it's more convenient I don't
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,256	| IOT067 |	Like maybe I didn't care in my wallet.
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:29,376	| IOT067 |	So what are we going to do we're going to drive our car parking lot and see who they take
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,680	| IOT067 |	They work with you know S I can't park here
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,704	| IOT067 |	You know what
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,728	| IOT067 |	I don't want that
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:38,848	| IOT067 |	I don't think that I can't imagine people living room on the table like that but I could be wrong
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,872	| IOT067 |	People did do that
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,384	| IOT067 |	With Apple
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:44,992	| IOT067 |	They didn't enter coming back around now too and adding
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:47,808	| IOT067 |	Support for the different payment services when they tried to
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,832	| IOT067 |	Focus on
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,112	| IOT067 |	Using only one for that
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,928	| IOT067 |	Bright it's going to be harder
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,952	| IOT067 |	Before it gets better
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,464	| IOT067 |	Sadly
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:55,744	| IOT067 |	All right
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:58,048	| IOT067 |	Will hear some quick news we're going to run down
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| IOT067 |	First off
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:22:59,840	| IOT067 |	Canary
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:04,448	| IOT067 |	All In One Security device has signed a partnership this week with Liberty Mutual
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,472	| IOT067 |	End
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,800	| IOT067 |	This ties in with last week's podcast we had Ryan rice
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,824	| IOT067 |	II was at
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,360	| IOT067 |	American Family Insurance
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:12,896	| IOT067 |	I'm talking about
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,432	| IOT067 |	How people might buy this
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:14,944	| IOT067 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:15,968	| IOT067 |	So
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,808	| IOT067 |	Canary with Liberty Mutual what's going to happen is you get a discount
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,088	| IOT067 |	If you have a canary
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,416	| IOT067 |	Canary also has a partnership with State Farm
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,208	| IOT067 |	You don't share all your info
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:29,280	| IOT067 |	Cremation you only share some of it but the idea of like being able to
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:32,096	| IOT067 |	Monitor things while you're away is really
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,608	| IOT067 |	Compelling
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,656	| IOT067 |	Shopping burglaries also
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,424	| IOT067 |	Compelling
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,448	| IOT067 |	So everyone wins
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:37,984	| IOT067 |	That should be good
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,520	| IOT067 |	Now I will stay
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:45,408	| IOT067 |	Canary was a partner with Apple homekit so if you are excited about getting a canary you may want to wait
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,224	| IOT067 |	The fragmentation issue
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:52,064	| IOT067 |	Because they're going to launch a second-generation product is going to be homekit compatible
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:55,904	| IOT067 |	And I know that a lot of people don't want to give up there
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:58,720	| IOT067 |	Personal information to get discounts on insurance
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,024	| IOT067 |	I kind of I understand that
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:06,144	| IOT067 |	But actually I'm doing it I'm doing it through Progressive with my auto insurance my wife and I both had to do a little
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,704	| IOT067 |	Odbc
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,752	| IOT067 |	Montreal the plugs in it Progressive gets
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,288	| IOT067 |	All of the data from our cars
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:15,872	| IOT067 |	And we get a discount in return for providing that data so
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,432	| IOT067 |	Any monies money I'll give it up
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:21,504	| IOT067 |	Next item on the news is
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,040	| IOT067 |	Let's see what is the next
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:24,832	| IOT067 |	GE
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,368	| IOT067 |	Predix
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,416	| IOT067 |	OTR
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:33,536	| IOT067 |	They signed a deal to partner with Azure so customers who are using critics as software
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:40,704	| IOT067 |	Hosted on GE predix cloud
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:46,080	| IOT067 |	Products which applications
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,640	| IOT067 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| IOT067 |	And this is
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,968	| IOT067 |	This is actually
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,736	| IOT067 |	Grateful
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:55,808	| IOT067 |	So it's great for Michael
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:59,392	| IOT067 |	Because in my conversations with people
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| IOT067 |	A big Industrial
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,952	| IOT067 |	Conglomerates
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:04,000	| IOT067 |	Their customers do not
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:07,840	| IOT067 |	I want to say they don't trust you either but they're like geru really a cloud provider
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,376	| IOT067 |	RIT Department
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,144	| IOT067 |	Feels better
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:10,656	| IOT067 |	Going with Mike
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:11,936	| IOT067 |	So
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:15,520	| IOT067 |	This is going to help GE get those customers who are like
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:21,664	| IOT067 |	I don't know about your Cloud it may be awesome but my it department is not keen on that you know cuz what's happening is
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,480	| IOT067 |	OT. Operational tag
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,040	| IOT067 |	Can the industrial tech people there like we love GE
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,064	| IOT067 |	But it Department
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:30,880	| IOT067 |	Has to get involved now with I like the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,672	| IOT067 |	I love Microsoft
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,696	| IOT067 |	So
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:35,488	| IOT067 |	This deal makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:41,632	| IOT067 |	And it's great for pretty much everyone involved in GE will still have its own cloud
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,680	| IOT067 |	For people who want to just stick their stuff there
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,960	| IOT067 |	But I imagine a lot of
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,752	| IOT067 |	Microsoft in
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:50,336	| IOT067 |	Let me just tell you Microsoft is either a marketing genius
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:52,640	| IOT067 |	Or they're really winning
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,664	| IOT067 |	A lot of iron
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,944	| IOT067 |	Deals
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,736	| IOT067 |	They've been killing it on the other side
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,272	| IOT067 |	Honestly
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,552	| IOT067 |	Obviously battling Google
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,112	| IOT067 |	Amazon Amazon web services
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,160	| IOT067 |	Several other traditional Cloud players
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:08,000	| IOT067 |	So this is I think they're doing really well they're doing what they need to do
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| IOT067 |	Is
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT067 |	Stay
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,816	| IOT067 |	Relevant
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,840	| IOT067 |	In this club Meets World
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,912	| IOT067 |	So the other
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:19,520	| IOT067 |	Piece of news is really an app recommendation I did do this I'm on this week in Google
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| IOT067 |	Recommended it there so you
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,592	| IOT067 |	You can just like skip ahead if you
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| IOT067 |	I want to hear it again
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:25,152	| IOT067 |	But I had to tell everybody
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,688	| IOT067 |	The podcast because it's
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:31,808	| IOT067 |	It's called Alexa Alexa it's by the Unified
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,856	| IOT067 |	Unified computer
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,880	| IOT067 |	Intelligence Corporation
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,184	| IOT067 |	Yes ucic
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:41,024	| IOT067 |	If you Google Alexa and you see I see you're going to find it
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,816	| IOT067 |	It will put in the show notes as well
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| IOT067 |	It's for iOS
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,376	| IOT067 |	Turn Android in all it does
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,144	| IOT067 |	Is you press a button
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:48,960	| IOT067 |	You bring it to your Amazon account
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,288	| IOT067 |	I thought you just press a button and you're like
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:55,360	| IOT067 |	Turn off living room lights you don't even have to say your name
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:55,872	| IOT067 |	And then
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:58,432	| IOT067 |	I didn't mean I've done it in my life
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,456	| IOT067 |	Wish I could say
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,736	| IOT067 |	C4 my netatmo camera
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:04,320	| IOT067 |	Is basically replicates the
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,624	| IOT067 |	Feature of the
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,928	| IOT067 |	Hardware remote that you can get
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,208	| IOT067 |	With
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,232	| IOT067 |	The echo
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:15,328	| IOT067 |	It doesn't play music so you can't set timers and you can't
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:19,680	| IOT067 |	But that's okay but but it's a software implementation of the hardware remote which is
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,704	| IOT067 |	Really clever
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,472	| IOT067 |	And this is
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:24,032	| IOT067 |	I thought it must have been eight months ago
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,312	| IOT067 |	It's not longer I said
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:25,824	| IOT067 |	I wish
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,128	| IOT067 |	This type of functionality was built into the
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,432	| IOT067 |	App that comes with the echo
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:37,088	| IOT067 |	You know why can't why do I need a Bluetooth remote to speak to the thing when I'm not in the same room that why can't I just use the app
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,624	| IOT067 |	Can my phone as microphone
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,208	| IOT067 |	Exactly how I do wish they would do a widget
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:48,864	| IOT067 |	That would be nice but are you 100% sure this is IOS as well because I'm looking icy it for Android
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,936	| IOT067 |	I lied to you you're right it is
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,704	| IOT067 |	Only
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| IOT067 |	Android
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,520	| IOT067 |	Sorry so sorry people with the iOS
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,568	| IOT067 |	Tell if your side just went out from the iOS
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,360	| IOT067 |	Oh
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,200	| IOT067 |	So that I think
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,736	| IOT067 |	Is pretty much everything
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,016	| IOT067 |	That's all the News That's fit
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:08,320	| IOT067 |	I guess no need to talk about this week
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,600	| IOT067 |	Kevin Kevin was moving
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,904	| IOT067 |	And I am on vacation so
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,696	| IOT067 |	It's possible we missed some stuff
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,768	| IOT067 |	And you know what will come Circle back to it
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,048	| IOT067 |	And
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| IOT067 |	I'm still recovering from
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:19,840	| IOT067 |	Trying myself
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| IOT067 |	Yes
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:24,960	| IOT067 |	Don't wire hot
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,240	| IOT067 |	Who
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,824	| IOT067 |	No so I want to hear more about the nest outdoor Cam and I think I know who's going to tell
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:33,152	| IOT067 |	Yes stay tuned for May who
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,688	| IOT067 |	Naughty weather
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,480	| IOT067 |	Is a product manager at
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:43,904	| IOT067 |	Hey Rita break into the podcast for a message from Wolf SSL here I've got Larry stefanik
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,208	| IOT067 |	Who is the CEO Larry who is
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,792	| IOT067 |	CeCe worthy experts
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:54,144	| IOT067 |	On device security we've been working in the space for the last decade
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:56,704	| IOT067 |	We're now the most widely deployed
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,984	| IOT067 |	Security solution
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:01,824	| IOT067 |	For the iot with over a billion devices secured at this point
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,104	| IOT067 |	That is a lie
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:04,640	| IOT067 |	A devices
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,176	| IOT067 |	What goes into
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,944	| IOT067 |	Securing and IRT
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:11,040	| IOT067 |	So we think about three key things first of all
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:15,136	| IOT067 |	The the data in transit or the data between your device
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,928	| IOT067 |	And your cloud
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:20,256	| IOT067 |	So the the traditional are most popular way
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,560	| IOT067 |	To secure that data
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,840	| IOT067 |	Is through
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:27,424	| IOT067 |	The SSL protocol which is the protocol that is used
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,984	| IOT067 |	On the rest of the internet for securing
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,008	| IOT067 |	Data in transit
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:33,312	| IOT067 |	We also think a lot about
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,104	| IOT067 |	Securing data on the device
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:35,872	| IOT067 |	6 l
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| IOT067 |	So encrypting
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,432	| IOT067 |	Data that you might
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,456	| IOT067 |	Have on your device that you
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,248	| IOT067 |	Needs to be private
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,552	| IOT067 |	And it finally we help companies
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,112	| IOT067 |	Make sure they're the firmware update
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,184	| IOT067 |	It's one of the clever things that attackers like to do
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:53,024	| IOT067 |	Two devices is install their firmware instead of yours
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,328	| IOT067 |	So what you need to do is Havasu
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,096	| IOT067 |	Secure Channel
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,120	| IOT067 |	To your device
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,448	| IOT067 |	The best way to do that the most common way to do that is through
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,472	| IOT067 |	SSL
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:04,032	| IOT067 |	And we do all of the above that's what we do
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:08,640	| IOT067 |	BrandsMart created where in Automotive
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:11,456	| IOT067 |	Industrial Automation consumer devices
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,992	| IOT067 |	In medical devices
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,808	| IOT067 |	And we address this wide range of markets
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,320	| IOT067 |	Through
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:21,696	| IOT067 |	A long list of Partnerships that we have with the silicone vendors in that the operating system vendors
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,744	| IOT067 |	Alright well
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,256	| IOT067 |	Refined
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:29,888	| IOT067 |	So just check us out and wolf ssl.com coyote
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:39,872	| IOT067 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the iot podcast I'm your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:43,200	| IOT067 |	And today's guest is mehu manual
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,504	| IOT067 |	Who is a product manager for the nest
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:49,856	| IOT067 |	Easier to talk about this big news today which is the release
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:53,184	| IOT067 |	New outdoor security camera
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| IOT067 |	Hey man what are you doing
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:57,024	| IOT067 |	I'm getting great thanks for having me
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,560	| IOT067 |	Really appreciate it
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,352	| IOT067 |	I am super excited
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,632	| IOT067 |	Because
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,912	| IOT067 |	I love Outdoors
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:05,216	| IOT067 |	Security cameras I'm currently testing the Arlo's
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,520	| IOT067 |	I have an order in for the netatmo welcome
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,080	| IOT067 |	So now I'm like oh my gosh
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:11,616	| IOT067 |	Come September I should
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,640	| IOT067 |	Check out the
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,920	| IOT067 |	Nest outdoor cam
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:17,248	| IOT067 |	Tell us a little bit about what you guys were thinking
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,296	| IOT067 |	When you decided to go
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:19,808	| IOT067 |	Design
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,088	| IOT067 |	Sure
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:24,928	| IOT067 |	Take a step back
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:30,048	| IOT067 |	All experience using Nest cam indoor and we decided on a place of peace
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,840	| IOT067 |	That you wanted to go to the camera on
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,144	| IOT067 |	And yet realized after you
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| IOT067 |	Joseph dropped MN
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,984	| IOT067 |	Users had told us
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,800	| IOT067 |	They want to use camera
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:45,920	| IOT067 |	If you want to secure their homes the benefit they when I get out of this protect their own
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:49,248	| IOT067 |	And if they want to protect their home
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:52,064	| IOT067 |	Look around today your security cameras better
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:53,856	| IOT067 |	Market
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:57,440	| IOT067 |	And you realize that most of the cameras either
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,744	| IOT067 |	Rely on a motion light sensor
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:05,376	| IOT067 |	And unfortunately this resulted in a camera
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,144	| IOT067 |	Either
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,168	| IOT067 |	Off all the time
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,240	| IOT067 |	Essentially dependent on Angela. Sanchez
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,312	| IOT067 |	Oscar results
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,848	| IOT067 |	And the question
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,920	| IOT067 |	As a user if you wanted to buy a camera
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,456	| IOT067 |	Woodley traffic camera
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,992	| IOT067 |	That actually stays off all the time
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:26,624	| IOT067 |	You know how can security camera be a camera that sees off all the time
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:31,232	| IOT067 |	An answer was very clear to us that we had to go to camera
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:34,048	| IOT067 |	Add stands guard 24/7
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:37,376	| IOT067 |	We also wanted to go to Canada Actually
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,680	| IOT067 |	130 degrees
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,728	| IOT067 |	Indian Knight and Day
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:46,848	| IOT067 |	Absolutely athletically beautiful so that my wife would actually
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:51,456	| IOT067 |	House vs bee industrial design that typically does cameras have
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:54,016	| IOT067 |	And lost
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:57,344	| IOT067 |	But actually texted bondage of the machine learning
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,880	| IOT067 |	That is available
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,392	| IOT067 |	Bill vision
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,000	| IOT067 |	Westchester
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,024	| IOT067 |	Pain
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:06,560	| IOT067 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,352	| IOT067 |	So let's dig into this little bit
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,144	| IOT067 |	The camera is
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:12,192	| IOT067 |	Wired so I have to have it plugged in
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:18,848	| IOT067 |	Are you told me that is ip65 rated which means it's good for rain dust and other outdoor use
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,408	| IOT067 |	It's adapter
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:25,504	| IOT067 |	Is actually a higher rating so I guess you told me it could be buried in snow which is super fun
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,296	| IOT067 |	I would love that here in Austin Tech
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,832	| IOT067 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,624	| IOT067 |	Mine is more like it will it melt
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:35,744	| IOT067 |	Beyonce all the cameras that are wired
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:39,840	| IOT067 |	Available sounds of your life that as a user of how to drill a hole in my
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:42,656	| IOT067 |	On walls actually take the virus the doctor
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,424	| IOT067 |	Bikes
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:47,008	| IOT067 |	Which essentially difficult puzzle DIY because yfu
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:50,336	| IOT067 |	Uses of calendula research
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:52,384	| IOT067 |	So what we did is we designed the first
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:54,176	| IOT067 |	Apple wireless adapter
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:57,504	| IOT067 |	Mitch is IP67 radio dimensions
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,528	| IOT067 |	/.
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:01,600	| IOT067 |	Inside a small being a pot of water
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:07,744	| IOT067 |	And I don't obviously recommend to put it inside of puddle of water
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:08,512	| IOT067 |	Videos season
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| IOT067 |	Weather
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:15,936	| IOT067 |	And you could easily plug into your outdoor outlet installation
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:17,472	| IOT067 |	Got it yes
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:22,336	| IOT067 |	Because that is the reason most people are like sacrificing your wireless camera
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,128	| IOT067 |	I just don't want to mess with
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,152	| IOT067 |	Treeland stuff into
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,176	| IOT067 |	My house which is
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:26,688	| IOT067 |	Intimidating
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,272	| IOT067 |	Before you get to the software is
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:32,320	| IOT067 |	You guys have a microphone on this camera
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:35,392	| IOT067 |	Which I thought was kind of interesting because it means
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,952	| IOT067 |	I could talk to people and they can talk back to me
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,488	| IOT067 |	Why did you
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,912	| IOT067 |	Just realized the bunkers
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:49,472	| IOT067 |	Number one that's Run for the burglars of Dialga
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:51,520	| IOT067 |	Camera camera
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,312	| IOT067 |	And wild and Luke kissing
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:57,408	| IOT067 |	Queen for the house that they want to work like that
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:00,224	| IOT067 |	And if you can tell you is the camera there is a person in it
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,248	| IOT067 |	Camera
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,832	| IOT067 |	To get their attention and say hey
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,624	| IOT067 |	Why are you here okay
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,392	| IOT067 |	What's up can I help you
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:11,488	| IOT067 |	At that point in time and becomes a quite a bit of the trying to get their attention
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:19,936	| IOT067 |	That was a fighter
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,008	| IOT067 |	The second reason is that a lot of people you could just
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,288	| IOT067 |	Erin Broderick
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,568	| IOT067 |	Franchi Auto door
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:29,152	| IOT067 |	And that's right there is a delivery driver
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:44,256	| IOT067 |	So this seems like it might encroach a little bit on the video doorbell Market
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:47,328	| IOT067 |	Obviously you're going to tell me I should buy an outdoor nest
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:48,608	| IOT067 |	Instead of a video doorbell
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,400	| IOT067 |	Could these devices work
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,448	| IOT067 |	Together or do you really see them as
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:56,800	| IOT067 |	Little things that
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,976	| IOT067 |	Let's talk about software
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:18,048	| IOT067 |	You guys are introducing new software
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:18,816	| IOT067 |	4
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,888	| IOT067 |	This camera or is it a new Nest app for honest
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,400	| IOT067 |	Devices
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,472	| IOT067 |	It's a new one that's that for all NetSpend Eliza
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:27,776	| IOT067 |	Specifically for all net
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:34,176	| IOT067 |	Users and abusers
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,200	| IOT067 |	Will be able to use this
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:38,016	| IOT067 |	And then there are three critical
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:41,088	| IOT067 |	Teachers that were bringing it back
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,112	| IOT067 |	One of them is
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,208	| IOT067 |	Dropping users had enjoyed through.
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:48,000	| IOT067 |	We're bringing that to netcam as well
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:50,048	| IOT067 |	And that feature allows you to
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:51,328	| IOT067 |	Shadow video feed
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,608	| IOT067 |	Off your camera
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,912	| IOT067 |	Your neighbor out your nanny or two grandparents
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,776	| IOT067 |	II
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,312	| IOT067 |	Features are called spaces
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,640	| IOT067 |	And then as I mentioned early on little bit
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,712	| IOT067 |	Feature that allows you
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:14,112	| IOT067 |	Pictures of beautiful to rectangular few of the radio stations within that's how it in their house
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,880	| IOT067 |	Living room
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,928	| IOT067 |	Dining room wherever they have police camera
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,232	| IOT067 |	It is that a beautiful
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,256	| IOT067 |	What it takes
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,536	| IOT067 |	All the connected devices
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,376	| IOT067 |	Are protected or any other devices
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:27,680	| IOT067 |	Puts it in between the spindle space
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,960	| IOT067 |	Odoo user
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,240	| IOT067 |	Now I no longer have it
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,776	| IOT067 |	Think about whether this thermostat
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:34,336	| IOT067 |	Or downstairs living room or upstairs
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,128	| IOT067 |	Now the states of southeast
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,896	| IOT067 |	Easiest way to
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,408	| IOT067 |	Absolute
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:43,808	| IOT067 |	Teachers that we are introducing which is available to all natural
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:44,576	| IOT067 |	Subscribers
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| IOT067 |	But has yellow on Dropcam
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,720	| IOT067 |	This feature is called person
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:53,792	| IOT067 |	And we really work
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:54,560	| IOT067 |	Hard
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:55,584	| IOT067 |	To understand
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,376	| IOT067 |	How to bring about the machine learning
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:38:01,216	| IOT067 |	Nei capabilities into this cameras and what you're trying to
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:04,032	| IOT067 |	Did you get that human behavior
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:04,800	| IOT067 |	So
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,312	| IOT067 |	Does humans
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,664	| IOT067 |	But you know that it's not there not perfect
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:11,968	| IOT067 |	Because we miss the things and we sometimes
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,016	| IOT067 |	Communicating
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:20,928	| IOT067 |	When there's a person in front of the camera there are times
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,304	| IOT067 |	And I kissed
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,264	| IOT067 |	Might be hidden behind your mailbox
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,824	| IOT067 |	Kind of spending only face is visible
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:42,944	| IOT067 |	Or they're just walking towards a vehicle in between toe only torso
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:49,600	| IOT067 |	So then we actually give you an ability
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,904	| IOT067 |	Still get the alert by saying the hay
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:59,584	| IOT067 |	And the reason behind his back we realized that ultimate judgment ultimate decider is you
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,376	| IOT067 |	You're the owner of your home Georgia
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,400	| IOT067 |	The Protector
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,424	| IOT067 |	And you want to
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,472	| IOT067 |	Used machine learning and AI
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,752	| IOT067 |	To augment your intelligence
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:07,776	| IOT067 |	Not just
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,312	| IOT067 |	Give me the answer
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,080	| IOT067 |	Which is black and white
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:18,528	| IOT067 |	Would you also be able to do facial recognition on top of this because I know that I have the same UPS
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,112	| IOT067 |	A notification
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,904	| IOT067 |	From my outdoor Nest cam
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,048	| IOT067 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:33,120	| IOT067 |	As I mentioned early on
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:35,680	| IOT067 |	With this journey we've started about a year ago
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:40,032	| IOT067 |	Work that journey in this is some definitely something Vivint
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:40,544	| IOT067 |	Thinking about it
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:43,616	| IOT067 |	Trying to figure out what is the best way to provide the benefits
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,152	| IOT067 |	Can you set an alarm
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:47,456	| IOT067 |	Okay and then a question about spaces
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:49,760	| IOT067 |	What is the visual
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:50,784	| IOT067 |	Component is it
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,576	| IOT067 |	Actually the rooms of
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:55,136	| IOT067 |	An image of the rooms at the cameras in that I'm seeing
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,672	| IOT067 |	Or is it like an iconography
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:58,208	| IOT067 |	Groupthink
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:58,720	| IOT067 |	Inspired rooms
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:01,280	| IOT067 |	So if you already have a nest
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:07,424	| IOT067 |	We have significant number of users with multiple next exercise their home then you will get the app
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:10,752	| IOT067 |	Show live view on the spaces that bus cameras belong
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,800	| IOT067 |	What's the weather in living room or backyard
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:15,104	| IOT067 |	I'll try and Yarbrough upstairs Loft
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,152	| IOT067 |	Thermostat does not have
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,176	| IOT067 |	The actual
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,968	| IOT067 |	Next time. Just be obvious
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:22,272	| IOT067 |	You have to use iconografia some of the rake
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:24,064	| IOT067 |	Create spaces and allow users
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:29,952	| IOT067 |	Can you control other Nest devices from that view or do you just see like
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,768	| IOT067 |	Oh there's a thermostat here and it said a text
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:38,656	| IOT067 |	You can easily tap on the same icons that you had the same
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,424	| IOT067 |	Concept
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,984	| IOT067 |	Tap on it and easily
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,776	| IOT067 |	Think about it
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,544	| IOT067 |	Is that
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:46,336	| IOT067 |	As you bring number of devices
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,360	| IOT067 |	Number of connected devices
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:48,640	| IOT067 |	For your home
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:51,456	| IOT067 |	Lolly as a user you would want one app
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,016	| IOT067 |	But you're going to want
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:41:00,416	| IOT067 |	But this is a really easy day for you sister navigate the various connected devices.
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,184	| IOT067 |	If we
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:02,464	| IOT067 |	Inside their home
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:10,400	| IOT067 |	And there are many press reports earlier about Nest developing some sort of security home security hub
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:15,776	| IOT067 |	And is that something that still under development or does this kind of
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,288	| IOT067 |	Portfolio free
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:17,824	| IOT067 |	JCPenney
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:21,920	| IOT067 |	Different categories in brightness for all this evaluating
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,456	| IOT067 |	Vegas
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,040	| IOT067 |	Want to do what is right by customers on
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,320	| IOT067 |	Today I can talk about
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:29,856	| IOT067 |	Can tell you that
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,648	| IOT067 |	All right question
