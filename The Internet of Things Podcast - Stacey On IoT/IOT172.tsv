EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,776	| IOT172 |	Just searched not impossible
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,056	| IOT172 |	Actually sounds
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,336	| IOT172 |	Yes
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,360	| IOT172 |	All right
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:55,200	| IOT172 |	Let us get started with some financial news
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,272	| IOT172 |	Takes out now
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:01,856	| IOT172 |	Nevermind
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,624	| IOT172 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,416	| IOT172 |	We have last Friday
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,464	| IOT172 |	Netgear's Arlo division
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,488	| IOT172 |	Filed for
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,256	| IOT172 |	An IPO
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,304	| IOT172 |	And Sonos also
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,328	| IOT172 |	Filed for a night
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:18,240	| IOT172 |	That's an initial public offering it means they're going to raise money on the stock markets and that money will presumably go towards making their prey
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| IOT172 |	Products better
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,520	| IOT172 |	Giving them
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,080	| IOT172 |	Forward and all that good stuff
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:25,920	| IOT172 |	The fun part about IPOs is you get to read a document called an S1
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,224	| IOT172 |	And those have all kinds of financial aid
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,296	| IOT172 |	So we know now that Sonos has sold
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| IOT172 |	Over 19 million products
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,672	| IOT172 |	In almost 7 million households around the world
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,720	| IOT172 |	And last year they actually
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,024	| IOT172 |	Reported a billion dollars in
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:41,536	| IOT172 |	Almost a billion
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,352	| IOT172 |	In income cell
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,888	| IOT172 |	That's actually pretty cool
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:48,192	| IOT172 |	They did have a net loss
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| IOT172 |	In
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,984	| IOT172 |	Bisco 2017
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,008	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,824	| IOT172 |	But that's a lot of devices
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,128	| IOT172 |	Sonos has been around for
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,896	| IOT172 |	A really long time
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,176	| IOT172 |	13 years
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,224	| IOT172 |	Now there's also Arlo
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,528	| IOT172 |	From our lows we have figured out
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,296	| IOT172 |	That
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| IOT172 |	They have sold
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT172 |	7
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,648	| IOT172 |	And they have made
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| IOT172 |	In
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,440	| IOT172 |	Physical
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,720	| IOT172 |	2017
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,256	| IOT172 |	370 million
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,560	| IOT172 |	They don't have a
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| IOT172 |	Prophet
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:22,240	| IOT172 |	And that is because the separation expenses to get them out from Netgear IndyGo public are costing them more money than
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,288	| IOT172 |	So they do something called pro-forma
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,568	| IOT172 |	Numbers that take out those
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:30,688	| IOT172 |	Extraordinary events and those numbers actually show that they are also proper
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,200	| IOT172 |	Which
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| IOT172 |	Is pretty amazing for hard work
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:34,784	| IOT172 |	Incredibly proud
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:35,808	| IOT172 |	But hey
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:42,976	| IOT172 |	Yeah it certainly helps that if you look even a year before the revenue growth from 2016 to 2017 at the report
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,280	| IOT172 |	40 is 100% growth I mean there
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,072	| IOT172 |	Just gangbusters growth
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,608	| IOT172 |	Right and they are growing from a small
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,168	| IOT172 |	What is 7 million devices
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,448	| IOT172 |	Really good
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,216	| IOT172 |	This is Arlo
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,544	| IOT172 |	I'm pretty impressed with that because they've only been out for just a few year
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,104	| IOT172 |	Coyote doing well
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| IOT172 |	But
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,176	| IOT172 |	These documents are full of risk statement
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,968	| IOT172 |	And that's
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,504	| IOT172 |	3 par for the course Very
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| IOT172 |	I used to read these all the time
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,344	| IOT172 |	What I'm noticing though in
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,904	| IOT172 |	There's a couple things to notice big trends that
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,416	| IOT172 |	Are worth
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,464	| IOT172 |	One Arlo talks
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:18,559	| IOT172 |	Quite a bit about its relationship with AWS Amazon web services
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:23,935	| IOT172 |	And that's because it's cloud is hosted on there and that's an integral part of its business Arlo make security camera
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT172 |	Ascend
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,239	| IOT172 |	That date I get sent to the cloud
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,543	| IOT172 |	The camera footage and
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,079	| IOT172 |	The fact that Amazon
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,127	| IOT172 |	Now is one of their competitors is Broad
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,967	| IOT172 |	I'm curious because they don't talk in there about
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:40,063	| IOT172 |	Rethinking their Cloud strategy but I'm curious if they'll find their way over to
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,879	| IOT172 |	I guess it wouldn't be Google because Google has nest
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,207	| IOT172 |	So maybe Microsoft or some other cloud
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:51,583	| IOT172 |	Yeah it kind of does leave it to Microsoft Azure because there are no
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:52,863	| IOT172 |	Hardware
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:54,143	| IOT172 |	Competitors in terms of
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,447	| IOT172 |	Products from Microsoft in this space
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,287	| IOT172 |	So I wonder if we'll see that and I also think this is an interesting
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,103	| IOT172 |	Given the rapid m&a happening in this
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| IOT172 |	Area it'll be
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,431	| IOT172 |	Interesting to see if other
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:11,807	| IOT172 |	Iot device makers decide to dump Amazon is it encroaches more and more into
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,831	| IOT172 |	The smartphone business
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:20,255	| IOT172 |	Text Ashley that's what I was thinking I mean right now you don't have a full Suite of competing products from Amazon but we know they
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:25,887	| IOT172 |	Several companies are two camera companies I can think of or camera component companies
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,935	| IOT172 |	Between blink and ring
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,959	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,519	| IOT172 |	They'll compete even heavier in the future I think with Arlo
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,847	| IOT172 |	Yes so that's one Trend I'm going to keep an eye on it
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| IOT172 |	The next year
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,711	| IOT172 |	I also be surprised with Arlo they had a really tremendous emphasis on
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,479	| IOT172 |	Engagement
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:40,991	| IOT172 |	Weather app
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:44,063	| IOT172 |	And they try to compare themselves to
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,855	| IOT172 |	Facebook and I don't know if this is like
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,903	| IOT172 |	Padding because you know you wanted
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,743	| IOT172 |	Investors think you're sexier than you are which is very common in these documents
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,791	| IOT172 |	But they talked about
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,815	| IOT172 |	Our spin
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,351	| IOT172 |	Monthly active users
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,911	| IOT172 |	And so I don't know what is your thigh feel like
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,447	| IOT172 |	I don't want to buy a device that
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| IOT172 |	It wants me to engage with
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,263	| IOT172 |	Therap I want to buy a device
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,543	| IOT172 |	Performance Smart Home
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,079	| IOT172 |	Function for me I almost never want to be
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| IOT172 |	Cameras are a little different
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT172 |	But still
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:14,527	| IOT172 |	Yeah I completely agree with you on trying to compare the engagement of a security camera app
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:19,647	| IOT172 |	To a social media app or other even they compared to Candy Crush and I'm like really you know
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:24,255	| IOT172 |	You go to a candy crusher go to Facebook when you make when you have some downtime right
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:30,143	| IOT172 |	Kind of pick and choose one that is safe for in your notifications coming in at you like I want to read this but with a camera
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:36,543	| IOT172 |	You may be getting a lot of notifications sooner like anytime somebody walks up to my house I get a notification it's not the
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,823	| IOT172 |	The same type of Engagement
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,335	| IOT172 |	At all
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,871	| IOT172 |	So that's just me
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:44,991	| IOT172 |	As weird I don't know if I should read more into it because usually that engagement in Social
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,551	| IOT172 |	Forms is too precise both users and
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,319	| IOT172 |	A potential for
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| IOT172 |	Add dollars
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,159	| IOT172 |	Yeah and social you're engaging
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:58,559	| IOT172 |	Because of other people you're engaging with other people maybe not in real time maybe even real time with messenger apps that are related to
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:01,119	| IOT172 |	Direct messages are not engaging with a
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,399	| IOT172 |	Person here
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:05,471	| IOT172 |	It's not just don't see that as a comment or metric is comprable
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| IOT172 |	Little weird
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,823	| IOT172 |	The other thing that I thought was super interesting
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| IOT172 |	The Arlo
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,615	| IOT172 |	Was actually
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,383	| IOT172 |	The strength of
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,175	| IOT172 |	Retailers that they
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,735	| IOT172 |	Disclose so their cameras are sold
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT172 |	In
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,575	| IOT172 |	Three main places Best Buy Amazon and
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,087	| IOT172 |	Costco
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:24,927	| IOT172 |	In 28% of their 2017 sales
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:25,951	| IOT172 |	What's the best
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,231	| IOT172 |	Which
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,791	| IOT172 |	Well people are still shopping at Best Buy with my first thought
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:32,863	| IOT172 |	16% were at Amazon and 13%
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,143	| IOT172 |	Costco
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,191	| IOT172 |	I don't know Kevin disaster
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:36,959	| IOT172 |	I thought I was crazy
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:41,055	| IOT172 |	Crazy in what way cuz I actually do go to Best Buy
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,127	| IOT172 |	When I got to have something and or tip
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,663	| IOT172 |	Piccoli it's on sale
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:52,063	| IOT172 |	Right so if I need something immediately I won't get from Amazon I'll go to BestBuy unless I can save a ton of money on Amazon
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,831	| IOT172 |	Best Buy would be
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:58,975	| IOT172 |	First and then Costco is really interesting because that is like for mainstream America that's where like
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,279	| IOT172 |	Your mom shops right so having
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,559	| IOT172 |	13% of their revenue
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,095	| IOT172 |	From Costco I thought was
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,655	| IOT172 |	Guys in a smart home space get your product
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| IOT172 |	Good Lord
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:14,847	| IOT172 |	Well yeah I mean we go to Costco probably once a month and I have seen the Arlo products as well as many other electronics and it soon
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:18,943	| IOT172 |	Soon as you walk in I don't know if it's the same with every Costco but I've been to a couple in my area
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,503	| IOT172 |	It's like as soon as you walk in that feel like chronic sex
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,015	| IOT172 |	It's right there
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,063	| IOT172 |	You cannot not go through it
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,599	| IOT172 |	And
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,623	| IOT172 |	I don't have any
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:31,231	| IOT172 |	It's hard to just ignore and walk past it so I think they get a lot of decent sales by
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:33,279	| IOT172 |	Having products in there for mainstream
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:40,191	| IOT172 |	Consumers in your right what companies to get their iot products in their I have seen some others obviously but yeah
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,703	| IOT172 |	Brighten your face
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,239	| IOT172 |	In your face
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| IOT172 |	All right
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,055	| IOT172 |	So the only other thing that
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,823	| IOT172 |	People
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,871	| IOT172 |	Hash this out quite a bit and it is worth tok
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| IOT172 |	Talking about his friend the sonosite
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,479	| IOT172 |	Cuz it talk about how Amazon
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:56,575	| IOT172 |	Can pull their functionality from the Sonos 1 speakers
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:59,135	| IOT172 |	Really with limited notice to Sonos because it's an AP
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,743	| IOT172 |	And I looked at that and everyone's like
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:04,767	| IOT172 |	Freak out
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| IOT172 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:11,167	| IOT172 |	This is not great but this is something we've been living within the smart home Community forever
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,471	| IOT172 |	Talk about it later on
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| IOT172 |	Only answer a
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,055	| IOT172 |	He's our question but this to me
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:17,823	| IOT172 |	Points to the need
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,103	| IOT172 |	Data scheme
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,175	| IOT172 |	A unified data schema like alljoyn was supposed to be
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:26,015	| IOT172 |	Like ofc is supposed to be but is really not
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| IOT172 |	So far
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,319	| IOT172 |	For the home
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,647	| IOT172 |	And for these devices because right now
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:35,743	| IOT172 |	Everything you buy is at the mercy of these supported apis and they can
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,023	| IOT172 |	They can go away
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:41,119	| IOT172 |	And they also change on a fairly regular basis as I've seen just from tinkering with
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,143	| IOT172 |	Coding stuff
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,447	| IOT172 |	Something breaks because the API was changed
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,007	| IOT172 |	So I agree with you I don't know that we're going to
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,311	| IOT172 |	Get to that point I would love to but
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| IOT172 |	Everybody seems as a run
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,639	| IOT172 |	Proprietary solution to this problem
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,991	| IOT172 |	Happens it's going to be terrible I mean I guess it gives a lot of negotiating
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,503	| IOT172 |	Leveraged
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| IOT172 |	Thing like Amazon
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,111	| IOT172 |	I mean imagine the first time someone stands up to this people are going to knock
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,207	| IOT172 |	I agree with you I also think
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| IOT172 |	The first
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,255	| IOT172 |	Product makers at
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:11,071	| IOT172 |	Loses compatibility for the functionality
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,119	| IOT172 |	He's going to make a big public stink
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,935	| IOT172 |	And blame Amazon rightly so
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,703	| IOT172 |	I don't think
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:18,751	| IOT172 |	Amazon will want to tarnish its
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| IOT172 |	Brand with that so
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:24,895	| IOT172 |	When I saw this and people worrying about maybe this goes away
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,431	| IOT172 |	I make don't be silly because
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:30,015	| IOT172 |	Frankly Amazon doesn't make its money from selling Echo products
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| IOT172 |	It makes money by
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:37,183	| IOT172 |	Getting the data building you services on that data and getting people to buy things and use the services
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,487	| IOT172 |	Through its Echo products and
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,023	| IOT172 |	3rd party Echo products
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:41,791	| IOT172 |	It support
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| IOT172 |	The Amazon voice services so
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,863	| IOT172 |	Amazon one
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,143	| IOT172 |	Padme everywhere and
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,727	| IOT172 |	If other companies want to help them do that they're going to continue to support a tie
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,031	| IOT172 |	We'll see what happens
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,871	| IOT172 |	Inside again I want my unified data schema still okay
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,151	| IOT172 |	Let us move on
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,663	| IOT172 |	2
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,711	| IOT172 |	Amazon Prime day
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,527	| IOT172 |	Play I'm not a huge
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:07,391	| IOT172 |	Holiday it's not really a thing but we did notice
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,999	| IOT172 |	One remember last week when I was talking about that crazy new
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,815	| IOT172 |	Madam a powered sink from Delta
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| IOT172 |	Hey
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:21,215	| IOT172 |	That's actually for sale it'll be for sale to the general public for the first time as a prime day launch
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,007	| IOT172 |	For $500
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,775	| IOT172 |	4
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,055	| IOT172 |	Chrome and then
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,359	| IOT172 |	$525 for
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| IOT172 |	Arctic stainless which is basically like
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,223	| IOT172 |	It looks like stainless steel
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:41,183	| IOT172 |	And if you want to see it before buying it you can actually go to the Stacey on iot YouTube channel because
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,999	| IOT172 |	I actually reviewed it
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,303	| IOT172 |	So I'll link to that review in case you
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| IOT172 |	You are interested in
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:51,167	| IOT172 |	Learning more about it or just seeing one of these in action and be like
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,215	| IOT172 |	Wow Stacy just is a little crazy
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,239	| IOT172 |	Which is
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,799	| IOT172 |	So that's probably our most notable
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,079	| IOT172 |	Gadget
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,871	| IOT172 |	Madame Amazon
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:03,711	| IOT172 |	Products are on sale so some good deals on Kindle Paperwhite
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,759	| IOT172 |	And I feel like I should keep asparagus
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,575	| IOT172 |	Lose them all the time the Echo Show is like
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,855	| IOT172 |	130
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,391	| IOT172 |	That's a pretty great deal
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,671	| IOT172 |	If you want that
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:16,255	| IOT172 |	And I also saw an ecobee3 with 3 sensors
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,023	| IOT172 |	Or 219
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,583	| IOT172 |	This is not the most recent ecobee4
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:23,679	| IOT172 |	But it's a really good thermostat and having three sensors
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,959	| IOT172 |	Is actually really stellar
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| IOT172 |	I don't even know what I
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:30,591	| IOT172 |	Yeah that's actually the thermostat that we use here in the house
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,103	| IOT172 |	I have
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,943	| IOT172 |	Two sensors I take that back I have one remote sensor
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:40,319	| IOT172 |	So the unit itself is a sensor and then you can add these additional little sensors in other rooms
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:43,647	| IOT172 |	And I've literally I should really buy another sensor because what I do is
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:46,719	| IOT172 |	I put the sensor in the bedroom when we go to sleep so that way
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,511	| IOT172 |	The bedroom is comfortable
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| IOT172 |	And then
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,839	| IOT172 |	Penny the day when I get out of bed unless another bed
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,655	| IOT172 |	I put the sensor in my home office I just carry it in a minute
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:58,495	| IOT172 |	Just a little stinky thing that runs on a coin cell battery in that way I'm comfortable now office
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| IOT172 |	There you go
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| IOT172 |	So we could get Kev
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,823	| IOT172 |	We could Splurge an annuity
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:07,455	| IOT172 |	Okay so those are some of the products that we saw the receipt until we saw the
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,223	| IOT172 |	Tp-link
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:12,319	| IOT172 |	Deco mesh networks if you're in the market for a mesh Network that is also
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,111	| IOT172 |	Launching apparently is a prime daypart
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| IOT172 |	Not to be outdone
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT172 |	Buy Amazon
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,255	| IOT172 |	Google home
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,023	| IOT172 |	Is also
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,303	| IOT172 |	Doing some say
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:22,815	| IOT172 |	Sales
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,143	| IOT172 |	Yeti sales are actually through walmart.com
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,703	| IOT172 |	And I say that specifically because you
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:35,103	| IOT172 |	Cannot go and get these deals in the Walmart store which is kind of silly I live a mile from the Walmart store but I
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,663	| IOT172 |	Order things through walmart.com just to get the rebates
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,199	| IOT172 |	And that's what they have on me so
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,759	| IOT172 |	This is through the 17th of
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,039	| IOT172 |	July which is
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,831	| IOT172 |	Coincidentally the last day of prime day
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,367	| IOT172 |	Sandy Moore there
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:52,767	| IOT172 |	You can get a Google home mini on sale for $34 and then you get a $15 rebate so
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| IOT172 |	It's $19 net
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,351	| IOT172 |	That which is a really good price
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:59,935	| IOT172 |	If you want the full size Google home which is normal 129
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,983	| IOT172 |	It's on sale for 99 and there's a
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,263	| IOT172 |	$30 rebate on
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:09,663	| IOT172 |	Top of that so it's $69 net and if you really got to have bass booming sound for music along with you
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,431	| IOT172 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,503	| IOT172 |	You can get two of the big bad Google home Max units
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,295	| IOT172 |	We tried to leave Earth
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,599	| IOT172 |	$350 normally you can get
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,367	| IOT172 |	Two of them
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:21,695	| IOT172 |	498 after a 100
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,743	| IOT172 |	$50 rebate witches wow
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,767	| IOT172 |	That's too much down for me
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,327	| IOT172 |	Having one of those fills up
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:28,863	| IOT172 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,143	| IOT172 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,959	| IOT172 |	So pretty good little Google Assistant
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,007	| IOT172 |	It's very little but
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,055	| IOT172 |	I'm not sure what Google is trying to do here
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| IOT172 |	I know we talk
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,663	| IOT172 |	Talked about a Google assistant voice there now 8 voices and you can
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:48,063	| IOT172 |	Why does he hate the man I don't know that it's so funny but I changed our Google voice to a man and he was like
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:58,047	| IOT172 |	Okay well I don't use nobody in my house uses the Google Assistant with me so I could free rein to go male or female doesn't matter but it use
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,071	| IOT172 |	Used to just choose
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:01,631	| IOT172 |	Invoice number 1 voice number to Voice number 3
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,399	| IOT172 |	The description
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,447	| IOT172 |	Now and I'm not sure I understand why
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,751	| IOT172 |	If you go into the update assistant app
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,287	| IOT172 |	You not use them by color
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,311	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,847	| IOT172 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,383	| IOT172 |	Red purple green
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| IOT172 |	I have mail
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,431	| IOT172 |	American
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,735	| IOT172 |	Female I don't know
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| IOT172 |	Sean Connery
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,063	| IOT172 |	I really don't know
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:25,183	| IOT172 |	But if you change it on one it's a universal change that hasn't changed at all so all of your
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:29,023	| IOT172 |	Assistant voices will change to the new voice on your phone and other devices Etc
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,303	| IOT172 |	What should I do
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,327	| IOT172 |	Weirded-out cuz
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,143	| IOT172 |	Right
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:40,543	| IOT172 |	Yeah so curly I use orange for what it's worth you might want Amber to green or cyan that's up to you
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| IOT172 |	It's not weird
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| IOT172 |	Go Google
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:47,967	| IOT172 |	Keeping it interesting
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:51,551	| IOT172 |	Is Nest aware customers can now set in manage activity Zone
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,343	| IOT172 |	What's on IOS and Android
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,111	| IOT172 |	Devices
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,671	| IOT172 |	This is something you could do for a while with ring
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,183	| IOT172 |	And
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,207	| IOT172 |	Pink's mother
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,743	| IOT172 |	Camera makers
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:03,583	| IOT172 |	So I believe even on the wires I was able to
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,191	| IOT172 |	Yeah I know you needed the computer to do it right
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:14,079	| IOT172 |	I'm in as to where this just brings it down to the mobile apps
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,591	| IOT172 |	I have never play
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,455	| IOT172 |	I try not to but I
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:23,295	| IOT172 |	Once I got this news I updated my Nest app on my iPhone and
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,831	| IOT172 |	Yep you just have to
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| IOT172 |	Give your camera in the app
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| IOT172 |	Make sure your
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:30,719	| IOT172 |	App is in landscape mode so if you lock it to Portrait this will not work
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,767	| IOT172 |	Put in landscape and then just
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:35,327	| IOT172 |	Drag little handles around the area you want so
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:42,239	| IOT172 |	Hopefully I will no longer get notified anytime somebody walks past the house across the street on the sidewalk as I have
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,799	| IOT172 |	Limited activity Zone not adjust our front walkway
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,591	| IOT172 |	Although
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,383	| IOT172 |	Does this mean you won't catch your neighbor if she backs
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:52,223	| IOT172 |	You know I might want to change the nest aware Zone
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| IOT172 |	Activism
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:58,111	| IOT172 |	Tiny tiny tiny news
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,391	| IOT172 |	You may care about
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,415	| IOT172 |	Sonos
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,951	| IOT172 |	Now supports AirPlay 2
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:04,511	| IOT172 |	Kevin you've got her you're a resident Sonos user
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:10,399	| IOT172 |	Yeah I'm not to Jazz by this but I'm sure other people will be basically yes UFC
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:13,215	| IOT172 |	Support for AirPlay to Solana update your Sonos app
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,543	| IOT172 |	I did that right before the show and then
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:22,687	| IOT172 |	When I open the app it said there's an update for the app so I can send me back to the app store which didn't have an update cuz I just got the update
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:28,319	| IOT172 |	Blue paint so hopefully you have better luck I was not able to test it because of that looping update issue
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:34,719	| IOT172 |	What this does is you'll be able to say Hey Siri play such-and-such on my Sonos water whatever song
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:38,303	| IOT172 |	Don't know Survivor room yet or Sonos setup enable play Apple music
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT172 |	That way so
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:44,447	| IOT172 |	Why I'm saying like it's not like it add Siri to the Sonos devices
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,215	| IOT172 |	It's just
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:49,311	| IOT172 |	Adding Siri support on your phone for your Sonos devices switches
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,383	| IOT172 |	Sure nice to have but I'll just stick with you and Madam a
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,247	| IOT172 |	And we're still waiting on updates
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,271	| IOT172 |	Is the homepod which
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,039	| IOT172 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| IOT172 |	We bought you in December
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,671	| IOT172 |	Pretty darn early only when a new function comes out quite honestly
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:11,839	| IOT172 |	I'm it's just because it's limited to Apple music which we do subscribe to but I also listen to The Beatles Channel or
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:15,935	| IOT172 |	Are the coffee shop or coffee house rather on Sirius XM that's all supported by Madame a
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,471	| IOT172 |	So why have that card
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:19,775	| IOT172 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,311	| IOT172 |	Hey let's talk about something really cool
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,847	| IOT172 |	Space base
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,871	| IOT172 |	Iot
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,151	| IOT172 |	Not to be confused with
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,919	| IOT172 |	The space force
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:27,455	| IOT172 |	This is real and
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,503	| IOT172 |	Happening well sorta
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,295	| IOT172 |	Kevin you want to talk to us about space
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:37,695	| IOT172 |	Space coyote I did not know about this but apparently there's been a project going back to 2014 with the
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,231	| IOT172 |	Development of cul-de-sac
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,279	| IOT172 |	Which was low cost
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,815	| IOT172 |	Machine-to-machine communication services
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,631	| IOT172 |	Space-based infrastructure for iot
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:53,055	| IOT172 |	The deal is this is actually spinning to terrestrial iot using the satellites to communicate and then go
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| IOT172 |	Actually have
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,127	| IOT172 |	2 billion low power
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,407	| IOT172 |	Wide area network
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:01,247	| IOT172 |	Devices connected to Satellites by 2022
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,039	| IOT172 |	I have written about satellites
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,807	| IOT172 |	A lot
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,343	| IOT172 |	It's a weird sub-genre that I
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,367	| IOT172 |	I am really excited about
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:08,927	| IOT172 |	The challenge with us and answer we don't have answers
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:13,023	| IOT172 |	When you're looking at this kind of satellite stuff you need to think about it
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,839	| IOT172 |	Things you need to think about simultaneous connections
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,375	| IOT172 |	Because satellites
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,191	| IOT172 |	This one actually
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:20,959	| IOT172 |	Handel's billions
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,495	| IOT172 |	I believe so it's a lie
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,287	| IOT172 |	You also need to think about
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,847	| IOT172 |	The cost of the radios in the terrestrial
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,615	| IOT172 |	Devices to
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:29,151	| IOT172 |	Talk to space and their battery
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,919	| IOT172 |	Consumption
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:32,991	| IOT172 |	As you can imagine shouting all the way out to space is
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| IOT172 |	Battery intensive
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,551	| IOT172 |	That's one of the reasons why these satellite
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,087	| IOT172 |	They're huge and
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,599	| IOT172 |	Expensive
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,415	| IOT172 |	About two batteries and very expensive radios cuz
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,439	| IOT172 |	There's not a lot of use for them
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,999	| IOT172 |	Rights of operations
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,279	| IOT172 |	Xiaomi scale
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,071	| IOT172 |	But
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:53,471	| IOT172 |	This actually sounds really interesting so I'm actually going to try to find somebody who can talk to us a little bit more about this because
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:57,567	| IOT172 |	It would be really intriguing to have these would use the same frequency is sick box
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,431	| IOT172 |	I'm all about new networks for iot in
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,199	| IOT172 |	Having a space camp
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,271	| IOT172 |	Pegasus Global coverage and waited
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:06,783	| IOT172 |	We don't have today
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,343	| IOT172 |	And it gives Elon Musk another use for space
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:10,623	| IOT172 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,927	| IOT172 |	All right
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,719	| IOT172 |	Smart City news
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,487	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,279	| IOT172 |	LG CNS which is a
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,559	| IOT172 |	Iot
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,839	| IOT172 |	Division of algae
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| IOT172 |	Stepmonster a new
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,655	| IOT172 |	Smart City platform
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,679	| IOT172 |	Called City Hall
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,959	| IOT172 |	And
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,263	| IOT172 |	It's going to focus on Korea
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,311	| IOT172 |	Or maybe not.
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| IOT172 |	Which is where they're based
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,503	| IOT172 |	And it basically is a way to
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,271	| IOT172 |	Collective
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,807	| IOT172 |	From iot sensors Oliver
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,599	| IOT172 |	The place and bring it in and analyze it
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,135	| IOT172 |	Deliver services
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,439	| IOT172 |	It supports the
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,231	| IOT172 |	1 M to M Stan
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:50,559	| IOT172 |	As well as 98 other iot standard
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:54,143	| IOT172 |	Yeah there's a lot well that means they're doing all the standards
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,679	| IOT172 |	For you the downside is
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,447	| IOT172 |	That you're stuck
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,727	| IOT172 |	As long as you.
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:02,079	| IOT172 |	Got yourself sew-in ideas the platform will serve as the Unified
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| IOT172 |	Takata control tower
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| IOT172 |	4 smart cities
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,967	| IOT172 |	This feels very similar to some things I can do saint
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,503	| IOT172 |	Also in South
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,551	| IOT172 |	Korea they have a similar
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,063	| IOT172 |	Effort by 1
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT172 |	Carriers
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,135	| IOT172 |	Singapore has it ever
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| IOT172 |	For like this day forth with
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,696	| IOT172 |	I believe it is Accenture
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,976	| IOT172 |	I'm a
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,280	| IOT172 |	Connected City platform that pulls out all the state and and
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,328	| IOT172 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| IOT172 |	Just throwing it out there
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| IOT172 |	There for you guys
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:30,752	| IOT172 |	Yeah that one M2M standard I probably should have heard of it before but I never did so I went and looked
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:36,640	| IOT172 |	And they're tons and tons of white papers and standards documents there and I looked at the security one would win
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,920	| IOT172 |	211 pages
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:41,504	| IOT172 |	And my brain exploded as I can even look at the other standards
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| IOT172 |	Apparently it is
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,832	| IOT172 |	Aquatica worldwide global
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,624	| IOT172 |	M2M standard
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,416	| IOT172 |	If it is I'm not sure why I hadn't heard of it before
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| IOT172 |	About my global
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,072	| IOT172 |	Maybe it is if you're in Europe
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,376	| IOT172 |	Europe I believe Sutton Asia
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,144	| IOT172 |	Which skin out
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,448	| IOT172 |	Is what we would call arrested for Elder row but
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,984	| IOT172 |	Everyone else would be like
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT172 |	Yeah that's global
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,824	| IOT172 |	Global can just sometimes meme
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:06,848	| IOT172 |	More than
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:09,920	| IOT172 |	And before we get it
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,944	| IOT172 |	Sucked into the
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,992	| IOT172 |	One M2M standard
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,528	| IOT172 |	Let us talk about something Kevin
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:19,136	| IOT172 |	Which might be useful to you guys especially if you heard me talking about the aware air quality
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,160	| IOT172 |	Sensor
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:20,928	| IOT172 |	Couple weeks back
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| IOT172 |	This is how to make your own
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,744	| IOT172 |	Indoor air quality
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:27,328	| IOT172 |	Yeah I just found this right before the show so I can't type
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:33,472	| IOT172 |	Follow this project and everything you know about allegedly this works fine basically somebody ate a fruit has
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:36,288	| IOT172 |	Put their own air monitoring sensor
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,056	| IOT172 |	Together
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:40,896	| IOT172 |	Measure various particle sizes and temperature
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:46,784	| IOT172 |	Relative humidity there using a dust sensor module temperature humidity sensor a little
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:53,184	| IOT172 |	Whatscall hackable board hack a b l e as in Bluetooth low-energy so that's how they're getting the data moving around
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:57,536	| IOT172 |	Around using a Raspberry Pi as a Gateway with the python script python
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:00,608	| IOT172 |	And a Taproot dashboard display so they can
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:07,008	| IOT172 |	Look at the data again it's a project that I did not do pretty technical onto because everything is explained what does
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,776	| IOT172 |	Sex a good thing
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:11,360	| IOT172 |	Infinity chest want to follow the directions and copy the code
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,664	| IOT172 |	You could do this I would imagine it's knocking
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:20,576	| IOT172 |	After that much I didn't look at the pricing but this has to be Camping World modern dollars that we spend shock is more than 50 Cortana
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| IOT172 |	This looks like
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,112	| IOT172 |	They say this is a
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:22,624	| IOT172 |	Beginner level
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| IOT172 |	Project fi
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,464	| IOT172 |	Folks interested in Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,000	| IOT172 |	You know
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| IOT172 |	I'm looking at this sound like
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| IOT172 |	Code you can download
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,192	| IOT172 |	How you know if really good
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:38,752	| IOT172 |	I probably wouldn't do this I would spend $99 on a
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,800	| IOT172 |	Device but
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,592	| IOT172 |	If you're fun project for anybody
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,128	| IOT172 |	Nevada high school students
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,408	| IOT172 |	Bored this summer
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,944	| IOT172 |	Tell him to go yeah
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,504	| IOT172 |	I think looking at the instructions it's overwhelming because
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:55,648	| IOT172 |	All the base details of how the sensors work down to you know the different bite in a transaction in
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:24:02,560	| IOT172 |	The dust sensor for example is listed but that's good for people who want to know everything about it but if you don't you could just follow me
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:05,632	| IOT172 |	It's a little less overwhelming if you look at that way
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,424	| IOT172 |	Yeah and I would say
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:12,544	| IOT172 |	Indoor air quality sensor running around it's actually really big deal and
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,568	| IOT172 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,872	| IOT172 |	It's kind of interesting to see like how certain
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,408	| IOT172 |	Products are
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,944	| IOT172 |	Use patterns in my home
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,712	| IOT172 |	I'm really affect the air
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,504	| IOT172 |	So we started using it
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,320	| IOT172 |	Downdraft for oven because I saw this
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,344	| IOT172 |	Every time I cooked
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:26,880	| IOT172 |	We just get like all the
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,648	| IOT172 |	Does particulate matter
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,696	| IOT172 |	Hey dude I should totally
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,488	| IOT172 |	Suck that way and so now we do
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,816	| IOT172 |	Using like an oil diffuser can really suddenly like spike your
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,608	| IOT172 |	Pollutants inside so
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:37,632	| IOT172 |	Maybe don't do that
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,192	| IOT172 |	So I don't know what I found a very educational
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:47,104	| IOT172 |	Yeah just a Bluetooth sensor by itself is $20 I mean again this is not going to be a huge investment in terms of cos
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,384	| IOT172 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,944	| IOT172 |	So let us go to this week's voice mail
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,736	| IOT172 |	This is from

EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,152	| IOT172 |	Start with
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,176	| IOT172 |	Schlage
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,248	| IOT172 |	So this week's voicemail is from
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,272	| IOT172 |	Josh
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,112	| IOT172 |	I like your podcast by the way thank you
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,136	| IOT172 |	My name is
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,696	| IOT172 |	I have a Chamberlain
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:36,000	| IOT172 |	Garage door opener that I'd like to make
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:39,328	| IOT172 |	Smart MyQ enabled and mostly interested in
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,352	| IOT172 |	Daniel Tiger
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,656	| IOT172 |	Open garage without closing it
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:44,448	| IOT172 |	Gainesville close it remotely
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,496	| IOT172 |	Sorry I looked at the MyQ add-on
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:50,848	| IOT172 |	Cannot big fan of all the limitations if you wanted if this then that
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| IOT172 |	Description if you want to add Google Now.
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,176	| IOT172 |	Description
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:58,016	| IOT172 |	No matter what I'm assuming that we'll have a subscription to ever get it
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| IOT172 |	I want to
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:01,600	| IOT172 |	To look at other options but I think
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,904	| IOT172 |	Conflicting information online and working on a TV
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,672	| IOT172 |	Coffee
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,440	| IOT172 |	God
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,208	| IOT172 |	Anything else
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,976	| IOT172 |	Put the Chamberlain
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,000	| IOT172 |	Do you know anything about
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:11,840	| IOT172 |	Whether third parties work with Chamberlain garage door openers do you know any of them
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,608	| IOT172 |	Good
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,888	| IOT172 |	Thank you very much bye
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,424	| IOT172 |	KJ
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,192	| IOT172 |	This is
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,240	| IOT172 |	There's a lot easier
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,520	| IOT172 |	Because it's a SmartPhone question
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:22,336	| IOT172 |	Haha yeah because there's no unified data schema for smartphone
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:25,664	| IOT172 |	Most of the other garage door
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,736	| IOT172 |	Don't actually want you to be able to open
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,808	| IOT172 |	Boise State security
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:34,880	| IOT172 |	Issue so this is the same thing that happened in the lock
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:38,464	| IOT172 |	Community a couple lock makers now that you do it if you also give them a
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,744	| IOT172 |	A passcode verbally
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,768	| IOT172 |	So that's
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:42,048	| IOT172 |	Aspect
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:42,816	| IOT172 |	Why
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,328	| IOT172 |	It doesn't work
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:50,496	| IOT172 |	I do have the Chamberlain MyQ I think it's a great option for people who just want to see if their doors open or shut
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| IOT172 |	Take care of her
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| IOT172 |	Remotely so I gave this to my in-laws
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:58,176	| IOT172 |	For someone who wants to get more into home automation
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:00,224	| IOT172 |	There's only a couple things I can offer for
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,296	| IOT172 |	One is if you have a wink
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,344	| IOT172 |	It does work with the wink hub
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,648	| IOT172 |	Not to remotely close it
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:13,536	| IOT172 |	Use like opening it as a trigger so I have a robot in my wink that
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,584	| IOT172 |	If we open the garage door after search
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,352	| IOT172 |	Time of
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| IOT172 |	Night after
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,632	| IOT172 |	Basically.
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:18,912	| IOT172 |	My porch lights go
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,192	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,496	| IOT172 |	I did that without if I did that without having to
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,264	| IOT172 |	Subscription
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:25,056	| IOT172 |	So if all you want to do is use it like
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,568	| IOT172 |	What is a trigger
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| IOT172 |	But
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,128	| IOT172 |	If you want to go further
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,664	| IOT172 |	You're probably going to go with something
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,432	| IOT172 |	Kevin
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:34,528	| IOT172 |	Yes I actually don't have a Chamberlain MyQ
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,552	| IOT172 |	Garage door opener
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:40,416	| IOT172 |	When I did put in with my garage door opener may work with
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,208	| IOT172 |	Myql explain in a second
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,512	| IOT172 |	So it goes by several names
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:47,328	| IOT172 |	When is the linear gd00z
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:50,144	| IOT172 |	The garage door opener the one that I bought I think
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:54,496	| IOT172 |	It's available at Lowe's for like $65 under the name gocontrol which is
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:57,056	| IOT172 |	What I have to again if the same thing as just rebranded
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:59,104	| IOT172 |	Essentially it's a Z-Wave
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,872	| IOT172 |	Controller
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,944	| IOT172 |	With two wires and those two wires get attached
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,968	| IOT172 |	2D
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:08,064	| IOT172 |	Terminals where the wires from a hardware button garage door
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,088	| IOT172 |	Open and close
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,136	| IOT172 |	Ghost so I attached the
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:14,720	| IOT172 |	Go control to that and it works perfectly fine with wink
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:19,328	| IOT172 |	There's also a tilt sensor in the kid that you put on the garage door and based on the tilt
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,376	| IOT172 |	Controller tells me if my garage doors open or closed
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:27,520	| IOT172 |	So I too have a robot that if after 10 or 15 minutes the garage doors open it lets me know
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,544	| IOT172 |	Via wings
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,848	| IOT172 |	And then I can remotely close it via wink
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,152	| IOT172 |	Now the MyQ models
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:38,272	| IOT172 |	According to the maker of the module the Z-Wave module they say they are not compatible
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:42,880	| IOT172 |	That seems to be true based on what I read in various forms and such
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:48,000	| IOT172 |	However we can add a link in the show notes if you don't mind soldering
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,280	| IOT172 |	Little Liars
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,072	| IOT172 |	To the hardware
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,888	| IOT172 |	Controller in your garage that you likely have
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,168	| IOT172 |	If you want to do that
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,448	| IOT172 |	You can make it work
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:59,776	| IOT172 |	You can't solder it directly or connected directly to the MyQ
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,544	| IOT172 |	Like I've done with
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,080	| IOT172 |	My garage door opener
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,104	| IOT172 |	That will not work
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:09,248	| IOT172 |	Additionally if you're not on wink and you're on SmartThings it looks like SmartThings support has been pulled
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,040	| IOT172 |	In the last 6 to 12 months
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,576	| IOT172 |	Buy Chamberlain so you
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,368	| IOT172 |	Really out of luck if you have a SmartThings
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,648	| IOT172 |	City of wink
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:17,696	| IOT172 |	You got an option but it's going to require some solder
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,000	| IOT172 |	And our final thing
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,280	| IOT172 |	Have not tried this
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,304	| IOT172 |	But we did find it
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,864	| IOT172 |	A device from
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:27,680	| IOT172 |	Comedy called nexx garage nexx
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,448	| IOT172 |	Garage
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:31,008	| IOT172 |	And they have a $99
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:34,592	| IOT172 |	Module that you stick to your door and a sensor
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,360	| IOT172 |	And
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:38,176	| IOT172 |	This actually they say it works with Madam a
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,944	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:41,248	| IOT172 |	And it also works with Google Assistant
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:41,760	| IOT172 |	And if
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,040	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:46,880	| IOT172 |	That might be the way to go I looked at the reviews
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:50,208	| IOT172 |	Some people it looks like it's a little bit more complicated install
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:50,976	| IOT172 |	But
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:57,120	| IOT172 |	I don't know this looks yeah there's no really good solution here if you don't want to jump into the MyQ space because of
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:03,008	| IOT172 |	These changes that Chamberlain has made an adding subscription fees for if this and that and so on
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:07,616	| IOT172 |	I don't know like I get why they do it and I know we talked about in the Shogun Steel just not a fan of that
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,152	| IOT172 |	And
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,224	| IOT172 |	Just before you buy if you're interested in the next garage thing
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:14,016	| IOT172 |	Before you buy just go to the website which is
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,808	| IOT172 |	Next garage.com
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,344	| IOT172 |	They have a list of the
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:19,392	| IOT172 |	Garage door openers it works with so
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:21,696	| IOT172 |	Chamberlain Bunches of them I don't know
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT172 |	At which one you have
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,232	| IOT172 |	So you will have
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:23,744	| IOT172 |	How to check that out
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,024	| IOT172 |	All right
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:30,912	| IOT172 |	Josh I hope that helps you and you enjoy your tinkering to get your garage doing
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,680	| IOT172 |	What it

EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:33,728	| IOT172 |	What you ended up
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,008	| IOT172 |	It how you feel
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,800	| IOT172 |	And now
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:38,592	| IOT172 |	Stay tuned for our guest this week
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:41,408	| IOT172 |	Who is Randy Schneider from Delta faucet
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:44,736	| IOT172 |	Talking about how they connected the faucet why
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,504	| IOT172 |	And
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:49,856	| IOT172 |	A bit about how they programmed it to understand words like
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,672	| IOT172 |	Decanter and glass + Tumblr
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,464	| IOT172 |	So stay tuned for that
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:31:00,864	| IOT172 |	And now a message for this week sponsor hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:06,240	| IOT172 |	That's for a message from our sponsor sponsor is a pharaoh and I have Joe bread
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:07,520	| IOT172 |	CEO of the Pharaoh here to
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,824	| IOT172 |	What's really quickly
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,848	| IOT172 |	Tell our audience
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:11,616	| IOT172 |	What is a pharaoh
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:13,408	| IOT172 |	Fully integrated
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,432	| IOT172 |	Fully Interactive
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:17,248	| IOT172 |	Fully secure sensor to Cloud iot black
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,040	| IOT172 |	Our customers choose us
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:19,808	| IOT172 |	Because they can
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,624	| IOT172 |	Market buys much as 80%
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,904	| IOT172 |	Of course that cuts down on
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,672	| IOT172 |	Cost and complexity
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:30,560	| IOT172 |	Because it's so robust and they can reuse 90% of their work
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,328	| IOT172 |	Project project
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:35,168	| IOT172 |	First love how easy it is to get their devices connected
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,472	| IOT172 |	And how fast and responsive they operate
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:40,288	| IOT172 |	Awesome so Kenmore use as a pharaoh to get its appliances
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,336	| IOT172 |	What are the benefits
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:46,176	| IOT172 |	The Kenmore as seen from connecting fridges and dishwashers to the internet
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,456	| IOT172 |	Are two main category
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:52,320	| IOT172 |	That's the first one is in customer value in customers get value features
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,880	| IOT172 |	Amiability to control their devices from their smartphone
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:56,928	| IOT172 |	But also they can integrate Kenmore
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,440	| IOT172 |	More tightly
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,720	| IOT172 |	Traditional lives
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,744	| IOT172 |	Kenworth
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,792	| IOT172 |	Because their product managers
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:04,352	| IOT172 |	Appliances with cruelly competitor
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,376	| IOT172 |	Differentiation
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,936	| IOT172 |	And devices that are easier and less costly
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:11,520	| IOT172 |	Maintenance service and they use real data from these devices
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,824	| IOT172 |	The field to understand what features are popular
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:23,296	| IOT172 |	Kenmore is an incredibly strong and trusted brand and they had the foresight to start very early to lead what was at the
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:25,088	| IOT172 |	Time an emergent connected appliances
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,136	| IOT172 |	They had multiple projects
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,952	| IOT172 |	With existing solutions that they just weren't doing the job
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,488	| IOT172 |	It took him too long to get a Kinect
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,512	| IOT172 |	The place to Market
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:34,560	| IOT172 |	Experience too many outages
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:37,376	| IOT172 |	Generally the solution
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,496	| IOT172 |	Runner 27
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:44,288	| IOT172 |	Connected Appliance model together now
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,592	| IOT172 |	And a pharaoh is a true platform
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:49,152	| IOT172 |	So everything works with everything else
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,432	| IOT172 |	What are the hardest things about eyes
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,968	| IOT172 |	Is that you have to
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,248	| IOT172 |	Develop for embedded
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:56,832	| IOT172 |	Mobile and the cloud but a pharaoh has created a unified
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,368	| IOT172 |	Click the configure developer
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,904	| IOT172 |	The process that radically simple
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,696	| IOT172 |	And as a result
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:03,744	| IOT172 |	The first pharaoh powered Appliance
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:06,304	| IOT172 |	The Kenmore built
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:07,584	| IOT172 |	The previous one
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,168	| IOT172 |	The outages that used to experience stop cold
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:15,520	| IOT172 |	Because we built a lot of resilience into the system
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,800	| IOT172 |	Device if nobody connect
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,336	| IOT172 |	And too many company
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,616	| IOT172 |	Go through all the trouble
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:23,200	| IOT172 |	Justifying the customers aren't signing up
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:25,760	| IOT172 |	Because the onboarding process is too complicated
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,296	| IOT172 |	To fly with a pharaoh
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,320	| IOT172 |	It's a very simple
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:30,368	| IOT172 |	Process started to see
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,136	| IOT172 |	A lot more customer
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,672	| IOT172 |	Actually connect me
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:35,232	| IOT172 |	Appliances and then once those appliances were connected
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,816	| IOT172 |	Manage the entire fleet of them
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:41,120	| IOT172 |	Using an overall single-pane dashboard
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,912	| IOT172 |	Let's see the data that
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:44,192	| IOT172 |	It's coming back from their machines
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,520	| IOT172 |	Topline analytics and machine learning
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,312	| IOT172 |	Finally I want to touch on
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:51,616	| IOT172 |	Security a pharaoh not only secures all the
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,128	| IOT172 |	Potato Patch
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:55,712	| IOT172 |	Devices or appliances in this case in a cloud
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,272	| IOT172 |	But it also secures the manufacturing process
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:58,784	| IOT172 |	Where can we go
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,856	| IOT172 |	The best place
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,136	| IOT172 |	Is a pharaoh
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,160	| IOT172 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,184	| IOT172 |	/ gobig
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:08,256	| IOT172 |	That's a f e r o.
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:10,304	| IOT172 |	Slash g o b i g
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:22,080	| IOT172 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast this is your home

EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,280	| IOT172 |	We are talking about my new favorite Gadget
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,304	| IOT172 |	Which is the
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:45,376	| IOT172 |	There's a lot of words here but it's basically a Delta faucet
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| IOT172 |	That talks
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,168	| IOT172 |	To madame

EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,896	| IOT172 |	Let's get this started with I saw this
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:57,664	| IOT172 |	CES
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,688	| IOT172 |	I could talk about it ever since
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,224	| IOT172 |	Very excited
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,528	| IOT172 |	How did it come to pass that you guys
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:05,856	| IOT172 |	Hey
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:07,136	| IOT172 |	Text hubby and
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:07,904	| IOT172 |	How did madame
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,976	| IOT172 |	Yes that's a great question are
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,000	| IOT172 |	Joshua Fawcett
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,048	| IOT172 |	Turn around for almost 10 years
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:18,656	| IOT172 |	And adults are always looking for ways to innovate and add new technology to our devices
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,984	| IOT172 |	So where the invention really of Amazon Echo and
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:25,824	| IOT172 |	Other smart speakers even ableist add voice activation
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,360	| IOT172 |	To some of our devices
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:29,408	| IOT172 |	So we wanted to look for ways
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:34,272	| IOT172 |	We could add it on to existing product offering and bars are electronic
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:38,112	| IOT172 |	Arabic seller so adding voice activation made sense
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:42,976	| IOT172 |	People could do some of the tasks that they normally do with a touch faucet but this house when able
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,488	| IOT172 |	New features
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,280	| IOT172 |	Express base
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:48,352	| IOT172 |	I guess we should probably explain to people what the touch
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:52,192	| IOT172 |	Yes sir I said she'll faucets use
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,216	| IOT172 |	Cast of Simpsons
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,496	| IOT172 |	Technology so that you can touch
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,824	| IOT172 |	Deposit anywhere to turn it on and off you has a handle on it so you can
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:02,176	| IOT172 |	Install control temperature and then you can even touch the handle to turn it on or off or on the spout
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:03,200	| IOT172 |	Enable you to do tasks
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:08,064	| IOT172 |	Very good and as someone who's owned I have had a capacitive touch faucet
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,112	| IOT172 |	Ever since we moved into this house
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:12,160	| IOT172 |	And it took that it was a little bit of
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:14,720	| IOT172 |	You guys but I would never never go back
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,768	| IOT172 |	Now even though every now and then
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,560	| IOT172 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,328	| IOT172 |	Turn it off
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,864	| IOT172 |	Turn off the faucet at the faucet
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,656	| IOT172 |	Supposed to
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,704	| IOT172 |	It's actually a lot like
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:25,472	| IOT172 |	Smart light bulbs
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:28,800	| IOT172 |	So you guys actually started selling this
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,336	| IOT172 |	First through you
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,104	| IOT172 |	Website
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:33,152	| IOT172 |	Two people as part of a beta program
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,920	| IOT172 |	What kind of feedback
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,456	| IOT172 |	Yasso
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,272	| IOT172 |	This year we sold a small quantity to some user
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:40,320	| IOT172 |	And we
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,368	| IOT172 |	Lots of interesting feedback really
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,904	| IOT172 |	Learn about use cases in which
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:44,928	| IOT172 |	People use this
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,952	| IOT172 |	I got some
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:47,744	| IOT172 |	Good feedback about a week
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,024	| IOT172 |	A teacher features
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:51,584	| IOT172 |	Product stories as well about a person
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,352	| IOT172 |	Has a cat
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,144	| IOT172 |	Lights to turn a faucet off so they
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:58,240	| IOT172 |	And they would give it to me and then your voice
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,008	| IOT172 |	Turn off
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:36:59,776	| IOT172 |	I like it
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,056	| IOT172 |	Imaginext cat
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,104	| IOT172 |	Okay and I noticed you guys don't have it
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,152	| IOT172 |	And I was kind of curious
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:05,664	| IOT172 |	Why that way
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,968	| IOT172 |	Yes that's a great question and
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:11,040	| IOT172 |	It's actually an intentional decision that we made
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:13,856	| IOT172 |	With the testing center on voice activation
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,416	| IOT172 |	Pretty much all of the user interface is through voice actor
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:19,232	| IOT172 |	So there wasn't a lot left 4 and 1/2
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,792	| IOT172 |	Necessary
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:27,168	| IOT172 |	Customer first and customization options could get a user interface to customize
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,448	| IOT172 |	The name of a container
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:31,264	| IOT172 |	Core 2 processor remote control faucet
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,848	| IOT172 |	Also as updates are pushed out
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:37,408	| IOT172 |	Something that we learned at you
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:42,784	| IOT172 |	Get the updates right away to the web app you don't have to worry about are you running the latest version of the app on your phone
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:43,296	| IOT172 |	So that was a nice
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:48,160	| IOT172 |	Have you seen any pushback from your customers about this or do they even
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,184	| IOT172 |	Never use the web app
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:51,744	| IOT172 |	Yes will you does a question me specifically asked are you
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,280	| IOT172 |	The weather
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:56,096	| IOT172 |	You should just minimal because most season her case is to voice
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,888	| IOT172 |	But it does have some music
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:04,288	| IOT172 |	Features you can check to see how much water are you using and then like I mentioned you can customize some things like the name of the cancer
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,848	| IOT172 |	Inner Light coffee pot or dog bowl
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,640	| IOT172 |	And how much water goes into those containers
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,456	| IOT172 |	Let's go to the actual installation
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:12,992	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:14,016	| IOT172 |	There's a lot to think about
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,808	| IOT172 |	Once you got to deal with
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,112	| IOT172 |	I mess with everything in my house and
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:20,416	| IOT172 |	But it wasn't actually that hard
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,720	| IOT172 |	H2O faucet
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,536	| IOT172 |	Man of a module
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,816	| IOT172 |	And they have to have
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,840	| IOT172 |	Power underneath
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:30,400	| IOT172 |	And that's because Wi-Fi is a big Power hog
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,168	| IOT172 |	Capacitive touch
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:31,680	| IOT172 |	Did not have
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,728	| IOT172 |	What's a little bit of an adjustment
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,264	| IOT172 |	I'm glad that I had another
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,056	| IOT172 |	Do most
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:42,176	| IOT172 |	So yeah you're right Stacy with the Wi-Fi module on the faucet you have to have an AC adapter
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:47,808	| IOT172 |	Turn Outlet we have found the majority people have an outlet and they may not know that they have an outlet Austin times together garbage
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,600	| IOT172 |	Disposal under sink
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,392	| IOT172 |	Or if you have a dishwasher nearby
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,184	| IOT172 |	There be an outlet under the sink as well
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| IOT172 |	And if you don't
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:57,024	| IOT172 |	Typically an inexpensive addition
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:00,096	| IOT172 |	Electrician come out or if you're DIY type person
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,120	| IOT172 |	You cannot live without
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:02,656	| IOT172 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:04,192	| IOT172 |	And let's talk about
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:04,960	| IOT172 |	The actual
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:05,472	| IOT172 |	Skill with
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,032	| IOT172 |	Because I find it a little bit
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,336	| IOT172 |	To be like the way this work
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,872	| IOT172 |	I will say
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:12,640	| IOT172 |	Madam
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:13,920	| IOT172 |	Acid altitude
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:14,432	| IOT172 |	Dispense
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:15,968	| IOT172 |	Types of water and
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:19,040	| IOT172 |	But I do find myself stumbling
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:20,832	| IOT172 |	Over
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,880	| IOT172 |	So I'm curious about
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,160	| IOT172 |	How you employ
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:28,256	| IOT172 |	Yes I can be a little bit of a mouthful.
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:31,072	| IOT172 |	Once you get used to it and the routine it
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,840	| IOT172 |	Becomes
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,864	| IOT172 |	A place for you
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,680	| IOT172 |	But it's something we're looking to improve right now it's
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,240	| IOT172 |	A limitation of the
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,776	| IOT172 |	Profiles that are available
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:40,544	| IOT172 |	Within
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:45,152	| IOT172 |	Ecosystem so they have profiles for light switches and door locks
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:47,712	| IOT172 |	But there's not really a profile for a faucet
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:49,248	| IOT172 |	And that's something we're working
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:50,528	| IOT172 |	Consumers Amazon
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,296	| IOT172 |	2
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,832	| IOT172 |	It's that next stage of development
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:54,112	| IOT172 |	Oh yes okay that my
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:54,880	| IOT172 |	Makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:40:00,512	| IOT172 |	It's kind of gets into this challenge that I see in which is there's no data schema I know Universal data schema
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,024	| IOT172 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,560	| IOT172 |	In devices in it
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,864	| IOT172 |	So everybody has to build their own
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,680	| IOT172 |	And if native skills basically in bed
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:11,520	| IOT172 |	I would think becomes a challenge for a company like you guys especially
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:17,664	| IOT172 |	Do you have plans to go beyond anatomy and moving to like Google or some other ecosystem
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:19,456	| IOT172 |	When we start our development
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,224	| IOT172 |	We
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,760	| IOT172 |	Took a step back and looked at
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,832	| IOT172 |	The landscape to figure out what's assistance out there and what we see
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:26,112	| IOT172 |	Systems are people using
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,672	| IOT172 |	This goes back sometime maybe year ago and
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:31,232	| IOT172 |	Looking around we saw the Amazon Echo was
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:34,304	| IOT172 |	Can we erase a little bit and was popular
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,352	| IOT172 |	Consumers
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,632	| IOT172 |	Would also buy a touch faucet
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:42,496	| IOT172 |	Partners Amazon and wanted to make bar
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:44,032	| IOT172 |	Voice activated faucet
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:44,800	| IOT172 |	Works
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,824	| IOT172 |	Within their skills
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:47,360	| IOT172 |	Available since then
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,896	| IOT172 |	Pulaski exchange a little bit
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,664	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,688	| IOT172 |	Google has
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,712	| IOT172 |	Come up
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:53,504	| IOT172 |	Apple has their homepod
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:56,320	| IOT172 |	And I think those are both platforms we are looking ticks
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,600	| IOT172 |	Blur to try
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:59,904	| IOT172 |	To add voice activation
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:00,928	| IOT172 |	To our faucet
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:02,208	| IOT172 |	Work with those platform
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:03,488	| IOT172 |	We're just not quite there yet
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:09,376	| IOT172 |	Let's talk about this issue that a faucet is something that people don't necessarily think a lot about
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,192	| IOT172 |	I like when you move into a new home
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,472	| IOT172 |	Has a faucet
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,032	| IOT172 |	There's a bus at great
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,568	| IOT172 |	There wasn't one
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:20,128	| IOT172 |	But people don't necessarily spend a lot of time
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:22,944	| IOT172 |	Upgrade cycle
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,992	| IOT172 |	But I imagine that you guys do
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:30,624	| IOT172 |	So how long do you feel like your boss it should last and then how long from when you start adding technology to
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,160	| IOT172 |	How does that change that occur
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:38,304	| IOT172 |	Yes people will typically think of a faucet has an appliance when they move into a new home it is
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:39,840	| IOT172 |	Just something that they use
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,376	| IOT172 |	People replace a faucet
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,424	| IOT172 |	Is something goes wrong and
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:47,008	| IOT172 |	Copulate or they want to do a remodel and update
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:47,776	| IOT172 |	Stylist
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,568	| IOT172 |	I saw sister design
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:53,151	| IOT172 |	And they have lifetime warranty on their
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:55,199	| IOT172 |	Are electronic faucet
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,479	| IOT172 |	Have a 5 year warranty
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:57,247	| IOT172 |	You can
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,271	| IOT172 |	Expectantly
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,295	| IOT172 |	On time
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,855	| IOT172 |	After the electronic Spark
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:02,623	| IOT172 |	Where's outer brakes
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:05,183	| IOT172 |	Maybe there's an upgrade cycle that needs
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,719	| IOT172 |	How do you envision that
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:11,583	| IOT172 |	Telesis Electronic Component that needs to be replaced we offer replacement parts
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,119	| IOT172 |	You can definitely reach out
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:15,679	| IOT172 |	Delta to an 800 number or an online
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:18,751	| IOT172 |	Contact and we can send you a new part if you need that
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:19,519	| IOT172 |	One of the
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:20,799	| IOT172 |	Biggest questions that I've got
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,079	| IOT172 |	People about the
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,615	| IOT172 |	Beyond
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:28,991	| IOT172 |	How do I know that the faucet isn't going to be turned on in Waist gallons of Honey gallons
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,551	| IOT172 |	Water so most people were sitting here telling
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:33,087	| IOT172 |	Oh I need a notification system
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,903	| IOT172 |	Dispense this many gallons of water
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:37,439	| IOT172 |	I don't actually know do you guys have some
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:39,743	| IOT172 |	So
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,279	| IOT172 |	Kohler touch faucet
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:43,839	| IOT172 |	Actually have a 4 minute timeout
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:48,447	| IOT172 |	And so that will override not only a touch activation but also a voice
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:50,239	| IOT172 |	So typical flow rates
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:51,775	| IOT172 |	People's homes are
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:54,335	| IOT172 |	About a gallon and a half per minute what means
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:56,895	| IOT172 |	Really worst case scenario if somehow your faucet
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,455	| IOT172 |	Catalan
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:42:59,967	| IOT172 |	Distance about
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:01,247	| IOT172 |	Water
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:04,319	| IOT172 |	Okay I couldn't even fill up my fish tank without you
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,087	| IOT172 |	You guys
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:07,903	| IOT172 |	Another issue that we've encountered
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,671	| IOT172 |	A couple times
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:12,767	| IOT172 |	I think it's probably was Madame SOI only there was some sensitivity around
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:15,327	| IOT172 |	So I started out calling
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:16,351	| IOT172 |	Something
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,375	| IOT172 |	Fish bass
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,423	| IOT172 |	Because I have a certain base I like to fill
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:21,471	| IOT172 |	It's forever that I used to film
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,263	| IOT172 |	I tried to do that
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:25,823	| IOT172 |	Was not having any
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,871	| IOT172 |	But she's like I couldn't understand this
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,151	| IOT172 |	So do you have any advice
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,175	| IOT172 |	Are people on
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,711	| IOT172 |	Hey baby don't call it
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,991	| IOT172 |	Fish bait
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,527	| IOT172 |	Just call it bass or something else
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,063	| IOT172 |	Yasso
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,087	| IOT172 |	One-word names
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,111	| IOT172 |	Definitely work
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:40,159	| IOT172 |	Better you can use more than one word
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,951	| IOT172 |	You know Amazon has their own
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:47,327	| IOT172 |	Machine learning that's going on in the background and interesting to do during development when
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:53,471	| IOT172 |	We have to train are still on what kinds of objects looks or will you provide a list of
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:55,007	| IOT172 |	Common object names
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,287	| IOT172 |	Star Developers
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:59,871	| IOT172 |	Actually went to The Crate & Barrel website and got a list of a lot of different
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,639	| IOT172 |	Akinator names
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,175	| IOT172 |	Anywhere from Facebook
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,711	| IOT172 |	Decanter
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:04,223	| IOT172 |	Kind of
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:07,039	| IOT172 |	Train it on types of object
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:07,807	| IOT172 |	An object name
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,831	| IOT172 |	Cold water
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,599	| IOT172 |	And so
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,391	| IOT172 |	The scale uses that information
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:12,671	| IOT172 |	2
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,695	| IOT172 |	Trey cross reference
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:14,975	| IOT172 |	I name you might have with
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:17,535	| IOT172 |	Common name for container that hold water
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,303	| IOT172 |	I like that
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:21,375	| IOT172 |	Are you guys planning to expand this to other areas
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,959	| IOT172 |	I think this is awesome but a lot of people are like
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:27,519	| IOT172 |	Hey I want to be like Madame a run me a bath
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:29,567	| IOT172 |	You know that's something we're looking to
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:33,407	| IOT172 |	For we right now have the voice activated kitchen faucet
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:36,223	| IOT172 |	And it would be an area that seems to make sense
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:40,319	| IOT172 |	To explore as we continue to grow the offering but right now is
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:40,831	| IOT172 |	Justice
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,135	| IOT172 |	And what is the price you
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:45,183	| IOT172 |	About launching this product and how people
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:46,463	| IOT172 |	So far
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:50,815	| IOT172 |	What was most surprising was how people use it in their everyday
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:53,375	| IOT172 |	The once people get used to
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,911	| IOT172 |	Naming an object
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:55,679	| IOT172 |	Like
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,727	| IOT172 |	They begin to use it
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:00,799	| IOT172 |	Tilly's Chillicothe / se have abs
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,335	| IOT172 |	Secret recipe that they make
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,383	| IOT172 |	For me it's making oatmeal for my son
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,663	| IOT172 |	In the morning
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,711	| IOT172 |	Assertive change my
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:14,111	| IOT172 |	Routine in the morning instead of reaching for a measuring cup out of the cupboard I think a voice command and feel confident it's going to depend
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:16,927	| IOT172 |	Right amount of water into the bowl with oatmeal and then
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,719	| IOT172 |	X-ray to go
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,743	| IOT172 |	So it's
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:22,047	| IOT172 |	That kind of learned behavior that
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:23,071	| IOT172 |	You see the shift
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:26,143	| IOT172 |	Four people were doing things one way and now the technology enables
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,679	| IOT172 |	How to do it anyway
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:31,007	| IOT172 |	Okay well I can't wait for the future when madam
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:31,775	| IOT172 |	Myrecipes
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,079	| IOT172 |	Dispenser automatic
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,615	| IOT172 |	Well I'm off doing
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,407	| IOT172 |	That's going to be like
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,175	| IOT172 |	My uncle
