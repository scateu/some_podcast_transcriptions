EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:13,824	| IOT049 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,824	00:00:14,336	| IOT049 |	Your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:15,360	| IOT049 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:18,944	| IOT049 |	Today we have got a great show for you we have got
EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:20,736	| IOT049 |	Nest new features from it
EDL	00:00:20,736	00:00:22,528	| IOT049 |	We're going to talk about the Amazon.
EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:23,552	| IOT049 |	Intapp we got
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:25,088	| IOT049 |	Awesome updates on semiconductor sales
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:26,880	| IOT049 |	We've got mozilla's
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,160	| IOT049 |	Iot strategy
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:29,184	| IOT049 |	What's up with that
EDL	00:00:29,184	00:00:30,720	| IOT049 |	And I'm a
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:32,512	| IOT049 |	Even talk to you about why I
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:35,328	| IOT049 |	I'm not sure we should call the Internet of Things The Internet of Things anymore
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:36,608	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:37,120	| IOT049 |	Big Show
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:39,424	| IOT049 |	But because I'm traveling
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:41,728	| IOT049 |	A the sound quality maybe a little iffy
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:43,520	| IOT049 |	MP we don't have a guest
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:45,056	| IOT049 |	This is Jessica Kevin and Stacey
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,568	| IOT049 |	Baby show
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,104	| IOT049 |	We'll make due
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:48,384	| IOT049 |	We had a blast.
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:51,968	| IOT049 |	All right now wait to get to the Amazon stuff we'll talk about it later
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:52,992	| IOT049 |	West 1st
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:53,504	| IOT049 |	Asperger's
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:55,296	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:56,320	| IOT049 |	Nest isn't
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:57,600	| IOT049 |	I think
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,880	| IOT049 |	Is great will let you talk about it
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:05,536	| IOT049 |	Yes there are two new features coming to Nest thermostats which is nice cuz we never had we had a ton of
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:11,168	| IOT049 |	New features lately the two figures are family accounts and home away assist
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:13,472	| IOT049 |	They are pretty much what they sound like
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:14,496	| IOT049 |	Family counts
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:18,080	| IOT049 |	You don't have to after the you get this update you won't have to
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:20,128	| IOT049 |	Share your login your password
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:20,640	| IOT049 |	Because right now
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:25,504	| IOT049 |	You don't like on my Nest I'm signed in with my own Gmail account and
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:26,528	| IOT049 |	Amion password
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:29,088	| IOT049 |	I have to give that to everybody in the family not a big deal
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:31,136	| IOT049 |	Pretty much trust my family but still
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:34,976	| IOT049 |	It can be a bit of a hassle for other people who want to share their nest
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:37,280	| IOT049 |	Access family access to the
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,816	| IOT049 |	Set thermostat without
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:40,608	| IOT049 |	Sharing credentials so that's kind of
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,376	| IOT049 |	Cool
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:43,936	| IOT049 |	Leaving the throne copy of the monthly home report
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:46,496	| IOT049 |	Which I like to see all my little leaves as i r in them
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,544	| IOT049 |	Solar house
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:52,128	| IOT049 |	Lots of leaves on trees
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:56,224	| IOT049 |	Yes so there's that I know you're pretty excited about the family accounts
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,504	| IOT049 |	I am so
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,528	| IOT049 |	Well I'm excited about boats
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,088	| IOT049 |	The second picture is
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:05,952	| IOT049 |	Basically it's an improvement on the features
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,256	| IOT049 |	Nest traditionally has used
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:11,072	| IOT049 |	IR sensor proximity sensor
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,096	| IOT049 |	Tire sensor on the thermostat
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,192	| IOT049 |	But they've also built
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,704	| IOT049 |	What's an algorithm
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:21,056	| IOT049 |	Hey early in the morning if you don't sense motion
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,872	| IOT049 |	It's most likely that someone has left the house
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,408	| IOT049 |	Like for the day
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:28,736	| IOT049 |	And so it'll more quickly transition to the away mode when they
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,272	| IOT049 |	Turn off your heat or AC
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT049 |	If possible
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| IOT049 |	And so
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:35,392	| IOT049 |	What they've done now is there using you
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:35,904	| IOT049 |	Your phone
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:39,232	| IOT049 |	Because I don't know I just happens to me a lot cuz my office
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:42,048	| IOT049 |	It's not near the thermostat I'll be in my office for a while
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,120	| IOT049 |	What happened
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,656	| IOT049 |	My head out
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:55,360	| IOT049 |	And I'm in the same boat because my home office is on the second floor of the nests in the first floor in
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:03:01,248	| IOT049 |	You know their initial attempt to do home away settings I think was a step forward at the time
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,040	| IOT049 |	But now they're taking advantage of
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,856	| IOT049 |	Available hardware and smarts today
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| IOT049 |	To bring It Forward even more I think
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| IOT049 |	Yes there's a couple things
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,744	| IOT049 |	This one is the big macro thing that I love from
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| IOT049 |	Twitches
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:15,072	| IOT049 |	Masters final
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,608	| IOT049 |	Getting things ready for the fact
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:21,216	| IOT049 |	People don't live in a home by themselves people live in a home usually
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,312	| IOT049 |	This is great because the family account
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| IOT049 |	How to make it
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:29,152	| IOT049 |	Very easy to share and you don't like let's say you've got
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,992	| IOT049 |	Airbnb are you get gas coming and you can't even give him that without compromise
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,528	| IOT049 |	Security
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:37,856	| IOT049 |	And also kind of comes back to this idea of like your home
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,136	| IOT049 |	Maybe getting its own email address
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,440	| IOT049 |	Previous shows about this
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,720	| IOT049 |	Send
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,512	| IOT049 |	Scott Jensen
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,280	| IOT049 |	Who works at Google
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,048	| IOT049 |	He's like
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,352	| IOT049 |	I don't actually like my home having an email address
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,168	| IOT049 |	It's still better than one person
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,984	| IOT049 |	Being tied to a device so having a home
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,520	| IOT049 |	Or Family Ties
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,032	| IOT049 |	Two devices
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,616	| IOT049 |	And then the same thing for the
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:04,480	| IOT049 |	A wasting that's also a nice way to kind of keep track of a number of people in the home
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,272	| IOT049 |	Especially in a larger home with
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| IOT049 |	Upstairs Downstairs
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:08,832	| IOT049 |	Unless whatever
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,184	| IOT049 |	Working on this with Integrations from
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| IOT049 |	A bunch of other partners like
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:19,839	| IOT049 |	Zoo leaders I'm testing out some lights right now that that I'm home
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,631	| IOT049 |	Even when I'm not in front of my nest
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,167	| IOT049 |	So there's
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,215	| IOT049 |	There's other ways of doing this that aren't the phone
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,727	| IOT049 |	Especially
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| IOT049 |	If you're someone who
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,775	| IOT049 |	It's like
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,799	| IOT049 |	I don't have a cell phone
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,383	| IOT049 |	Or you got a kid that maybe doesn't
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:38,527	| IOT049 |	Actually that's the key I don't know if he made that clear up front so I apologize for the home away assist uses
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,575	| IOT049 |	Your phone data sensors on your phone
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,623	| IOT049 |	To help Nest understand who
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,927	| IOT049 |	Is home and or who is away
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,743	| IOT049 |	Whether it's GPS sensors or whatever else
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,791	| IOT049 |	Rental homes
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| IOT049 |	So they're expanding their
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,143	| IOT049 |	Smart around proximity who is home and
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| IOT049 |	Is anybody home and visitor who is it
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,751	| IOT049 |	So this is an opt-in feature by the way
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,823	| IOT049 |	It says when family members opt-in
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:04,127	| IOT049 |	It lets the harmonious use data from the phone
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,943	| IOT049 |	For the nest so you don't have to use
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,759	| IOT049 |	This feature I know some people may have concerns about privacy and
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,319	| IOT049 |	GPS in geofencing and all that so
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,111	| IOT049 |	But the nice thing is if you do opt in
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,671	| IOT049 |	The home away assist won't switch
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,951	| IOT049 |	To away
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:21,791	| IOT049 |	If they're still somebody in the house if it and it knows that through the phone
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,607	| IOT049 |	So I like this because Nest is it essentially
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,631	| IOT049 |	Expanding its presence
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:29,983	| IOT049 |	Yeah and if you think about it it also gives you away to say hey
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:34,591	| IOT049 |	If I'm the only person in the whole because now it's got a family account
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,151	| IOT049 |	It can say
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,199	| IOT049 |	Stacy is right now the only person home
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,015	| IOT049 |	I could then setup my Integrations to work
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,063	| IOT049 |	With things I like when I'm home
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,647	| IOT049 |	So that's kind of cool especially if you
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,415	| IOT049 |	Like you and your
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,695	| IOT049 |	Pick another fight a lot over the
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,207	| IOT049 |	Temperature
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,999	| IOT049 |	Like
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,559	| IOT049 |	This is not a feature by the way that Nest is offering now
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,095	| IOT049 |	Thinking forward
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,375	| IOT049 |	Think about things like
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,423	| IOT049 |	My guess is Stacy's home
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,727	| IOT049 |	She likes it you know 75 degree
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,311	| IOT049 |	Oh Stacy's husband's home and he's by himself he loves it
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:05,823	| IOT049 |	68
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,383	| IOT049 |	I would expect them to expand
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,431	| IOT049 |	To that type of personalization
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,503	| IOT049 |	In the future man I know I will see a technical reason for not happening
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| IOT049 |	I don't either
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,551	| IOT049 |	What does it mean
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,343	| IOT049 |	It will
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:21,439	| IOT049 |	Complex and then they've always been
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,255	| IOT049 |	Depart of themselves on being
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,047	| IOT049 |	Really easy for
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,327	| IOT049 |	Consumers to get
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,607	| IOT049 |	So you don't have to wake
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,911	| IOT049 |	There's not a lot of programming there's not a lot of
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,215	| IOT049 |	Conditional statements you're making
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| IOT049 |	You know a lot of that stuff that
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,799	| IOT049 |	Happens with a lot of other application
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,847	| IOT049 |	Ensign services
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,151	| IOT049 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,223	| IOT049 |	So that is the nest news and it's pretty good
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,039	| IOT049 |	I can't wait to try these features on my nest and see what have
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:50,879	| IOT049 |	Will light in the South with Mozilla and its iot strata
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,231	| IOT049 |	Kevin has a penny
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:07:00,095	| IOT049 |	We should say back in February so February Mazzella said hey we're going to not be
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,631	| IOT049 |	A mobile browser kind of
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,935	| IOT049 |	I think we're going to be a connected device company
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,751	| IOT049 |	And they decided that that's where they were going to focus
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,775	| IOT049 |	Add Mozilla
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:12,127	| IOT049 |	You're not aware is the creator of the Firefox browser
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:17,759	| IOT049 |	Tan and gray things to advance the web in an open-source over the past house at least decade
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,575	| IOT049 |	And I have nothing but respect for what they've done
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,135	| IOT049 |	And unfortunately hasn't really panned out
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:28,767	| IOT049 |	Firefox browser market share has been declining in the face of other browsers and Salon
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,303	| IOT049 |	And they're kind of pivoting a little bit but
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:35,423	| IOT049 |	You know I think there's still a lot they can do here I think it's a smart move for them to get into it IRT
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,959	| IOT049 |	Space I mean
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,031	| IOT049 |	You stepped back a week because they announced a couple of
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:44,127	| IOT049 |	A potential Solutions as they say on their on their blog for iot such as
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,687	| IOT049 |	Endless Run 3 is real quick project link
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:51,807	| IOT049 |	Which is at personal user agent that understands preferences for how you want to interact with devices
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,135	| IOT049 |	Father's project sensor web so it's a way to get
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,463	| IOT049 |	Data from sensors to
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,511	| IOT049 |	Apps and such there it is
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| IOT049 |	Project Smart Home
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:07,679	| IOT049 |	Which they say is a middle ground between solution such as apple homekit and the Raspberry Pi so they want to
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:11,007	| IOT049 |	Middle Ground between the in a box solution and then do it yourself
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,847	| IOT049 |	Elena project Vanni which is an
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,919	| IOT049 |	IRT enabler package for developers and device makers
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:21,503	| IOT049 |	I want to add a voice interface to their devices which sounds really cool
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,295	| IOT049 |	It all sounds really cool I'll be honest
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,831	| IOT049 |	Banana pudding on my
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,367	| IOT049 |	Opinion hat for a second
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,415	| IOT049 |	And it just seems to me like
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,719	| IOT049 |	A lot of this already exists
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,255	| IOT049 |	And it works
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,023	| IOT049 |	Pretty well
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:38,911	| IOT049 |	So it kind of saddens me to see Missoula used too often be at the Forefront of new technology
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,959	| IOT049 |	And leading the way perfectly with some
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,239	| IOT049 |	Open source approaches to it
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| IOT049 |	Now trying to
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,823	| IOT049 |	I'll say ketchup
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,359	| IOT049 |	To say for voicemail
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,687	| IOT049 |	Go to the series in the Google Now is in the Amazon voice services and so on
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,759	| IOT049 |	And I say that because when I look at their Wiki
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,063	| IOT049 |	Thanks for that project Danny which is the voice enabling
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:02,975	| IOT049 |	They're saying right now the van team is brainstorming how we can create our own unique solution that does not have to compete with or catch up with
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,279	| IOT049 |	The existing players such as Siri and Google Now
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,351	| IOT049 |	It seems like they're just
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:14,495	| IOT049 |	Floating an idea out there that really not don't have a lot of focus yet and I'm not sure there's a big need for what they're going to
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,055	| IOT049 |	Potentially offer if they offer anything at all
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:21,919	| IOT049 |	So that's the best I take my pain and head off now and I'll shoot it over to you for your thoughts cuz
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,455	| IOT049 |	I want a bathroom too much air
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,735	| IOT049 |	No that's fine in time
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| IOT049 |	Privacy and
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,415	| IOT049 |	Which I think is a reason
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| IOT049 |	That you could
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,487	| IOT049 |	See something like this flourishing
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:41,375	| IOT049 |	And maybe Danny is a terrible example
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,679	| IOT049 |	The project smart home sounds a lot like
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,215	| IOT049 |	Something like SmartThings only
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,799	| IOT049 |	It sounds like it would be completely open as opposed to being built
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,103	| IOT049 |	I would love
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:55,199	| IOT049 |	Something like this I think if it got enough market share
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| IOT049 |	You could see
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,783	| IOT049 |	Developers building for this
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,295	| IOT049 |	In a way that
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:03,391	| IOT049 |	It makes him not have to participate with some of these closed-door ecosystems
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,719	| IOT049 |	Resources you could just pick one that you could pick something
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| IOT049 |	Hidden Lake Project
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:11,583	| IOT049 |	Especially with them
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,887	| IOT049 |	Established already
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,959	| IOT049 |	And in their wikis
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| IOT049 |	Things on it
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,799	| IOT049 |	Wow this is really
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,823	| IOT049 |	I'm with you on
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:26,175	| IOT049 |	Choices good in the end they could offer something at the others
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:29,503	| IOT049 |	Don't especially when it comes to you no privacy security
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:32,319	| IOT049 |	Simplicity. Some of the things you did mention
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,111	| IOT049 |	But is that going to be enough
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,903	| IOT049 |	At this point in time
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,463	| IOT049 |	I don't know I do know there are things I would like
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,327	| IOT049 |	So on The Voice side I would love to see if I can if this then that service
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,631	| IOT049 |	Integration
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,143	| IOT049 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,447	| IOT049 |	So I think that would be
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,215	| IOT049 |	Awesome
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,239	| IOT049 |	If I were
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,799	| IOT049 |	It just a little bit easier than their STK which is
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| IOT049 |	Great Bear Lake
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,895	| IOT049 |	Developers
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:57,919	| IOT049 |	Going to build their own
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,783	| IOT049 |	Suffer for this a little easier and I think it'd be kind of
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,807	| IOT049 |	Awesome to have it
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,391	| IOT049 |	So I think that would be
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:14,815	| IOT049 |	On the open side you know if if they could create like a true bridge between something like homekit and all the other stuff out on the
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| IOT049 |	Market
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| IOT049 |	That would be really valuable
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,911	| IOT049 |	You just don't know if that's
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,215	| IOT049 |	In all of these are very much
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:21,727	| IOT049 |	Much like
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,287	| IOT049 |	We are literally throwing this
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,967	| IOT049 |	You know props to them for being late
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| IOT049 |	Hey Ya
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,551	| IOT049 |	So that's what mozilla's doing
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,599	| IOT049 |	I think we should probably talk
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,159	| IOT049 |	About what would you chew quick items
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,671	| IOT049 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,767	| IOT049 |	We are going to talk
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,351	| IOT049 |	A report came out
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,119	| IOT049 |	For the McLean group
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| IOT049 |	Semiconductors
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| IOT049 |	You guys are like
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| IOT049 |	Who cares but
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,287	| IOT049 |	We are about to hit
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:12:00,127	| IOT049 |	1 trillion semiconductors sold by 2018
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,687	| IOT049 |	In a single year
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,967	| IOT049 |	That is one trillion
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,503	| IOT049 |	And that is a lot
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,271	| IOT049 |	A semiconductor
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,063	| IOT049 |	What's kind of exciting
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,903	| IOT049 |	And it just give you a sense the industry is expected to sell
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,183	| IOT049 |	800
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,719	| IOT049 |	An 86.7
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:16,511	| IOT049 |	This year
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| IOT049 |	September
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,327	| IOT049 |	This is all anytime.
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:23,167	| IOT049 |	Play ten million
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:28,031	| IOT049 |	Yeah and then they say 950 billion Siamese next year and then it's
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,567	| IOT049 |	1.02 trillion in
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:34,943	| IOT049 |	In 2018 which has happened to coincide with the number of zeros in a trillion 18
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| IOT049 |	Ingrate
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,783	| IOT049 |	We know cuz we chat before the show
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,551	| IOT049 |	We did
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:44,159	| IOT049 |	Before you guys get like and it's not just the Internet of Things
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,671	| IOT049 |	This is just a
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| IOT049 |	Ramp up
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,791	| IOT049 |	We just use more chips because we can there cheaper
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,583	| IOT049 |	The average selling price of these chips
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,631	| IOT049 |	Is only $0.30
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,703	| IOT049 |	It's because over 70% of these chips are in
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,215	| IOT049 |	Include
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,519	| IOT049 |	Opto sensor discrete
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:03,103	| IOT049 |	So these are like tiny little things like actuators
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,175	| IOT049 |	Resistor is little power management chips
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,223	| IOT049 |	Little tiny bits that you
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,991	| IOT049 |	You sticking
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:09,759	| IOT049 |	Senior phone
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,295	| IOT049 |	International single-purpose
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,087	| IOT049 |	It's been expensive chips
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,391	| IOT049 |	That brings the average selling price down
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| IOT049 |	But they're still
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:22,047	| IOT049 |	Pisces which are integrated circuits which of the fancier things like
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,327	| IOT049 |	Microcontrollers
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,119	| IOT049 |	Application process Solutions
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| IOT049 |	Server chips
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,215	| IOT049 |	So lot of chips
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:35,103	| IOT049 |	It was crazy about this as if this didn't happen I mean I mean I know this is going to sound obvious but
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:38,687	| IOT049 |	Your phone's wouldn't be as powerful as inexpensive as they are relatively
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,455	| IOT049 |	Expensive
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,295	| IOT049 |	Iot devices to be a lot more of the easier to get into that market
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,087	| IOT049 |	It just it's amazing
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:45,855	| IOT049 |	What is impacts
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,135	| IOT049 |	It's
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,671	| IOT049 |	Are everywhere
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:49,951	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,487	| IOT049 |	Yay 1 trillion
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,535	| IOT049 |	All right that's it
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:57,119	| IOT049 |	Weird passive Wi-Fi I just wanted to drop you
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,167	| IOT049 |	Because it's not real it's not
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| IOT049 |	Commercialized
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:02,239	| IOT049 |	I mean it's real that people
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:06,079	| IOT049 |	What is making stuff up today
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:10,431	| IOT049 |	No this is real but it's still research that needs to be commercialized so
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| IOT049 |	Take that as
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,503	| IOT049 |	It's called
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,551	| IOT049 |	Passive Wi-Fi and its
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:19,391	| IOT049 |	It's low power Wi-Fi in this isn't like the Halo Wi-Fi spec which is
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:23,999	| IOT049 |	At the Wi-Fi Alliance right now trying to get certified this is
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| IOT049 |	Actually
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,815	| IOT049 |	A way to
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:31,935	| IOT049 |	Transmit Wi-Fi signals using kind of a reflection of a signal called Backscatter
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,471	| IOT049 |	To transmit the data so
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,263	| IOT049 |	Like ten thousand
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| IOT049 |	Sometimes less powers
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:40,895	| IOT049 |	That's a huge huge difference in terms of power and
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:47,807	| IOT049 |	Well I wouldn't say something like this say in a connection that you want always on and always fast cuz I think at the moment they test
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,855	| IOT049 |	I stood up to 11 megabits per second
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,951	| IOT049 |	You know I could see it lesson phones and tablets and TVs and such
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,255	| IOT049 |	Four more in iot devices which
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:00,095	| IOT049 |	Today might use Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi and so on
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:03,167	| IOT049 |	So you're getting Bluetooth like speeds but even
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,959	| IOT049 |	Much less power than the Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:08,031	| IOT049 |	Yeah and what's kind of neat about it is
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:11,615	| IOT049 |	It's much more Distributing so it's kind of like a peer-to-peer data
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,407	| IOT049 |	Link as opposed to Lake
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,991	| IOT049 |	Your thing talking to your router and then to the public internet
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,807	| IOT049 |	The things can actually use this to talk to each other
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,575	| IOT049 |	And then back to the
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,111	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,135	| IOT049 |	From an architecture
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,439	| IOT049 |	This is kind of really fascinating to
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,999	| IOT049 |	But we're just thinking about it
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,023	| IOT049 |	Research being done
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,791	| IOT049 |	At the University of Hawaii
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,119	| IOT049 |	And it looks like I killed a company
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:36,191	| IOT049 |	Call jeeva Wireless jeeva
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,727	| IOT049 |	To help commercial Isis
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,495	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,311	| IOT049 |	Be interesting to see if they make this happen
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,359	| IOT049 |	Yeah but they've been working on it actually since
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:43,871	| IOT049 |	2014
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,431	| IOT049 |	So let's go
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,967	| IOT049 |	Hopefully all right
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| IOT049 |	Shall we do it
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:52,063	| IOT049 |	Let's do it been waiting for days to do it
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,463	| IOT049 |	Dino Amazon
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:00,255	| IOT049 |	Which is 2 days after
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,279	| IOT049 |	Recorded it so
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:01,791	| IOT049 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,143	| IOT049 |	Lunch tomorrow or the next day
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| IOT049 |	Kevin
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,983	| IOT049 |	All right
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| IOT049 |	Foremost
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,567	| IOT049 |	Everybody Knows by now but for those that do not
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,639	| IOT049 |	Amazon has added two new Echo devices
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,175	| IOT049 |	3D family of echo products
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:24,831	| IOT049 |	When we we had rumors I've been kind of knew about that would be what is called the Amazon tap
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,903	| IOT049 |	And that is a smaller version of the current Hardware
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:30,207	| IOT049 |	But it's also portable battery powered
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:35,327	| IOT049 |	And yes you do have to tap the button or press the button before you can get your voice services
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,607	| IOT049 |	Go and get your
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,375	| IOT049 |	You commands in such
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,679	| IOT049 |	The other one kind of came out of left
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,447	| IOT049 |	Field
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,471	| IOT049 |	And I think
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,519	| IOT049 |	You and I both ordered it on day one
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,847	| IOT049 |	We did that is the echo Dot
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,895	| IOT049 |	So imagine if you will
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,687	| IOT049 |	Somebody
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:56,319	| IOT049 |	Smashing down Amazon Echo pushing straight down on it to get rid of the your speaker in the height and all that
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:00,927	| IOT049 |	And that comes up with something that's maybe I don't know 2in tall looks like a hockey puck
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:04,767	| IOT049 |	It's like the top of the echo in the bottom of the echo no middle
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:09,375	| IOT049 |	That's because you're just speaker inside it short of a small speaker similar phone speaker
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,655	| IOT049 |	So the
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,423	| IOT049 |	God
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,727	| IOT049 |	Is always listening always on which is nice
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:19,103	| IOT049 |	However if you're going to use it for music you would Bluetooth or wired parrot 2
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,127	| IOT049 |	A set of speakers
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,175	| IOT049 |	So it's basically
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,711	| IOT049 |	An echo without the speaker
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,015	| IOT049 |	The way to add your own speakers to the
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:31,135	| IOT049 |	Self but you prices for these are 12999 for the portable
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,159	| IOT049 |	Echo tap
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:36,255	| IOT049 |	And 8999 for the echo Dot
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,791	| IOT049 |	An interesting way
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,583	| IOT049 |	You can only order the.
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,655	| IOT049 |	Through your existing Amazon Echo you had to ask
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,983	| IOT049 |	She We Shall Not Be Named to order an echo. Which
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,775	| IOT049 |	Work well for me and I'll die for you
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,079	| IOT049 |	Super Why
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,615	| IOT049 |	If you work around 6
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,127	| IOT049 |	You could do like
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,663	| IOT049 |	I think it is
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,943	| IOT049 |	You could go to the app and do it
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:55,967	| IOT049 |	Some things like that
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,295	| IOT049 |	If you really want it.
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,599	| IOT049 |	So quick take you want to go for it or should I go
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,415	| IOT049 |	Well we both were the same thing
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:08,511	| IOT049 |	So let's talk about why you didn't and I can do the same
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,815	| IOT049 |	Why you didn't order the Amazon tap
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,863	| IOT049 |	Alexa enabled portable speaker
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:17,983	| IOT049 |	So Timmy the tap looks like kind of like we said originally when we were talking about the
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:21,567	| IOT049 |	Does product because it's portable it doesn't have the always-on speaker capability
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:24,895	| IOT049 |	Anatomy voice is a hands-free kind of
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:28,735	| IOT049 |	User interface and tap to touch something to talk to it
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,271	| IOT049 |	Sex the magic real
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,087	| IOT049 |	So it feels like Amazon here is
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,135	| IOT049 |	I don't know if they're testing
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,439	| IOT049 |	The viability of portability
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,719	| IOT049 |	With this product
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,255	| IOT049 |	To see if that you know has
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,047	| IOT049 |	Is leg somewhere
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:48,447	| IOT049 |	Send me $430 to get basically a Bluetooth speaker with with Amazon voice services
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:48,959	| IOT049 |	A lot of money
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:53,055	| IOT049 |	Nothing I wanted yeah I mean it's all about the portability
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,591	| IOT049 |	I completely agree with you
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,407	| IOT049 |	And I don't think I'm going to changes having to Tap a button
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,687	| IOT049 |	To do voice services
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,223	| IOT049 |	It does take the magic out
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,991	| IOT049 |	What is the
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:05,599	| IOT049 |	Like the magic the coolest thing about the current Echo it's the fact that
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:11,231	| IOT049 |	Anybody who is it within voice range can ask it a question send a command get information
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,303	| IOT049 |	Having to walk over and tap the button I know it sounds like a
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,327	| IOT049 |	First world problems
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:18,655	| IOT049 |	Really that's the magic of the device so
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:25,055	| IOT049 |	I'm a little disappointed this this comes with a little charging puff that you plug in and you set this Amazon tap on tablet
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:25,823	| IOT049 |	Charging pack
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,639	| IOT049 |	And I really thought I think I said in a private show
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,919	| IOT049 |	I really thought
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:32,735	| IOT049 |	Maybe they will enable it so that if it's sitting on the charging
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,575	| IOT049 |	Meaning it's not going to use the internal battery for power
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:40,671	| IOT049 |	Maybe we're having always listening mode it does not from what I can see so far
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,975	| IOT049 |	That could be changing the future but then again
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,559	| IOT049 |	It is called the tap I don't think I'm going to take the path away
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,863	| IOT049 |	Ya don't say anything
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,631	| IOT049 |	Cute app
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,655	| IOT049 |	How do you feel about this
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,959	| IOT049 |	A little device
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,727	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| IOT049 |	I don't know
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,263	| IOT049 |	So that's
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,055	| IOT049 |	I am very curious
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,335	| IOT049 |	Like looks at the tap
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,895	| IOT049 |	That is something I need in my life
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,687	| IOT049 |	Please let us know why
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,271	| IOT049 |	We won't make fun of you really really
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,063	| IOT049 |	Maybe I'll go
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:12,671	| IOT049 |	The voice is Magic
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:20,607	| IOT049 |	Maybe I mean and I totally get the pole portability thing I mean I've always wish I could it was easier to move around the current
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| IOT049 |	Echo that I have
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,679	| IOT049 |	The answer right now is go buy more echoes
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:29,567	| IOT049 |	So this geocache this is another Echo but this can go anywhere in the battery will last for up to 9 hours of playback and
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,871	| IOT049 |	And if it had always on voice
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:36,223	| IOT049 |	Listening then it would last for 9 hours so I totally understand why they're doing it that way
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:39,295	| IOT049 |	It doesn't give you any other features that
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:42,111	| IOT049 |	The existing Echo has other than really portability
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,927	| IOT049 |	Now on to the Amazon
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,231	| IOT049 |	I ordered it
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT049 |	You ordered it
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,767	| IOT049 |	Kevin
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,071	| IOT049 |	I mean the fact is okay it's
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,119	| IOT049 |	It's an Echo - the Maine
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| IOT049 |	Speaker
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,655	| IOT049 |	But
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:57,215	| IOT049 |	I can put several of these around the house
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,775	| IOT049 |	And instead of having to
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:06,175	| IOT049 |	Going to a particular room to use the the echo on you know I can do it throughout my house now it's
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:10,015	| IOT049 |	Adding microphones and stands small speakers in the House Everywhere I Go
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:13,599	| IOT049 |	Be invisible interface that's what I want my house wherever I am in the house if I want
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,879	| IOT049 |	To control the house
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,440	| IOT049 |	Music writer I just want to do what I don't have
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,488	| IOT049 |	I have to go somewhere or Tap a button
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,768	| IOT049 |	Or whatnot so
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,584	| IOT049 |	Doesn't do anything differently but
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,120	| IOT049 |	I just like the idea of
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,168	| IOT049 |	Buying one of these as opposed to
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,448	| IOT049 |	Spending
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:30,496	| IOT049 |	You know double the money for a full
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,264	| IOT049 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,336	| IOT049 |	Also a lot of people really like to use their own speakers
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,872	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,640	| IOT049 |	You can do this
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:43,296	| IOT049 |	You can do that with that since I meant to do that so I like that as well I don't need speakers in every room
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT049 |	Define with
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:48,672	| IOT049 |	Just having a small phone like speaker that can read back anything I ask
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:53,280	| IOT049 |	The echo so I'm fine with that so to me it's just a way to expand my echo ecosystem in the house
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,328	| IOT049 |	At a relatively low cost
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,168	| IOT049 |	Two of those for one Echo
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,936	| IOT049 |	And so
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,216	| IOT049 |	If I cuz I was looking at
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:01,728	| IOT049 |	Buy another
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,896	| IOT049 |	Where is your Echo today where do you think
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:14,528	| IOT049 |	My echo today is about 3 feet from where I'm sitting right now on my second floor home office
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,064	| IOT049 |	Yeah I do have
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:22,720	| IOT049 |	A Fire TV with a voice remote downstairs in one of the base of the family room
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| IOT049 |	So we could do
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,536	| IOT049 |	Things through
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,328	| IOT049 |	Through the voice service through that
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,912	| IOT049 |	I hope I put this closer to the kitchen and the main living room
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,704	| IOT049 |	Because that's where I spend most of our time
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:36,032	| IOT049 |	Will I use an external speaker and play music on it
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,312	| IOT049 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:40,896	| IOT049 |	We're going to have like a Jambox I could always wire to that or Bluetooth it to that
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| IOT049 |	So maybe
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:45,760	| IOT049 |	But it's getting more for informational and smart home control things for me
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,368	| IOT049 |	Wiring it into my receiver in
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,648	| IOT049 |	Sticking
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,416	| IOT049 |	In my living room
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,720	| IOT049 |	And so
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,256	| IOT049 |	But it would go
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| IOT049 |	Over my
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,536	| IOT049 |	My speakers
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:02,400	| IOT049 |	And then I'd have all the home control that we already have and then I've moved
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,424	| IOT049 |	Upstairs
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,728	| IOT049 |	Go to my officer I still want one in the bathroom
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:10,848	| IOT049 |	Do that the places where we are the most are the places where we want to
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:14,688	| IOT049 |	Control the lights that are around us in the rooms around us when I control the thermostat
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:18,784	| IOT049 |	Do you know
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,552	| IOT049 |	This is crazy
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:23,136	| IOT049 |	Is I want I want to just go out while I'm in the shower like Play the song
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,928	| IOT049 |	And I want to know what time it is
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,256	| IOT049 |	Possibly information about like my day or my commute
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,304	| IOT049 |	You know while I'm getting ready
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:31,584	| IOT049 |	So
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,608	| IOT049 |	I don't actually
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,216	| IOT049 |	For my bathroom
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:42,336	| IOT049 |	Which is why my husband thinks I'm crazy for putting something because he thinks of it totally is a home
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,128	| IOT049 |	Echo please flush
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,480	| IOT049 |	Touchless
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,552	| IOT049 |	No no no
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,600	| IOT049 |	Sorry
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,368	| IOT049 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,160	| IOT049 |	I really actually that's one of the
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,720	| IOT049 |	Few places where I wanted to have like a higher-quality
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:03,328	| IOT049 |	That makes sense and as far as the speaker goes
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:06,656	| IOT049 |	You know I have not heard it I mean that we're buying this Sight & Sound on scene
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,728	| IOT049 |	But it basically they do say it includes a built-in speaker
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:14,336	| IOT049 |	So you can use it as a Smart Alarm Clock in the bedroom and assisted in the kitchen etcetera so
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:19,456	| IOT049 |	Don't feel like you must attach speakers to it if you're just going to use it as a voice
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,736	| IOT049 |	Assistant type device
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,040	| IOT049 |	You know it will work
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:26,880	| IOT049 |	It's not mandatory to add speakers to it that would be if you're going to listen to music
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:29,696	| IOT049 |	It's interesting to me because it essentially
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,512	| IOT049 |	This has become similar to my current Android phone which
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,792	| IOT049 |	I can
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:37,632	| IOT049 |	You know a cat by saying OK Google at any time and then perform voice command
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,704	| IOT049 |	And that's always with me so it's very similar in that regard
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:43,776	| IOT049 |	This is so tied into my smart home
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,056	| IOT049 |	System right now that
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,080	| IOT049 |	It just made sense for me to buy
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,360	| IOT049 |	Right
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:50,432	| IOT049 |	So March 31st is when we get ours
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,480	| IOT049 |	What's happening
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:55,808	| IOT049 |	I'm curious if you know it seems to me like they weren't sure this was going to
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:59,392	| IOT049 |	A big hit just yet so they did what they've done before The Limited
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:04,000	| IOT049 |	Who can purchase at 6 women to one unit per order and only 2 per customer
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:07,328	| IOT049 |	And you had to buy a technically had to buy it
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,096	| IOT049 |	Through
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:08,608	| IOT049 |	The echo
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:12,448	| IOT049 |	Set what wax you could through do it you're an Amazon Fire TV as well so
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:14,496	| IOT049 |	I would have things I don't know that you know
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,776	| IOT049 |	Mass-produced
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,056	| IOT049 |	Ginormous run of these
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,592	| IOT049 |	As of yet
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,872	| IOT049 |	It may just be a test
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:20,384	| IOT049 |	That kind of
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,176	| IOT049 |	Amazon
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,248	| IOT049 |	But I did think it was kind of weird
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:27,808	| IOT049 |	Because I'm very curious like with a lot of people
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,088	| IOT049 |	Reading about the ecobee
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,112	| IOT049 |	Successful
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:33,440	| IOT049 |	And now I'm at this tiny little one
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,208	| IOT049 |	Instead
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,280	| IOT049 |	Cuz it is to say it's a nice lower price points so we'll see
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,304	| IOT049 |	And
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,120	| IOT049 |	I don't know why I can't wait
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:45,472	| IOT049 |	Yeah I'm looking for 2 minutes again it doesn't do anything that
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:51,360	| IOT049 |	The current one doesn't do base the right price point and it's an easy way to expand if you would like the Amazon ecosystem
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,944	| IOT049 |	We do
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,712	| IOT049 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| IOT049 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:01,600	| IOT049 |	The only other thing I wanted to talk about first episode about a bill that was introduced to the Senate last
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:02,624	| IOT049 |	End
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:06,976	| IOT049 |	This is just introduced it may not go anywhere but it's worth talking about because
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,536	| IOT049 |	How to get the Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,328	| IOT049 |	Digit bill
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:14,144	| IOT049 |	It's to get the FCC the Federal Communications
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:18,752	| IOT049 |	Commissioned to do a report on and then to regulate The Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,288	| IOT049 |	Which is worth notice
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| IOT049 |	Because
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,896	| IOT049 |	Up until now most of the efforts around iot
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,664	| IOT049 |	I've actually been
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| IOT049 |	Federal Trade Commission
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,248	| IOT049 |	To the FTC
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:31,808	| IOT049 |	And that's been around things like data privacy
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,600	| IOT049 |	And devices
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,112	| IOT049 |	Give that up
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,928	| IOT049 |	So there Ben a couple finds out there
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:40,000	| IOT049 |	Basically on establish laws and then now the f
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,512	| IOT049 |	CC
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:44,352	| IOT049 |	Is saying an innocent been kind of burbling over in Washington
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,632	| IOT049 |	Entities to agencies
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,144	| IOT049 |	Has it been like
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,936	| IOT049 |	Maybe I'll take care of the internet
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:50,752	| IOT049 |	I got it I got I got
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:53,056	| IOT049 |	So this bill
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,336	| IOT049 |	Is basically saying hey
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:56,896	| IOT049 |	Let's give it to the Federal Communications Commission
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,432	| IOT049 |	And it's
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,808	| IOT049 |	It's calling for a working group till like study this
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,576	| IOT049 |	Again
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:08,160	| IOT049 |	And they want the FCC to study whether there's enough Spectrum
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,232	| IOT049 |	Yeah the regulatory barriers that might
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:12,768	| IOT049 |	Exist
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,792	| IOT049 |	Getting more Spectrum
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:17,120	| IOT049 |	Understanding what government
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,704	| IOT049 |	Stakeholder should be involved in any other regulatory processes
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:27,616	| IOT049 |	I think it makes more sense to be with the FCC then with the FTC quite honestly
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,896	| IOT049 |	What does spectrum stuff
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:32,992	| IOT049 |	Yes there is there's a role for the ftce
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:35,808	| IOT049 |	Asking several agencies to get together to
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,856	| IOT049 |	Can a Prius medical reports that will
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,416	| IOT049 |	One day possibly lead to laws
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,720	| IOT049 |	After this one day possibly leads to Allah
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:45,024	| IOT049 |	And those agencies of the Department of
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,048	| IOT049 |	Asportation
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:52,960	| IOT049 |	Tftc the National Science Foundation and the Department of Commerce including at the national telecommunications and information
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,728	| IOT049 |	Administration
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:57,824	| IOT049 |	If this is a little bit different I think then then Pryor
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:00,128	| IOT049 |	Industry efforts to either regulator
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,920	| IOT049 |	Monitor or protect
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| IOT049 |	Citizens and such because
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:07,296	| IOT049 |	IRT is such a broad range of devices and services
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:11,904	| IOT049 |	We talked about car so how do you not have an automobile Regulatory Commission not involved
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,464	| IOT049 |	It may make sense in this case to
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,000	| IOT049 |	As broad collaboration
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,024	| IOT049 |	Between these groups
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,352	| IOT049 |	Security and safety in
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,656	| IOT049 |	How things will work together and so on so
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:29,312	| IOT049 |	I don't have a problem with this I'm not saying that I'm in all four more regulations or anything but
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,592	| IOT049 |	This is something that is
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,896	| IOT049 |	This is literally calling for
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,408	| IOT049 |	A report
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,224	| IOT049 |	Now that I'm for it
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:40,064	| IOT049 |	Make a report it's going to be like
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:46,208	| IOT049 |	I better run along cuz this industry is changing very quickly
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:50,304	| IOT049 |	Very quickly
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:54,400	| IOT049 |	It is so this is the developing Innovation and growing The Internet of Things at
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,240	| IOT049 |	Which I wonder if you come up with a lob
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,032	| IOT049 |	The clever acronyms
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:03,872	| IOT049 |	Probably not
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,944	| IOT049 |	Done
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,736	| IOT049 |	So this is it this is out there
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,016	| IOT049 |	If you guys want to look it up
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,040	| IOT049 |	Go for it
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:11,808	| IOT049 |	Try to follow it
