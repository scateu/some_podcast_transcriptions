EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:28,928	| IOT026 |	It's it's only you well the news
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,720	| IOT026 |	Tuesday morning
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:36,352	| IOT026 |	Quirky the company that owns wink filed for bankruptcy they file for chapter 11 bankruptcy
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:38,144	| IOT026 |	Which means they're trying to restructure
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,424	| IOT026 |	As part of that
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:44,032	| IOT026 |	Agreed to a bid from Flextronics
EDL	00:00:44,032	00:00:45,568	| IOT026 |	Which now goes by Flex
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:49,920	| IOT026 |	To be accepted flexes bid for 15 million
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:50,944	| IOT026 |	For the wink
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,992	| IOT026 |	Home automation subsidiary
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:54,528	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:55,552	| IOT026 |	You may be wondering
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:57,088	| IOT026 |	What does that mean for you
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:01,952	| IOT026 |	Exactly wondering that what does that mean for me not the listeners are near me
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:04,512	| IOT026 |	What does it mean for me if I love my wink
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,304	| IOT026 |	The only one in the world who loves their wing
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:09,632	| IOT026 |	But you know I'm actually running a wink right now so
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:12,192	| IOT026 |	I I wonder what it means for me
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:12,704	| IOT026 |	Running away Inc
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:14,240	| IOT026 |	The answer is
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,008	| IOT026 |	For the neck
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:16,288	| IOT026 |	60 days or so
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,104	| IOT026 |	Your wink should still continue operating
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:22,176	| IOT026 |	What they're going to do as part of the bankruptcy process
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:22,944	| IOT026 |	Flex
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:26,272	| IOT026 |	Has made what is called the stalking horse bid so that means
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:27,040	| IOT026 |	That
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:27,808	| IOT026 |	Quirky
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:29,344	| IOT026 |	Likes flexes bid
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,112	| IOT026 |	The best
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:33,952	| IOT026 |	And if any other bidders come along that offer more money and appear to be
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,488	| IOT026 |	Better for the creditors
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,000	| IOT026 |	End
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:39,072	| IOT026 |	Winks business is an ongoing concern basically
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:45,216	| IOT026 |	The bankruptcy court in the trustees would say Hey you know Flex do you want offer more money otherwise we're to take this other company
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:49,824	| IOT026 |	I don't think that's going to happen they've been trying to sell wink for
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,336	| IOT026 |	4 months
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:56,224	| IOT026 |	Yeah it's it's a numbers problem written up the story when the news broke and
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:02:00,320	| IOT026 |	It sounds like they were between fifty and a hundred billion dollars in debt
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,856	| IOT026 |	AR
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,880	| IOT026 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:06,464	| IOT026 |	So Corky has between 50 and $100 in debt
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:11,584	| IOT026 |	They have between 10 and 50 million in assets when I spoke to Ben Kaufman
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:15,168	| IOT026 |	The CEO the he's now the former CEO of Corky
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,704	| IOT026 |	All the way back
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,728	| IOT026 |	July
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,288	| IOT026 |	He said that 40 had about 2 million
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,336	| IOT026 |	Recite 12 million dollars in cash left
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,664	| IOT026 |	So that's that's not a lot of
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,176	| IOT026 |	Cashland
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:32,832	| IOT026 |	No and according to the bankruptcy filing you had said Flextronics is the biggest predator
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,368	| IOT026 |	They're owed about almost
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:38,976	| IOT026 |	What's 19 million as it is so you know 15 million there just trying to
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,536	| IOT026 |	Recoup as much as I guess as possible and then
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:44,096	| IOT026 |	May they do if they get
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,376	| IOT026 |	The bid accepted
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,984	| IOT026 |	So they get the bid accepted their goal is probably to keep it going as
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,032	| IOT026 |	A legitimate business
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,800	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,336	| IOT026 |	Flextronics
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,128	| IOT026 |	It's actually made the wink hub
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,152	| IOT026 |	4
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| IOT026 |	Cricket
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,944	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,224	| IOT026 |	It behooves them
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,040	| IOT026 |	Actually keep it operating for a couple reasons
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:07,904	| IOT026 |	One there's all these wink Hub still out there on the shelves in the relays
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,976	| IOT026 |	And then there's a whole ecosystem of devices and partner
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,512	| IOT026 |	It also
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,048	| IOT026 |	Are Flextronics
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:19,168	| IOT026 |	Text customers to be quite honest their contract manufacturer
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,192	| IOT026 |	They also
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,752	| IOT026 |	Work with startups through their lab 9 division
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,056	| IOT026 |	Building a lot of connected products
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,336	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,408	| IOT026 |	Having a big black eye in
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,944	| IOT026 |	In terms of wink failing and
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,968	| IOT026 |	These Partnerships
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,480	| IOT026 |	Integrations
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:33,760	| IOT026 |	Mine is probably not in there
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,088	| IOT026 |	Keep this going and maybe
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,160	| IOT026 |	Maybe turn the business around for Wink in terms of
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,720	| IOT026 |	Continuing to sell products Maybe
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,560	| IOT026 |	Can you sell the other Wing products that are on the shelves and
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,096	| IOT026 |	Recoup some of that money that would be great for the
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,144	| IOT026 |	Yeah well I mean that's
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:56,544	| IOT026 |	From a consumer standpoint of me and you might be might be able to get a deal on the wing Hardware in the near future
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,336	| IOT026 |	But you don't know what it's future is of course
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,360	| IOT026 |	Right
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,432	| IOT026 |	And so I sat there and I emailed
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,224	| IOT026 |	I'm a wing spokesman and he
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| IOT026 |	He said
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,832	| IOT026 |	Quote this does not impact how users experience wing
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,392	| IOT026 |	And they will continue to receive the same support
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,672	| IOT026 |	After the process
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,184	| IOT026 |	This is finally
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:17,536	| IOT026 |	So that implies that after the 60-day period for the bankruptcy
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,071	| IOT026 |	Proceedings is over
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:22,143	| IOT026 |	That Wing is going to continue as a going business
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| IOT026 |	That's My Hope
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,471	| IOT026 |	I'm going to
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:31,615	| IOT026 |	I've also reached out to a bunch of the wink partners because wink has these Partnerships with Lutron
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:35,199	| IOT026 |	What's Philips with Amazon with ramberlyn with nest
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,271	| IOT026 |	All these companies that have these Integrations in
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:42,367	| IOT026 |	That's actually why I'm still using my wink is because it
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,391	| IOT026 |	It has these relationships
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,975	| IOT026 |	I depend on his part of my home automation scheme so
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,255	| IOT026 |	My Hope
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,327	| IOT026 |	Is that all these companies are like yes this is a
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,119	| IOT026 |	The setback but we love working with wink
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,399	| IOT026 |	Love it
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:59,007	| IOT026 |	Blah blah blah Kevin tofel is a fanboy we will continue to support Wii
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,823	| IOT026 |	So here's a question
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| IOT026 |	Yes or no we don't take into detail
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:07,199	| IOT026 |	Have you talked to the SmartThings people about this
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:12,063	| IOT026 |	Not talk to anyone I have Ivory shout at this point to a lot of pee
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,343	| IOT026 |	Chia
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,367	| IOT026 |	Cluding smart
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,415	| IOT026 |	7
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:16,927	| IOT026 |	Secrets
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,231	| IOT026 |	I mean if I had my wish
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| IOT026 |	Would be like some
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,535	| IOT026 |	Other established
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,839	| IOT026 |	Company that's already in the space
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,887	| IOT026 |	Kind of absorb it and continue it
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:29,215	| IOT026 |	Or some iot Consortium of companies say
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,031	| IOT026 |	We decided all together let's just work together and
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:36,127	| IOT026 |	On a platform Hammer build off of this I don't think that's going to happen that's high in the sky but
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,175	| IOT026 |	But smart things I could
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:41,503	| IOT026 |	CEO Samsung Maybe
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,039	| IOT026 |	So here's the irony
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,063	| IOT026 |	Irony alert
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,087	| IOT026 |	I know I'm like
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,647	| IOT026 |	When we say that there should be like a red flashing light
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,183	| IOT026 |	That would be awesome
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,023	| IOT026 |	Yeah my lights just flash dreads
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,535	| IOT026 |	There you go
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:58,143	| IOT026 |	So we were going to talk to Kevin and I were going to talk about this actually last week on our
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,935	| IOT026 |	Show who should buy wink
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,215	| IOT026 |	Because to me it's like this
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,543	| IOT026 |	Sad asset running around out there and I could very nervous about would happen
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:10,943	| IOT026 |	So I was going to go with Amazon because I had talked to sources who is said that Amazon had looked at when can the
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,247	| IOT026 |	Then backed off because of the security glitch way back in
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,783	| IOT026 |	And I thought
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,319	| IOT026 |	With
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,599	| IOT026 |	The integration with Alexa
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:23,231	| IOT026 |	I'm sorry everybody who's who trying to call you. Just went off I apologize
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:29,631	| IOT026 |	So with the integration with the Amazon Echo I thought that would be a really nice kind of software platform
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,447	| IOT026 |	It would bring a lot of really interesting functionality to Amazon
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:39,359	| IOT026 |	And I don't disagree with you but I don't know that Amazon wants to be that player in this market I think they're high
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,639	| IOT026 |	Happy being
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:44,479	| IOT026 |	An interface that connects then a gazillion different things
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,271	| IOT026 |	The week is kind of that's what we wants to
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,855	| IOT026 |	I absolutely princess switch
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| IOT026 |	I mean it
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,439	| IOT026 |	The echo ADS-B
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,743	| IOT026 |	Voice functionality but I don't see a real big dipper
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:56,767	| IOT026 |	Is there really
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:57,791	| IOT026 |	Turn off
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,119	| IOT026 |	I don't want to disagree with you
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:07,519	| IOT026 |	But I'm going to subtly disagree with
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,287	| IOT026 |	You are
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,847	| IOT026 |	Another surprise to me
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,687	| IOT026 |	You obviously knew this but I did not get the third largest creditor for Corky
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:15,967	| IOT026 |	Is UPS
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,759	| IOT026 |	You know
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,319	| IOT026 |	I was looking at that you know I saw that would be
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:24,671	| IOT026 |	Why because do you remember again that security glitch back in May
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:30,559	| IOT026 |	What happened was they basically bricked all their devices with a upgrade
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,095	| IOT026 |	A certificate upgrade
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,887	| IOT026 |	So if your device was
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| IOT026 |	Sprint
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| IOT026 |	WinCo
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,447	| IOT026 |	Let you
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,727	| IOT026 |	Ship your device
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:42,591	| IOT026 |	Back to them on their dime and then shipped it back to you after they reset it
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,151	| IOT026 |	What was kind of funny is all
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,967	| IOT026 |	But I shouldn't say all you had to do was
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,039	| IOT026 |	Basically go to your router and reset the DNS
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:54,879	| IOT026 |	And then upgrade the device and then turn your DNS settings back
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,951	| IOT026 |	That is not something everybody knows how to do and totally understand
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:04,095	| IOT026 |	Yes but they did put up a website and let you in told you how to do it and it wasn't it wasn't terribly intimidate
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,167	| IOT026 |	As things go but
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,959	| IOT026 |	Apparently a lot of people took
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,727	| IOT026 |	Come up on that offer
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:13,055	| IOT026 |	And I think that's probably what that
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,591	| IOT026 |	That UPS bill is
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,151	| IOT026 |	1.3 million dollars who am I
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| IOT026 |	If you know there's
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,967	| IOT026 |	I got a lot of brown trucks
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,015	| IOT026 |	Welder shipping also
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,039	| IOT026 |	Product
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:27,903	| IOT026 |	Yeah they're in that there's there's actually some of the other creditors in there
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,183	| IOT026 |	Where are shipping related
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| IOT026 |	As well
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,719	| IOT026 |	Zodiac
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,511	| IOT026 |	DL Industrial
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,815	| IOT026 |	Oh I'm sorry Eastfield
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| IOT026 |	Lighting
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT026 |	Is actually a
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,631	| IOT026 |	Asian
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:38,655	| IOT026 |	Shipper
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:45,311	| IOT026 |	So I thought having been Kauffman who is the CEO of quirky on there as a creditor
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,383	| IOT026 |	Is an unsecured creditor was really interesting as well
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,919	| IOT026 |	That seems very rare
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,015	| IOT026 |	Later on in the list is also a former president
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,527	| IOT026 |	Calf Corky
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,807	| IOT026 |	Who is listed
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,647	| IOT026 |	I hate to see it all kidding aside
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:05,023	| IOT026 |	The wing is actually works really well for me and I know other people have had different experiences I totally understand that
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,839	| IOT026 |	It's my Hub of choice right now
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,607	| IOT026 |	And I guess
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:15,263	| IOT026 |	Going out on a limb I mean if I was going to buy a house right now I guess I probably would not buy a wink Hub because the Futures on sir
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| IOT026 |	So which one would I buy
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,383	| IOT026 |	I'm glad you asked
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| IOT026 |	I am in the same boat
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,479	| IOT026 |	Because
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,015	| IOT026 |	There are things that I
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,575	| IOT026 |	What the wink Hub has offered me
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,879	| IOT026 |	Is Lutron support
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,439	| IOT026 |	Switch not a lot of other
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:33,951	| IOT026 |	Jobs offer
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:40,351	| IOT026 |	That has been kind of killer for me because SmartThings would be my automatic
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,399	| IOT026 |	I was put back to smart
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,471	| IOT026 |	Thanks so if you're like me and you have Lutron support
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,775	| IOT026 |	Dang it I love Lutron
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,103	| IOT026 |	Your your other options are going to be
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| IOT026 |	The Staples connect
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| IOT026 |	Hub
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,455	| IOT026 |	Which does have Lutron support
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,759	| IOT026 |	Or you can go with the honk
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT026 |	Support
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,575	| IOT026 |	If you're a big Apple user
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:04,927	| IOT026 |	What homekit support
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| IOT026 |	You're going to
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| IOT026 |	When does 60 days are up and we don't know what's
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,071	| IOT026 |	If we if everything goes to hell
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,375	| IOT026 |	Then you know you can see
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,143	| IOT026 |	But
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,167	| IOT026 |	If all else fails
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,703	| IOT026 |	Tomcat will have
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,471	| IOT026 |	Lutron set
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,263	| IOT026 |	Plus other devices
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,079	| IOT026 |	Or you can do Staples connect
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| IOT026 |	And they have Lutron
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,383	| IOT026 |	Plus other device
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,687	| IOT026 |	Not exit the devices don't match up
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| IOT026 |	Like device-to-device
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,271	| IOT026 |	Write the other option
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,831	| IOT026 |	Like Staples connect doesn't have
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,623	| IOT026 |	An Amazon Echo support
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,743	| IOT026 |	Is Amazon Echo is the most important item
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,559	| IOT026 |	SmartThings SmartThings is you're going
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,071	| IOT026 |	Have your back
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,607	| IOT026 |	And I
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,911	| IOT026 |	I've told the Lucian people I beg to them
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,447	| IOT026 |	How to get me a Lutron dongle
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,519	| IOT026 |	So we can just plug that into the back of SmartThings
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,079	| IOT026 |	I don't know if that's going to happen or not
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,175	| IOT026 |	Well we will have to say I'm already on the SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:01,503	| IOT026 |	Page 99 bucks I'm not buying anything right this second
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,015	| IOT026 |	But
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,831	| IOT026 |	I'm going to have to have a backup plan
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,903	| IOT026 |	And it's going to SmartThings as a good backup because
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| IOT026 |	This is a good Segway
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:12,511	| IOT026 |	It the nest 2nd generation hub
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:16,863	| IOT026 |	Has Intelligence built into the Hub so not everything is cloud Reliant
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| IOT026 |	And I know
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,983	| IOT026 |	Yeah because well we know why because
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,591	| IOT026 |	It was the cloud you lose your smart on basically and that is pretty much exactly what happened this week
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,615	| IOT026 |	Again
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| IOT026 |	This time
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| IOT026 |	Instead of Ness going down
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,223	| IOT026 |	Although I did hear that Nest may have
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,247	| IOT026 |	Have had some issues to
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,527	| IOT026 |	What happened was
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,063	| IOT026 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| IOT026 |	Web services
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,415	| IOT026 |	AWS
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,207	| IOT026 |	When is happens there people in the
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,231	| IOT026 |	Community Grill
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:49,631	| IOT026 |	What so many people use Amazon web services because it's so inexpensive
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,423	| IOT026 |	It is and it's
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:53,727	| IOT026 |	It's actually quite reliable
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:57,055	| IOT026 |	Except except for the Ashburn Virginia Data Center
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| IOT026 |	That that thing I don't know what's
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,127	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| IOT026 |	What is brought home to me
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| IOT026 |	You probably were sitting there going up
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,247	| IOT026 |	Everything in the cloud
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,295	| IOT026 |	It's bad there was there was an override
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,831	| IOT026 |	I believe on CD
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,111	| IOT026 |	I'm sorry Kevin
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,159	| IOT026 |	Picking on your site that's okay
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,695	| IOT026 |	There is a gentleman who is
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,719	| IOT026 |	My Amazon
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:17,023	| IOT026 |	Echo went haywire it caused Mayhem
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:24,191	| IOT026 |	And the Mayhem I saw was that basically his dog woke up at 5 in the morning and you can turn on the
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| IOT026 |	Light switches Echo
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:28,031	| IOT026 |	Yeah I mean okay to get used to a certain
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,823	| IOT026 |	Convenience factor in Holiday
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:34,175	| IOT026 |	I guess you could construed as Mayhem but no I was inconvenience that very night because
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:39,807	| IOT026 |	My echo will not play music or controlling my lights either so Ed Sheeran
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,831	| IOT026 |	Hit the light switch so
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,135	| IOT026 |	Mayhem it was not for me
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,159	| IOT026 |	We had the same issue
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,463	| IOT026 |	Mayhem was not the word I chose
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,071	| IOT026 |	I was like what the heck is happening was the extent of my
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,631	| IOT026 |	But since
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,703	| IOT026 |	Since mine is kind of sometimes not working I just assumed it was
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,751	| IOT026 |	Ghost in the machine kind of thing
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:07,455	| IOT026 |	Leslie Cloud Reliance for The Internet of Things it actually got me thinking about how many services actually run on Amazon
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,247	| IOT026 |	Because a lot of them do
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,783	| IOT026 |	And if not
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,575	| IOT026 |	The winged Cloud runs on Amazon
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| IOT026 |	Obviously
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,647	| IOT026 |	The echo has Timberland sunny
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,415	| IOT026 |	Amazon
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,439	| IOT026 |	But a lot of
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,975	| IOT026 |	Even Cloud products like
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:21,279	| IOT026 |	Electric imp which provides the
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,863	| IOT026 |	Connectivity + cloud services for things like
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,935	| IOT026 |	The rachio sprinkler head they actually run
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,215	| IOT026 |	On Amazon
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,519	| IOT026 |	They now offer an on-premise device but
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,359	| IOT026 |	Ala which is kind of it more of an industrial
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,175	| IOT026 |	Cloud provider also runs on Amazon
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,199	| IOT026 |	And the list goes on
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,807	| IOT026 |	I used to I used to track which once ran on Amazon and which didn't but
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,855	| IOT026 |	It became kind of silly because most
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,879	| IOT026 |	Devices actually
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:52,767	| IOT026 |	Amazon so that's one of those problems that people don't really talk about I mean everyone kind of acknowledges
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,399	| IOT026 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:58,911	| IOT026 |	I mean
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,983	| IOT026 |	They that got built-in redundancy and
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,799	| IOT026 |	Your data centers all over but it mean when they have something that
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,847	| IOT026 |	XM widespread level
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:12,991	| IOT026 |	The only redundancy that you could have in places have your service is running on a separate companies cloud and that's expensive
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:17,855	| IOT026 |	Batman you fall back issues and someone
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,135	| IOT026 |	Text for 2DS
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,695	| IOT026 |	You're another company's Cloud doesn't look
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,279	| IOT026 |	Quite like Amazon's cloud and it's not like you can actually architect
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,815	| IOT026 |	A Wonder one solution have
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,351	| IOT026 |	Optimized
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:31,423	| IOT026 |	So I totally get it. But we've said this
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,751	| IOT026 |	I think probably for the last two episodes in a row
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,823	| IOT026 |	Having IRT solar line upon the cloud
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:38,847	| IOT026 |	Brings
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,639	| IOT026 |	Challenges and
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:44,223	| IOT026 |	I still keep going by right before the show we were talking about the hubs
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:49,343	| IOT026 |	Because my favorite husband all that actually might the do-it-yourself insteon Hub that I ran here in my house
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,903	| IOT026 |	Not connect to the cloud but everything here
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,695	| IOT026 |	Was running on a headless server
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:58,047	| IOT026 |	That's it I thought you know I didn't worry about Amazon web services or anybody else's cloud
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,071	| IOT026 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| IOT026 |	So like the cloud
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,167	| IOT026 |	That were proselytizing
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,191	| IOT026 |	We have become
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,959	| IOT026 |	Redundant
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,079	| IOT026 |	My lights just went red again
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,871	| IOT026 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,639	| IOT026 |	Yes I sure like
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,759	| IOT026 |	We're not going to talk more about this
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,551	| IOT026 |	Because there's really nothing more to say so
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:22,111	| IOT026 |	Since neither of us are offering a service nor can we really
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,903	| IOT026 |	I really can't think of an option
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,695	| IOT026 |	They helps people
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,999	| IOT026 |	But if you guys listeners have an option
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,791	| IOT026 |	I'd like to know about it
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,071	| IOT026 |	Because this is
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| IOT026 |	This is a continuing problem
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,679	| IOT026 |	You did actually given option of that was
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,263	| IOT026 |	At least I consider the SmartThings Hub which the new one does have some
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,567	| IOT026 |	Smart's new logo
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,103	| IOT026 |	In case the cloud is not excessive
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:47,455	| IOT026 |	You know the Amazon Echo has some smarts local
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:48,991	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,015	| IOT026 |	You know I think
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:52,575	| IOT026 |	Your counterpart is eating at talked about
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,623	| IOT026 |	The alarm is being said inside
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| IOT026 |	The echo
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,463	| IOT026 |	What are some local stops yeah yeah
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,487	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,791	| IOT026 |	Hybrid
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,351	| IOT026 |	There's a hybrid approach but you know no one is going to be
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT026 |	No one is happy when their stuff is
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,703	| IOT026 |	You're always going to want that
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,519	| IOT026 |	Always
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,031	| IOT026 |	You know it's like
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:15,615	| IOT026 |	Unless unless you're like in a life-or-death situation
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,919	| IOT026 |	And you're kind of stupid thing is you don't see the cloud
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,431	| IOT026 |	Right you know it
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,247	| IOT026 |	It's like when your power goes out in your
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,527	| IOT026 |	Curses power
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,063	| IOT026 |	You know your
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,087	| IOT026 |	Like my only income
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:27,647	| IOT026 |	Convenience food like in the middle of a hurricane or something are like
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,207	| IOT026 |	Volcano the power's out but
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,231	| IOT026 |	But at least I have
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| IOT026 |	My family
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,791	| IOT026 |	We're safe but this is not that
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,839	| IOT026 |	This is like
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:38,399	| IOT026 |	I have to get up to turn my lights lavender Ahab
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,447	| IOT026 |	I don't know where I go
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:41,983	| IOT026 |	Let's talk about smart
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,031	| IOT026 |	Let's talk about presents
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,055	| IOT026 |	Because
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,079	| IOT026 |	Did you get me presents
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,407	| IOT026 |	Oh wait what kind of presents
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:53,247	| IOT026 |	I cooked I got the smart plugs
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,527	| IOT026 |	It's from a company called zuly
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:55,807	| IOT026 |	And
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,855	| IOT026 |	I got to tell you Kevin we have talked about
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:01,695	| IOT026 |	Presence and Bluetooth for god it feels like years
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,231	| IOT026 |	Trevor
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| IOT026 |	And
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,303	| IOT026 |	Now that I finally tried them
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,839	| IOT026 |	You like it don't you
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:11,935	| IOT026 |	I do like it but I'm also like once again this is so hard for me
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:17,055	| IOT026 |	Right it's like Christmas where you're like Christmas is Christmas and then Christmas comes in your like
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,871	| IOT026 |	Okay well yeah that was
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,151	| IOT026 |	I guess yeah that was cool
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,711	| IOT026 |	Which makes me feel like a little ungrateful
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,759	| IOT026 |	So silly in this
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,783	| IOT026 |	Julie is fine
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,063	| IOT026 |	Julie makes the smart plug
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,391	| IOT026 |	They sell for $160 for a 3-pack
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,951	| IOT026 |	Which is what you're going to need to actually do presence in your home
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,999	| IOT026 |	Or $60 for
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:36,767	| IOT026 |	Single
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,279	| IOT026 |	Smart plug
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,559	| IOT026 |	They're beautiful
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:42,911	| IOT026 |	They plug into any outlet and turn it into
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,191	| IOT026 |	A smart outlet
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,983	| IOT026 |	You can plug
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:49,055	| IOT026 |	Any Appliance into it if you plug the lamp into it it turns into a dimmer
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,847	| IOT026 |	It also measures
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,639	| IOT026 |	Energy usage
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,175	| IOT026 |	It can do scheduling
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,943	| IOT026 |	It can
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,479	| IOT026 |	Let's see what else
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,783	| IOT026 |	Measures my carbon footprint for that device
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:02,111	| IOT026 |	And almost sounds like the
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:04,159	| IOT026 |	WeMo Insight switch that you had sent me
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,951	| IOT026 |	Yes and that is also 6
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,255	| IOT026 |	So if you were looking at both of these
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,023	| IOT026 |	Is senior like
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,559	| IOT026 |	I really want a smart outlet
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,839	| IOT026 |	That does some cool things
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,887	| IOT026 |	You know I might
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,167	| IOT026 |	Recommend you do
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,959	| IOT026 |	The Soule because you're going to get the
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:20,031	| IOT026 |	On off capabilities you're going to get the
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:23,103	| IOT026 |	Energy consumption but you're also give me the ability to dim a light
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,895	| IOT026 |	I don't believe the inside
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,199	| IOT026 |	I think you are correct on that one
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| IOT026 |	But
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,271	| IOT026 |	For the time being
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,551	| IOT026 |	This is only iOS
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,367	| IOT026 |	So iOS only for now Android is coming later
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,647	| IOT026 |	I don't know about
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:41,279	| IOT026 |	So the big deal about the three packets besides saving yourself a little money
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,839	| IOT026 |	If you have three or more of these they
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:49,215	| IOT026 |	Use Bluetooth to triangulate your presence your location in your home provide it and I said this
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,799	| IOT026 |	Between years ago provided you have your phone on you
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:58,431	| IOT026 |	Yes and I know when we talked about this way back you're like when I don't want to carry my phone everywhere
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,711	| IOT026 |	But I bet you're doing it now aren't you
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,735	| IOT026 |	A little boy
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,831	| IOT026 |	Here goes okay so here is
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,855	| IOT026 |	Here's was Julius
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,647	| IOT026 |	Zulia selling presents
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:12,255	| IOT026 |	And they're selling it tied to Bluetooth on your phone so yes you do have to take your phone with you
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,815	| IOT026 |	Which I kind of lose because I don't always have pockets
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,375	| IOT026 |	But if I take my phone with me
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,399	| IOT026 |	Here's what I
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| IOT026 |	I can walk into a room
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,007	| IOT026 |	And theoretically the lights will turn on
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,567	| IOT026 |	In the lamp that I have plugged
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,079	| IOT026 |	Into the zoo
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,359	| IOT026 |	It will turn on when I in
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,151	| IOT026 |	And that is actually pretty
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| IOT026 |	So I'm walking through my house and it's like
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,015	| IOT026 |	The lights turn on
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| IOT026 |	The TV turns on
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,135	| IOT026 |	Vistaprint
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:44,767	| IOT026 |	Do the lights turn off when you leave the room so yes
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,839	| IOT026 |	I accepted into our bedside table lamp
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:51,167	| IOT026 |	And her master bedroom is actually my husband's bedside table lamp because
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:54,239	| IOT026 |	Mine is already plugged into a different smart lamp setup
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:58,847	| IOT026 |	But his was set so five minutes after I leave the room with my phone
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,895	| IOT026 |	That it will turn off
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:06,015	| IOT026 |	And DUI on this is really nice so when you're actually setting that up it warns you it says
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:10,367	| IOT026 |	By the way when you do this you could be leaving other people in the dark
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,159	| IOT026 |	Do you still want to do it
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,463	| IOT026 |	That's nice I really did think that was a nice
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,023	| IOT026 |	Yes I do in my
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:18,559	| IOT026 |	Thanks a lot
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,351	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| IOT026 |	Yes I did
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,399	| IOT026 |	And
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,191	| IOT026 |	When I left with my phone
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,215	| IOT026 |	Boom
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:26,751	| IOT026 |	It turned off
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,287	| IOT026 |	Actually
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:28,799	| IOT026 |	Once again
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,079	| IOT026 |	Nice
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,103	| IOT026 |	I did find
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,151	| IOT026 |	If I left
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,919	| IOT026 |	The room
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| IOT026 |	But I didn't go into a room
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,271	| IOT026 |	That had a Zulily
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:38,783	| IOT026 |	Outlet
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:41,343	| IOT026 |	Didn't always turn off
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,391	| IOT026 |	It was a little hit or miss
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:50,303	| IOT026 |	And that's because it's it's basically figuring out which one of the Zulus are closest to with your Bluetooth ready
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,607	| IOT026 |	When your phone so again triangulation and
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,655	| IOT026 |	It's not going to be super super precise
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,447	| IOT026 |	Because of that it is my desk
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| IOT026 |	Right so if I
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,775	| IOT026 |	If I went out of the master bedroom
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:03,615	| IOT026 |	Into like the office where there is another Zully and then I went someplace else
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:07,199	| IOT026 |	Then the light would turn off but if I went for my master bedroom down into light
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| IOT026 |	Like a living room where there was no end
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,783	| IOT026 |	I bypassed all the others ulis
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,807	| IOT026 |	Yep it was just like
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:17,440	| IOT026 |	Because you're still closest to that one or yeah just doesn't know where you are at that point
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:25,376	| IOT026 |	I was like oh I guess I need to buy more of these two really cover my house I was just going to say you pretty much want one in like every room
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,192	| IOT026 |	Room that's one thing so here's the other thing about living
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,496	| IOT026 |	It integrates with the net
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:34,080	| IOT026 |	I can't tell if this is a great thing or not a great thing
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:38,176	| IOT026 |	So I think I need more granular controls but for most people they're going to probably
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,736	| IOT026 |	So you know how
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:44,064	| IOT026 |	Most people have their nests someplace out of the way and sometimes you're like
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:47,904	| IOT026 |	In a room and suddenly realize your nest is decided that you're away from home
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,952	| IOT026 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,000	| IOT026 |	All the time all the time
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,792	| IOT026 |	So this integrates with the nest already
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,840	| IOT026 |	And this would stop that
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,632	| IOT026 |	Because if you stick the smart plug
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,168	| IOT026 |	In there
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,728	| IOT026 |	In that room that you're in most the time with your phone
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,032	| IOT026 |	It'll just be like your nest
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:04,544	| IOT026 |	She's here
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,824	| IOT026 |	Don't go away
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:11,712	| IOT026 |	So these can act as basically external sensors for an ass which is very nice
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,992	| IOT026 |	It is except
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,296	| IOT026 |	I have my Nest upstairs
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,832	| IOT026 |	And when I go downstairs
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,368	| IOT026 |	I actually like that my nest
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:18,880	| IOT026 |	Turn off
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,720	| IOT026 |	So I was kind of like oh
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| IOT026 |	I kind of wish I could turn my
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:28,864	| IOT026 |	Downstairs sensors off since I got a downstairs and upstairs thermostat
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,168	| IOT026 |	I wish that I could turn my downstairs
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,936	| IOT026 |	Sensors
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,472	| IOT026 |	Zulys off for the nest
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,288	| IOT026 |	Which is
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:38,080	| IOT026 |	Maybe a little more complicated
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:41,152	| IOT026 |	But I'd kind of like to see that in an update because I think that would be
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,432	| IOT026 |	Nice to have later
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:46,784	| IOT026 |	Totally agree you and your tell me about these before the show
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:49,088	| IOT026 |	You mentioned something about the battery life on your phone
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:51,136	| IOT026 |	Yes and this is the final day
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:55,488	| IOT026 |	I noticed and I install these on my iPhone
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,000	| IOT026 |	Because
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:23:00,352	| IOT026 |	I didn't have the Android app yet and I don't use my iPhone
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,144	| IOT026 |	It's my work phone
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,168	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,728	| IOT026 |	I noticed it until usually I
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:09,056	| IOT026 |	Don't charge my charge my work phone once every four days or so
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,104	| IOT026 |	But this guy
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,152	| IOT026 |	Running this app I would go through
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,688	| IOT026 |	The battery like once a day
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:17,248	| IOT026 |	And this app uses the battery
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,552	| IOT026 |	2/3 at the bat
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:23,648	| IOT026 |	Yeah we went into the battery settings on your phone
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:27,232	| IOT026 |	Right before the show and took a look to see which apps are using the battery the most
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,048	| IOT026 |	And it was nearly two-thirds of the usage
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,864	| IOT026 |	Was from the zulia
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:37,728	| IOT026 |	And that's kind of concerning to me I know it's using bluetooth smart and it should be low power and all but
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:42,336	| IOT026 |	The app is probably constantly looking for the smart plugs
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:45,408	| IOT026 |	Even when you're not at home as my guest but there may be some
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:48,992	| IOT026 |	Some geofencing involve are that alleviates that I don't know
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,528	| IOT026 |	There's a whole lot of pinion going
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,856	| IOT026 |	Yeah now I don't know if it
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:58,208	| IOT026 |	So this is the question does it use geofencing to notice when I'm away from home
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,720	| IOT026 |	How to turn off the
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,024	| IOT026 |	Cuz I'm a little weird as a tester
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,048	| IOT026 |	I work from home
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:06,656	| IOT026 |	Right so it's people who were home you know
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,472	| IOT026 |	Not working at home but we're out all day
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,288	| IOT026 |	Maybe it stops paying for them
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:17,664	| IOT026 |	The app would have to know that I only know to know that I would it would need to be in a GPS or Wi-Fi or some other
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:18,944	| IOT026 |	Some other way
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,760	| IOT026 |	I'm going to suspect not it's just a guess on my part
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,784	| IOT026 |	It dogs location
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:23,808	| IOT026 |	It does ask
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:28,416	| IOT026 |	Maybe maybe
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,464	| IOT026 |	It is asking for that permission
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:38,656	| IOT026 |	You're going to have to go work in a coffee shop for 8 hours and then see if it still use 2/3 of the battery usage at that point because that's
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,704	| IOT026 |	The only way I think to find out unless the company
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,472	| IOT026 |	You know
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,240	| IOT026 |	Tell you for sure
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,520	| IOT026 |	Potato
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,312	| IOT026 |	It is going to Ping a lot because it's
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:50,688	| IOT026 |	Constantly checking to see how far it is away nachos from one Zulily
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,968	| IOT026 |	But for multiples awais
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,552	| IOT026 |	In the final wish list I would have for the Zulu
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:25:00,672	| IOT026 |	Right now I can't use the presents for anything other than the zoo lease
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:03,488	| IOT026 |	Really want to use the present
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,536	| IOT026 |	Send Taylor the CEO of Zulily
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,840	| IOT026 |	Said that they're working on
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,632	| IOT026 |	But I really want to use like
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,192	| IOT026 |	Azuli presents isn't if this then that
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,496	| IOT026 |	2
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,520	| IOT026 |	Trigger other thing
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,032	| IOT026 |	Thanks because
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,080	| IOT026 |	Yeah my lights
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,104	| IOT026 |	Are not lamps
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,384	| IOT026 |	So the fact that it's
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,152	| IOT026 |	Plugged in
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,920	| IOT026 |	Devices
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,944	| IOT026 |	This is very limiting to
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,968	| IOT026 |	Tell me where is I want to be like
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,528	| IOT026 |	Yo when I step into this
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,808	| IOT026 |	Broom I want my
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,088	| IOT026 |	Lutron lights to
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,624	| IOT026 |	Turn on my Philips Hue Lights to turn on
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,952	| IOT026 |	So that's the next stage of zulia
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:38,816	| IOT026 |	You know after they work on the battery issues and after they possibly give me granular
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,864	| IOT026 |	Controls may be before the grid
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:44,448	| IOT026 |	I wonder if they're even considering
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,472	| IOT026 |	A second product
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:49,568	| IOT026 |	That would be less limiting to you and that would be easily smart switches
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,360	| IOT026 |	CNY
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:55,200	| IOT026 |	As we've discussed which is all the switches are hard for people cuz no one wants to install switches
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:55,968	| IOT026 |	Everyone's afraid of life
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:59,808	| IOT026 |	They should be
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,600	| IOT026 |	But afraid of
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:06,720	| IOT026 |	Before we had all these connected bulbs which is arguably much simpler to install
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,536	| IOT026 |	You know all the insteon stuff I have we're all smart switches
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,328	| IOT026 |	Redid mosto switches in my house
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,864	| IOT026 |	I'm with you that I've
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,376	| IOT026 |	Redid motion
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,912	| IOT026 |	We are in the process of
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,424	| IOT026 |	Redoing most of
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,496	| IOT026 |	Lutron
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,800	| IOT026 |	Now I'm feeling like
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:23,616	| IOT026 |	Oh no that's why I'm Like Glue Sean give me a dog
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:26,432	| IOT026 |	Please maybe I can build my own
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:31,552	| IOT026 |	I still like a radio from inside a Lutron or Pico and see what I can hack together
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,320	| IOT026 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,344	| IOT026 |	Hello
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:40,000	| IOT026 |	Well we have talked a lot about a lot of things some good some bad we've made some good recommendations for people
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:42,304	| IOT026 |	And now it is time for us to take a
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:44,864	| IOT026 |	Quick interlude quick musical interlude
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:48,192	| IOT026 |	And then stay tuned for a guest who is liat ben-zur
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:54,592	| IOT026 |	She's with Philips digital health and she is going to discuss Aging in place and how the internet of things can help with
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:27:00,992	| IOT026 |	Fat and change Healthcare
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:06,112	| IOT026 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things show this is Stacey Higginbotham and today I have is my guest
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,648	| IOT026 |	Liat ben-zur
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,696	| IOT026 |	Who is the Senior Vice-President of
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| IOT026 |	Connected
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:13,280	| IOT026 |	Digital propositions for Royal Philips
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| IOT026 |	Hailey. How are you doing
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:20,192	| IOT026 |	Hey Stacy I'm doing great thanks for having me I'm so excited you are here to talk about something that is
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:22,752	| IOT026 |	Actually really important which is
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:27,104	| IOT026 |	How we can use the internet of things to improve Elderly Care
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:29,664	| IOT026 |	And kind of the concept of Aging in place so
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,456	| IOT026 |	I'm super excited to have you here
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:35,296	| IOT026 |	So first off let's set the standard width
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:36,832	| IOT026 |	Phillips
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,904	| IOT026 |	You are right now part of the same company that makes the
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:42,976	| IOT026 |	Philips hue light bulbs but that is not the case for much longer
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,744	| IOT026 |	Correct
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:44,512	| IOT026 |	That's correct
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:49,120	| IOT026 |	We're actually splitting off of the lighting business by the end of this year
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,912	| IOT026 |	Alright so
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:57,312	| IOT026 |	Let's get started with kind of this concept because everybody much everyone's aware of the demographic Trends happening
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,080	| IOT026 |	Which is
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| IOT026 |	They're about to be a lot of
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,152	| IOT026 |	Older people and
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,688	| IOT026 |	We're kind of concerned about
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:05,248	| IOT026 |	How we're going to care for so many aging people
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:07,040	| IOT026 |	With the resources that we have
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:12,160	| IOT026 |	And there's a lot of opportunity for The Internet of Things even if it's something as simple as
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,720	| IOT026 |	It'll caring for your parents and
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:17,792	| IOT026 |	Having the ability to put sensors in their home in it
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:20,096	| IOT026 |	Non hopefully surveillance kind of way
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,376	| IOT026 |	Just make sure they're okay
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,656	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:25,984	| IOT026 |	You guys have created actually I think it was about two months ago
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,264	| IOT026 |	Have a think tank
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:27,776	| IOT026 |	4
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,592	| IOT026 |	How to innovate around Elder Care
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,360	| IOT026 |	Correct
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:35,200	| IOT026 |	Yeah that's right actually we definitely do see
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:38,272	| IOT026 |	That there's a pretty big problem to be solved out there
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,576	| IOT026 |	So I think today there's
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:45,952	| IOT026 |	Seniors are actually using more of the healthcare resources per capita than any other group
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:50,560	| IOT026 |	And patients are 65 years and older are representing 40%
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,096	| IOT026 |	The Vault hospitalized adult
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:55,936	| IOT026 |	We think that there's a lot that we can do there there's
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,752	| IOT026 |	Technology Innovation sprouting around
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:03,360	| IOT026 |	Everywhere and you're you and and and his podcast talks about a lot of them
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,384	| IOT026 |	But it's
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:09,248	| IOT026 |	A bit rare to hear people talking about how those technology Innovations are are
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,016	| IOT026 |	Helping the elderly
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:14,624	| IOT026 |	And in research that was done between Phillips and Georgetown
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:18,976	| IOT026 |	University we we actually learned that it's not because the elderly don't want to adopt a pet
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,536	| IOT026 |	In fact many of them do
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,328	| IOT026 |	I think that one a little bit of help
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,864	| IOT026 |	On learning how to use it
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:28,704	| IOT026 |	But oftentimes their caregivers are just so overwhelmed with that day-to-day care
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:30,752	| IOT026 |	But they don't have time or the patience
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:33,568	| IOT026 |	So the Aging well hub
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,616	| IOT026 |	Which is that what you're referring to
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,152	| IOT026 |	Is is like a think tank
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,432	| IOT026 |	That we started
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,736	| IOT026 |	With a lot of other lot of other partners
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:44,320	| IOT026 |	Georgetown MIT age lab Humana will S Health and more
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:44,832	| IOT026 |	2
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,648	| IOT026 |	Focus on driving Innovation specifically
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,952	| IOT026 |	Around attacking issues of Aging well
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:55,584	| IOT026 |	And so far have you guys discovered anything interesting or what is kind of
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,096	| IOT026 |	Do you have a
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:58,144	| IOT026 |	Focus for your research yet
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:03,264	| IOT026 |	I think it's still very early days so a lot of these things are just getting started but
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,568	| IOT026 |	We're going to be stay tuned
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:08,640	| IOT026 |	To hear about what comes out of that about aging well hub
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:11,968	| IOT026 |	I I certainly will maybe we'll have you back in a year to see see what you've learned
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,296	| IOT026 |	So Phillips has actually been doing
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,320	| IOT026 |	A lot with
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:16,832	| IOT026 |	The elderly
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,112	| IOT026 |	Ocean sound like
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:22,720	| IOT026 |	But you guys have been in the space for decades with the lifeline
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| IOT026 |	Product
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| IOT026 |	Which
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:30,144	| IOT026 |	You know I think we've all were familiar with I fallen and I can't get up was at the tagline
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,192	| IOT026 |	Lifeline's tagline
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:35,264	| IOT026 |	Master concept of the concept I think
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:40,640	| IOT026 |	I think you're right Lifeline is has been the leader in the United States for many years in
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:44,736	| IOT026 |	Helping elderly to be more independent in their homes
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,040	| IOT026 |	With these types of solutions at
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,320	| IOT026 |	Detect Falls
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:51,136	| IOT026 |	And a lousy nurse immediately be
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,928	| IOT026 |	Connected to back and response
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:54,976	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,792	| IOT026 |	How do you take a product like that which is
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:59,328	| IOT026 |	You know connected to a cellular network
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,144	| IOT026 |	And kind of upgrade it for
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,424	| IOT026 |	The current
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT026 |	Generation and era
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,496	| IOT026 |	Because
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,568	| IOT026 |	You know I look at something like that and I'm like a that's
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:11,616	| IOT026 |	That feels very
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,152	| IOT026 |	Old school in
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,944	| IOT026 |	How do you tie something like that in with
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:18,784	| IOT026 |	Ghetto Sensors how do you make it may be a little bit cheaper I don't know I mean
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:24,160	| IOT026 |	I'm sure expensive because there's all this back and monitoring it's not just like
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:27,744	| IOT026 |	Are there people on the other end is so if you fall
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:31,328	| IOT026 |	You know it's calling actual people who will send help to you so that's
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,864	| IOT026 |	I assume part of the cost but
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:35,680	| IOT026 |	How do you get a chance when you're very very expensive
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:41,056	| IOT026 |	This is actually a very complex solution of a Lifeline system
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:47,456	| IOT026 |	Takes over 9 million call the year that's almost won a minute and their average response time is 22 seconds
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:49,504	| IOT026 |	So it's a it's a pretty serious
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:53,088	| IOT026 |	I'm solution to make sure that there's always someone there
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,368	| IOT026 |	For your loved ones when they need it
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,672	| IOT026 |	What's your question
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,720	| IOT026 |	Your question in terms of
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,256	| IOT026 |	How do you take these
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,304	| IOT026 |	Core Technologies and drive them
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,840	| IOT026 |	Into the Brave New World
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,888	| IOT026 |	Coyotes Rectify that
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:08,704	| IOT026 |	Coyotes what's hard about the same stuff that's driving
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,240	| IOT026 |	All of the wearable companies
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,520	| IOT026 |	That we like to talk about
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:12,800	| IOT026 |	To do
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:16,384	| IOT026 |	Cool stuff the same technology that they're putting into two to their devices
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,920	| IOT026 |	Are going into
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,968	| IOT026 |	The Next Generation
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:21,504	| IOT026 |	Philips go safe Solutions
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:24,576	| IOT026 |	Which is really a wearable pendant
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,368	| IOT026 |	Include includes
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,648	| IOT026 |	3G modem
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:30,720	| IOT026 |	Give to Les Bois home communicators GPS
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:33,536	| IOT026 |	Wife I told your bread crumbs audio begin
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:35,584	| IOT026 |	All the stuff that we talked about
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,096	| IOT026 |	In
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,144	| IOT026 |	I would say going to the more
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,936	| IOT026 |	Consumer Centric
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,984	| IOT026 |	Sexy stuff that early adopters
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,776	| IOT026 |	Talk like what like to discuss
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,824	| IOT026 |	But it's designed for the elderly
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,920	| IOT026 |	It's it's not the stuff that you see when you
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:52,736	| IOT026 |	First walking to Best Buy in the home automation Zone
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,808	| IOT026 |	Autoalert detection there is
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:58,368	| IOT026 |	Really designed to make sure that if someone Falls
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:01,696	| IOT026 |	Not only is at detecting the fall but
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,768	| IOT026 |	If a person falls in Camp themselves make a call
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:07,584	| IOT026 |	It automatically starts the call for you
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,120	| IOT026 |	There's someone that talks back
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:13,216	| IOT026 |	I'm from the response Center and make sure everything is okay if you need assistance
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:17,312	| IOT026 |	And then you can start to think about how this can go beyond
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,080	| IOT026 |	Just
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,128	| IOT026 |	Those types of
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:23,456	| IOT026 |	Of extreme cases to also providing
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:25,248	| IOT026 |	Support for elderly care
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,528	| IOT026 |	I'm going to need my assistance
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,088	| IOT026 |	So is that someone's been
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,880	| IOT026 |	Locked outside of their home
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,648	| IOT026 |	Or
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,440	| IOT026 |	I need to pick up some medication
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:36,256	| IOT026 |	Or they need help do you know to go to a doctor's appointment
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:40,352	| IOT026 |	They have that on them at all times with someone there 24/7
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,632	| IOT026 |	You can try to contact
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:43,424	| IOT026 |	A various people in there
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,448	| IOT026 |	Care plan
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,216	| IOT026 |	To get help with him
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,264	| IOT026 |	That's really useful because
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,824	| IOT026 |	I I know that Lifeline feels kind of like
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,616	| IOT026 |	Oh my gosh you know
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:55,712	| IOT026 |	I have literally fallen and I am unconscious or
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,016	| IOT026 |	You know you're going to send an ambulance versus
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,064	| IOT026 |	Fall in and I'm kind of stuck
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,112	| IOT026 |	But I don't really need an ambulance I just
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,392	| IOT026 |	Can you call my
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:07,488	| IOT026 |	I just want to call a like a family member whose nearby and have them come over and
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,280	| IOT026 |	Help me out for
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:12,864	| IOT026 |	Maven esterly help me out but just kind of come over and comfort me or
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,400	| IOT026 |	You don't make me some soup
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,704	| IOT026 |	So that it's actually it is
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:21,312	| IOT026 |	It's an incredible thing Stacy I I've seen a lot of Technologies
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,848	| IOT026 |	I actually went
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,640	| IOT026 |	To visit the lifeline
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,408	| IOT026 |	Team
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:27,712	| IOT026 |	On the East Coast after taking a lot of these calls
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:31,296	| IOT026 |	And when you listen to someone who's
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:34,880	| IOT026 |	You know 9503
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,392	| IOT026 |	Person
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:39,488	| IOT026 |	Calling in in Encino just asking for help Small Things testing
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,256	| IOT026 |	System
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:44,352	| IOT026 |	And the happiness it brings up some on the other side right there immediately to help them
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,960	| IOT026 |	It's much more powerful than just the obvious thing that we think about in terms of
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,472	| IOT026 |	I'm salt
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,008	| IOT026 |	Call support
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:54,848	| IOT026 |	Deliver for Meals on Wheels before
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:55,360	| IOT026 |	And just
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:58,688	| IOT026 |	Just being there for someone is it's like
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,016	| IOT026 |	80% of like
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:05,088	| IOT026 |	What people need happiness it's Comfort like human comfort
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:05,600	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,672	| IOT026 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,464	| IOT026 |	So in terms of
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:10,976	| IOT026 |	Providing
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:12,256	| IOT026 |	Again
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,792	| IOT026 |	Healthcare let's
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:14,560	| IOT026 |	That's kind of talk
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,888	| IOT026 |	Beyond that solution let's talk about
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:20,448	| IOT026 |	How we bridge the gap
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:26,080	| IOT026 |	Between kind of consumer-grade medical stuff like a Fitbit activity tracker into kind of
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,872	| IOT026 |	Hospital in medical
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:28,896	| IOT026 |	Call care because
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,688	| IOT026 |	As you get older
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:33,248	| IOT026 |	You're probably going to
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,296	| IOT026 |	To need more wearables and more
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:37,088	| IOT026 |	Hospital-grade kerin
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,368	| IOT026 |	I'm very curious like
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,160	| IOT026 |	What that should look like
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:45,792	| IOT026 |	In kind of this more consumer I guess we'll call it the consumerization of
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,304	| IOT026 |	Medtech
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,608	| IOT026 |	Because we had the consumerization of it
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:55,264	| IOT026 |	But what should that start looking like to make it a little bit friendlier as we kind of try to bring the stuff into the home
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,032	| IOT026 |	Because
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,568	| IOT026 |	Where could I have to write
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,616	| IOT026 |	We can't just rely on hospitals for that
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,944	| IOT026 |	We don't seem to meet to as much anymore
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:06,272	| IOT026 |	With kind of better Wireless better sensor technology right
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:08,576	| IOT026 |	I think we have no choice
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,856	| IOT026 |	Actually I think
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:12,160	| IOT026 |	With the Aging population growing
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:16,256	| IOT026 |	The number of chronic diseases growing the overload on the medical system growing
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:18,304	| IOT026 |	Healthcare costs
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,072	| IOT026 |	Growing
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,608	| IOT026 |	It's just not sustainable
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:25,728	| IOT026 |	Absolutely there's no question about it the Healthcare System needs to change
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:30,592	| IOT026 |	And the way that we see that happening kind of depends on where you are
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,616	| IOT026 |	In the continuum
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,408	| IOT026 |	Continuum of Care what we call the
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,688	| IOT026 |	Care
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,736	| IOT026 |	So depending on if you
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,016	| IOT026 |	If you're someone who's
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,040	| IOT026 |	Healthy
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:39,808	| IOT026 |	Or perhaps
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:45,440	| IOT026 |	Recently went to a doctor and we're told that you have the potential of getting a chronic disease
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:47,232	| IOT026 |	If you don't change your lifestyle
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:49,536	| IOT026 |	These need to be Beyond
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,560	| IOT026 |	General
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,072	| IOT026 |	Fitness tracker
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:54,400	| IOT026 |	It's really about wearable Solutions
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:59,264	| IOT026 |	I'm not going to focus on some real Healthcare issues designed by doctors and psychologists
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,568	| IOT026 |	Like really leverage clinical knowledge
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,872	| IOT026 |	In order to drive programs
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,152	| IOT026 |	That can drive change
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,688	| IOT026 |	Behavioral change
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,224	| IOT026 |	That's kind of one
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:08,992	| IOT026 |	Part of the continuum
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,296	| IOT026 |	If you're someone who's already sick
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,344	| IOT026 |	If your son is already sick
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,648	| IOT026 |	And you're in the in the healthcare C
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:18,208	| IOT026 |	Systems there's also opportunities for 4
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:22,816	| IOT026 |	The Internet of Things in the consumerization of of healthcare and
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,584	| IOT026 |	Wearables
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| IOT026 |	To play a huge role
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,936	| IOT026 |	I'll give you an example we've been working on
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:31,008	| IOT026 |	Intensive Ambulatory Care programs with Banner Health
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:34,592	| IOT026 |	Where we focus really on
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:38,688	| IOT026 |	The most complex and high-cost patients like the top 5% of patients
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,224	| IOT026 |	Austin elderly
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:43,040	| IOT026 |	Multiple chronic conditions
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,832	| IOT026 |	Accounting for 50% of all Healthcare
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:46,880	| IOT026 |	And those patients
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,928	| IOT026 |	Get a bunch of connected Hardware
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,720	| IOT026 |	To get Android tablets
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:55,584	| IOT026 |	To get customized software they get all kinds of biometric sensors blood pressure oxygen saturation
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,352	| IOT026 |	Scales whatever
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,424	| IOT026 |	All of those Solutions are tied back
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:00,704	| IOT026 |	2
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,776	| IOT026 |	How sweet digital platforms
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,568	| IOT026 |	Doctors have access
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,592	| IOT026 |	Nurses have access
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:12,992	| IOT026 |	To see the information that's being out of the country artists that information patients are matched to healthcare coaches nurses social workers
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:14,528	| IOT026 |	And
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,832	| IOT026 |	In just two years since we
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,600	| IOT026 |	Ben
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,136	| IOT026 |	Do we not program with Banner
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:21,440	| IOT026 |	Is a significant impact
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:24,512	| IOT026 |	Actual Healthcare cost Racine 27% reduction
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:26,560	| IOT026 |	And cost of care
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,352	| IOT026 |	Which goes up to 32%
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:31,680	| IOT026 |	I'm injection for acute and long-term care costs
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:35,008	| IOT026 |	And 45% reduction in hospitalizations
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:35,776	| IOT026 |	Overalls
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,568	| IOT026 |	What are the common
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,336	| IOT026 |	Things
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:40,896	| IOT026 |	That you needed a hardware side
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:41,920	| IOT026 |	That you need on these
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:45,760	| IOT026 |	Software side that you need on the cloud back inside to
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,576	| IOT026 |	That makes this different from
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:50,112	| IOT026 |	You know Alex hitting me with like
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:53,184	| IOT026 |	A Fitbit and maybe some home
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| IOT026 |	Cameras and
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,256	| IOT026 |	Electronic medical records
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:56,768	| IOT026 |	System
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:01,888	| IOT026 |	Some other kid
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,424	| IOT026 |	Yeah so there's
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,984	| IOT026 |	There's a few key variables
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:08,800	| IOT026 |	That really matter when we talk about
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:09,568	| IOT026 |	Changing
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,104	| IOT026 |	Landscape
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:12,896	| IOT026 |	Number one is accuracy of data
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:14,432	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:19,552	| IOT026 |	Lots of solutions out there but accuracy of data really matters that's you know why
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:21,344	| IOT026 |	Much much harder.
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,904	| IOT026 |	2 things to be considered medical devices
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,464	| IOT026 |	Number two is
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:32,864	| IOT026 |	Wait a second so accuracy addata if it's FDA approved that means should I assume that that means the data coming off
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,376	| IOT026 |	What is accurate
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:35,168	| IOT026 |	Sweating.
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:35,936	| IOT026 |	What indicator
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,984	| IOT026 |	What's 1 indicator but of course
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:41,312	| IOT026 |	These Arduino accuracy of data can
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,104	| IOT026 |	Go beyond just
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,920	| IOT026 |	Care medical devices right because when it comes to
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:47,712	| IOT026 |	Being able to
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,992	| IOT026 |	Addictive
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,296	| IOT026 |	The more context you have the better
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:54,624	| IOT026 |	You can imagine all kinds of things around you providing contacts
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,928	| IOT026 |	And I think accuracy of data
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:40:01,536	| IOT026 |	Is one of the things that the medical community Ashley struggles with there's so many things out there what do they dress
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,840	| IOT026 |	And noise in the system
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,888	| IOT026 |	Good really / results
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:08,448	| IOT026 |	And there's no tolerance for that in a minute
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:10,752	| IOT026 |	That's one that's one variable
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:14,848	| IOT026 |	Another key variable and probably one of the most important variables
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:15,360	| IOT026 |	Is
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:16,896	| IOT026 |	The ability
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:19,200	| IOT026 |	For data to be used
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,480	| IOT026 |	Color of a cross
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,784	| IOT026 |	Longitude of
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:23,808	| IOT026 |	Things you do in your life
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:26,112	| IOT026 |	What I mean by that is today
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:28,928	| IOT026 |	When you buy wearable devices
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,720	| IOT026 |	Or smart devices
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,000	| IOT026 |	At the store
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,536	| IOT026 |	All the data that's collected
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,328	| IOT026 |	From those devices
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,864	| IOT026 |	Chesapeake elected in
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:39,680	| IOT026 |	The spirit clouds by each manufacturer
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:40,960	| IOT026 |	Liver
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,728	| IOT026 |	. device
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:44,288	| IOT026 |	So if I have 10 different connected things
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,592	| IOT026 |	Around me on me in my house
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:49,920	| IOT026 |	Usually the data is going to 10 different places
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:55,040	| IOT026 |	One of the things that we're really trying to do and we think it's absolutely critical for the success
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,320	| IOT026 |	Love
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:58,880	| IOT026 |	Healthtech and Generals is to create an open platform
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,672	| IOT026 |	The public cloud
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,184	| IOT026 |	If you will
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,208	| IOT026 |	Where
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:04,256	| IOT026 |	You can start to connect the dots
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,280	| IOT026 |	Home Health Care
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:07,584	| IOT026 |	Systems all the way through to
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:10,144	| IOT026 |	Devices that are more consumer-centric
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,912	| IOT026 |	Secure
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,448	| IOT026 |	HIPAA
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,728	| IOT026 |	Compliant cloud
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,008	| IOT026 |	Where
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,032	| IOT026 |	If the consumer
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,336	| IOT026 |	Consents to sharing data
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:20,384	| IOT026 |	You can actually start to connect the dots
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:25,504	| IOT026 |	And this is very very important because if you want to do some of the things that we think
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:28,064	| IOT026 |	Are necessary for Predictive Analytics
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:30,880	| IOT026 |	You need to be able to take that wearable data
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,648	| IOT026 |	And
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,928	| IOT026 |	Connected up to the healthcare
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:36,000	| IOT026 |	I'll give you an example of
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:37,024	| IOT026 |	How powerful that could be
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,072	| IOT026 |	Summit lifeline
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:41,120	| IOT026 |	Wearable pendant we talked about earlier
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:45,472	| IOT026 |	The one that elderly people might be using more for you know call detection and
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:47,264	| IOT026 |	Having someone there when they when they need help
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:50,080	| IOT026 |	We've been looking at the data
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:53,663	| IOT026 |	From the past several years from Seniors who have been using that
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:56,991	| IOT026 |	And working with a lot of clinical scientist
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,271	| IOT026 |	Data scientist
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:00,319	| IOT026 |	Even able to
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,087	| IOT026 |	Do some
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:03,391	| IOT026 |	Really interesting data analytics
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,927	| IOT026 |	Where we can detect
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,207	| IOT026 |	Proactively
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:09,023	| IOT026 |	When patients are most likely to have health issues
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:13,119	| IOT026 |	That's really allowing doctors and caregivers to intervene before problems occur
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,167	| IOT026 |	You know of course ultimately helping
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,447	| IOT026 |	Patience
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:19,263	| IOT026 |	Stay healthy reduce reduce hospitalization
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:20,543	| IOT026 |	But
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:24,383	| IOT026 |	That's all using historical data that was gathered from Lifeline users
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:30,271	| IOT026 |	Over the years and combining that with real information that's coming in real time from the from the seniors wearable device
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:34,879	| IOT026 |	The care stage program which is the name of that analytics platform is he won't start
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,951	| IOT026 |	Change things from being a reactive care device
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,743	| IOT026 |	To proactive care device
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:41,023	| IOT026 |	Extremely powerful
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:46,399	| IOT026 |	You can't do that if all the different things were using to collect data on lives in 20 different clouds
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:48,447	| IOT026 |	And you can't do that it's the things
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:51,263	| IOT026 |	I'm requesting or data are living on cloud
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:53,823	| IOT026 |	That are not secure not HIPAA compliant
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:55,871	| IOT026 |	And are not going to lie to do
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,895	| IOT026 |	Connect those dots.
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:01,247	| IOT026 |	Okay so it's like the predictive maintenance for Machinery but applied to humans
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:04,063	| IOT026 |	You're like that's terrible Stacy
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,879	| IOT026 |	Don't don't say that ever again
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:08,927	| IOT026 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,695	| IOT026 |	In that make sense
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,743	| IOT026 |	You guys have done
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:14,559	| IOT026 |	What will probably wrap this up quickly but
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:17,887	| IOT026 |	I I do want to focus on some of the diseases that you guys have been
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:20,447	| IOT026 |	Because you have this very
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:22,751	| IOT026 |	Are the lifeline programs for generic
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:25,567	| IOT026 |	General help you guys
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,335	| IOT026 |	Also have
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:28,383	| IOT026 |	The Ambulatory Care Program
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:33,759	| IOT026 |	Which is also can generic but you also have some very specific disease programs
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:38,111	| IOT026 |	I'm with diabetes you have diabetes specific Care Community you have a
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,391	| IOT026 |	COPD
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,671	| IOT026 |	Care community
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:42,207	| IOT026 |	I'm very curious like
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:48,607	| IOT026 |	I guess why those exist what you're learning about doing specific care communities versus General Health
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,399	| IOT026 |	I'm guessing it's just a
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,959	| IOT026 |	When you focus on these care communities you're getting both
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:54,495	| IOT026 |	Is there a
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,519	| IOT026 |	Specific like
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:59,615	| IOT026 |	Being able to get better data associated with those care like
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,639	| IOT026 |	Having a specific
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,431	| IOT026 |	I guess Patient Group
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:04,223	| IOT026 |	But is there also is like a
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:07,295	| IOT026 |	Inability to bring those actual patients together if you want
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:10,367	| IOT026 |	Beer kind of social media or help
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,671	| IOT026 |	Yes absolutely
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,463	| IOT026 |	First of all
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,743	| IOT026 |	Phillips is
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:17,023	| IOT026 |	Involved with
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,047	| IOT026 |	All of the above
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:21,119	| IOT026 |	So we're offering programs that are very specific
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:24,191	| IOT026 |	Two unique cohorts of populations
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:28,543	| IOT026 |	Such as a diabetes platform that was announced this week at dreamforce actually
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:29,823	| IOT026 |	Well I'm with Salesforce
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:30,847	| IOT026 |	And that's
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:37,503	| IOT026 |	Really about a digital Health Solution to help improve the care for like the nearly 400 million people that are living with diabetes
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:39,807	| IOT026 |	Huge population
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:42,879	| IOT026 |	And it's all about diabetes self-management
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,415	| IOT026 |	With an application
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:45,695	| IOT026 |	Integrated
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:49,535	| IOT026 |	To a backend that has an online community for collaborative
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,047	| IOT026 |	Care
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:56,703	| IOT026 |	So it's the first time that there's an online community that can connect people with diabetes to clinicians
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:58,495	| IOT026 |	I'm two other
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,287	| IOT026 |	People that also have the disease
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:02,079	| IOT026 |	So that everyone can share
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:07,711	| IOT026 |	Personal data clinical Health Data whatever they want to share in a secure
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:08,735	| IOT026 |	Southeast Network
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:11,295	| IOT026 |	You know
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,063	| IOT026 |	Just a
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:15,903	| IOT026 |	Just a simple example of of the types of things we're doing but we're involved in this
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:19,743	| IOT026 |	Various points of a Continuum including
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:22,815	| IOT026 |	General Health Solutions for people that maybe want to
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:25,375	| IOT026 |	Just start to monitor their blood pressure
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:28,447	| IOT026 |	There their heart rate their sleep patterns
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:31,007	| IOT026 |	You're the most fundamental
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,311	| IOT026 |	Things in your life are your sleep
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,335	| IOT026 |	Your nutrition
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:35,871	| IOT026 |	Your activity levels
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:36,895	| IOT026 |	And
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:40,735	| IOT026 |	Between those three things if he can if you can be coached
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:46,111	| IOT026 |	To change your lifestyle you can actually prevent having all kinds of chronic diseases later on in your life
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:48,927	| IOT026 |	And we're looking at those opportunities to
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,463	| IOT026 |	I think one of the
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:54,047	| IOT026 |	The most important differentiators coming going back to your other question
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:57,119	| IOT026 |	What separates all of these programs
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:46:00,191	| IOT026 |	A lot of the other solutions that are out there today
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:01,215	| IOT026 |	Is the
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:02,495	| IOT026 |	Clinical expertise
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:04,543	| IOT026 |	And Healthcare expertise
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,847	| IOT026 |	That were using
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:10,431	| IOT026 |	To deliver the coaching to deliver the recommendations to deliver the
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,711	| IOT026 |	Change behaviors
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:14,015	| IOT026 |	That are necessary to
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:14,527	| IOT026 |	Imbruvica
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,599	| IOT026 |	Stop. The real key differentiator
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:20,671	| IOT026 |	It's not just about tracking data and presenting
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:22,463	| IOT026 |	Pretty graph visualization
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:24,767	| IOT026 |	What can you do with it
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,047	| IOT026 |	And how can we use
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,839	| IOT026 |	Are benches
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:28,607	| IOT026 |	Seal Behavioral
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:31,935	| IOT026 |	Change scientists psychologists and
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:34,751	| IOT026 |	NICU nurses in cardiologist
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,799	| IOT026 |	Everything in between
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:37,823	| IOT026 |	To help deliver
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,103	| IOT026 |	Programs
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:40,383	| IOT026 |	These are
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,431	| IOT026 |	Solutions that we often build
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,711	| IOT026 |	With the patience
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,759	| IOT026 |	And with Hospital
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:47,295	| IOT026 |	Burberry clothes
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,831	| IOT026 |	The last mile of healthcare
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:50,111	| IOT026 |	In order to try to make an impact
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:53,183	| IOT026 |	Okay so it's the involvement of the doctors
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,719	| IOT026 |	And
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:57,279	| IOT026 |	Creating a community and getting an early start hopefully
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:59,583	| IOT026 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:01,119	| IOT026 |	Alright well we have moved from
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:02,911	| IOT026 |	Your elderly
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:05,215	| IOT026 |	I'm always forgetting it's it's the elderly
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:07,263	| IOT026 |	Hub no elderly Innovation Hub
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:08,799	| IOT026 |	Aging well hub
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:09,567	| IOT026 |	Aging well hub
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:14,687	| IOT026 |	My brain my brain reacts against it cuz I'm like oh no it's an actual hub
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:17,247	| IOT026 |	Anthony M physical device.
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:22,879	| IOT026 |	So the agent will have all the way to I guess it's also aging well as but it's earlier in life
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:26,463	| IOT026 |	With specific preventing specific chronic diseases hopefully
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:31,071	| IOT026 |	You guys have a lot going on I'm excited to hear about it and I feel better about my own
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:32,095	| IOT026 |	My own efforts of beijing
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:35,935	| IOT026 |	Which which really involved is waking up every single day
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,215	| IOT026 |	So
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:40,287	| IOT026 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show that I appreciate it
