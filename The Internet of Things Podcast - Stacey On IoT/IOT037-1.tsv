EDL	Record In	Record Out	Clipname	Subtitle
EDL	00:00:06,656	00:00:12,800	| IOT037-1 |	Later on the show we talked about Phillips and a decision it made two
EDL	00:00:12,800	00:00:15,104	| IOT037-1 |	Take away some of the functionality
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:19,200	| IOT037-1 |	Its hub had that enabled it to work with some 3rd party lights
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:20,992	| IOT037-1 |	Well
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:24,832	| IOT037-1 |	Since the show was recorded Phillips actually reverse the decision that it made
EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:28,928	| IOT037-1 |	It has recently upgraded the software so Philips Hue Lights
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:30,720	| IOT037-1 |	Didn't work with 3rd party lights
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:32,768	| IOT037-1 |	When we did the show
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:35,840	| IOT037-1 |	That still remain the case but on Wednesday
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:38,656	| IOT037-1 |	It actually reversed that
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:40,704	| IOT037-1 |	Because so many of its customers complained
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:43,264	| IOT037-1 |	So what is going to do
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:44,544	| IOT037-1 |	It's going to
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:51,200	| IOT037-1 |	Reverse the software upgrade so lights from other brands will continue to work as they did before with the Philips Hue system
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:52,736	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:58,880	| IOT037-1 |	In a statement the Phillips provided to me it says they will work on the reversal at the upgrade and they will shortly confirm when it will be available
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:00:59,904	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,720	| IOT037-1 |	When you guys here Kevin and I talked about this
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:03,744	| IOT037-1 |	Know that
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,536	| IOT037-1 |	While our discussion
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,816	| IOT037-1 |	Is still relevant
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,632	| IOT037-1 |	Phillips has decided that it will not
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:10,912	| IOT037-1 |	Kill off
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:11,680	| IOT037-1 |	Third party
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,192	| IOT037-1 |	Functionality
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:15,264	| IOT037-1 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the iot

EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:34,208	| IOT037-1 |	I will call it mining operation and
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,744	| IOT037-1 |	In his office
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,024	| IOT037-1 |	And updates
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:39,840	| IOT037-1 |	And our guest is
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,376	| IOT037-1 |	Going to talk about
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:43,680	| IOT037-1 |	The connected kitchen and also
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:45,216	| IOT037-1 |	What to do
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:48,800	| IOT037-1 |	Decommissioning a connected device when your company gets sold
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:49,824	| IOT037-1 |	Sam
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,360	| IOT037-1 |	Exciting times
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:53,920	| IOT037-1 |	Alright so let's start with
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,968	| IOT037-1 |	What everyone's talking about this week which is
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,504	| IOT037-1 |	The hue
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| IOT037-1 |	The hughleys
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:04,928	| IOT037-1 |	It's funny they have a new program a new certification program called friends with you and right now
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:07,488	| IOT037-1 |	I don't think anybody wants to be friends with you
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:10,048	| IOT037-1 |	They're cutting support for 3rd party bulbs
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:11,840	| IOT037-1 |	Yeah it is
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:14,912	| IOT037-1 |	It's brutal out there for a third party light bulb
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,960	| IOT037-1 |	Hand for a customer review
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:21,312	| IOT037-1 |	We first started getting reports of this when people were updating their Hue Lights
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,080	| IOT037-1 |	End
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:28,480	| IOT037-1 |	All the sudden there Cree there Ostrom there GE link bulbs
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:32,064	| IOT037-1 |	He had previously worked under the hue
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,600	| IOT037-1 |	Hug
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:36,928	| IOT037-1 |	We're certified under the zigbee light Link profile
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,464	| IOT037-1 |	Just suddenly stopped working
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:41,024	| IOT037-1 |	So if you weren't a hue light bulb you no longer worked with you
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:45,888	| IOT037-1 |	So just to be clear for people if they did not yet update
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:49,984	| IOT037-1 |	They're Philips Hue operating software to version 1.11 I know you can
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,520	| IOT037-1 |	Check that in the app
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:55,104	| IOT037-1 |	Man they still have the 3rd party compatibility
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,896	| IOT037-1 |	Mine still work
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,664	| IOT037-1 |	And I have not done the
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,712	| IOT037-1 |	There you go so
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,016	| IOT037-1 |	Word to the wise if you don't want to lose this
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| IOT037-1 |	Boys for now
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,832	| IOT037-1 |	Maybe I love
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,600	| IOT037-1 |	You know
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,928	| IOT037-1 |	Maybe now it could be that he does a forced update
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,440	| IOT037-1 |	At some point in time
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,720	| IOT037-1 |	True
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,232	| IOT037-1 |	True
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:17,632	| IOT037-1 |	Let's talk about what's going on here because I'm very much open platform kind of guy so the fact that
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:21,472	| IOT037-1 |	The Hue Bridge already work with zigbee wireless particles was was
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,240	| IOT037-1 |	Plus
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,544	| IOT037-1 |	Is that not pretty standard that particle
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| IOT037-1 |	It is it is
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:32,480	| IOT037-1 |	Okay I mean I think I know the answer I'm trying to give you the
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,528	| IOT037-1 |	Benefit of the doubt here by playing a little dumb
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:38,880	| IOT037-1 |	So basically they're they're closing things down a little bit more well okay
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,392	| IOT037-1 |	So here's that
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,208	| IOT037-1 |	It snows it be is a it's a radio
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,768	| IOT037-1 |	Now leichtling is actually a
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,608	| IOT037-1 |	Profile so that's software that runs on top of zigbee that zigbee assertive
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:55,008	| IOT037-1 |	Now zigbee is you guys may remember is kind of in a little bit of turmoil because of the up-and-coming
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,520	| IOT037-1 |	Red
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,336	| IOT037-1 |	All comes back to thread and we Haven
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,128	| IOT037-1 |	So with
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,200	| IOT037-1 |	Thread which is the nest Samsung
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,992	| IOT037-1 |	Freescale
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,040	| IOT037-1 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| IOT037-1 |	Kind of a couple other
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,832	| IOT037-1 |	Companies
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,136	| IOT037-1 |	And let's let's go see is Philip Sousa Porter of
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,184	| IOT037-1 |	Because that may answer some
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:17,791	| IOT037-1 |	Some of what may be coming out here may just be kind of some
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:24,447	| IOT037-1 |	Protocol confusion as they're trying to move to kind of support more modern standards like thread
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,239	| IOT037-1 |	It's it's kind of unclear like
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| IOT037-1 |	What
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,519	| IOT037-1 |	Is happening here
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,823	| IOT037-1 |	Yeah and just as you were
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:33,151	| IOT037-1 |	Talking about this I looked up on thread group chat Oregon Phillips is a can
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,687	| IOT037-1 |	Contributing member to
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT037-1 |	The threat group
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,223	| IOT037-1 |	So maybe that
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,319	| IOT037-1 |	Maybe
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| IOT037-1 |	It just
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:44,159	| IOT037-1 |	And even if it is happening and I'm okay with that but it's B
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:49,279	| IOT037-1 |	The manner that it's happening it's just pretty much somebody flipping a switch here in a software update
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,327	| IOT037-1 |	I don't think this was very well communicate
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,095	| IOT037-1 |	Headed to the users
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| IOT037-1 |	It may not have
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,447	| IOT037-1 |	In-N-Out Phillips has always said though that
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,519	| IOT037-1 |	The support for these other
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,287	| IOT037-1 |	Bulbs
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,055	| IOT037-1 |	His
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,079	| IOT037-1 |	Always been
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,359	| IOT037-1 |	Kind of
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,895	| IOT037-1 |	Just support for this
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,407	| IOT037-1 |	Profile
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,223	| IOT037-1 |	So they have never been proactively
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,807	| IOT037-1 |	Testing or doing anything with these bulbs in
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:13,855	| IOT037-1 |	In their conversation with Cena
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,671	| IOT037-1 |	About this change what has happened is
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,999	| IOT037-1 |	Customers have been coming to them when these
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:23,839	| IOT037-1 |	Light bulbs have had issues or problems and it sounds like Phillips is like
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:29,215	| IOT037-1 |	This is become kind of a pain people are coming to us about bulbs not working
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,263	| IOT037-1 |	And we don't know what to do with it
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:36,639	| IOT037-1 |	And I get it and in fact they are actually going to deal with it because they do have this new friends of hue program
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,407	| IOT037-1 |	Wish hope
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,943	| IOT037-1 |	Let them certified
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:45,343	| IOT037-1 |	Designee bulbs bulbs that are no longer working after the software update may actually work in the future
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,391	| IOT037-1 |	If they go through the friends of hue program
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:51,487	| IOT037-1 |	And yes and so the question then becomes will Bosch how hard is it to
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,511	| IOT037-1 |	Become
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,559	| IOT037-1 |	You know interoperable with the friends of hue program
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,119	| IOT037-1 |	This is where
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| IOT037-1 |	Something like
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,471	| IOT037-1 |	Alljoyn or
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,495	| IOT037-1 |	Some
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:08,127	| IOT037-1 |	Sort of real interoperable HTTP style standard for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,663	| IOT037-1 |	Would be
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT037-1 |	Freaking
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,455	| IOT037-1 |	Amazing
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| IOT037-1 |	Because what is happen
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:19,391	| IOT037-1 |	Is instead of some sort of universal again HTTP is a wonderful example
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,463	| IOT037-1 |	Some sort of universal
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,743	| IOT037-1 |	Standard
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,047	| IOT037-1 |	We have interoperability
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| IOT037-1 |	Programs
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,095	| IOT037-1 |	And
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,607	| IOT037-1 |	That means
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,679	| IOT037-1 |	Everybody has to work that much harder
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,727	| IOT037-1 |	To get things to work together
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,751	| IOT037-1 |	And it's kind of pain
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| IOT037-1 |	For the consumer
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,823	| IOT037-1 |	For the startups for
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:41,151	| IOT037-1 |	For the big companies that have to set up these programs and then certified
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,919	| IOT037-1 |	Test everything
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,967	| IOT037-1 |	It's just really frustrating
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:46,271	| IOT037-1 |	Cuz I think about how cool it could be if
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:50,111	| IOT037-1 |	Your light bulbs just kind of talk to each other because you inserted like
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,903	| IOT037-1 |	One or two lines of code that said
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,415	| IOT037-1 |	Hey
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,719	| IOT037-1 |	Here's the code that says I'm a light bulb
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| IOT037-1 |	We already work this out
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:02,143	| IOT037-1 |	And you know what I'm going to go back on Sunday cuz I gave incorrect information as I look something over here now that's on my screen
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| IOT037-1 |	Apparently
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,215	| IOT037-1 |	Your light bulbs
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,751	| IOT037-1 |	If they're already added
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,543	| IOT037-1 |	Prior to the software update built
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,311	| IOT037-1 |	Continue to work
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,127	| IOT037-1 |	There may be problems but they will continue to work
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:17,759	| IOT037-1 |	The issue here or what would fill up the saying is they're stopping users from adding new third-party bulbs to setups
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:23,391	| IOT037-1 |	Oh so that's not as bad as originally thought which is a good thing
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,207	| IOT037-1 |	Seeing either Kevin or I have actually changed
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:29,279	| IOT037-1 |	Neither of us have updated because we're both like
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,887	| IOT037-1 |	We both have 3rd party light bulbs as part of our systems we don't want to break our home
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| IOT037-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:41,823	| IOT037-1 |	So now I don't feel so bad and it what I said about not getting a software update obviously it's a personal choice you guys on your device is not me but
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,103	| IOT037-1 |	Now I don't feel like
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,151	| IOT037-1 |	I need to hold off on that update
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| IOT037-1 |	Will you let us know how it turns
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:53,599	| IOT037-1 |	What you know I don't have no plans to add any new third-party bulbs currently that could change in a week but
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,903	| IOT037-1 |	For now I'm comfortable saying yeah I'm okay with this now
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,743	| IOT037-1 |	See I kind of feel bad about this because I'm still waiting for my
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,279	| IOT037-1 |	White dimmer
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,047	| IOT037-1 |	BR30
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT037-1 |	From anyone
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:04,863	| IOT037-1 |	Except for you
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:06,911	| IOT037-1 |	Sex
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,191	| IOT037-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:08,959	| IOT037-1 |	So that the work
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,239	| IOT037-1 |	I can tell you that
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,543	| IOT037-1 |	I don't actually think you has the white
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,311	| IOT037-1 |	BR30
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,895	| IOT037-1 |	Don't know have not shot for any in awhile
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,431	| IOT037-1 |	No they don't they don't have
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| IOT037-1 |	The white Bea Arthur
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:19,967	| IOT037-1 |	That was my
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:26,623	| IOT037-1 |	The only thing which case you need a third-party I need a third-party cuz all they have the $60 color
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,903	| IOT037-1 |	Send
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,439	| IOT037-1 |	So expensive
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,511	| IOT037-1 |	It is well don't update your tub
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:36,351	| IOT037-1 |	Well I was going to say I'm still not updating my light bulbs
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| IOT037-1 |	I'm very sad about
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| IOT037-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,727	| IOT037-1 |	So that is the Hue situation
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,823	| IOT037-1 |	That is Stacy's rant on interoperability for the day
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,359	| IOT037-1 |	Maybe we'll come back
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,383	| IOT037-1 |	Who knows
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,407	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,479	| IOT037-1 |	Little bit more we're going to move to some Enterprise news
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| IOT037-1 |	IBM
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,295	| IOT037-1 |	Xi'an Tuesday
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,575	| IOT037-1 |	Igloo
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:57,855	| IOT037-1 |	Big blue
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:02,975	| IOT037-1 |	We don't talk a lot about Enterprise but it's a big deal in IBM
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:07,327	| IOT037-1 |	Back in March announced a 3 billion dollar iot initiative
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:13,727	| IOT037-1 |	And in September they appointed a woman named Harriet green to be the general manager of their internet-of-things practice
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:16,543	| IOT037-1 |	She's actually also the general manager at their education practice
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,079	| IOT037-1 |	I know random
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,383	| IOT037-1 |	I asked her about it and she's like yeah basically stuck
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,407	| IOT037-1 |	Kind of new business
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| IOT037-1 |	Stuff that's me
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,967	| IOT037-1 |	Education iot
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:24,991	| IOT037-1 |	Sure
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| IOT037-1 |	I spoke with her
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,063	| IOT037-1 |	Last week
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,599	| IOT037-1 |	And we talked about
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,927	| IOT037-1 |	IBM's initiatives in iot couple things worth mentioning
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:37,023	| IOT037-1 |	The announcement this week was about IBM throwing Watson at iot
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,607	| IOT037-1 |	Ye Ye Big Data Big Data
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,631	| IOT037-1 |	Intelligent learning
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:42,911	| IOT037-1 |	Intelligent learning
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| IOT037-1 |	Use machine learning
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| IOT037-1 |	I think I can just come
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,287	| IOT037-1 |	So Watson
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,311	| IOT037-1 |	You may know him
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,335	| IOT037-1 |	As hey
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:53,151	| IOT037-1 |	Computer that plays Jeopardy +
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,711	| IOT037-1 |	You actually play Jeopardy against Watson once
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| IOT037-1 |	I did I lost
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| IOT037-1 |	Well most people do
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| IOT037-1 |	Interesting
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:06,719	| IOT037-1 |	I don't know if Peregrine told us or somebody else at IBM but I'm looking at your story now and I'm
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,047	| IOT037-1 |	Just flabbergasted about the amount of data
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,607	| IOT037-1 |	That they say connected devices are generating
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,655	| IOT037-1 |	Oh yeah it's a big number what was that number
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:15,935	| IOT037-1 |	Well
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| IOT037-1 |	I'm going to Restasis
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:23,615	| IOT037-1 |	What are the square and given that IBM says there more than 9 billion connection devices operate today and those devices
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:29,759	| IOT037-1 |	Will generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data every day or the next 15
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,831	| IOT037-1 |	That's a lot of data
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,367	| IOT037-1 |	Angela Watson
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,903	| IOT037-1 |	Exactly and
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,183	| IOT037-1 |	Through
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:42,303	| IOT037-1 |	They say that most of that day. I think 90% of it is unstructured so it's in the form of
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,631	| IOT037-1 |	Words and structure tax social media things that
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,423	| IOT037-1 |	Normal computers can't read
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,215	| IOT037-1 |	Did you fight Watson
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,495	| IOT037-1 |	Watson is literate Bealls
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,287	| IOT037-1 |	It can take in that data
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:52,799	| IOT037-1 |	In processing
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,919	| IOT037-1 |	I don't mean to cut you off that's really interesting to me because I think of how much
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:02,783	| IOT037-1 |	Structured data like that we work with on a daily basis as writers and consumers and so on
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,855	| IOT037-1 |	I'm surprised that there's been no standardization
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:11,743	| IOT037-1 |	For this data maybe pick up the breadth of devices and that type of data but you know why can't they use XML or
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,791	| IOT037-1 |	Where are Json or something
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,351	| IOT037-1 |	Trinetx the data structure
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,143	| IOT037-1 |	Have you seen like
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,447	| IOT037-1 |	That will this is things like doctor's note
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,471	| IOT037-1 |	Consider just scanned in
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:27,359	| IOT037-1 |	Right right yeah it's it's such a range of data I mean a light bulbs going to generate different bigger than a doctor
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:33,247	| IOT037-1 |	Is Kendall Jenner a different data than my Raspberry Pi and sunset where I get it I get it sorry diverse
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,295	| IOT037-1 |	It's just an interesting problem
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:38,623	| IOT037-1 |	And it's important to know that when you're dealing with IBM
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:40,159	| IOT037-1 |	IBM's Best Inn
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,951	| IOT037-1 |	Biggest hammer in their toolbox
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| IOT037-1 |	Is Watson
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,743	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,023	| IOT037-1 |	When you have Watson
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,791	| IOT037-1 |	Every
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:51,679	| IOT037-1 |	Have you read your stinking structure problem looks like a nail that Watts
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:12:00,895	| IOT037-1 |	There are some really cool things so what they've done is they have on top of IBM has a product called the iot
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,663	| IOT037-1 |	Foundation cloud
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:05,247	| IOT037-1 |	Which is their Cloud for The Internet of Things they've got
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:08,063	| IOT037-1 |	It's basically if you want to build a connected product they've got
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,367	| IOT037-1 |	I'm a partnership with arm
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,903	| IOT037-1 |	And so
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,463	| IOT037-1 |	Certain arm-based chips
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:18,559	| IOT037-1 |	Will send their data automatically up to IBM's Cloud if you want to
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| IOT037-1 |	Appropriate code
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,655	| IOT037-1 |	It doesn't automatically happen if you write the code
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,983	| IOT037-1 |	And then you can start sending your data up there where it's at
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,287	| IOT037-1 |	Organized and Cooling
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| IOT037-1 |	Infinitely scalable
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| IOT037-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:34,175	| IOT037-1 |	Now you have access to it basically like a
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:37,247	| IOT037-1 |	For API calls for Watson services
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| IOT037-1 |	It's in those are
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,087	| IOT037-1 |	Add API for voice recognition so
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,903	| IOT037-1 |	And a Predictive Analytics service
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:47,743	| IOT037-1 |	A video and image recognition service and a textual analysis
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,559	| IOT037-1 |	That's actually really cool so like
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,631	| IOT037-1 |	You know about the unstructured data
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,911	| IOT037-1 |	You got access to that
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,679	| IOT037-1 |	If.
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:58,495	| IOT037-1 |	Voice recognition natural language processing service
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:02,335	| IOT037-1 |	The Predictive Analytics that GE always talks about that's in there too
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:06,943	| IOT037-1 |	And then the video and image recognition kind of stuff that you know Facebook and Google all talk about
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:11,807	| IOT037-1 |	Actually use in their products you can actually get access to some of that from Watson
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| IOT037-1 |	In IBM's iot
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,927	| IOT037-1 |	So those are the big things that IBM launch today
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,719	| IOT037-1 |	And it's actually pretty sweet
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,767	| IOT037-1 |	And today by today I mean this week
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:24,607	| IOT037-1 |	Cuz today happens to be Tuesday the recording this but you will not hear it until 3
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:28,959	| IOT037-1 |	Gobots
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,287	| IOT037-1 |	Show the one other notable thing for you guys out there
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,359	| IOT037-1 |	Is IBM's taking a very vertical strategy
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:41,247	| IOT037-1 |	With the internet of things as opposed to kind of what I think of is a horizontal strategy that the Silicon Valley
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT037-1 |	Folks are taking
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,343	| IOT037-1 |	And that is worth noting because
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,903	| IOT037-1 |	It seems to be very bifurcated based on
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:51,231	| IOT037-1 |	Where you're coming from so a lot of the old school Industries
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,791	| IOT037-1 |	Like Cisco GE IBM they're like
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,815	| IOT037-1 |	Cricket at this like
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,863	| IOT037-1 |	Here's my solution
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,143	| IOT037-1 |	I even sat Solutions
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,447	| IOT037-1 |	Like I'm some sort of corporate
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,263	| IOT037-1 |	But here is a set of products for the retail industry
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:03,775	| IOT037-1 |	Here's some for the
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| IOT037-1 |	Automotive industry
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:07,615	| IOT037-1 |	Aerospace
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,455	| IOT037-1 |	Where is a lot of the start of some companies I talk to
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,991	| IOT037-1 |	Cancel is Bali there like
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:17,855	| IOT037-1 |	You know what here's a sensor platform you guys do with it what you will so I'm really interested to see how that
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:18,879	| IOT037-1 |	Pans out because
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,671	| IOT037-1 |	They're very different
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,231	| IOT037-1 |	Ways of looking at kind of the Industrial iot
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,303	| IOT037-1 |	Throwing that out there you guys
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| IOT037-1 |	Shall we take it back
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,607	| IOT037-1 |	2
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,167	| IOT037-1 |	Sure
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,191	| IOT037-1 |	All right
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,007	| IOT037-1 |	You want to talk about what we should do a quick messed up
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,311	| IOT037-1 |	The last we talked about my Nest trying to
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:37,823	| IOT037-1 |	To laugh roast
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:41,919	| IOT037-1 |	At 4 a.m. when the garage door open even though it didn't
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| IOT037-1 |	Right
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:46,271	| IOT037-1 |	Dennis told me at the time that it was my MyQ that was doing
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,551	| IOT037-1 |	Well
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,087	| IOT037-1 |	We turn off the MyQ
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,367	| IOT037-1 |	And it didn't stop
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,671	| IOT037-1 |	I called Napa
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,439	| IOT037-1 |	I know
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,975	| IOT037-1 |	We're like no we call that one
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,487	| IOT037-1 |	We did
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:59,327	| IOT037-1 |	Ness was like oh you know what we read the logs wrong
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| IOT037-1 |	We think it's your job
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:04,959	| IOT037-1 |	A Jawbone
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,495	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:10,335	| IOT037-1 |	I did set up my Jawbone to work with my Nest but I have a jaw bone
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:14,175	| IOT037-1 |	It's the Jawbone move it it's the El Cheapo Jawbone as I like to
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,199	| IOT037-1 |	To think of it
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,735	| IOT037-1 |	Because I lose them
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:20,063	| IOT037-1 |	I've lost every Fitness monitor no matter how fancy it is
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| IOT037-1 |	And so
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,111	| IOT037-1 |	50 bucks
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,623	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:26,207	| IOT037-1 |	I connected it but when I was connecting and I realized this
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:31,071	| IOT037-1 |	One actually doesn't talk to my house because it doesn't have what it needs to do to actually connect
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:34,143	| IOT037-1 |	With my house it only works on the up to and Beyond
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,471	| IOT037-1 |	This one doesn't talk to my house
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:41,823	| IOT037-1 |	If it was connected and so that's what they said was causing the problem so I disconnected that
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,127	| IOT037-1 |	And it hasn't tried to roast
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:44,639	| IOT037-1 |	Xiaomi since
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,455	| IOT037-1 |	I don't know if that was
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| IOT037-1 |	The problem
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,503	| IOT037-1 |	I can't really
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:52,831	| IOT037-1 |	Say with much confidence because we actually had a heat wave in Austin
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| IOT037-1 |	And I ended up turning my air conditioning back on
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,415	| IOT037-1 |	Gotcha so
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| IOT037-1 |	We're going to stay tuned
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,231	| IOT037-1 |	I'm not sure if the problem is solved
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,255	| IOT037-1 |	Maybe
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,535	| IOT037-1 |	Maybe.
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:05,119	| IOT037-1 |	I'd still be surprised if that's what it was but okay let's see what happens
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| IOT037-1 |	So there is the
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,703	| IOT037-1 |	Yes I do or maybe not on
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,055	| IOT037-1 |	So that's the update there so Kevin
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,335	| IOT037-1 |	You want to talk about your
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| IOT037-1 |	Your latest purchase
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:19,199	| IOT037-1 |	Yeah, it was a waste of money I'll say that right up front but
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,735	| IOT037-1 |	I learned so much
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,783	| IOT037-1 |	Never waste of money to learn
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:29,951	| IOT037-1 |	Don't know I agree I agree and when we were talking before the show you know I kept thinking I have to justify this purchase to you because it believed
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,231	| IOT037-1 |	Doesn't a lot of
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:34,559	| IOT037-1 |	Value for the cost and talking about a $35
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:38,655	| IOT037-1 |	USB Asic or application specific integrated circuit
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,959	| IOT037-1 |	I'm using the solar USB dongle
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:44,287	| IOT037-1 |	In a Raspberry Pi for very low energy Bitcoin mining
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,335	| IOT037-1 |	Right of the bat
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:50,175	| IOT037-1 |	I'm not going to get rich I've been doing this for three days and I barely heard a penny
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT037-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT037-1 |	But
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,015	| IOT037-1 |	And this is where I get into the hotel location bit
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,039	| IOT037-1 |	I had to learn
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:58,623	| IOT037-1 |	Didn't have to I enjoyed learning so much about how Bitcoin works
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,415	| IOT037-1 |	How do you say
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,207	| IOT037-1 |	Specific
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,999	| IOT037-1 |	Pieces of Hardware actually work
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,815	| IOT037-1 |	I have never ever surprisingly never built
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:11,935	| IOT037-1 |	An application from source code in Linux and I got to do that so that was cool
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:17,055	| IOT037-1 |	And I'm just having so much fun looking at the little grass so this thing turning out hashes for Bitcoin
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,871	| IOT037-1 |	It's actually got me interested in buying
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,175	| IOT037-1 |	More robust hardware for Bitcoin mining
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:26,015	| IOT037-1 |	And the big advantage of that I have over many other people that do this
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:30,623	| IOT037-1 |	I don't pay for electricity because I've got 41 solar panels on the roof for the house so
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:31,903	| IOT037-1 |	Most
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:34,719	| IOT037-1 |	Months of the year we have no bill actually
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,023	| IOT037-1 |	Over producing in Wipro
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:41,119	| IOT037-1 |	Balance of power hurdle up a bank account of power in with our electric pump
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:45,471	| IOT037-1 |	That's the big thing is Bitcoin mining people I got to pay for electricity
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,263	| IOT037-1 |	I don't have to say I think I might actually
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,799	| IOT037-1 |	Take us away further
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| IOT037-1 |	If you're going to do that
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,359	| IOT037-1 |	I don't recommend
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,151	| IOT037-1 |	Doing it on Raspberry Pi with
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,687	| IOT037-1 |	I bought the Avalon
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,735	| IOT037-1 |	Nano USB
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:59,807	| IOT037-1 |	Asic for this again $35 that cost me
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:03,903	| IOT037-1 |	It was a lot of fun it was challenging to I'm just getting the
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,463	| IOT037-1 |	The pie to recognize the USB port
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,511	| IOT037-1 |	For some reason was was a struggle that
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:11,839	| IOT037-1 |	You don't have to couple hours at anchor and I had a lot of fun doing it and I learned a lot
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,143	| IOT037-1 |	All right and so
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,167	| IOT037-1 |	We're talkin
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:18,495	| IOT037-1 |	Is it is it the $20 pie the $35 pie
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:24,383	| IOT037-1 |	I've had it for a while so I don't think the $35 one is probably one step down
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:29,247	| IOT037-1 |	The beauty is the pie can actually still be used as a regular pie was going on because
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,807	| IOT037-1 |	All of the processing for Bitcoin
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,575	| IOT037-1 |	Mining
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:35,135	| IOT037-1 |	Is offload to this USB dongle
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:38,207	| IOT037-1 |	It's to the point now where Bitcoin mining is so
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,231	| IOT037-1 |	Challenging
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,767	| IOT037-1 |	Intensive about Computing process
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:44,607	| IOT037-1 |	Irregular CPU or even most gpus it be a waste
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:48,447	| IOT037-1 |	She have to buy these very specific Bitcoin mining pieces
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,727	| IOT037-1 |	Is hard work I do at this point
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,007	| IOT037-1 |	So
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,799	| IOT037-1 |	Soledad is also did say
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,823	| IOT037-1 |	Did the pie
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:56,127	| IOT037-1 |	Utilization of the CP on the pies like 1%
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,895	| IOT037-1 |	I'm doing all this
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,711	| IOT037-1 |	I was going to say so I can't like offload
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,759	| IOT037-1 |	Sekrit like a city from my home
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,063	| IOT037-1 |	Call the computers in my home network
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:10,463	| IOT037-1 |	It's somebody it's funny you say that because I was doing crunches numbers for Saturday while I still can on another computer and
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,487	| IOT037-1 |	And before that
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,303	| IOT037-1 |	And I got to thinking why isn't anybody built
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,071	| IOT037-1 |	Those typos
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,607	| IOT037-1 |	Number crunching
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,911	| IOT037-1 |	Bits for for specific Hardware
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:22,495	| IOT037-1 |	You know it's probably just too expensive like a study program to do that but
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:26,591	| IOT037-1 |	It would be really interesting because they're so they're very application-specific
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,895	| IOT037-1 |	No you can't like uses for seti or something like that
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,479	| IOT037-1 |	It doesn't know how to do that
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,015	| IOT037-1 |	Candy with one thing and one thing on it
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,367	| IOT037-1 |	The funny thing
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,903	| IOT037-1 |	Lake Mead
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,183	| IOT037-1 |	4 senses
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,975	| IOT037-1 |	Month for $35
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,559	| IOT037-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,607	| IOT037-1 |	Why can several years that thing
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,119	| IOT037-1 |	Payforit
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,679	| IOT037-1 |	Yeah sure
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,727	| IOT037-1 |	And and you wrap the ice pack around it
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,007	| IOT037-1 |	FeFe
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:55,519	| IOT037-1 |	Don't go
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:00,895	| IOT037-1 |	All right well I sent you a picture of an ice pack extra that was my heatsink yes
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:03,711	| IOT037-1 |	I got to figure something out getting hot
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT037-1 |	Like I'm being sued that
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,807	| IOT037-1 |	Picture in the show notes Here
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,575	| IOT037-1 |	Just for fun
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:16,511	| IOT037-1 |	Yes that they're doing mining bitcoins on a Raspberry Pi door for pennies per month and we're using an ice pack
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,791	| IOT037-1 |	Turn the freezer as a heat sink
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:20,351	| IOT037-1 |	Adjust. It does not get any better than that
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:21,631	| IOT037-1 |	Nice
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| IOT037-1 |	The talent this is how we're paying for the pike
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,239	| IOT037-1 |	All right
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:28,799	| IOT037-1 |	Let's see also this week we had some
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,823	| IOT037-1 |	Some sad news
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,103	| IOT037-1 |	Happy news I don't know what to call
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,383	| IOT037-1 |	I will call it in
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:32,895	| IOT037-1 |	Determinate news
