EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,160	| IOT093 |	So
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,696	| IOT093 |	Let's get started
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:02,976	| IOT093 |	First off
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:06,048	| IOT093 |	There's no Kevin in the show it's all me and different versions
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:07,584	| IOT093 |	Even the CES showroom
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:10,400	| IOT093 |	In floor so there's going to be a little bit of noise in the back
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:13,472	| IOT093 |	Ground for some of these and some people are going to say
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:14,496	| IOT093 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,520	| IOT093 |	Echo's name
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:17,568	| IOT093 |	Consider yourself warned
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:19,872	| IOT093 |	But this is a fun show and doing something a little different
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:21,664	| IOT093 |	Wiko
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:23,200	| IOT093 |	I love all of the gadgets on display
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:27,040	| IOT093 |	Yes but my first job was to try to establish some sort of Baseline
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:30,112	| IOT093 |	Are We There Yet when it comes to mass adoption
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,416	| IOT093 |	Will this year be a year
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:33,696	| IOT093 |	But maybe that was the wrong
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,464	| IOT093 |	Question
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:36,256	| IOT093 |	Corey series the vice president of
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:36,768	| IOT093 |	Connect
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,864	| IOT093 |	Explains that maybe we won't know if we're there
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,144	| IOT093 |	Until we actually get there
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,704	| IOT093 |	You know we launched
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:46,240	| IOT093 |	Our first connecting garage opener
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:47,520	| IOT093 |	2011
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,568	| IOT093 |	It's hard to even think back to
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,080	| IOT093 |	The time when
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,872	| IOT093 |	Only 35%
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,384	| IOT093 |	People have smartphones
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,432	| IOT093 |	What really makes it hard for adoption to be mosque
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:56,224	| IOT093 |	If one of the requirements is
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| IOT093 |	Just have a mobile device
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:00,832	| IOT093 |	Software since then we're at well north of 70%
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,880	| IOT093 |	Most people are
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,160	| IOT093 |	Comfortable
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:04,928	| IOT093 |	Right
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:08,000	| IOT093 |	We're starting to move into the technology getting easy enough
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,280	| IOT093 |	App for people to bring it in
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,048	| IOT093 |	The homestand
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,840	| IOT093 |	The Experience on your
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| IOT093 |	Your phone is getting
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,888	| IOT093 |	The point where I think most people
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,448	| IOT093 |	Getting ready
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,216	| IOT093 |	Before
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:17,728	| IOT093 |	Understanding that you
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,544	| IOT093 |	I think there's a lot of building blocks happening
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,616	| IOT093 |	It's interesting conversations we have
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,384	| IOT093 |	In the industry
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,432	| IOT093 |	There's this idea that
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,968	| IOT093 |	This could be like this big bang moment
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:28,992	| IOT093 |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,040	| IOT093 |	There's going to be a big marketing event
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| IOT093 |	Like a day's going to happen
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:37,696	| IOT093 |	The whole home is going to be available like I was going to retail and it all be merchandising perfectly
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,512	| IOT093 |	It's really big
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| IOT093 |	Much less exciting
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,096	| IOT093 |	What I can say is
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,888	| IOT093 |	We've done a lot of work
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,192	| IOT093 |	I'll get over the last couple years and
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,472	| IOT093 |	Announce that this week
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,776	| IOT093 |	And see that
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,544	| IOT093 |	Ross
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,056	| IOT093 |	And really that's
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,104	| IOT093 |	One of a few different emerging
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,872	| IOT093 |	Standards
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,152	| IOT093 |	That's really
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| IOT093 |	Widely available
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,200	| IOT093 |	If you have an iPhone
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,504	| IOT093 |	You already have the home app
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,528	| IOT093 |	So do you think
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,064	| IOT093 |	Homekit is going to be
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,624	| IOT093 |	The Tipping Point or that one moment
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,928	| IOT093 |	Stacy so I'm not sure there is one
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,488	| IOT093 |	Amazon
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,256	| IOT093 |	Really impressive
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,304	| IOT093 |	Samsung are doing a great job
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,864	| IOT093 |	Inserting a really widen out with a
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,376	| IOT093 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,936	| IOT093 |	Nest has been a fantastic job
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,728	| IOT093 |	Google
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,008	| IOT093 |	As part of that
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,520	| IOT093 |	Story
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:24,800	| IOT093 |	Is really interesting
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,896	| IOT093 |	So is this just a part of the garage door openers I don't have any great
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| IOT093 |	Forecaster
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,736	| IOT093 |	I think that there are some really interesting
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,784	| IOT093 |	Building blocks that are happening
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| IOT093 |	Jason Johnson
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,624	| IOT093 |	The CEO of August

EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,792	| IOT093 |	I think there are more products
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:46,816	| IOT093 |	Amor homes
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,864	| IOT093 |	To say that there's more smart home
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,400	| IOT093 |	Strong
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:54,240	| IOT093 |	To use we're seeing these individual Point Solutions appear at home
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,288	| IOT093 |	And then and then people get a second item
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:01,664	| IOT093 |	Third item less than 6% of homes in North America or what we would
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:04,224	| IOT093 |	Call the smarthome insteon truly connected Can like

EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,552	| IOT093 |	I'm so we have a lot of work to do
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,832	| IOT093 |	To really create smart
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,600	| IOT093 |	Home spit
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:13,952	| IOT093 |	People are experimenting and they're trying these different devices and they get really satisfied with
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,607	| IOT093 |	Aside from the smart home there was smart everything's at the show
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| IOT093 |	Smart hair brushes

EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,287	| IOT093 |	Toys for children
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,823	| IOT093 |	It was crazy

EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,991	| IOT093 |	In a general skip
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| IOT093 |	To get a perspective
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,087	| IOT093 |	From someone who isn't selling anything smart
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,599	| IOT093 |	Water connected
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,927	| IOT093 |	I wanted to get his take on the state of gadgets at CES
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,487	| IOT093 |	He starts off by telling me what he

EDL	00:04:59,263	00:04:59,775	| IOT093 |	And
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,383	| IOT093 |	And how do you feel about that
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,919	| IOT093 |	Today is a really smart
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,735	| IOT093 |	And if they are lost Mayan

EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,631	| IOT093 |	Downstairs lights off
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,471	| IOT093 |	Like a child
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| IOT093 |	Because I have to leave
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,823	| IOT093 |	Things being that
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,639	| IOT093 |	Which is a worrying statement
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,759	| IOT093 |	Light switches work
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,039	| IOT093 |	It wasn't the worst thing ever
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,343	| IOT093 |	Be about them
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:49,695	| IOT093 |	So now I see us now that we know that you're kind of like an early adopter aficionado
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,231	| IOT093 |	What do you think of CVS

EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,911	| IOT093 |	Technology when
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,447	| IOT093 |	In what two directions
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT093 |	They said they going to do a v
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| IOT093 |	Real product
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,591	| IOT093 |	Three I'm going to make a drone for some reason
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,919	| IOT093 |	And they all look the same
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:15,551	| IOT093 |	And it doesn't matter it's just I must stick Wi-Fi in is I am waiting to find like a
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,087	| IOT093 |	Wifikill Austin

EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,479	| IOT093 |	She grabbed it and ran it through a hairbrush they did not like
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,271	| IOT093 |	And she described
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,295	| IOT093 |	And I paraphrase
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,319	| IOT093 |	As a cheap CVS
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| IOT093 |	So it wasn't even a nice happy

EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,167	| IOT093 |	But you're brushing too hard
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,703	| IOT093 |	Like hair is stiff
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,799	| IOT093 |	I just think it was just as amazing

EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,735	| IOT093 |	It doesn't even really thing
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,039	| IOT093 |	Kind of having a conversation about this
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,343	| IOT093 |	What would make sense if you could set

EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,775	| IOT093 |	And it suck LG and Samsung
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,287	| IOT093 |	I believe both
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:50,943	| IOT093 |	Sing this beats true for most people to load washer
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:55,551	| IOT093 |	Pretty cool so these washer dryer
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| IOT093 |	Stop loading
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,343	| IOT093 |	And front-load
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,439	| IOT093 |	So you can put inside a bunch of towels and you have some shirts
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,743	| IOT093 |	Need to be put on delicate so you can wash the towels

EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,575	| IOT093 |	Almost feel bad I put washer dryer in Lost
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,903	| IOT093 |	I'm excited about that washing machine
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,719	| IOT093 |	But I too found that Moen faucet I
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:35,999	| IOT093 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,559	| IOT093 |	So I found Michael pillow
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,351	| IOT093 |	A senior product manager at Moen
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,935	| IOT093 |	Ask why they replace the faucet with this weird
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| IOT093 |	Button pad
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,775	| IOT093 |	We looked at a lot of different designs
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| IOT093 |	Controller with all the
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,615	| IOT093 |	Buttons is what
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,431	| IOT093 |	Summer Resorts around the size of the button
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,479	| IOT093 |	The look of the button to texture
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,247	| IOT093 |	The way there
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,527	| IOT093 |	Raise off the controller
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,319	| IOT093 |	To make an easy to use without actually looking at
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,599	| IOT093 |	Controller
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:06,207	| IOT093 |	Orientation is over changing temperature change
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,535	| IOT093 |	Is this better than a faucet
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,351	| IOT093 |	Shower system
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,887	| IOT093 |	Precisely control temperature

EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,743	| IOT093 |	Location where that part of it that describes what the devices are
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,303	| IOT093 |	Or making it available over any IP based network
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,607	| IOT093 |	We're really excited to be partnering with a thread group
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,143	| IOT093 |	Stopping at the market first
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,215	| IOT093 |	We're looking forward to seeing all sorts of devices talking..
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,007	| IOT093 |	The cross thread based Networks
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,543	| IOT093 |	And I'm in the future other i p Bass neck
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,895	| IOT093 |	This means I could eventually have that. Talking over
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| IOT093 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,199	| IOT093 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:13,855	| IOT093 |	Everything is IP base should be able to talk.. And I see that's the vision and that's what we're we're bringing the market along with hundreds of other
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,695	| IOT093 |	Are active in the alliance many others
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:24,607	| IOT093 |	So if I'm a developer and I'm like I don't know what I'm going to do with it can you explain to me what the goal is
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,631	| IOT093 |	At this layer
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:30,239	| IOT093 |	The goal at this layer is really to give intelligence to the different devices that are on the various Networks
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,055	| IOT093 |	So I can tell a light bulb how to turn on and off
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,359	| IOT093 |	It doesn't matter whether I'm using a zigbee network
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,127	| IOT093 |	Thread Network
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| IOT093 |	Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,431	| IOT093 |	I'll be able to make that
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,199	| IOT093 |	That part
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:41,503	| IOT093 |	Happens a lot more easily with the.
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,039	| IOT093 |	City sounds like it's
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,111	| IOT093 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:53,023	| IOT093 |	I will right now we have a probably a lot more products actually deployed in the markets in those and we hope to actually be working
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:58,143	| IOT093 |	These different groups to align and harmonize a lot of what we have in all the different device object
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,167	| IOT093 |	Awesome okay
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,191	| IOT093 |	What should I expect
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:00,959	| IOT093 |	This year
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,727	| IOT093 |	From the alliance
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:08,127	| IOT093 |	From the alliance this year you should really start seeing that the first products are coming out with.. You also see hundreds of products
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,711	| IOT093 |	Other girl already really.. Abel through our zigbee
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:18,623	| IOT093 |	And speaking of Standards this is a good time to pop back in with a message for the open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,439	| IOT093 |	Who is the sponsor for this specials
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:25,279	| IOT093 |	CES edition of The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:31,679	| IOT093 |	Today I have VJ K7 who is chair of the business strategy working group for ocf
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:35,519	| IOT093 |	So let's kick it off why does the Internet of Things need a standard
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:41,151	| IOT093 |	I said I don't want to focus on putting together the basic Plumbing for devices
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:46,271	| IOT093 |	Talk to each other what I want to do is in the afternoon I just want to bring a device out of the box
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| IOT093 |	And I want
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,343	| IOT093 |	See that you can talk to other devices
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,135	| IOT093 |	I just buy a standard
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:54,719	| IOT093 |	Glad it was based on
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,231	| IOT093 |	Sleepless
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| IOT093 |	When was
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,791	| IOT093 |	The need for a standard
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,327	| IOT093 |	So that all devices
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,607	| IOT093 |	Talk the same language
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,655	| IOT093 |	The second is a certification
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,935	| IOT093 |	A device
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:06,751	| IOT093 |	135i ocse you know that
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,847	| IOT093 |	Easton talk to any other OCS 35 device
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,383	| IOT093 |	But also a reference
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,407	| IOT093 |	Implementation
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,223	| IOT093 |	So that's it to activate the development process
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:19,807	| IOT093 |	Open source implementation of the OCS specification
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,647	| IOT093 |	So that developers can take that open source code
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,439	| IOT093 |	Do a protocol utility
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:27,487	| IOT093 |	Under control Solutions on top of it
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:32,095	| IOT093 |	So why was the merger with all seen earlier this year important
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,607	| IOT093 |	For the Iowa
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:38,751	| IOT093 |	What are the three things to enable internet of things as you want a standard for devices
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,775	| IOT093 |	Talk to each other
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,823	| IOT093 |	Do you want a lot of consolidation
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,871	| IOT093 |	What is the very detrimental
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:50,015	| IOT093 |	Fragmentation of the standards and tie combination of the industry and also
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,039	| IOT093 |	He was trying to
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:57,439	| IOT093 |	Achieve the same goes because very logical for these two organizations to come together and what's going on
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,463	| IOT093 |	Indulge
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:03,839	| IOT093 |	Are utility is an open source project that is sponsored by open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,375	| IOT093 |	Anita's restaurant
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:09,471	| IOT093 |	Implementation of the OSHA standard what's going to happen is
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,031	| IOT093 |	Ocf and all things have come together
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:18,431	| IOT093 |	The first step is we want to make sure the device is from these two ecosystems can talk to each other
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:24,575	| IOT093 |	People that we are creating a bridge it just want to make sure that transparently devices that talk OCS or
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,367	| IOT093 |	Taco joint
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:29,695	| IOT093 |	Talk to each other and moving forward you're going to make sure
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| IOT093 |	The beaches
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,791	| IOT093 |	Best of the Best of Both Worlds can come together
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,327	| IOT093 |	In one standard
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| IOT093 |	Specification
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| IOT093 |	And how can a company get involved
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,167	| IOT093 |	With you
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| IOT093 |	They're minibeast
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,239	| IOT093 |	So you can company can get
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,263	| IOT093 |	Enroll in OTs
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,591	| IOT093 |	Strategy
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,663	| IOT093 |	Whether you're Building Products whether you're offering services
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:52,479	| IOT093 |	Opleiding intersection to the iot space
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:58,879	| IOT093 |	I think osseous is starting an organization you should consider joining because by joining the organization you can infer
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:03,487	| IOT093 |	Linda strategy in the direction of the Consortium you can influence the specification
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:06,047	| IOT093 |	The standardization work that is going on
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,071	| IOT093 |	You have the ability to
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:10,399	| IOT093 |	234 your products and build products that are OTF
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:13,983	| IOT093 |	We also encourage people to start using our utility
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,263	| IOT093 |	D2 Building Products
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,823	| IOT093 |	Introduce features into a utility
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| IOT093 |	And where can I go to find out more
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:23,199	| IOT093 |	Information about the open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:28,063	| IOT093 |	Open tentatively. Org website. To learn more about
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,111	| IOT093 |	The open-source implementation
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:34,463	| IOT093 |	Listen to implementation for OTs
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:44,959	| IOT093 |	And we're back with this week special CS edition of The Internet of Things podcast sponsored by the old
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,495	| IOT093 |	Open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:50,079	| IOT093 |	We're now moving into some of the deeper conversations I had while I was at
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:50,847	| IOT093 |	CS
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:55,967	| IOT093 |	Search is a fascinating talk with dr. Michael Bjorn who is head of research Ericsson consumerlab
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,527	| IOT093 |	He shared predictions with me about
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,575	| IOT093 |	Technology Trends facing us in
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,343	| IOT093 |	2017
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,695	| IOT093 |	All right Michael you have put out a list of 10
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| IOT093 |	Prediction
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,743	| IOT093 |	Sport this year
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,279	| IOT093 |	Is this year already
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,351	| IOT093 |	And we're not going to go into all of them
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,655	| IOT093 |	There were a couple that I thought were really exciting
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,679	| IOT093 |	Society podcast
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,727	| IOT093 |	Let's hit the iot predictions
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:21,567	| IOT093 |	So we have a trend about consumer setting the pace
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:22,847	| IOT093 |	The things
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,383	| IOT093 |	There we go
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,663	| IOT093 |	Asking
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| IOT093 |	People about what they think about them
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,503	| IOT093 |	The things we should say that
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,039	| IOT093 |	People don't really know
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| IOT093 |	What that means right
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,879	| IOT093 |	So instead we asking more complete things
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,903	| IOT093 |	Things we talked about
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,207	| IOT093 |	It's the fact that about half of
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,231	| IOT093 |	The people we surveyed
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,767	| IOT093 |	Would like to talk to household
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,535	| IOT093 |	Old appliances
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,863	| IOT093 |	Stop you walk around at CVS
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,143	| IOT093 |	UCLA
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,447	| IOT093 |	Nothing right now and it's actually very much related to
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,263	| IOT093 |	It's right that we called AI everywhere as well because
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,055	| IOT093 |	Internet of Things is kind of
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,567	| IOT093 |	One of the first
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,383	| IOT093 |	Applications I would say for AI assistants
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,943	| IOT093 |	So I think you should also be looking at
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:01,759	| IOT093 |	The uptake of all these new
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,039	| IOT093 |	AI assistant
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:05,343	| IOT093 |	That could be a litmus test for
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,879	| IOT093 |	How is the speed of internet
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,671	| IOT093 |	Developing out there
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,719	| IOT093 |	Okay cuz I seen a i
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:11,999	| IOT093 |	Toothbrushes
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,023	| IOT093 |	Which I was kind of like
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:18,911	| IOT093 |	I need a lot of time with my toothbrush but I've also seen some really interesting things
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:19,935	| IOT093 |	Autonomous
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,239	| IOT093 |	And that is also
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:22,751	| IOT093 |	Part of one of
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:27,103	| IOT093 |	Yes true but I think even though there's lots of cars here
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:32,735	| IOT093 |	I think we still tend to think about the driver perspective for cars
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,759	| IOT093 |	And of course if you
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,063	| IOT093 |	Is there a Thomas
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,879	| IOT093 |	So we decided we talked about the patent
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| IOT093 |	Respect you before this year with
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,463	| IOT093 |	We decided
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,231	| IOT093 |	Other
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,511	| IOT093 |	People out there in traffic
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,279	| IOT093 |	Pedestrians
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,351	| IOT093 |	A court of the people we talked to
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:52,191	| IOT093 |	They would like to actually have all cars being a
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,495	| IOT093 |	That would make them feel safer when they're crossing the street
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,543	| IOT093 |	Those are also the people who would like to have
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,943	| IOT093 |	Which I thought was really interesting as
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:07,039	| IOT093 |	How do you communicate as a pedestrian with an autonomous car
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,087	| IOT093 |	Because normally like if I'm going to do some
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,623	| IOT093 |	I'm crazy I'm going to make icon
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,903	| IOT093 |	Contact with the driver first
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,671	| IOT093 |	To be like him
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:15,231	| IOT093 |	Are you doing man I'm getting
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,511	| IOT093 |	But I can't do that with
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,327	| IOT093 |	How do we start thinking about
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,119	| IOT093 |	Crossing the street in front of line
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| IOT093 |	And or the standoff
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:24,191	| IOT093 |	I got to stop
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:27,007	| IOT093 |	You're like you're there I'm not going to go
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,567	| IOT093 |	What's your address and there's card in person because of cost
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,615	| IOT093 |	Once we get into situation with Iraq
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,407	| IOT093 |	Ashley Outlet on these cars out there on the streets
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,223	| IOT093 |	It doesn't mean that that's the only thing that's going to change
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:40,319	| IOT093 |	So actually the whole traffic situations going to change fundamentally
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,111	| IOT093 |	One of the things we looked into was
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:46,207	| IOT093 |	The fact that you know you have all the street signs and stuff up in the air
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT093 |	But if you're going to be
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:51,839	| IOT093 |	Add more focused on what you're doing with your smartphone maybe or other things
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,863	| IOT093 |	You looking down
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,423	| IOT093 |	So people would actually have liked to have
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| IOT093 |	Things
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| IOT093 |	Embedded
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,239	| IOT093 |	Example
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:01,055	| IOT093 |	And potentially also course I should be able to look on
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,591	| IOT093 |	On what's going on with the cars
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,663	| IOT093 |	Not having to look up in the air can expect
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,479	| IOT093 |	So we thought Wally how you know
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,271	| IOT093 |	Self-drive is not just for the cars
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:13,599	| IOT093 |	It's Russ we when we're walking we're doing other things we need some
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,391	| IOT093 |	Self-drive kind of functionality
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| IOT093 |	Aspidistra
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| IOT093 |	Awesome this is like Paul the billboard
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,792	| IOT093 |	It's going to go kaput
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| IOT093 |	What I could
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT093 |	Add to that that
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:28,448	| IOT093 |	Another Trend we talkin about here we called augmented personal reality
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:31,776	| IOT093 |	And actually that's about how you will be using a r
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,336	| IOT093 |	Potentially to customize a personalized
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,128	| IOT093 |	What you see around yourself in the world
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:39,712	| IOT093 |	So maybe do doors are not going to go food per se
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:43,808	| IOT093 |	How about if you can decide what you want to have on those Billboards yourself
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,648	| IOT093 |	So I find this trend really disturbing because we're already living in
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,184	| IOT093 |	Such a filter bubble as
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,000	| IOT093 |	Consumers of information
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,768	| IOT093 |	And even
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,560	| IOT093 |	Look at the US elections this year
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,864	| IOT093 |	And you're kind of like
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,144	| IOT093 |	Filter bubbles are bad
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:01,984	| IOT093 |	So when I think about augmented personal reality I'm like
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT093 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,568	| IOT093 |	I could avoid seeing things I don't want to see
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,360	| IOT093 |	And it's a little scary
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:13,760	| IOT093 |	Yeah actually I tried one of the other there a couple of new Tango Project Tango phones coming out here at csac
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,272	| IOT093 |	Release Spa
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| IOT093 |	Yesterday
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,344	| IOT093 |	The Asus Zenfone AR
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,136	| IOT093 |	I tried it out and actually
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:24,000	| IOT093 |	We had a bit of a hole in the wall
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,280	| IOT093 |	And I decided to put
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:27,072	| IOT093 |	Some piece of furniture in front of dad
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:32,704	| IOT093 |	I was pretty cool because I could do that on the screen and then what each time I looked at it this morning she was still there so I didn't have to see the hole in the wall
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| IOT093 |	That's not such a bad thing
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:37,056	| IOT093 |	Talk about person my session actually we
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:39,616	| IOT093 |	We talked about personalisation as a good thing right
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:43,968	| IOT093 |	Echo chamber social Silas kind of discussion
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,040	| IOT093 |	We decided it's just a bad thing I think it's actually human thing
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:49,088	| IOT093 |	This some good and some bad things with this
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,880	| IOT093 |	If you think about your
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,648	| IOT093 |	Neighborhood
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:56,000	| IOT093 |	Where you live maybe your other people like if it like you living in that neighborhood
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| IOT093 |	Is that a bad thing
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,816	| IOT093 |	Where's a good thing I think it's part of human life
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,376	| IOT093 |	And that's what happening online as well
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,704	| IOT093 |	You turning the online world into our digital neighborhood
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:07,264	| IOT093 |	And I think it's only human that we would like to see
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,056	| IOT093 |	People that are big like ourselves
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,824	| IOT093 |	Out there
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,104	| IOT093 |	And of course there's some
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,664	| IOT093 |	Ramifications of that that we need to deal with going for
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:17,760	| IOT093 |	That's true and I can actually now when I'm walking through the neighborhood
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,784	| IOT093 |	My neighbor has a
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,320	| IOT093 |	Hideously colored door and
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,088	| IOT093 |	Just be like
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,112	| IOT093 |	Making something pretty
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,392	| IOT093 |	You guys also
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:26,976	| IOT093 |	Because you conducted your focus groups for this or some of them with the VR users
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| IOT093 |	You guys discovered something else
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,560	| IOT093 |	Huli resonated with me
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| IOT093 |	So
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:35,168	| IOT093 |	Just go ahead you call it bodies out of sync and I was like oh is that like
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,192	| IOT093 |	Drake dance
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| IOT093 |	But instead it's actually
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:40,032	| IOT093 |	But it's actually about the fact that
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:42,080	| IOT093 |	Yeah this a lot of technology changed
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,872	| IOT093 |	Sometimes it's hard to keep up right
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:46,944	| IOT093 |	Mentally speaking
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:50,784	| IOT093 |	So when we did VR virtual reality research in
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| IOT093 |	Virtual
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| IOT093 |	Reality world
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:57,184	| IOT093 |	We realize that a lot of the people there were already talking about getting their VR legs
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:59,488	| IOT093 |	Your legs
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:03,840	| IOT093 |	What does it's a bit like in semen they used to talk about sea legs so
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,400	| IOT093 |	You need to get used to this sort of this
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:09,984	| IOT093 |	This is the waves coming and going and not become seasick from that
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:16,128	| IOT093 |	And that's what's happening at actually also with virtual reality if you think about that so one of the vision
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,200	| IOT093 |	Mobile
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:19,968	| IOT093 |	Living room
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:22,272	| IOT093 |	In the car or your mobile workspace or something
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:25,088	| IOT093 |	You've tried reading in the back of the bus
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,136	| IOT093 |	But some of us can do it I was kind
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| IOT093 |	We we need
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,184	| IOT093 |	Car sickness pills
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:32,256	| IOT093 |	And telling us that you know this is probably
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:32,768	| IOT093 |	Maybe even more
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:36,096	| IOT093 |	That's all well and good for the big picture
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:41,216	| IOT093 |	But what can CPS tell us about what to expect for 2017 when it comes to the Smart Home
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,288	| IOT093 |	For that I turn back to Jason Johnson of August
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,312	| IOT093 |	To get his tag
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:49,664	| IOT093 |	The voice is really becoming a mainstream interface for the home
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:54,528	| IOT093 |	And all the announcements of the companies are integrating voice capabilities into their products
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,320	| IOT093 |	Tells us this is really moving to mainstream
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,880	| IOT093 |	New Amazon the echo devices
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| IOT093 |	Pave the way
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,464	| IOT093 |	For others to integrate that capability
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,000	| IOT093 |	And allows two
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:07,584	| IOT093 |	To do a lot of great things in our home by not having to pull our phone out of her pocket
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,096	| IOT093 |	Open app
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:13,216	| IOT093 |	What seems certain is that we're still not getting a single standard to make all of our devices
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT093 |	Interoperate
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,032	| IOT093 |	Grant Erickson the president of the thread group
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,592	| IOT093 |	Says we're probably going to have
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:24,224	| IOT093 |	I think it's going to actually be a while Stacy until we see that convergence there's a lot of
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:27,296	| IOT093 |	Different value propositions that each of the different players bring to the table
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:31,904	| IOT093 |	Isaac vegan has a very very strong history of strong products
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,696	| IOT093 |	What their applications
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,744	| IOT093 |	Google NASA me bring their own
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:42,144	| IOT093 |	Value to that ecosystem
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT093 |	They bring
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,080	| IOT093 |	Consolidation anime impact
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT093 |	They all
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:55,712	| IOT093 |	Exists for a long time and there's interoperability and Gateway is another solution to come in the market
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,248	| IOT093 |	Smith's Raleigh sink work well together
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,528	| IOT093 |	As a consumer what is
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,552	| IOT093 |	This mean if I'm like
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,600	| IOT093 |	Crap
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,624	| IOT093 |	What do I do
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| IOT093 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,416	| IOT093 |	There's no reason to wait
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:08,512	| IOT093 |	There's great Solutions there's integrators to make all the stuff work together
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,072	| IOT093 |	Before we get too mired into the standards debate
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:14,656	| IOT093 |	Consumer should prepare for another challenge hitting the market in
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,168	| IOT093 |	2017
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,704	| IOT093 |	Subscription play
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,776	| IOT093 |	Zach supalla the ceo of particle
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,824	| IOT093 |	And iot development platform
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:26,432	| IOT093 |	Explains why his customers are rethinking how they charge for
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| IOT093 |	Connected products
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,760	| IOT093 |	So we see some customers
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:33,600	| IOT093 |	Who are trying to operate their businesses away.
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,136	| IOT093 |	Github always operate
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,672	| IOT093 |	It cost me $40 to make
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,208	| IOT093 |	Birthing sl400
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,768	| IOT093 |	There's $60 left I split it with the distributor everybody goes
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,840	| IOT093 |	That's the old-fashioned way selling Hardware
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:46,656	| IOT093 |	But without me there's an ongoing cost associated with
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:49,728	| IOT093 |	The product ID your paying a platform company or you're paying
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,496	| IOT093 |	Cellular data plan
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:51,776	| IOT093 |	Or you're paying
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,848	| IOT093 |	Someone to host your Cloud software something cost
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,152	| IOT093 |	And
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:00,224	| IOT093 |	If you behave in an old-fashioned way you get frustrated because your margin is
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,552	| IOT093 |	Other companies are relying on ongoing
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,064	| IOT093 |	Reminisce
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,344	| IOT093 |	Like
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,624	| IOT093 |	Consumables reordering like
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,160	| IOT093 |	Subscription fees
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:11,744	| IOT093 |	To make the economics work for 90 product and those companies are General
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,024	| IOT093 |	Successful
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:16,864	| IOT093 |	Now that requires educating customers and often works better and Industrial
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:21,472	| IOT093 |	And Commercial environments where companies are more willing to pay a recurring revenue for ongoing value
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:23,008	| IOT093 |	And consumers are still warming up
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,032	| IOT093 |	To that but
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:27,104	| IOT093 |	Those companies are working out and the companies with
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,896	| IOT093 |	A fixed margin and ongoing
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,664	| IOT093 |	Costs
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,688	| IOT093 |	Are struggling to figure out how to make
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,272	| IOT093 |	And is there a way for that to work works if you grow fast
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:39,392	| IOT093 |	It works if you are sales grow faster than your castas and and you have
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,928	| IOT093 |	Central growth it works
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,488	| IOT093 |	But if that doesn't happen you end up
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,768	| IOT093 |	Holding the bag of a lot of cost
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,048	| IOT093 |	Revenue to support
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:51,168	| IOT093 |	And ideally you're doing that why you grow and eventually you're going to pop a subscription plan or something on top of
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,704	| IOT093 |	Or some other way to create online
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,984	| IOT093 |	I think that's as good example
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,776	| IOT093 |	That is fundamentally a product
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,312	| IOT093 |	Taipei fixed cost for
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,104	| IOT093 |	But they have other ways engaging with
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,384	| IOT093 |	Power companies to do
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,408	| IOT093 |	Response
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:06,528	| IOT093 |	There are other sources of revenue that either they do today or they can do in the future that eventually close the gate
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:10,624	| IOT093 |	Hopefully alternative revenue streams give Nest the chance to last
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,160	| IOT093 |	Otherwise
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:12,672	| IOT093 |	Google will
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:15,744	| IOT093 |	But all other connected products out there
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:18,560	| IOT093 |	Should be working hard to add features worth paying for
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,888	| IOT093 |	All in the podcast and what feels like an optimistic
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:24,960	| IOT093 |	Manufacturers are thinking about their business models
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:31,360	| IOT093 |	And how to keep supporting these products through several iterations of new standards or upgraded technology
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:38,272	| IOT093 |	Much has been made of Intel introducing a smart card format that would allow device makers to add more brains to their products.
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:43,392	| IOT093 |	Down the road the products would have to have an Intel processor inside and we need a slot that would fit the card
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,976	| IOT093 |	But it's a nice way of thinking ahead for a device that could live for
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,512	| IOT093 |	For 10 to 20 years in your home
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:52,096	| IOT093 |	Best eyelid with Corey series of Chamberlain
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:57,728	| IOT093 |	Who's back to spell out how he thinks this race to fit standards and more features on a product
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,008	| IOT093 |	Play out for the time being
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,544	| IOT093 |	I'll give you a hint
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,360	| IOT093 |	It's going to involve more hubs
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:06,176	| IOT093 |	You know I think it's an interesting challenge
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,712	| IOT093 |	When our goal is
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,992	| IOT093 |	Chamberlain is the build
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,528	| IOT093 |	A quality
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:12,064	| IOT093 |	Highly reliable pocket Alaska
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,880	| IOT093 |	And Technology changes every two
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,928	| IOT093 |	And we're trying to accommodate that in our products
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,440	| IOT093 |	Kohl's
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:21,792	| IOT093 |	And what we want to do is say your accessories and ways for you to
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,584	| IOT093 |	Keep up with technology space
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| IOT093 |	Without you
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,376	| IOT093 |	Tearing out the entire
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:27,936	| IOT093 |	Price Chopper nobody wants to do that we know that
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,984	| IOT093 |	So we launched a product
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,520	| IOT093 |	Announced the launch of a product
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:34,336	| IOT093 |	I'll come out in April called the MyQ home Bridge
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:36,896	| IOT093 |	They'll allow existing MyQ users
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,432	| IOT093 |	The ability
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,456	| IOT093 |	Top rated homekit
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:42,784	| IOT093 |	As an additional accessory to
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:45,856	| IOT093 |	They're either existing garage opener with MyQ or two
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,696	| IOT093 |	Alright y'all get ready for more bridges
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,208	| IOT093 |	More
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:55,840	| IOT093 |	We're almost through with this year's special CES edition of The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:59,936	| IOT093 |	What do I find a word from our sponsor and then I'm going to tell you my favorite device
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,216	| IOT093 |	The whole show
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,264	| IOT093 |	Ceviche
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,056	| IOT093 |	What is 2017 look like
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,336	| IOT093 |	For the
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:06,848	| IOT093 |	Open connect
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:11,200	| IOT093 |	So we can look at it from different vectors
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:14,272	| IOT093 |	What sort of product announcement from
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:17,344	| IOT093 |	Member companies of ocf announcing that they have
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:20,672	| IOT093 |	35 products in the market number to one of the key
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:22,464	| IOT093 |	He goes as far as to make sure
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:28,864	| IOT093 |	Did the OTF ecosystem and the all seeing ecosystem completely the devices on these two ecosystems
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,912	| IOT093 |	Talk to each other very transparently
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,728	| IOT093 |	Is going to be out there in 2017
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,776	| IOT093 |	Beyond.
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,800	| IOT093 |	Is going to start
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:41,408	| IOT093 |	Putting resources into more verticals and the specification for other vehicles
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,688	| IOT093 |	Like healthcare
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,968	| IOT093 |	Industrial
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:45,248	| IOT093 |	Transportation
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:48,576	| IOT093 |	Mexico utility from an open-source perspective
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:51,136	| IOT093 |	You're going to see support or more additional
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,904	| IOT093 |	Platform
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,672	| IOT093 |	Weather is
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:55,488	| IOT093 |	Hardware operating system that's already and
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:59,840	| IOT093 |	Constraints implementation of iot that is out there for embedded devices
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,632	| IOT093 |	You'll see. Getting in her
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,424	| IOT093 |	A new start to see more and more
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,192	| IOT093 |	TeacherTube
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:09,056	| IOT093 |	Expand into new areas like enabling be better connectivity options to the cloud
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,360	| IOT093 |	Breathing into other ecosystems
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,384	| IOT093 |	Normocephalic
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,712	| IOT093 |	Alright y'all
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:18,016	| IOT093 |	It's time for my favorite device
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:21,088	| IOT093 |	It's been roundly bought in the Press
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:24,160	| IOT093 |	But my favorite device from the entire CES
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,440	| IOT093 |	Was
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,464	| IOT093 |	The microbots
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:26,976	| IOT093 |	Push
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,792	| IOT093 |	This is a $50 robot
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,328	| IOT093 |	That you attached to it
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,376	| IOT093 |	Button on a dumb Appliance
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:35,936	| IOT093 |	And you can program it and it pushes the button for you
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,216	| IOT093 |	Bus
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:40,800	| IOT093 |	My coffee maker which is not smart but cost a lot of money
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:43,616	| IOT093 |	I can now make it smart by adding this button presser thing
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,944	| IOT093 |	This is not a device for the mainstream
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,712	| IOT093 |	But
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,224	| IOT093 |	I really liked
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:52,832	| IOT093 |	And that's it for the special CES edition of The Internet of Things podcast
