EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:26,624	| IOT206 |	At the edge
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:29,440	| IOT206 |	We've got Apple buying some patent
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:29,952	| IOT206 |	Consider of in
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:33,280	| IOT206 |	I want an echo Auto
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:35,840	| IOT206 |	We got a new August video doorbell
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:37,632	| IOT206 |	Get some tips for madam
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:38,144	| IOT206 |	A
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,680	| IOT206 |	Got a dead robot

EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,568	| IOT206 |	And
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,104	| IOT206 |	We're going to hear how
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,640	| IOT206 |	Mitsubishi Bank
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:49,408	| IOT206 |	Has
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,176	| IOT206 |	Connected
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:51,968	| IOT206 |	Any devices using the affair
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:57,600	| IOT206 |	We're going to hear from Chrissy Mayer Who is a partner at root Ventures
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:59,392	| IOT206 |	She's going to explain why Ark
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,928	| IOT206 |	Connected devices cost
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:02,208	| IOT206 |	Souderton
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,792	| IOT206 |	Let's get this party started
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:07,072	| IOT206 |	But first
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:07,840	| IOT206 |	A message
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:08,608	| IOT206 |	From our sponsor
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:15,776	| IOT206 |	This week sponsor is Western Digital Western Digital builds Data Solutions that enable the world to see
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:18,848	| IOT206 |	The biggest challenges
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:25,248	| IOT206 |	What's your digital is introducing its most advanced flash storage solution the eu5
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:30,368	| IOT206 |	511 this is built to empower 5G mobile devices it'll allow you to
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:36,768	| IOT206 |	Play board games save more memories and binge more videos so get ready for
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:40,096	| IOT206 |	5G future at Western Digital.
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:42,656	| IOT206 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,168	| IOT206 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,472	| IOT206 |	I guess we're going to start off with
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,240	| IOT206 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,056	| IOT206 |	So Google has
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:49,824	| IOT206 |	Anu
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,848	| IOT206 |	Development board
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,360	| IOT206 |	Let's talk about that
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:53,920	| IOT206 |	Actually announced
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:02:00,320	| IOT206 |	This last year at the Google next conference that's a big cloud conference
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:00,832	| IOT206 |	Products
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,368	| IOT206 |	Now they are
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,672	| IOT206 |	Launched in beta
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,720	| IOT206 |	Name is coral as you would said
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,024	| IOT206 |	When is a USB stick
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:12,096	| IOT206 |	Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,144	| IOT206 |	Ginormous
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:20,544	| IOT206 |	Heatsink and fan on the processor I would have thought it was a Raspberry Pi but it's not it is
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,080	| IOT206 |	I'm bored
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:26,432	| IOT206 |	Google's Edge TPU that's their tensorflow processing unit
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:31,552	| IOT206 |	So for example you could connect this to a camera device
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| IOT206 |	What
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:38,720	| IOT206 |	Google says it can use state-of-the-art mobile Vision models up to a hundred or more frames per second
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,744	| IOT206 |	Power efficient manner
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:44,864	| IOT206 |	Very specific types of processing again at the edge
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,448	| IOT206 |	I think these are development
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:52,032	| IOT206 |	This is really geared towards people that want to build products using it so
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:58,688	| IOT206 |	Other product announcements but this has tons of potential and I know you're all about processing at the edge so
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| IOT206 |	You're going to tell us what the potential as I suspect
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,784	| IOT206 |	Yes so
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:07,136	| IOT206 |	This is in line with what movie is Intel with its movidius stick
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:09,184	| IOT206 |	Actually offered about a year-and-a-half ago
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| IOT206 |	And
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,744	| IOT206 |	Right now we're looking at these on Lake
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,536	| IOT206 |	Computers these are USB sticks
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:16,352	| IOT206 |	Do you plug in the computers but imagine being able to plug this into
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,912	| IOT206 |	Like a video camera is Kevin mentioned
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,984	| IOT206 |	Or even unlike an industrial iot Gateway
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:24,544	| IOT206 |	And what you're going to be able to do is you're going to have
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,312	| IOT206 |	You'll have to
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,848	| IOT206 |	Pre-trained your algorithm in the cloud
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| IOT206 |	But this allows you to do
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,432	| IOT206 |	Inference at the edge
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,272	| IOT206 |	It's computer vision is one thing you could do
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,576	| IOT206 |	Predictive maintenance kind of algorithms
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,392	| IOT206 |	You could actually do a lot like even like anomaly detection
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,952	| IOT206 |	Would be a really good one
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,720	| IOT206 |	So
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:47,072	| IOT206 |	The sky's the limit here and we don't actually even really know how we're going to use
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:47,840	| IOT206 |	I can even see it
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,144	| IOT206 |	Processor
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:52,192	| IOT206 |	Inside a car but
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| IOT206 |	Getting your bikes
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,008	| IOT206 |	That I don't know
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,056	| IOT206 |	Think about all these fun
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,128	| IOT206 |	Computer vision or better AI
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,200	| IOT206 |	Oil processing would be another
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,992	| IOT206 |	Oh yeah they doing
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,040	| IOT206 |	Expanding your wake word
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,576	| IOT206 |	Capabilities might be an option
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,136	| IOT206 |	So much
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,160	| IOT206 |	Very exciting
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,488	| IOT206 |	Look for that if you are into building this sort of thing if you're not
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:19,071	| IOT206 |	Send all those people were building it look for in like a year to having
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:23,679	| IOT206 |	Just even better machine learning at the edge that could be applied to Machine Vision
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,703	| IOT206 |	Anomaly detection
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,471	| IOT206 |	Audio
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| IOT206 |	I don't even know what
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,311	| IOT206 |	Whatever you desire
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:34,687	| IOT206 |	As long as you have $150 cuz that's the cost of the coral to report
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,039	| IOT206 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| IOT206 |	Wicked
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,623	| IOT206 |	Actually I did mention this to the beginning which is
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| IOT206 |	A shape
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,439	| IOT206 |	We have a bankruptcy filing in the smart home space
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| IOT206 |	So I feel like
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,535	| IOT206 |	Last month in February
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,815	| IOT206 |	Centralite
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,583	| IOT206 |	Which makes
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| IOT206 |	Bunch of sensors in
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| IOT206 |	It is supposed to be sent
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,703	| IOT206 |	They filed for chapter 7
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,775	| IOT206 |	And chapter 7 means
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,311	| IOT206 |	Are not coming back from
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,919	| IOT206 |	Chapter 11 is restructuring chapter 7 is like we are done
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:06,943	| IOT206 |	We are closing
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,735	| IOT206 |	This looks like
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,807	| IOT206 |	Someone had sent this into us and they're like this might be because of
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:17,439	| IOT206 |	You know the end of Lowe's Iris central nervous system
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:20,767	| IOT206 |	Shut that system down or is in the process of shutting that system down
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:25,375	| IOT206 |	They also made the sensors that were used by Xfinity
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,143	| IOT206 |	And some other
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,215	| IOT206 |	Pink are two things here
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,263	| IOT206 |	When is the end of the year
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,079	| IOT206 |	Companies buying this trap in their own
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,847	| IOT206 |	Phone brand to sell
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,943	| IOT206 |	Lesson focus on sensors and
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,015	| IOT206 |	We all thought this was going to be like
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,319	| IOT206 |	People were going to buy these cool sensors
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:47,135	| IOT206 |	Create these cool longtail applications for iot
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,415	| IOT206 |	Way back at the early days of this
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,719	| IOT206 |	That's not actually what happened
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,511	| IOT206 |	Instead what we seeing is
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:56,607	| IOT206 |	A lot of the heavy lifting has been done by you
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,399	| IOT206 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:00,959	| IOT206 |	And sensors have been a pretty small part of
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| IOT206 |	For the mainstream
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| IOT206 |	Hyatt
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,543	| IOT206 |	So
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,615	| IOT206 |	I tried to get a list of deaths that these guys have all like
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:10,175	| IOT206 |	Could get was the list of creditors
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,967	| IOT206 |	Pretty much as you would expect
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,247	| IOT206 |	Their basic
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,527	| IOT206 |	Lourdes
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,319	| IOT206 |	Cable service providers
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| IOT206 |	Nothing really exceptional
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,879	| IOT206 |	I didn't see anything
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:26,303	| IOT206 |	And if you bite
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,839	| IOT206 |	You have until
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,375	| IOT206 |	May 28th
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,143	| IOT206 |	This year
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| IOT206 |	To file your
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:32,959	| IOT206 |	Claims
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,103	| IOT206 |	He comes later in the show. But maybe we should talk about something else too
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,383	| IOT206 |	Say goodbye to
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,967	| IOT206 |	Wish I could say something a saying goodbye to us if you think about it
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,783	| IOT206 |	Yes we also have another goodbye
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,575	| IOT206 |	We actually saw this goodbye
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,927	| IOT206 |	Lighthouse which made a connected
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,999	| IOT206 |	Which also had a Time
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,767	| IOT206 |	A flight
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,303	| IOT206 |	Sensor in it they gave it
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,327	| IOT206 |	Really exceptional
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| IOT206 |	Depth perception
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,143	| IOT206 |	This allowed it to get a lot
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,447	| IOT206 |	More information about the environment
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,215	| IOT206 |	Even more accurate
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,263	| IOT206 |	But beyond that
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:10,847	| IOT206 |	It had voice recognition that it been translated into automatic
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:14,687	| IOT206 |	So I might tell the camera do you like your lighthouse
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:19,295	| IOT206 |	If you don't see my dog walker by 4 p.m. today send me a note
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:19,807	| IOT206 |	Application
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,647	| IOT206 |	And what it would do is it would take that command which is really complicated
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,975	| IOT206 |	To do it would recognize it and then parse that out and then
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,559	| IOT206 |	If it did not see the person it new as your dog walker
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,607	| IOT206 |	By that time
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,631	| IOT206 |	It would be like
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,167	| IOT206 |	Hey yo your dog
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,751	| IOT206 |	That kind of usability is
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT206 |	Pretty exceptional
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| IOT206 |	The downside was It was a
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| IOT206 |	Very expensive
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,383	| IOT206 |	A subscription
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:44,895	| IOT206 |	The associate
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,431	| IOT206 |	So
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,455	| IOT206 |	The company did not do well
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| IOT206 |	Shut down
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,367	| IOT206 |	But
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,463	| IOT206 |	There's been a lot of talk about
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT206 |	Siri
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,303	| IOT206 |	The homepod and how it's
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,095	| IOT206 |	It's not an awesome experience
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,119	| IOT206 |	But
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,911	| IOT206 |	With something like
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,215	| IOT206 |	That capability
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,751	| IOT206 |	Become an awesome experience
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,055	| IOT206 |	What will be interesting is
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:17,663	| IOT206 |	Such a platform would have to be expensive because you would need all that ready
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,687	| IOT206 |	Are you ready for this
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,759	| IOT206 |	That machine learning at the edge that we talked about
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:24,063	| IOT206 |	To really understand it
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,855	| IOT206 |	Parse all those commands
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| IOT206 |	And understand what it was looking
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:31,487	| IOT206 |	And somehow that dated actually does have to get to the Cloud
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:35,327	| IOT206 |	I guess it could be aggregated data so what we'll see how it does that
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,863	| IOT206 |	It still has that app
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,399	| IOT206 |	Privacy
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| IOT206 |	I think
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,959	| IOT206 |	Lighthouse
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,239	| IOT206 |	Was ahead of its time
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:44,031	| IOT206 |	Nothing much
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,847	| IOT206 |	But I suspect that in the business model you know what
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| IOT206 |	Subscription to use Etc
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:53,247	| IOT206 |	It's what heard it and it's typical Apple to wait for a great product
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,527	| IOT206 |	Market open up
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:59,391	| IOT206 |	And then go Apple Magic to make it simple to use etcetera so
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,975	| IOT206 |	I'll be interested to see if they use it for any
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,255	| IOT206 |	Homekit
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,535	| IOT206 |	Devices of Their Own
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,071	| IOT206 |	Cuz I don't think they would
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,119	| IOT206 |	License without 2
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,911	| IOT206 |	Other Hardware makers
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:17,055	| IOT206 |	It's also possible they just want to improve face detection on the phone
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| IOT206 |	That's true I mean
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,431	| IOT206 |	Possible
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,455	| IOT206 |	Awesome Face detach
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,735	| IOT206 |	All right
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,807	| IOT206 |	So that's
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,087	| IOT206 |	Not so long ago.
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,135	| IOT206 |	There is actually a recent death
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,439	| IOT206 |	Cash
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,303	| IOT206 |	The most morbid podcast
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:44,447	| IOT206 |	The my buddy that actually glad I did not drop $900 on
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,031	| IOT206 |	Jibo robot
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:53,663	| IOT206 |	Which we knew that Jibo was shutting down
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,759	| IOT206 |	And everybody who bought a Jeep
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,551	| IOT206 |	So you going to have a useless
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,831	| IOT206 |	Jibo robot
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| IOT206 |	It's done
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,439	| IOT206 |	The company credit
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:08,255	| IOT206 |	Geebo itself
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,303	| IOT206 |	The robot itself in people's homes is
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:17,215	| IOT206 |	Saying things like
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| IOT206 |	Around
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,543	| IOT206 |	It's kind of cute and funny it's up to make
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,079	| IOT206 |	Bad situation somewhat
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| IOT206 |	Easier to deal with but
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,639	| IOT206 |	$900 brick
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,735	| IOT206 |	I came close to buy on two
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,503	| IOT206 |	I know you did
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,807	| IOT206 |	This was a case
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:35,135	| IOT206 |	It being announced really early and then the functionality just
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:41,023	| IOT206 |	Skyrocketing ahead in this was like going to be like a Amazon Echo on Wheels basically
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,047	| IOT206 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,583	| IOT206 |	Got so much better so
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,655	| IOT206 |	Satchel
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| IOT206 |	There is a new product out
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,727	| IOT206 |	And it's worth talking about
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,775	| IOT206 |	August
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,591	| IOT206 |	Made the August lock and the August video doorbell
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,895	| IOT206 |	And was bought by us
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:01,247	| IOT206 |	Has a brain bailout
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:01,759	| IOT206 |	Meet
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,575	| IOT206 |	It is neat for a couple of reasons one
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,599	| IOT206 |	It has no wires
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,183	| IOT206 |	It is $230
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:13,535	| IOT206 |	And 3 It is Well designed and unlike the last doorbell switch
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,839	| IOT206 |	Cool looking squares this is
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,607	| IOT206 |	Something that quote
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,143	| IOT206 |	Looks like a doorbell
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:23,775	| IOT206 |	It does it looks like a doorbell there's lots of different options at least 8 to choose from to match your
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,055	| IOT206 |	Homes exterior
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,591	| IOT206 |	230 on the prices
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:31,967	| IOT206 |	Nest hello is why
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,759	| IOT206 |	And this has a remote
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,831	| IOT206 |	Thought I paid 204 - 2
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,111	| IOT206 |	You probably got it on a cool day
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,135	| IOT206 |	MSRP
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,207	| IOT206 |	Oh I could be
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,743	| IOT206 |	So I'm going to hold off
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:49,631	| IOT206 |	Being very excited about this until I can try it in the reason is because I actually have
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,423	| IOT206 |	The first gen and 2nd gen
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| IOT206 |	August doorbell camera
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,727	| IOT206 |	The first gen was it
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:54,751	| IOT206 |	Nautica
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,311	| IOT206 |	I'll just be honest
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,335	| IOT206 |	Didn't have
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| IOT206 |	You know at night
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| IOT206 |	It had no
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,943	| IOT206 |	Lighting options
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:06,527	| IOT206 |	If your street was dark you were just out of luck you can see who is at your door
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:07,807	| IOT206 |	This kind of glitchy
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,343	| IOT206 |	I didn't love it
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:14,975	| IOT206 |	The next version fixed a lot of those
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,791	| IOT206 |	HD video resolution it's got night vision
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,583	| IOT206 |	Digital Zoom
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,887	| IOT206 |	It's got the remote chime
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,191	| IOT206 |	So yeah we're going to just see how it works
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:28,287	| IOT206 |	It also has a little bit of a limitation unless you want to pay five bucks a month
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,079	| IOT206 |	Does it how it has a
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,591	| IOT206 |	Video recording
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:35,967	| IOT206 |	Yeah so you can do a livestream at anytime if you want to see eclipse
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:42,111	| IOT206 |	Set a recording when it sees motion you can only see 5 seconds and they only hang around for the last 24 hours
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,439	| IOT206 |	If you want to pay
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT206 |	See
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:50,047	| IOT206 |	So actually I don't have a problem with the current setting I have
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,655	| IOT206 |	So prior to August
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:58,751	| IOT206 |	Sickness
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,567	| IOT206 |	Press on the
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,687	| IOT206 |	And I do pay $10 a month
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:11,807	| IOT206 |	Two nest for my Nest hello doorbell video
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,855	| IOT206 |	I had a nest cam in my front window
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,975	| IOT206 |	And an SD card
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,999	| IOT206 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| IOT206 |	Cheap
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,815	| IOT206 |	We are cheap cheap
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,375	| IOT206 |	I am singing
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| IOT206 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:30,239	| IOT206 |	Other than August video doorbell
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT206 |	I'll try it
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,335	| IOT206 |	When it comes out and let you guys know
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| IOT206 |	Pretty much every doorbell out there
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| IOT206 |	And have strong feelings about the
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,479	| IOT206 |	There's something else you want to try and I don't I guess I don't know why
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:45,343	| IOT206 |	Yeah I want the echo Auto I saw a story in wired about how Amazon
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:48,927	| IOT206 |	Did voice recognition and search for the noisy car environment
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,439	| IOT206 |	For the echo Auto
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,767	| IOT206 |	And I don't have my invite yet Amazon is
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,815	| IOT206 |	It's getting them out an invite only basis
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,375	| IOT206 |	Really want
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,399	| IOT206 |	And the reason is
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| IOT206 |	I
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,471	| IOT206 |	Constantly want to ask
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,335	| IOT206 |	Not necessarily to do anything in my home
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,103	| IOT206 |	I'm just like
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,895	| IOT206 |	Hey what's that
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,967	| IOT206 |	What's that song and you like Stacy why don't you do that
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| IOT206 |	Google Assistant

EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| IOT206 |	SYM
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,463	| IOT206 |	Now I understand
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:28,095	| IOT206 |	There She Goes she's talking to me but she will never ever answer my request because
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,143	| IOT206 |	I logged into the wrong account

EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,567	| IOT206 |	I have spent
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,615	| IOT206 |	Trying to figure out
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,943	| IOT206 |	Reason is
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,991	| IOT206 |	My daughter wants to be able to she doesn't like to
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,527	| IOT206 |	Google she doesn't have her own
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:49,599	| IOT206 |	Spice so she wants to just be able
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,111	| IOT206 |	Able to ask Matt
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:56,255	| IOT206 |	I don't know if it's going to allow you to play liked songs from Spotify over your car stereo
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,791	| IOT206 |	But
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:00,607	| IOT206 |	That would be awesome if it did or if it just played them for me
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,375	| IOT206 |	There
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,167	| IOT206 |	That would also be a reason to why
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,191	| IOT206 |	Want that despite the fact
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,703	| IOT206 |	I have a Tesla
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,775	| IOT206 |	Ask it to play me all kinds of
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| IOT206 |	I really just want to talk to one taken
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:15,711	| IOT206 |	Great. Now I get it it's fifty bucks for this
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:23,135	| IOT206 |	It's not expensive it's it you know you can plug it into USB or if you have an older car with a cigarette lighter 12 volt
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:25,183	| IOT206 |	You can connect it to your car speakers
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,975	| IOT206 |	So I suspect you can have
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| IOT206 |	Play music if you
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:32,351	| IOT206 |	Tulsa design
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:34,143	| IOT206 |	Road noise
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:37,471	| IOT206 |	Other things so using the phone may not be the best
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,543	| IOT206 |	Smartwatch
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,823	| IOT206 |	Get information by voice
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,359	| IOT206 |	And we have a ton of
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| IOT206 |	Questions I mean
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,967	| IOT206 |	When you get a twelve-year-old riding in the backseat or multiple 12 year olds
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:51,039	| IOT206 |	We have a lot of things we want to inquire about
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,319	| IOT206 |	Randomly on the road
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,599	| IOT206 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,671	| IOT206 |	What's the difference between a dairy cow and a beef cow
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,439	| IOT206 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,207	| IOT206 |	Probably
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,231	| IOT206 |	Mattamy doesn't know either
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,863	| IOT206 |	Actually a new device gets
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| IOT206 |	Support for that
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| IOT206 |	System
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,423	| IOT206 |	Roku
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,727	| IOT206 |	Which I am super excited about
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:13,567	| IOT206 |	Because right now I have a Roku that's attached to a Harmony
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:17,407	| IOT206 |	Disattached all my TV stuff but this would have give me
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,199	| IOT206 |	A little bit more granularity in the
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,223	| IOT206 |	Control and
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:24,063	| IOT206 |	I kind of like that cuz right now the only remote controller I use now
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,599	| IOT206 |	When we're watching TV is the Roku
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:31,743	| IOT206 |	Because you'll be able to ask Madame a Define comedies or
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,303	| IOT206 |	Or open
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:38,655	| IOT206 |	Hulu apps on Roku changed
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,447	| IOT206 |	And
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:40,959	| IOT206 |	Now
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,775	| IOT206 |	Submitting content on the show
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,591	| IOT206 |	So we're going to have a broad discussion about
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,383	| IOT206 |	First off
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| IOT206 |	We're going to start with
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,431	| IOT206 |	The Wirecutter
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| IOT206 |	Last week
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:53,503	| IOT206 |	Put out after last show they put out a
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,783	| IOT206 |	Update on
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,575	| IOT206 |	Do you need a smart home hub
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,855	| IOT206 |	And
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,623	| IOT206 |	Which is the best way
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,927	| IOT206 |	Wirecutter was basically like
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,207	| IOT206 |	Most of you do not need
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,511	| IOT206 |	And I think they're right
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,279	| IOT206 |	Most of you probably
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT206 |	And if you do need one
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:11,423	| IOT206 |	They picked SmartThings which runs counter to what
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,727	| IOT206 |	I would do but I
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:17,823	| IOT206 |	For everyone else they're like you know what just use like an Amazon Echo or a goo
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,335	| IOT206 |	Google home
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,127	| IOT206 |	I will say
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,175	| IOT206 |	Did we have had push back
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,967	| IOT206 |	From some of our listeners who are like
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,503	| IOT206 |	Guys
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,039	| IOT206 |	You really should put people
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:33,695	| IOT206 |	Zigbee and Z-Wave devices because they're little bit more secure and you have a extra layer between the internet
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,719	| IOT206 |	In a device
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,255	| IOT206 |	And that is a good point
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,047	| IOT206 |	But I still think it's too,
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,607	| IOT206 |	I don't know what you think about the wire
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,519	| IOT206 |	They have to appeal to as many of broad set of readers as possible so I completely understand
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| IOT206 |	Why they
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,615	| IOT206 |	Position the article this way and I don't
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,639	| IOT206 |	Disagree with that either
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,199	| IOT206 |	You and I are hubpeople
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,735	| IOT206 |	Like true how people not
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| IOT206 |	Voice assistance
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| IOT206 |	Concord as a hub
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:02,111	| IOT206 |	Voice assistance
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:05,183	| IOT206 |	More automation that may not be easily done
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:05,695	| IOT206 |	Without
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:10,815	| IOT206 |	I get it I agree with you I'm not a SmartThings user these days I pretty much
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,583	| IOT206 |	Run everything on wink
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| IOT206 |	I think it's
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,655	| IOT206 |	SmartThings does have some
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,215	| IOT206 |	Devices
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:20,799	| IOT206 |	And you can eat you know when I create custom device handlers
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,591	| IOT206 |	Gradle groovy you can do that
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,151	| IOT206 |	Great for people who need that
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:29,503	| IOT206 |	I don't think most people me that I don't think of wire cutters audience really needs that
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,783	| IOT206 |	So I get it
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:35,135	| IOT206 |	It depends what you want to do you just want to keep things simple
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,415	| IOT206 |	You can do that with just
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:38,207	| IOT206 |	Voice commands in memory
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,719	| IOT206 |	My devices
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,535	| IOT206 |	If you want to start expanding things
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:45,631	| IOT206 |	Get a broader range of devices
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,423	| IOT206 |	Sure
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,239	| IOT206 |	So that was The Wirecutter
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,055	| IOT206 |	Now as dedicated hub
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:55,871	| IOT206 |	As a warning sign
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:56,895	| IOT206 |	For you
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,711	| IOT206 |	Kevin has a
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,991	| IOT206 |	I'm a dummy story
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,063	| IOT206 |	Because I feel like a dummy in summer
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,647	| IOT206 |	Considering we when I say si switch
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:11,999	| IOT206 |	Hubs and devices so often for testing reasons
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,327	| IOT206 |	I'm going to get myself a little bit
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:17,631	| IOT206 |	Flog you today
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:18,911	| IOT206 |	Not today
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:22,239	| IOT206 |	Yes I wrote a story on the Block
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:24,287	| IOT206 |	Listen
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,591	| IOT206 |	Here is why you should always remove
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:29,151	| IOT206 |	What smart devices from the old one
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,455	| IOT206 |	And it sounds like common sense
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:35,807	| IOT206 |	But I'm going to tell you what happens if you don't do that because quite often
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:38,879	| IOT206 |	We got a hobbit a style just like unplug my wink
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| IOT206 |	Who set up a new home
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:43,487	| IOT206 |	Put devices on it
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,023	| IOT206 |	Put everything back on wink real quick cuz
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,351	| IOT206 |	I got to get it back
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,143	| IOT206 |	Enough for the family
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,983	| IOT206 |	And that's exactly what I did when I tested the SmartThings
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,519	| IOT206 |	USB
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:20:01,663	| IOT206 |	Stick on the Nvidia Shield TV last year was infected
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,223	| IOT206 |	I tested it with some devices on it did my review
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,271	| IOT206 |	Took everything off and went back to wink
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,343	| IOT206 |	I never removed everything from that
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:12,159	| IOT206 |	Cub and what I found out
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,927	| IOT206 |	Was
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,231	| IOT206 |	I signed into my SmartThings app
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,511	| IOT206 |	Earlier this week
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,863	| IOT206 |	And I have a developer account over there because I had some custom device Handler
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:21,887	| IOT206 |	And I noticed
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,423	| IOT206 |	It's still listed
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,751	| IOT206 |	On Samsung server
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,799	| IOT206 |	But I had connected to that
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,335	| IOT206 |	SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:34,687	| IOT206 |	Wasn't a total panic at first but then I realized
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:41,855	| IOT206 |	Especially the Wi-Fi devices although I'm seeing I'll call a heartbeat pain coming from zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,391	| IOT206 |	Which is very strange to me
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,415	| IOT206 |	Because they
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,183	| IOT206 |	Don't have
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:49,279	| IOT206 |	Access to the internet through the SmartThings Hub anymore
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:53,631	| IOT206 |	Connect to my wink hub
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,935	| IOT206 |	But we're going to break that process down into
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,703	| IOT206 |	But first off
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,983	| IOT206 |	Let's tell people
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,263	| IOT206 |	The process
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,543	| IOT206 |	Purchased basic
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,311	| IOT206 |	Hub removal
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,335	| IOT206 |	Suggestion
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:08,735	| IOT206 |	The first thing you should do to a new house Etc
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,295	| IOT206 |	Go to the app
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,575	| IOT206 |	Your current hub
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,135	| IOT206 |	And one by one delete
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| IOT206 |	All your devices
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:19,488	| IOT206 |	It's especially important if you've got Z-Wave and zigbee devices
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,048	| IOT206 |	The Secret of Isis should
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:24,352	| IOT206 |	Wander off on their own when you delete them
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:27,424	| IOT206 |	Z-Wave devices you actually I know when the wink
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:30,752	| IOT206 |	You have to actually manually remove them by clicking
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,032	| IOT206 |	Edifice
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:34,848	| IOT206 |	So I go in the week to go to the hub
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,360	| IOT206 |	Section
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,664	| IOT206 |	Remove Z-Wave.
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:43,552	| IOT206 |	That's how you need to do it in the SmartThings app also has
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| IOT206 |	Remove Z-Wave
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,088	| IOT206 |	Devices function
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,904	| IOT206 |	Where you're actually going to hit that button
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:52,512	| IOT206 |	And then you actually physically press the radio the Z-Wave there's always a button
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,304	| IOT206 |	Turns the radio into pairing
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,864	| IOT206 |	That's going to physically on
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:01,472	| IOT206 |	Reason you do that is because a Z-Wave and zigbee radio
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| IOT206 |	Can only be paired to
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,288	| IOT206 |	Onehub
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,848	| IOT206 |	It just becomes really relevant
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:07,872	| IOT206 |	In a moment
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:12,736	| IOT206 |	Correct and even though I didn't have the SmartThings Hub running for the last year
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,016	| IOT206 |	I put the SmartThings
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,064	| IOT206 |	App back on my phone
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| IOT206 |	This week
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:22,976	| IOT206 |	And I'm still able to use it to control some of these devices so I know these are actively talking to Samsung
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:28,352	| IOT206 |	And there's a lot of data there any devices that are no longer
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,120	| IOT206 |	Active
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:32,704	| IOT206 |	It shows the last state so you could see like the temperature in my home when
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,336	| IOT206 |	Mac addresses of devices IP address
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,736	| IOT206 |	No and this is something I'm thinking is
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,624	| IOT206 |	Manually delete your
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,392	| IOT206 |	Your account basically
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:54,208	| IOT206 |	Let's get into this weird
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:54,976	| IOT206 |	Question
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:58,560	| IOT206 |	That we have which is some of Kevin Z-Wave
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,888	| IOT206 |	Somehow getting
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,656	| IOT206 |	This data
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,960	| IOT206 |	And we for the life of us
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,240	| IOT206 |	Can I figure out how
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:11,616	| IOT206 |	Right because those devices cannot directly connect to the internet on their own
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,152	| IOT206 |	They need to go through
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,688	| IOT206 |	Wireless
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT206 |	Device
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,552	| IOT206 |	And it can only be
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,112	| IOT206 |	Sakura
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:28,256	| IOT206 |	Any event log I have all kinds of events
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,048	| IOT206 |	Look at the most recent events
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,656	| IOT206 |	And the only thing I can think of all the stuff
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,936	| IOT206 |	Some of those
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,960	| IOT206 |	Devices
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,240	| IOT206 |	Zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,008	| IOT206 |	Art at
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:44,640	| IOT206 |	To my voice commands and also routines
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:47,968	| IOT206 |	I don't know how they would still have
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,016	| IOT206 |	Access to the
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:53,088	| IOT206 |	Internet to get back to Samsung servers but maybe
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,904	| IOT206 |	Something is triggering something
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,208	| IOT206 |	And I will continue researching obviously
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,744	| IOT206 |	This is our mystery of
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,512	| IOT206 |	The day
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,024	| IOT206 |	Or week
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,072	| IOT206 |	Maybe it's going to be a whole week's worth of Mystery
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,120	| IOT206 |	Guys who know so we'll update
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,168	| IOT206 |	On what's happening there
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:10,496	| IOT206 |	As we figure it out this is like our own iot podcast hotline
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:18,432	| IOT206 |	This is also good for people who like you Stacy are moving you need to
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,504	| IOT206 |	Undo everything and reset it all up and so on
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:27,904	| IOT206 |	If you switch a hub this is I think something that most people know they should do I don't know if everybody does it
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,416	| IOT206 |	I didn't
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,208	| IOT206 |	Shame on me for that but
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:31,744	| IOT206 |	Really makes you think
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,792	| IOT206 |	When you are doing some type of migration
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,864	| IOT206 |	Uninstall everything properly
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,448	| IOT206 |	Speaking up this whole thing was sparked by a question
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,544	| IOT206 |	Hey
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,056	| IOT206 |	Guys
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,872	| IOT206 |	I lost all the data on my Hub and I had to reset it
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| IOT206 |	And
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:50,176	| IOT206 |	It took 7 hours
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,456	| IOT206 |	That sucks
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,016	| IOT206 |	He's like is there anyway
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,040	| IOT206 |	For us too
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,112	| IOT206 |	An answer to that is
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| IOT206 |	Not really
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:06,304	| IOT206 |	Not really I mean that there might be some hubs that juice supported but the mainstream type hubs do not not with wings
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,072	| IOT206 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,376	| IOT206 |	Don't even with insteon
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,168	| IOT206 |	The safest bet like as I'm
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:13,216	| IOT206 |	Isn't dismantling my house
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT206 |	And taking things off
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,056	| IOT206 |	Beside his bed is actually to do a reset of
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,848	| IOT206 |	Everything so delete all the data
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:22,944	| IOT206 |	Cuz I'm having some weird issues because I didn't do that
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,456	| IOT206 |	But some of my
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,760	| IOT206 |	Lutron lights in my Amazon Echo
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,296	| IOT206 |	It's just not worth contact
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,648	| IOT206 |	And smart home devices I think a little more finicky than any other
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,952	| IOT206 |	Joyce's used today so
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,256	| IOT206 |	I think you're right
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,608	| IOT206 |	But speaking of the iot podcast hotline
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,936	| IOT206 |	I believe it is time to take a
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,448	| IOT206 |	Question
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:45,728	| IOT206 |	From

EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:58,176	| IOT206 |	Okay so this week's question
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,968	| IOT206 |	Comes from Derek
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| IOT206 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:06,880	| IOT206 |	Hey Stacy Hey Kevin this is Derek coming from Gilroy started to leave you a message I'm not sure if it
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,208	| IOT206 |	Sager. Anyway you can use this on me
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,768	| IOT206 |	Section 8 regarding vehicle tracking
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,584	| IOT206 |	So you be have something out there and
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:19,168	| IOT206 |	Sprint offered something call the Sprint Drive and so
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,960	| IOT206 |	I guess I'm curious Are there any
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:24,800	| IOT206 |	Concerns that I may have you know I currently have
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:27,104	| IOT206 |	That's my primary provider so
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:31,456	| IOT206 |	Resume in addition to Google spent probably already knows where I'm at and what I'm doing anyway
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:35,552	| IOT206 |	But I'm getting wanting to get one of these for my
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:39,904	| IOT206 |	Teenage kids so I can see no, see where they're going Heather Drive in and give him some
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| IOT206 |	Feedback
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:44,256	| IOT206 |	Just curious if you guys have any experience with the
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:46,560	| IOT206 |	Is there any privacy concerns and
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,632	| IOT206 |	Is there something that's even better out on the market
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:50,912	| IOT206 |	Okay Derek
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:53,728	| IOT206 |	At first I was like privacy and then I heard
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,520	| IOT206 |	Teenage driver and I was like
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:58,848	| IOT206 |	We don't need privacy we need to keep an eye on our teenage driver
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:02,176	| IOT206 |	And here you have a bunch of solutions
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:04,224	| IOT206 |	And you named a couple of them already
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:06,272	| IOT206 |	You could use a Tracker
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,552	| IOT206 |	Just to know where they are
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,344	| IOT206 |	But I don't like that because
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,392	| IOT206 |	Are teenage driver I actually do feel like
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:14,208	| IOT206 |	There's a lot of benefit for knowing how they're driving
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:17,024	| IOT206 |	So I'm going to suggest an OBD Port monitor
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,048	| IOT206 |	Device
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,096	| IOT206 |	And I'm actually going to suggest
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,632	| IOT206 |	You can actually do any number
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,912	| IOT206 |	Thursday
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:27,520	| IOT206 |	Two variations the cheaper ones usually connect via Wi-Fi or something
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:30,080	| IOT206 |	Over your phone so the data is not
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,104	| IOT206 |	Continuously sent to you
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:36,992	| IOT206 |	The more expensive ones that come with a subscription be like Verizon Tom or the Sprint one that you mentioned
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,016	| IOT206 |	Those are connected
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,832	| IOT206 |	Cellular and you can get real-time
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:41,856	| IOT206 |	Status updates
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,392	| IOT206 |	Where they are
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:43,904	| IOT206 |	How fast
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,976	| IOT206 |	How they are applying their brakes and all kind
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:51,328	| IOT206 |	Which is pretty useful for a new driver has I think
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,888	| IOT206 |	The Privacy aspect I think
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,680	| IOT206 |	Eric is writing at this point
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,216	| IOT206 |	The carriers and these are
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,008	| IOT206 |	Solutions you just mentioned
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,032	| IOT206 |	Which is why I bring this up
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:05,920	| IOT206 |	They already have so much information from the smartphones that we all have those of us have today so
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:11,040	| IOT206 |	Yeah you're giving him a little bit more
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,832	| IOT206 |	Hey how fast is this person going
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:13,856	| IOT206 |	How are they breaking
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,160	| IOT206 |	Where are they going
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:22,816	| IOT206 |	The flipside is
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,352	| IOT206 |	Based on
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,144	| IOT206 |	Set time of
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:29,728	| IOT206 |	Driving the captured data saver 30-60 days Etc
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,008	| IOT206 |	From
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,568	| IOT206 |	That device and you will get a discount
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,336	| IOT206 |	You headache
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,104	| IOT206 |	Relatively safe
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,896	| IOT206 |	Driving. So
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:41,504	| IOT206 |	Save your money again. You're giving up data to somebody else but
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,784	| IOT206 |	And that's up to you to decide if that's
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| IOT206 |	Worth anything
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,600	| IOT206 |	Potential cost savings but
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:50,976	| IOT206 |	Turn on privacy standpoint it's just a teeny weeny bit more information than they probably already have
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,000	| IOT206 |	He and I
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,816	| IOT206 |	Keep an eye on this
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,840	| IOT206 |	The zoo
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:58,656	| IOT206 |	Or the automatic also doesn't integration with if
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,960	| IOT206 |	This is interesting be
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:03,264	| IOT206 |	Because you can actually use that data
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:06,336	| IOT206 |	Put their driving date or their location data into spreadsheets
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,152	| IOT206 |	And then you could apply that to like a map and see what
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:09,920	| IOT206 |	Like Bradley
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,688	| IOT206 |	What your team
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,456	| IOT206 |	Avatar
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,248	| IOT206 |	Or you could just get you
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,064	| IOT206 |	You can also set up like notify
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,576	| IOT206 |	Applications for
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:20,160	| IOT206 |	You can get an email when the car's engine is having
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,184	| IOT206 |	Or attacks
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:23,488	| IOT206 |	And that sort of thing might be really interesting to
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,048	| IOT206 |	I would say check out
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,864	| IOT206 |	Put automatic in zube because of those
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:33,216	| IOT206 |	Connections I'm sure you can set up that on Verizon's hum as well or the Sprint thing
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,752	| IOT206 |	But I think
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,520	| IOT206 |	It just has a
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,544	| IOT206 |	Richard
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,360	| IOT206 |	Bass option so Derek that is our advice for you
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:41,408	| IOT206 |	Good luck with your team driver
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:44,736	| IOT206 |	I'm not there yet but I'm really nervous about
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,808	| IOT206 |	All right
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:54,208	| IOT206 |	That concludes the news portion of this week's show stay tuned for a conversation with Krissy Meyer

EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:43,360	| IOT206 |	SoJO last time we talked we talked about Mitsubishi Bank combining iot
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,152	| IOT206 |	Banking before we get to that
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,944	| IOT206 |	Can you remind our listeners what a pharaoh.
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:48,992	| IOT206 |	Of course
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,784	| IOT206 |	And thank you Stacey it

EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| IOT206 |	Cheryl provides
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,904	| IOT206 |	Everything that you need to connect
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,184	| IOT206 |	Anything to the internet
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:59,232	| IOT206 |	From helping you build a business case
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,000	| IOT206 |	All the way
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:00,768	| IOT206 |	To roll out
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,816	| IOT206 |	Ongoing management and data analytics
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:08,704	| IOT206 |	Our customers tell us that a pharaoh is the best choice for a great end-user experience and developer productivity
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,240	| IOT206 |	It's also beautiful design
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,264	| IOT206 |	Really easy to use
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| IOT206 |	Very fast
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:13,824	| IOT206 |	And very very secure
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:18,688	| IOT206 |	Alright so let's talk about what's happening with the Pharaoh in Mitsubishi
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:22,272	| IOT206 |	This is the largest bank of Japan one of the largest in the world
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,552	| IOT206 |	And it has a pretty long hair
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| IOT206 |	That's right
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:27,648	| IOT206 |	Mitsubishi ufj Financial Group
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,440	| IOT206 |	Dates back to the 1880s
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:32,768	| IOT206 |	It's actually the world's fifth-largest Bank by total assets
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:35,328	| IOT206 |	About 2.5 trillion dollars
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:39,424	| IOT206 |	This project with Mitsubishi ufg is really one of the killer wraps if I owed
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,984	| IOT206 |	Connected things of course deliver value
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,264	| IOT206 |	And in many occasions
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,288	| IOT206 |	That leads to a financial
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:47,360	| IOT206 |	Transaction fees things typically transaction
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:51,456	| IOT206 |	Person holding a mobile phone but down the line will also be able to transact
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:55,040	| IOT206 |	Directly with each other based on Smart contracts and things like that
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,344	| IOT206 |	We called it project the bank of things
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:59,136	| IOT206 |	Why is Mitsubishi bad
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,160	| IOT206 |	Creating this
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,512	| IOT206 |	Mitsubishi bank is creating the bank of things
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:08,352	| IOT206 |	To exponentially increase the surface area
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,120	| IOT206 |	Of
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,144	| IOT206 |	Devices
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:12,704	| IOT206 |	That can actually be paid for digitally
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:16,032	| IOT206 |	Most of these devices are things that fade into the background
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,312	| IOT206 |	Crown dinner so
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,616	| IOT206 |	Cost constraint or resource constraints
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,432	| IOT206 |	It doesn't make sense to attach a traditional
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,968	| IOT206 |	Expensive pain at terminal
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| IOT206 |	To the actual device
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,784	| IOT206 |	But using a pharaoh
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:30,624	| IOT206 |	With a very inexpensive and simple but secure Bluetooth connect
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,904	| IOT206 |	Mitsubishi Bank
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:33,184	| IOT206 |	Can allow their customers
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,232	| IOT206 |	To make secure payments
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:38,048	| IOT206 |	Almost any kind of device at almost any price point
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,400	| IOT206 |	The idea is
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,936	| IOT206 |	You got things like parking meters
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:49,056	| IOT206 |	Vending machines why aren't all those things connected to the internet. All connected because it's really expensive
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:53,920	| IOT206 |	Either have to put a cellular radio in each one which would cost a lot
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:59,808	| IOT206 |	And then you have to provide some Wi-Fi connection nearby but with the affair a solution all you need is a really Annex
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,832	| IOT206 |	Expensive Bluetooth radio
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,368	| IOT206 |	And then we're able to set up a
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:04,416	| IOT206 |	Secure connection through the user smartphone
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,440	| IOT206 |	Back to the intern
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:07,744	| IOT206 |	And we use that secure Bluetooth connect
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,024	| IOT206 |	To the cloud
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:12,864	| IOT206 |	Command the device to do something after the payment has been processed
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,496	| IOT206 |	Apeiro. IOS
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,776	| IOT206 |	Go - big
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,056	| IOT206 |	Is always the best place to
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,592	| IOT206 |	Start if your developer

EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,400	| IOT206 |	Let me focus on
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:21,472	| IOT206 |	The seed stage the basically what that mean
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:24,800	| IOT206 |	Making investment really early and
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,312	| IOT206 |	Startup company
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,848	| IOT206 |	Who are solving
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,616	| IOT206 |	Very hard
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,688	| IOT206 |	Things like
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,712	| IOT206 |	Hardware
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,224	| IOT206 |	Iot

EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:44,512	| IOT206 |	So at huge companies
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,280	| IOT206 |	Light
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,816	| IOT206 |	Apple and square

EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,400	| IOT206 |	Volume
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,448	| IOT206 |	And then all the way to very early stage
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,216	| IOT206 |	Hardware startup
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,312	| IOT206 |	Kingdom Builder organizations
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,384	| IOT206 |	Heart of China inside factories and Empire
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:02,432	| IOT206 |	Suppliers mostly in Asia
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:05,760	| IOT206 |	Now I got to take everything that I learned over the
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:08,064	| IOT206 |	Horses that career and use it to help guide
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,368	| IOT206 |	Roots investment Visa
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:13,952	| IOT206 |	And also help advise all of the company that we in Bastion
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:19,328	| IOT206 |	Awesome so let's use that expertise and talk first off
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,376	| IOT206 |	About at route in
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:26,240	| IOT206 |	Specifically as a venture investor cuz that isn't that is a different mindset than someone who's an entrepreneur

EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:33,408	| IOT206 |	What are you looking for when you evaluate consumer iot
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:33,920	| IOT206 |	Hardware in Bessemer
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:37,504	| IOT206 |	So not many investors
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,016	| IOT206 |	Shaving
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:40,064	| IOT206 |	But I really
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:42,368	| IOT206 |	The Sounders that we're most excited
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:44,160	| IOT206 |	You are the one
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:46,464	| IOT206 |	To walk into our office with
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,000	| IOT206 |	1/2
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,792	| IOT206 |	Prototype rather than a
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,072	| IOT206 |	A super polish
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,096	| IOT206 |	Ed stock
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:52,864	| IOT206 |	So
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,888	| IOT206 |	We're looking for
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,168	| IOT206 |	Deeply technical founder
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,216	| IOT206 |	With a bold idea and
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,520	| IOT206 |	The experience
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,568	| IOT206 |	And who have the know-how
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,336	| IOT206 |	To be able to
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,152	| IOT206 |	It's funny that people
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:07,968	| IOT206 |	People showing me demos are often
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:14,368	| IOT206 |	Super apologetic that's their robot didn't work or that their software hit a bug or that there
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:18,464	| IOT206 |	Hearts were 3D printed and not injection-molded but
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,280	| IOT206 |	Honestly like as a technical investor
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,072	| IOT206 |	That's really what I wanted
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,608	| IOT206 |	I feel like I want to talk about the Chow
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:31,264	| IOT206 |	But they're having and I want to see the areas that are super high res can I want to hear about their planet
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,800	| IOT206 |	4
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,336	| IOT206 |	How they're going
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,616	| IOT206 |	To overcome those issues
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:38,432	| IOT206 |	Okay so guess if I bring you my
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,968	| IOT206 |	My disassembled prototype
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:41,248	| IOT206 |	I'm I'm already
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,016	| IOT206 |	Looking good
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:46,624	| IOT206 |	What are the pitfalls you see in the consumer iot
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:49,440	| IOT206 |	Around Hardware startup so once here's
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,976	| IOT206 |	You started on your journey
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,768	| IOT206 |	Maybe it's got something awesome
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:56,352	| IOT206 |	Where do you see companies or maybe Founders start to
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:59,168	| IOT206 |	Make the mistakes and it Hardware your mistakes
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:02,752	| IOT206 |	Can really cause a lot of problems you can't fix it quite as easily as soft
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,312	| IOT206 |	Definitely true
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:08,640	| IOT206 |	Enterprise's car and I don't want to downplay that at all
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:10,944	| IOT206 |	But building Hardware
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,016	| IOT206 |	Consumers is
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,040	| IOT206 |	Even harder
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,320	| IOT206 |	I feel like on the
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,344	| IOT206 |	Riverside
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:19,904	| IOT206 |	More than half the battle is
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,696	| IOT206 |	Figuring out who the
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:25,024	| IOT206 |	Hack is going to buy your products it's really not as straightforward as people often.
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:28,096	| IOT206 |	So once you have that figured out and you know
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:29,120	| IOT206 |	Who your target
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:31,680	| IOT206 |	Market is that you have to figure out distribution
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:35,008	| IOT206 |	So another words like how are you going to get your
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:37,568	| IOT206 |	Product to those customers that
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,616	| IOT206 |	It retail stores
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,408	| IOT206 |	Amazon
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,944	| IOT206 |	Direct online
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:45,760	| IOT206 |	My partnering with other businesses
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:46,528	| IOT206 |	Bundling it with
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,576	| IOT206 |	Products like those are all a
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:54,720	| IOT206 |	People fail to realize a lot about building
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,744	| IOT206 |	Consumer Hardware
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,840	| IOT206 |	Really difficult to make any money
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,144	| IOT206 |	The product
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:04,704	| IOT206 |	It's so before we get to kind of
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,240	| IOT206 |	Laying out all the
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,544	| IOT206 |	Costs associated with the connected device which I think
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,872	| IOT206 |	Trying to build one and people who are
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,152	| IOT206 |	Find one will appreciate
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:15,712	| IOT206 |	Let's go back to this idea of identifying your
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:18,272	| IOT206 |	Your Market because I do see a lot of people
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,296	| IOT206 |	Build things
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:23,904	| IOT206 |	Did seem to solve a particular problem for them which in some cases like Dropbox
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:27,488	| IOT206 |	Is awesome and in other cases like maybe
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:31,584	| IOT206 |	Juicero comes to Pint it feels like who that was so nice and
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:32,352	| IOT206 |	It cost so much
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,888	| IOT206 |	How do people find their target
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:41,056	| IOT206 |	It's not an easy thing it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears in it and take a lot of getting out and
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,592	| IOT206 |	Walking to the
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:43,872	| IOT206 |	Customer
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,640	| IOT206 |	The number one
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:48,224	| IOT206 |	Better than Vice that I like to give the people if
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:51,552	| IOT206 |	To test early and test offense oh
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:56,160	| IOT206 |	I don't care if you had like 3D printed parts and I don't care if your prototype is
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:58,208	| IOT206 |	Is barely held together like
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,000	| IOT206 |	Cheap prototype
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:03,328	| IOT206 |	Even if you have something that you can
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:06,144	| IOT206 |	Has even a subset of the functionality
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:09,216	| IOT206 |	Get out there and get people using it because that is how you find
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,264	| IOT206 |	People and what does
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:13,056	| IOT206 |	And that's also how you
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,080	| IOT206 |	You find out
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:14,848	| IOT206 |	Who
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:16,896	| IOT206 |	It wasn't it was and who it doesn't run
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,712	| IOT206 |	Can respond your product-based
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:24,320	| IOT206 |	But the real challenge with it takes a lot of
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,088	| IOT206 |	Another get out
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:31,488	| IOT206 |	Those customers again and again and again and doing that as much on the
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,024	| IOT206 |	Brunch and a view
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:35,328	| IOT206 |	Possibly can because
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| IOT206 |	Further
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:37,120	| IOT206 |	You get along
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:37,888	| IOT206 |	In
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:38,400	| IOT206 |	Product design
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:44,032	| IOT206 |	Further you get along in manufacturing it gets
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:47,104	| IOT206 |	Harder and harder to unwind wrong decision
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:50,944	| IOT206 |	It's hard to iterate when you've already produced a millionaire
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,712	| IOT206 |	10000 device
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,528	| IOT206 |	Okay so let's talk about cost
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,296	| IOT206 |	And
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,064	| IOT206 |	My favorite word
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:56,832	| IOT206 |	Bomb
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,368	| IOT206 |	Which stands for bill of materials
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,672	| IOT206 |	It's basically a fancy way of saying
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,184	| IOT206 |	How much it cost
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:07,584	| IOT206 |	Let's break that down because you shared a surprising stat with me about I have a cost to produce something of
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:11,936	| IOT206 |	Like a bill of materials for $100 then I actually have to sell this for likes
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,704	| IOT206 |	300
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:14,240	| IOT206 |	Yep
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,800	| IOT206 |	Unfortunate reality of shipping
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,336	| IOT206 |	Timber Hardware
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:20,640	| IOT206 |	People don't always fully under
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,664	| IOT206 |	Understand that
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:28,064	| IOT206 |	I can't build a device for $100 and sell it for $200 and make money
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:28,832	| IOT206 |	Not how it works
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:35,744	| IOT206 |	So there's so many things that you have to add in like so don't be teasing Freight charges and warranty
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:37,024	| IOT206 |	Using credit cards
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:39,584	| IOT206 |	To keep going
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,120	| IOT206 |	The reality of this
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:42,144	| IOT206 |	Situation is that if you
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,680	| IOT206 |	Build a hundred dollar device
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:45,216	| IOT206 |	$100
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:48,288	| IOT206 |	To assemble a $100 Bond, then
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,824	| IOT206 |	That might bring you up to like
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,384	| IOT206 |	$130 if I'm lucky
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:54,175	| IOT206 |	By the time I check on all
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:59,295	| IOT206 |	And then if you're selling through retail you have to turn around and go
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:02,367	| IOT206 |	Thanks to the retail store for every single product that
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,159	| IOT206 |	So
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,183	| IOT206 |	And that's just the difference
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:06,207	| IOT206 |	Wholesale in
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:11,327	| IOT206 |	Yeah and it's it's to the point that I will every retailer
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:12,863	| IOT206 |	Expect to take margin
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,911	| IOT206 |	To actually stop your products
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:19,007	| IOT206 |	Inventory and put it on their shelves so now this product that cost $100
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:19,775	| IOT206 |	To build
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,567	| IOT206 |	I just thought for $200
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,335	| IOT206 |	Just to break even
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,615	| IOT206 |	And then I have to sell it
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,431	| IOT206 |	$300 if I want to make
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:29,759	| IOT206 |	Any real margin or making it real money
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,039	| IOT206 |	So it's it's
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,599	| IOT206 |	The bends when you're building a
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:36,159	| IOT206 |	Product and you've got to remember that your
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:36,671	| IOT206 |	Average
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:37,951	| IOT206 |	Consumers
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,487	| IOT206 |	Pretty price-sensitive
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,023	| IOT206 |	After selling a product for $100
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:44,351	| IOT206 |	$300 might make Lee
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:47,679	| IOT206 |	Huge impact on their decision whether or not to buy it
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:54,847	| IOT206 |	Okay and this is why is consumers we see a lot of companies like launch their products sell only on their website and made
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,383	| IOT206 |	Maybe sell to Amazon how does
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:58,431	| IOT206 |	How does Amazon hire from
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:59,967	| IOT206 |	Putting something on a fist
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:00,735	| IOT206 |	Spell Shelf
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:07,135	| IOT206 |	Amazon also takes a fairly significant margin so they'll also take a pretty significant chunk off the top
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:09,439	| IOT206 |	But they're able to do so at a much
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:11,487	| IOT206 |	Encourage you
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:14,047	| IOT206 |	Physical retail stores that are carrying
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:15,839	| IOT206 |	Significant
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:16,351	| IOT206 |	Mentori
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,911	| IOT206 |	So if you really love a startup
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:19,423	| IOT206 |	You should buy for the
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:23,519	| IOT206 |	Absolutely they would love you
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:24,287	| IOT206 |	Before that
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:30,687	| IOT206 |	Okay so let's say we talked a bit about consumer let's talk about Enterprise how is investing in Enterprise
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,711	| IOT206 |	Fry's iot
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:34,271	| IOT206 |	Company is different and specifically the hardware
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,319	| IOT206 |	What are the differences
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,087	| IOT206 |	In
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,623	| IOT206 |	Selling Hardware to Enterprise
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,951	| IOT206 |	So on the Enterprise side
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,975	| IOT206 |	We are selling products
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:46,047	| IOT206 |	Companies you got to remember that
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:48,095	| IOT206 |	Sales cycle can be
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,143	| IOT206 |	Painfully painfully long
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,935	| IOT206 |	I can make a really long time
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,959	| IOT206 |	Close the contract
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:57,567	| IOT206 |	Really want him to get a purchase order approved
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:01,919	| IOT206 |	Five levels of the management change to get signatures from everyone
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:03,967	| IOT206 |	You might have to go through multiple rounds
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:05,247	| IOT206 |	Pilot
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,783	| IOT206 |	Before you get anywhere
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:07,807	| IOT206 |	Close to even
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,599	| IOT206 |	Clothing that that contract
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,879	| IOT206 |	At the end of the day if
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,159	| IOT206 |	Cast by episode
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:12,927	| IOT206 |	Same time like
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,975	| IOT206 |	You can sustain and you can
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:19,839	| IOT206 |	Grow a successful business by selling primarily in the Fortune 500 companies are bigger Enterprise customers
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,935	| IOT206 |	And on the Enterprise side when you're building hardware for them
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:26,495	| IOT206 |	Do you have to worry quite so much about
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:29,311	| IOT206 |	Things like always just the prettiest package is
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:31,103	| IOT206 |	Does this have that space age
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:33,407	| IOT206 |	White shiny Apple designer that
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:36,735	| IOT206 |	Fabric-covered I don't even know there's all kinds of design Trends happen
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:40,831	| IOT206 |	On the consumer side what do Enterprises look for when they buy
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:43,903	| IOT206 |	That's a really good point usually you don't
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:50,303	| IOT206 |	But sometimes you do it very dramatically based on who your customer is here selling to
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,327	| IOT206 |	The product is
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,095	| IOT206 |	And what it does
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,887	| IOT206 |	Interesting
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,167	| IOT206 |	Square for a while
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:58,239	| IOT206 |	And we were building the little credit card reader
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,519	| IOT206 |	We were not selling
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:04,127	| IOT206 |	Zoomers we were selling the business as they were small and medium-sized businesses
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:05,919	| IOT206 |	But it was still a business
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:06,687	| IOT206 |	Business
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,199	| IOT206 |	Play
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:09,247	| IOT206 |	It was
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:13,599	| IOT206 |	Has the piece of Hardware was going to be storefront for them when they were interacting
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:15,135	| IOT206 |	What's in there
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,671	| IOT206 |	It was very important
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:24,351	| IOT206 |	Have a level polish that you would expect in a in a consumer product so I think it really depends on
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:26,655	| IOT206 |	Depends on who you're selling it to and how it's going to be
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:28,703	| IOT206 |	Alright in Seoul
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:31,007	| IOT206 |	For any of these companies Enterprise
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:31,775	| IOT206 |	Consumer
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:35,103	| IOT206 |	Let's break down some of the challenges that you might have
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:35,871	| IOT206 |	In
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:38,687	| IOT206 |	Your supply chain in getting this sort of thing
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:39,967	| IOT206 |	Built and manufactured
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:42,527	| IOT206 |	You know a lot of this happens in Asia
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:44,575	| IOT206 |	All hear horror stories
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:46,111	| IOT206 |	We also hear horror stories about
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:46,879	| IOT206 |	Do I get in the US
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:49,951	| IOT206 |	So what kind of advice can you offer
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,743	| IOT206 |	People about physically
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:54,047	| IOT206 |	Manufacturing the device and then managing the
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:54,559	| IOT206 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:55,583	| IOT206 |	Go into it
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:56,863	| IOT206 |	Play I Like It
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,399	| IOT206 |	People that you can have
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,471	| IOT206 |	Product design in the world but if
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:03,263	| IOT206 |	You don't have a supply chain
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:05,823	| IOT206 |	Playoff you're never going to make it to Market with your product
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,407	| IOT206 |	I spend
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:15,807	| IOT206 |	A pretty significant check on my China advising new hardware companies were just starting to think about how to go about
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,575	| IOT206 |	Shutting up
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:17,599	| IOT206 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:22,463	| IOT206 |	And there's a few mistakes that I've seen people make and if it fits of advice that I like
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:26,303	| IOT206 |	Tell people outside and one is that your manufacturing partner
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,583	| IOT206 |	Has to be
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,863	| IOT206 |	Well mat
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,655	| IOT206 |	To your company Sage
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,935	| IOT206 |	And also to your
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:33,215	| IOT206 |	Product complexity
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:35,519	| IOT206 |	You have to look Beyond
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,287	| IOT206 |	Justice
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:40,127	| IOT206 |	Technical capabilities that they can check all the boxes on the technical side
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:43,199	| IOT206 |	Culture fit an attitude
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,735	| IOT206 |	Is super important
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:47,295	| IOT206 |	To that they're not willing to move it at speed that you're you
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:49,855	| IOT206 |	It's not going to be a good set
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:55,743	| IOT206 |	Asia isn't always the answer so people I see the people are
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:47:02,399	| IOT206 |	Consider the hardwood products made it to Asia but I don't think that's the right way to think about it I think that you need to be
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:07,263	| IOT206 |	Pushing really significant volumes for Asia to make sense and even then it
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,031	| IOT206 |	It doesn't always make
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,591	| IOT206 |	You shouldn't make that leap
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:14,687	| IOT206 |	To Manufacturing in Asia until you know
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,967	| IOT206 |	That you're really
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:17,247	| IOT206 |	Read me ready
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,015	| IOT206 |	The last
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:19,039	| IOT206 |	Mistake but I see it
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:21,087	| IOT206 |	People assuming that like bigger is better
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:23,391	| IOT206 |	That I want to work with the biggest
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:29,535	| IOT206 |	Factory Partners I can find because they have a big name in there will know and of course they're going to do a good job but
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:33,631	| IOT206 |	Being a small customer at a large
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:34,655	| IOT206 |	Talk to your
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:37,471	| IOT206 |	Supplier means that we run into
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:38,239	| IOT206 |	At 1
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,799	| IOT206 |	You're going to struggle to get resources
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,847	| IOT206 |	Then you're going to struggle to get attention
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:48,479	| IOT206 |	I've had that problem many times over any one time I was I was working with a start-up when we were partnered with us
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:52,831	| IOT206 |	Very well-known top-tier Factory I'm not going to name any names but
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:54,111	| IOT206 |	We have been given
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:55,391	| IOT206 |	Empathic
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:59,231	| IOT206 |	A+ players they were doing
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:00,511	| IOT206 |	An amazing job
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:02,559	| IOT206 |	Hijack and then
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:05,631	| IOT206 |	Again tired team
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,911	| IOT206 |	Disappeared
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:09,215	| IOT206 |	Overnight and was replaced by like
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:10,495	| IOT206 |	Newly-hired
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:13,311	| IOT206 |	Engineers and I mean like they're bad
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,079	| IOT206 |	Warm hunting
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:17,151	| IOT206 |	Literally people that they had hired
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,431	| IOT206 |	Like 2 to 3 days
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:18,943	| IOT206 |	Beforehand
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:21,503	| IOT206 |	And of course I freaked out
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:23,551	| IOT206 |	But it turned out that like my
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,319	| IOT206 |	Amazing
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:28,159	| IOT206 |	Like a big famous customer and since we were such as
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:30,719	| IOT206 |	Small startup working with this big fat
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:32,767	| IOT206 |	There really wasn't anything I
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:34,559	| IOT206 |	I can do about it and that is the key
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:35,583	| IOT206 |	Problem
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:42,239	| IOT206 |	That you can run into if you haven't been really dirty Jacob Frey and if you aren't well match
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:44,031	| IOT206 |	With your supply chain partners
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:46,335	| IOT206 |	Okay
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:52,479	| IOT206 |	And as a consumer I sit here and I am looking at all of this and probably the number one concern I have with
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:57,599	| IOT206 |	My Hardware devices is actually security and it's very similar in the Enterprise
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:49:01,951	| IOT206 |	What are you seeing I mean we hear a lot about like design with security in my
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:05,791	| IOT206 |	We hear a lot about like the bare minimum should be no hard go to passwords in
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:07,327	| IOT206 |	Encrypt everything
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:12,959	| IOT206 |	And we got a lot of new standards coming out UL is working on a standard arm just announce something on the
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:19,359	| IOT206 |	The device side I get lot of chatter about this so what are you advising your companies to do what are you
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,127	| IOT206 |	Thinking isn't
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:23,199	| IOT206 |	Security is
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,479	| IOT206 |	Q
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:27,807	| IOT206 |	Personally I'm glad to see that we're moving towards
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:31,647	| IOT206 |	More and more legislation around that but
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:35,743	| IOT206 |	First artist that I work with it's something that I like to stress
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,791	| IOT206 |	Need attention from
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:42,143	| IOT206 |	Day 1 like a cannot be an afterthought I mean it from the moment
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,447	| IOT206 |	That you start architecture
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,727	| IOT206 |	Your product
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:48,031	| IOT206 |	You should be thinking about data usage
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:49,311	| IOT206 |	Privacy
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:55,967	| IOT206 |	You should understand the concept of pii like personally identifiable information you should understand what it is
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:56,735	| IOT206 |	How you're going to have
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:58,271	| IOT206 |	Handle it and if you're building a
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:49:59,807	| IOT206 |	Consumer product you should
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:03,135	| IOT206 |	Probably this load what type of sensors are inside of it
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:06,463	| IOT206 |	When you think that you have all of your bases
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:09,535	| IOT206 |	When you think you're in a really good place
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,303	| IOT206 |	Don't shop there
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:13,119	| IOT206 |	And bring in an expert
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:15,423	| IOT206 |	Let them poke holes
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:16,959	| IOT206 |	And how you're handling
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:17,727	| IOT206 |	Ring security
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:19,263	| IOT206 |	How you're handling user data
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:21,311	| IOT206 |	Trust me like hiring
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,335	| IOT206 |	Security consultant
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:23,359	| IOT206 |	Now bikes
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:26,431	| IOT206 |	Expensive especially if you're in early
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:27,967	| IOT206 |	PlayStation startup but
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:28,991	| IOT206 |	If it prevents
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:31,295	| IOT206 |	Product returns or even worse if it prevents
EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:34,367	| IOT206 |	A walk through door really bad headline
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,647	| IOT206 |	It's worth every
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:38,975	| IOT206 |	All right and we talked
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:42,815	| IOT206 |	How to briefly before the show about some of the cool things that you've done actually in your own home
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:44,863	| IOT206 |	And so since we have all these crazy
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:45,631	| IOT206 |	Consumers who
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:49,471	| IOT206 |	Do I know what I know you guys out there listening to a lot of fun stuff so

EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:29,055	| IOT206 |	And add a
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:30,335	| IOT206 |	Notification

EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:40,831	| IOT206 |	I don't think it would be the worst thing in the world if they skipped a meal or two
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:44,415	| IOT206 |	So that your least favorite automation is what I meant
