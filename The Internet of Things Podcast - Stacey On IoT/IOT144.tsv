EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:42,656	| IOT144 |	Let's go with biggest disappointment that we have good stuff new Happy stuff to talk about a fan
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:43,680	| IOT144 |	Already
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,728	| IOT144 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,240	| IOT144 |	My biggest
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,288	| IOT144 |	Where
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:48,800	| IOT144 |	Oware
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,592	| IOT144 |	My presence today
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,896	| IOT144 |	We have been talking about this
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,432	| IOT144 |	You know like
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,712	| IOT144 |	Gosh for like 3 years now
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,248	| IOT144 |	It feels like a really long
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,576	| IOT144 |	I keep wanting to be able to go into a room
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,368	| IOT144 |	And have the room know that it's
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,136	| IOT144 |	Me
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,416	| IOT144 |	Not somebody else in my
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:07,232	| IOT144 |	But also that I've been there so when I say turn off the lights
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:07,744	| IOT144 |	It knows
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:08,768	| IOT144 |	We got
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:14,912	| IOT144 |	We got closer I mean we do have cameras with video recognition now but they're out there on the market but
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,984	| IOT144 |	Yeah I agree I mean I always thought it would be
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,264	| IOT144 |	Either a little tag
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:21,312	| IOT144 |	Maybe it's Bluetooth I don't know
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,592	| IOT144 |	Guitar phone
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,896	| IOT144 |	Whatever but it probably will be
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:30,272	| IOT144 |	Cameras and facial recognition and that's going to be interesting because a lot of people may not want that
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,064	| IOT144 |	See I want a Bluetooth Beacon
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,880	| IOT144 |	Things I thought that was the ideal way to do it so you
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,208	| IOT144 |	Phone
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,232	| IOT144 |	Also
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,000	| IOT144 |	We also
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,024	| IOT144 |	Kind of got there
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:45,376	| IOT144 |	In a sentence with like the Amazon Echo letting you group things in a room although that
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| IOT144 |	Not exactly
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:50,496	| IOT144 |	Perfect it's not perfect and it's more
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:56,896	| IOT144 |	It's Annie's of use thing it's not really a presence thing I mean it's putting the presence of the objects together but I think we're
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,920	| IOT144 |	Song about our presence
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,992	| IOT144 |	That's right for a 1R smarthomes to be smart enough to know where
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,272	| IOT144 |	Kevin is in this room and
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,576	| IOT144 |	Stacy isn't that room and someone
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,344	| IOT144 |	I really don't have the
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,904	| IOT144 |	This ties in with actually a corporate
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| IOT144 |	Or Enterprise
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,976	| IOT144 |	Kind of effort which is
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,744	| IOT144 |	Beacons
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,304	| IOT144 |	I was disappointed this year because I feel like beacons have no
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:17,632	| IOT144 |	They're not all that people are not I don't encounter them
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| IOT144 |	Very often
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| IOT144 |	Spaces
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,240	| IOT144 |	I have the physical web in Ableton
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| IOT144 |	IPhone 4
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| IOT144 |	Couple years that's
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT144 |	Google
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,568	| IOT144 |	Beacon
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| IOT144 |	Project
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,384	| IOT144 |	Cash nothing ever pops up
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,736	| IOT144 |	The only time I saw things pop up
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:35,296	| IOT144 |	Was when I was working for Google in the Google New York City office
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,624	| IOT144 |	I never had anything pop up in a store or anything
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:44,768	| IOT144 |	And I'm actually okay with that cuz I really don't know that I want the store hanging meat but it would have at least told me
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,560	| IOT144 |	I've only seen
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:52,448	| IOT144 |	A few or news of a few implementations and a lot of planned Abominations but
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,800	| IOT144 |	A could be the people ruin them out and we're just not aware yet but I tend to
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,104	| IOT144 |	Beauty the beacons are not yet all that
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,896	| IOT144 |	Yeah and I really thought there was
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,432	| IOT144 |	Interest Airbus on
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,992	| IOT144 |	I'm working but things like wayfinding I thought would be
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| IOT144 |	Be really helpful in building
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,112	| IOT144 |	A lot of cool talk and there have been so pilots in like Stadium
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:10,880	| IOT144 |	Sports Stadium
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,904	| IOT144 |	To help people
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,696	| IOT144 |	Get to the shortest line the fastest
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,976	| IOT144 |	Indicate which
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,744	| IOT144 |	Bathroom decor
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,536	| IOT144 |	But overall
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,559	| IOT144 |	Would be farther
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| IOT144 |	So
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,631	| IOT144 |	Maybe that'll happen
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,703	| IOT144 |	Let's see what else is disappointing this year
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,775	| IOT144 |	Consumer protections and data
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:33,919	| IOT144 |	Retention and Salon that's been a continuing problem and no longer has a problem the worse it is for this Market at the whole I think
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,759	| IOT144 |	A couple shows back we talked about some legislation
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:42,367	| IOT144 |	Here in the US that might add some consumer protections to iot devices but
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:46,463	| IOT144 |	As we sit back on that show it was like a six-year time frame at best
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,511	| IOT144 |	Apple keynote basic legislation
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| IOT144 |	Willets Point
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:54,655	| IOT144 |	Committee and then we'll do the next step and I will do the next step
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,703	| IOT144 |	Task force of a committee to create benchmark
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,007	| IOT144 |	Protection right right right
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,055	| IOT144 |	I didn't even
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,335	| IOT144 |	Take up space in my brain
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:08,479	| IOT144 |	Guess so consumer protections I'm actually disappointed that we haven't seen somebody lost
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,039	| IOT144 |	And I'm betting it's because a lot of this
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,903	| IOT144 |	Well could be that it could also be the
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,999	| IOT144 |	People when you say. Attrition meaning in the terms of service that people agree to or
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:25,375	| IOT144 |	Yeah okay I was going to say that's probably why there's no lawsuits cuz people are agreeing to the terms of service but you're right
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:31,775	| IOT144 |	Buried in there probably have arbitration Etc Elsa and I'll be the first one to say I don't read
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT144 |	Read the terms of service
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:37,151	| IOT144 |	I'm almost at in your eye. And I should I'm setting a bad example so
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,431	| IOT144 |	Don't do what I do
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:43,807	| IOT144 |	People read your terms of service and decide you often don't see the terms of service to you bought
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,599	| IOT144 |	A product and that's an issue
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,879	| IOT144 |	Yes I would like that song
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:52,511	| IOT144 |	Also in consumer protections I would say we also have not achieved any sort of forward momentum
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,047	| IOT144 |	Round things like
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,095	| IOT144 |	Setting a product life cycle settings
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,143	| IOT144 |	Security parameters we did see
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,423	| IOT144 |	This last year the f
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:05:59,935	| IOT144 |	PC
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,215	| IOT144 |	Sue
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:07,615	| IOT144 |	Couple router makers for having hard-coded passwords and still trying to advertise as being safe however
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,151	| IOT144 |	TC decisions were actually
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:15,295	| IOT144 |	Appealed so were and I don't feel that our current FTC is probably going to be as active under the
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| IOT144 |	Ministration
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,855	| IOT144 |	So yeah
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,135	| IOT144 |	I would say things are not great
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,439	| IOT144 |	I would agree
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,231	| IOT144 |	They can only get better let's hope they do
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,303	| IOT144 |	And speaking of getting better or rather
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,607	| IOT144 |	It's opposite since this is the biggest
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,119	| IOT144 |	Section
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,423	| IOT144 |	Cash Baker I think
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,215	| IOT144 |	I feel like things are getting worse
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,239	| IOT144 |	Army integration
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,799	| IOT144 |	I need not into separate
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT144 |	1
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,127	| IOT144 |	We have not seen a coalescing
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,431	| IOT144 |	Billy around standards except for madame
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:43,711	| IOT144 |	Possibly Google home
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,271	| IOT144 |	So they're still too many hugs out there
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,319	| IOT144 |	There's still a lot of options
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| IOT144 |	And getting things
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:49,599	| IOT144 |	To work together
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:54,975	| IOT144 |	Is not seamless you're like enabling skills and logging into like 16 different accounts
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,535	| IOT144 |	Get stuffed working and then even then it doesn't always work
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,839	| IOT144 |	It seems like we've got
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:05,983	| IOT144 |	Solution it's a bolt-on solution we just keep adding adding adding little bits not cohesive
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,751	| IOT144 |	Solution
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,543	| IOT144 |	James Wright & Filippis
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,823	| IOT144 |	Amazon text alerts
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:15,199	| IOT144 |	Get the skills and I forget what Google calls them but they have something similar and then we also have
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,991	| IOT144 |	Yeah but their party Services I can
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,039	| IOT144 |	Rap all these things together with apis
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:21,087	| IOT144 |	It's just everybody's trying to put
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:24,671	| IOT144 |	Stuff together and why do they do that because it's not together by Nature
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:25,951	| IOT144 |	By default
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| IOT144 |	And that's
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:31,327	| IOT144 |	Yeah you're right it's kind of getting worse in that sense
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,887	| IOT144 |	And what's making it even worse and
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,679	| IOT144 |	My best example of this would be
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,495	| IOT144 |	Amazon Echo Show
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,543	| IOT144 |	And Google's YouTube video
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,383	| IOT144 |	Now the people are actually like the big manufacturers are actively try
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,919	| IOT144 |	Tear things apart
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:49,247	| IOT144 |	So one it's all I need to begin with but in some cases
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,015	| IOT144 |	Since I'm just never going to be
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:55,391	| IOT144 |	Write and in that particular case you bought something with the
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,671	| IOT144 |	Unexpected feature
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,695	| IOT144 |	That you no longer have
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,511	| IOT144 |	Which brings us back to consumer-protection
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,303	| IOT144 |	Badda bing badda bing badda boom
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,071	| IOT144 |	All right
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:06,399	| IOT144 |	So I really like honestly biggest disappointment
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| IOT144 |	This year might be so far in the Smart Home
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,751	| IOT144 |	Still freaking
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,055	| IOT144 |	It sucks even though we said it's not for the last
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,079	| IOT144 |	3 years
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,383	| IOT144 |	I'm very disappointed with the end of
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,407	| IOT144 |	Asheville
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,199	| IOT144 |	Angry about it okay
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,479	| IOT144 |	Emotional
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:26,879	| IOT144 |	That's okay no you're entitled to admit it's been a challenge has been issue I don't disagree but I do think
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| IOT144 |	It's gotten
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| IOT144 |	Better it sucks less
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:35,071	| IOT144 |	Depending on what it is what product or what service or whatever it is you're trying to do I think it does suck less we have more options
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,631	| IOT144 |	Which has its pros and cons
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,959	| IOT144 |	I think it's getting easier to set certain things up just a mesh Network
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:45,311	| IOT144 |	For example can be very easy to set up and do a world of Wonders for devices in your house
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,615	| IOT144 |	But you're right it still kind of sucks
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,223	| IOT144 |	No no
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,503	| IOT144 |	All right
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,319	| IOT144 |	Finally on my biggest disappointments are
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:56,831	| IOT144 |	My gosh
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,647	| IOT144 |	Cellular providers where are my flexible cellular
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| IOT144 |	Transfer business
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| IOT144 |	And startup iot f
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,999	| IOT144 |	I still feel like
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,047	| IOT144 |	We're not seeing a lot of it
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,071	| IOT144 |	Innovation therein
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,863	| IOT144 |	And it's still hard for a smaller company
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,143	| IOT144 |	2
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| IOT144 |	Kapil products with
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,703	| IOT144 |	Cellular-based
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,007	| IOT144 |	Wireless Solutions in them
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:19,359	| IOT144 |	Yeah I don't disagree with that I think this is still pretty nascent Market
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,943	| IOT144 |	In terms of using alternative networks for iot devices
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:29,855	| IOT144 |	Luckily one would hope that the carriers and operators have learned a lot from the mobile broadband Revel
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:34,975	| IOT144 |	Lucien you know starting tennis years ago in terms of what they need to provide on the network
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,791	| IOT144 |	Kind of demanding to have from devices and so on
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:40,095	| IOT144 |	We seen figures and other.
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,863	| IOT144 |	20 billion device
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,703	| IOT144 |	So I'll cut them a little Slack
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,007	| IOT144 |	But by this time next year
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,799	| IOT144 |	If this is still on your disappointments list
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,079	| IOT144 |	That's a major fail in my pee
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,407	| IOT144 |	Another disappointment
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,175	| IOT144 |	Is
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:56,223	| IOT144 |	The Trump administration's decision not
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| IOT144 |	To continue with the vehicle to vehicle
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,855	| IOT144 |	Communication standards 7th grade to like 5 years ago
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,647	| IOT144 |	And not to implement that
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,159	| IOT144 |	Which
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,487	| IOT144 |	There's concern over the cellular in Hawaii
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:07,999	| IOT144 |	HiFi guys
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,535	| IOT144 |	But I really thought
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,327	| IOT144 |	We have this solved
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| IOT144 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:16,447	| IOT144 |	I got a lot of people
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,215	| IOT144 |	Possibilities
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| IOT144 |	Screeching halt
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:24,895	| IOT144 |	I can't argue with you on this one I'm disappointed as well it's just it's something that took so long and get going
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,175	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:29,247	| IOT144 |	We even had you know an official protocol standard for it
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,551	| IOT144 |	And we were just about to get
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,367	| IOT144 |	Rolling out here and now it's like nope not doing it
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,695	| IOT144 |	So that kind of sums up my biggest
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:41,535	| IOT144 |	As always I'm disappointed that I don't hear more from
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,327	| IOT144 |	Companies that are actually implemented
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,863	| IOT144 |	Cool iot stuff
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,911	| IOT144 |	I know that you're out there I know there are pilots and
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| IOT144 |	Sensitive
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| IOT144 |	I'm a little disappointed that I have
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,775	| IOT144 |	Heard more
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,287	| IOT144 |	Successful
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,311	| IOT144 |	Scale
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:11:00,735	| IOT144 |	And that could be partially because companies may think we just implemented is one thing that was a mess of undertaking and it gives
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,271	| IOT144 |	This Thursday that we didn't have before
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,063	| IOT144 |	We can make more sense of it
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,087	| IOT144 |	But part of me says
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,135	| IOT144 |	Are they thinking that's not
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:11,231	| IOT144 |	Big enough in there for not reaching out or shouting from the rooftops look what we did
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,743	| IOT144 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,279	| IOT144 |	Either
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,815	| IOT144 |	So that's our
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,351	| IOT144 |	So now we'll move into
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,679	| IOT144 |	Are crazy iot prediction
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,823	| IOT144 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,359	| IOT144 |	What we think is going to happen
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:28,639	| IOT144 |	2018
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,919	| IOT144 |	So
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,735	| IOT144 |	Let's kick it off with me on the smart home side
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,783	| IOT144 |	I think price is going to become a
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,063	| IOT144 |	Huge honkin deal to cancer
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,903	| IOT144 |	We're seeing so much interested really cheap
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:43,743	| IOT144 |	Iot home devices I think that's because people have realized that
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,303	| IOT144 |	Like we said earlier it's still kind of sucky
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:50,143	| IOT144 |	And I'm not going to spend a lot of money it's a lot to ask someone to spend you know
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,447	| IOT144 |	250 bucks on a camera
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:55,007	| IOT144 |	If they're not sure how it's all going to work together
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| IOT144 |	What other products
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,335	| IOT144 |	So I think
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| IOT144 |	Cheaper devices are going to come
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,175	| IOT144 |	If that's actually tied to another prediction
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:05,247	| IOT144 |	Air quality in China
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,271	| IOT144 |	Some Chinese manufacturer
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,063	| IOT144 |	It's actually getting really good
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:10,623	| IOT144 |	There's a lot more emphasis when I talk to you
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,647	| IOT144 |	Suppliers and
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,415	| IOT144 |	When I talk to me
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:12,927	| IOT144 |	Facturar
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,487	| IOT144 |	They're telling me that in China
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,047	| IOT144 |	Quality is becoming a big
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,559	| IOT144 |	Issue
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:22,911	| IOT144 |	And tell if you tie those two things together we're going to see some cheap devices but
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,983	| IOT144 |	Basement of quality and I think that's going to be
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,775	| IOT144 |	A lot of pressure on other
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,799	| IOT144 |	Providers in this area
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,103	| IOT144 |	I hope so because I just
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,407	| IOT144 |	Started pricing out motorized blinds
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,735	| IOT144 |	For my house and oh my goodness it's ridiculously expensive
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| IOT144 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,807	| IOT144 |	So if you do motorized
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,855	| IOT144 |	I will tell you that
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,159	| IOT144 |	Part of the challenge is he want quiet blind
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,927	| IOT144 |	Mostly
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,463	| IOT144 |	Those quiet Motors
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,487	| IOT144 |	They cost a lot
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:48,511	| IOT144 |	Yes they do
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:53,375	| IOT144 |	Yes I do so little me at a prediction in here I think after
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:53,887	| IOT144 |	When it's been
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,983	| IOT144 |	Since 2014 I think it was 2014 that Apple announced homekit
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:04,383	| IOT144 |	So was 2015 going to be the year of homekit while it wasn't 2016 no 2017
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:10,783	| IOT144 |	I think 2018 will be able to say yeah homekit has finally
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,063	| IOT144 |	Cortical arrive
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| IOT144 |	Siri
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,623	| IOT144 |	Will probably just be good enough
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,903	| IOT144 |	I don't think
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,975	| IOT144 |	I made this prediction back when they announce the homepod in fact
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:22,047	| IOT144 |	Saying I then feel haven't proved serious that it will
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,327	| IOT144 |	Compete better with
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:27,935	| IOT144 |	Amazon and Google's offerings but now I'm I'm rethinking that I do not expect that to happen
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,959	| IOT144 |	Still be good enough
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,727	| IOT144 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,263	| IOT144 |	The big change here
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:34,079	| IOT144 |	Was Apple's decision to go with hardware-based
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,359	| IOT144 |	Security Authentication
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,919	| IOT144 |	And they have really thought that
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:44,319	| IOT144 |	Through now we can be software-based where we staying out said it could be so I think that will ease the burden on a lot of these
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,343	| IOT144 |	Device makers
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,647	| IOT144 |	Which they were kind of going in circles for the
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:51,487	| IOT144 |	The passenger year-and-a-half in my opinion so 2018 I'm going to call it home kit
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,767	| IOT144 |	Is it's a deer
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| IOT144 |	I agree with that
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,375	| IOT144 |	But it's probably because I've been burned by
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,215	| IOT144 |	And the people I talked to have also been burned by him
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,519	| IOT144 |	The vendors
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,823	| IOT144 |	And manufacturers are certainly
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,591	| IOT144 |	Losing faith
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,127	| IOT144 |	Or have lost faith
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,919	| IOT144 |	The consumers
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,711	| IOT144 |	It's still a very popular request
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,759	| IOT144 |	People email is questions
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,671	| IOT144 |	Fewer things do work
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,183	| IOT144 |	Don't get that is true
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,487	| IOT144 |	Let's see what happens this year
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| IOT144 |	So yes
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,023	| IOT144 |	I do see some
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| IOT144 |	All right
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,911	| IOT144 |	I also think in this is kind of a fun way
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:33,983	| IOT144 |	Actually going to see some Smart Homes getting built
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| IOT144 |	Sonu belt
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,079	| IOT144 |	New apartments
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,151	| IOT144 |	Smart features
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,687	| IOT144 |	Added to them or going on them
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,503	| IOT144 |	The new-build market
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:46,783	| IOT144 |	I think
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,807	| IOT144 |	Connected elements are going
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,111	| IOT144 |	Package
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,183	| IOT144 |	So what kind of like granite
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,719	| IOT144 |	I do think that's happening
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,999	| IOT144 |	Lennar
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,511	| IOT144 |	Katie Holmes
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| IOT144 |	All those companies
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:01,119	| IOT144 |	Investing in it I think we should keep our eyes open
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,399	| IOT144 |	It's a lot of these are investing around
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| IOT144 |	Particular
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,447	| IOT144 |	Product
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,215	| IOT144 |	Like home kit
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,519	| IOT144 |	Where
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,055	| IOT144 |	Why is a non homekit
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:11,615	| IOT144 |	Are non Apple phone user I look at that unlike
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| IOT144 |	That is useless
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,199	| IOT144 |	So that'll be really interesting
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,063	| IOT144 |	Developed that because the two ways of
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,623	| IOT144 |	I seen so far is homekit or they go with Ken
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,903	| IOT144 |	Proprietary app
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:29,791	| IOT144 |	That uses like a Z-Wave or zigbee and then a hug that the apartment community
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,559	| IOT144 |	Provides
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:33,631	| IOT144 |	And then you just have a nap and that's usually in the apartment
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,143	| IOT144 |	Stormcutter
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:37,471	| IOT144 |	I tend to agree with you I think you'll see more of this
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,519	| IOT144 |	I think homekit will be the
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,847	| IOT144 |	Not that the factor standard for this kind of option but I think it'll be the one that's
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| IOT144 |	Offer the most
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:50,527	| IOT144 |	And probably chosen the most then I say that because the people who are buying homes in the future are the younger generation
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:53,599	| IOT144 |	Right man I'm a downsize yet
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,415	| IOT144 |	You can live there for a couple years maybe and stay there but whatever
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,231	| IOT144 |	You're not going to buy new construction again is
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:00,255	| IOT144 |	My guess neither am I
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,583	| IOT144 |	If I buy it
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:08,703	| IOT144 |	I can't get any neutral wires every true I can sympathize with that personally but
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,727	| IOT144 |	Again.
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,751	| IOT144 |	Generation X
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,775	| IOT144 |	Up-and-coming
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,823	| IOT144 |	Spell remind vinegar properties
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,359	| IOT144 |	One thing I think they're
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,407	| IOT144 |	Probably more iOS than Android
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,687	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,967	| IOT144 |	They're going to want this
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,503	| IOT144 |	And I can't believe you just called me
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,855	| IOT144 |	I didn't say all that young girl
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| IOT144 |	We're no longer
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,159	| IOT144 |	Up-and-coming
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:31,487	| IOT144 |	AARP card online
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| IOT144 |	All right
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:35,327	| IOT144 |	After Kevin's called me old let's move it move ahead to new prediction
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,631	| IOT144 |	Oh I like this one this is a good one
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,959	| IOT144 |	Always something I alluded to in a post
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,239	| IOT144 |	A couple weeks back
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:46,847	| IOT144 |	I think we will start to see in 2018 very slowly but we will see it
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:50,175	| IOT144 |	More offline or contextual Smart's in the home
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:55,039	| IOT144 |	Thanks to more localized machine learning and AI this goes back to some of the
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:55,807	| IOT144 |	Products that
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,135	| IOT144 |	Amazon announced this year back in November
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,207	| IOT144 |	I'll soon Google has some products around this time talking
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,767	| IOT144 |	Specific about green grass for Amazon and
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| IOT144 |	Tensorflow Lite
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,815	| IOT144 |	For Google
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:09,631	| IOT144 |	I think it was a beer to bigger players in this space
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:10,655	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:14,751	| IOT144 |	We'll see if it's going to require new hardware or not I'm hoping not
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:21,663	| IOT144 |	It just amazes me for example that Google's pixel phones can be offline but still tell you what song is playing in the area
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,199	| IOT144 |	So there's some
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:25,247	| IOT144 |	What used to be in the cloud is now on the phone
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:30,623	| IOT144 |	Right way to see that everything going now to the home this last in 2017
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,391	| IOT144 |	Intel
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,415	| IOT144 |	They launch date
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:32,927	| IOT144 |	Device called the
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| IOT144 |	Movie Diaz
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,255	| IOT144 |	I think was the neural network dongle
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,607	| IOT144 |	Had again
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,399	| IOT144 |	Capable of machine learning capabilities on this
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,423	| IOT144 |	Portable little
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,727	| IOT144 |	Stick USB stick it was
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| IOT144 |	Crazy
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:49,311	| IOT144 |	So this is definitely a trend and I think what we're going to
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,359	| IOT144 |	I see is now that all this is out there
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,407	| IOT144 |	And people have started using it or going to CC
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| IOT144 |	Some really cool stuff
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:18:01,087	| IOT144 |	And the added benefit is when the robot overlords rise up again just pull out their AI dongle
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,415	| IOT144 |	Hi
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,231	| IOT144 |	Also
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,791	| IOT144 |	This is more on the Enterprise front butt
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:14,399	| IOT144 |	Pink tour 2018 we can safely say that the race to the clouds
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,191	| IOT144 |	Everybody in there
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,471	| IOT144 |	Dog
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,495	| IOT144 |	Everybody in their dongle
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,591	| IOT144 |	Industrial space
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,383	| IOT144 |	Pretty much over there giving up that
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,943	| IOT144 |	We're now the cloud is over
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| IOT144 |	The it guys
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:33,343	| IOT144 |	So we got a sure we've got Google we've got Amazon all offering really competitive and compelling
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,135	| IOT144 |	Iot services
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,671	| IOT144 |	For Enterprises
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,183	| IOT144 |	Industrial class
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| IOT144 |	And related to that
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,023	| IOT144 |	Next year we're going to see
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,303	| IOT144 |	Edge has already been a big
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,583	| IOT144 |	This year
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:47,935	| IOT144 |	But it's going to be more so next year we're actually going to see how companies
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,703	| IOT144 |	Are implementing it
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,007	| IOT144 |	Where to see a lot of startups
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,543	| IOT144 |	Come in and solve for some of the
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,567	| IOT144 |	The problems of
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,359	| IOT144 |	Computing at the edge such as latency
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,895	| IOT144 |	Security issues
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| IOT144 |	Ambient
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:00,479	| IOT144 |	So I'm going to look forward to that
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,247	| IOT144 |	Pill finder
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:01,759	| IOT144 |	Call me if you're
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:02,783	| IOT144 |	Cool startups in
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| IOT144 |	We'll talk
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:05,855	| IOT144 |	Hussy
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,903	| IOT144 |	Oh last week
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,695	| IOT144 |	But Kevin brought up a very good
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,975	| IOT144 |	How much is business
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,743	| IOT144 |	Voice
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,535	| IOT144 |	I think that's going to be big next year
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,047	| IOT144 |	But it is also
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:21,983	| IOT144 |	I think I T has a lot of nightmares right now and I forget what survey it was with something like 62% of ITP
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,519	| IOT144 |	People surveyed back in
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,055	| IOT144 |	October November
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:29,663	| IOT144 |	Didn't even feel confident they knew about all the devices on their Network in their
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,431	| IOT144 |	And that's a
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:34,015	| IOT144 |	Huge issue a huge issue it folks want to know
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| IOT144 |	Everything
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:41,183	| IOT144 |	Because they'll be held accountable if there's an issue and they certainly want to keep control of all that and the whole BYOD movement kind of
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,463	| IOT144 |	I took some of that away
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:45,279	| IOT144 |	I think the only reason they just got their hands on that
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,071	| IOT144 |	And wrangled those cats
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,631	| IOT144 |	But this is going to be a mess for them
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| IOT144 |	Now here's where I'm going to go
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,823	| IOT144 |	I think next year it shops are going to reassess
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,591	| IOT144 |	How they're implementing
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,663	| IOT144 |	I think very much like a guest
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,991	| IOT144 |	We had earlier this year they're going to be looking for longer are Eliza's
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,783	| IOT144 |	The short-term
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:09,599	| IOT144 |	Because they realize that you truly do a business transfer
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,391	| IOT144 |	Information you actually need to think
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,927	| IOT144 |	Longer-term
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,439	| IOT144 |	Bigger
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,719	| IOT144 |	And just you know
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,279	| IOT144 |	These very easy automation projects at
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,887	| IOT144 |	So I think they're going to reassess their role in
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| IOT144 |	An iot developer
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,471	| IOT144 |	Think we're going to see some local can
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:28,031	| IOT144 |	Control start to develop because a lot of
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:31,103	| IOT144 |	Value in iot a cruise where the sensors are
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,895	| IOT144 |	And often times that's going to be at
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,663	| IOT144 |	Your branch office
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,687	| IOT144 |	Start a retail shop
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,479	| IOT144 |	I sent that is not where I T is today
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:37,503	| IOT144 |	So I think
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,319	| IOT144 |	Go Kevin
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,599	| IOT144 |	I was
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:45,951	| IOT144 |	Right there with you I'm like yep I agree I agree I agree and then when you said local control
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:53,119	| IOT144 |	I just don't see it does not want to give up control anytime it gives up control
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,911	| IOT144 |	It feels it's opening itself up
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:59,007	| IOT144 |	For accountability when it has no way to be responsible number one
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,287	| IOT144 |	Into
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,079	| IOT144 |	It people and I was 1/4
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,103	| IOT144 |	For 15 years and
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:06,175	| IOT144 |	Maybe it's changed since I was last in the night eShop
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:10,015	| IOT144 |	They don't want to offload things be
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,295	| IOT144 |	Because they feel it
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,575	| IOT144 |	Many of them feel it
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,879	| IOT144 |	Reduces their value to the organization
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,928	| IOT144 |	And sadly while I understand that
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:23,328	| IOT144 |	You know it isn't just a very specialized you need roll anymore it permeates everything in today's modern
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| IOT144 |	Businesses so
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| IOT144 |	It's a balancing act
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:28,448	| IOT144 |	For these folks and I sympathize with them.
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,216	| IOT144 |	They're going to fight
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,264	| IOT144 |	Tooth and nail to not give up
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:33,056	| IOT144 |	Control okay so maybe our fight is
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,592	| IOT144 |	It fights
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,360	| IOT144 |	Business
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:35,872	| IOT144 |	Over
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:39,968	| IOT144 |	Chi-Chi has always fought with business and it always will
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,272	| IOT144 |	All right
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| IOT144 |	Well those are big
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,576	| IOT144 |	Predictions
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,624	| IOT144 |	For next year feel free to share your own
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,392	| IOT144 |	Predictions with us
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,440	| IOT144 |	I'm sure we'll get lots of cool ones
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,512	| IOT144 |	And then we decided to end it on biggest questions
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,536	| IOT144 |	Because
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,584	| IOT144 |	I don't know about you Kevin but
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,864	| IOT144 |	There's a lot of things happening that
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:01,728	| IOT144 |	Malik next year because I'm not sure how that's going to play out
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,496	| IOT144 |	But I feel like it's going to happen
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,824	| IOT144 |	So my first in this category is
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,616	| IOT144 |	What is going to happen
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,640	| IOT144 |	With GDP
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,432	| IOT144 |	PR and that is the
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,480	| IOT144 |	General data protection regulation
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,784	| IOT144 |	Yes that is the eu's act
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,576	| IOT144 |	It goes into effect May 25th
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:19,392	| IOT144 |	2018 it's basically instilling some
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,416	| IOT144 |	Privacy and data
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,696	| IOT144 |	Protection charges
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,256	| IOT144 |	Across the European Union but also
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,280	| IOT144 |	For EU citizens
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:28,608	| IOT144 |	So that means if an EU citizen is renting a
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:29,888	| IOT144 |	Here in the US
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,960	| IOT144 |	They actually are protected by this which means
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| IOT144 |	Companies in the US will
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,800	| IOT144 |	Undoubtedly and other parts of the world
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:37,824	| IOT144 |	Have to deal with
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,872	| IOT144 |	Many companies already put
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,944	| IOT144 |	Yeah I have a feeling they're going to
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:46,272	| IOT144 |	They're not going to be prepared for those kind of situations and
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,808	| IOT144 |	The other aspect to this is
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,856	| IOT144 |	We got the whole brexit vote
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:50,624	| IOT144 |	So
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:54,976	| IOT144 |	UK folks you're not covered under gdpr anymore unless
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:57,024	| IOT144 |	UK passes something similar on its own
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,304	| IOT144 |	Yeah you guys are like
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,888	| IOT144 |	Dip with no privacy
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,400	| IOT144 |	SC Productions
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:06,752	| IOT144 |	Now I will say looking ahead at this
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,288	| IOT144 |	We'll probably see a Spate of lawsuits
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,336	| IOT144 |	Very soon after its path
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,616	| IOT144 |	Most of the big tech companies
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,920	| IOT144 |	Totally on board and have been
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,200	| IOT144 |	Forever In terms
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,968	| IOT144 |	Getting their house at 4
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:20,576	| IOT144 |	So we're going to see some really interested I think the lawsuits
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| IOT144 |	Will see you're probably going to be
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:25,440	| IOT144 |	Smaller companies and maybe some of the sketchy data Brokers that have
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,976	| IOT144 |	Historically been in the shadows
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,488	| IOT144 |	Is there going to start
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,304	| IOT144 |	We're also probably going to see some newspaper articles
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| IOT144 |	Who are like
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,352	| IOT144 |	Reporter saying
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:36,448	| IOT144 |	I just ask Tinder for all the day that they have on me and holy cow
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| IOT144 |	What they have
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| IOT144 |	So I think there's going to be a real public
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,776	| IOT144 |	Accountability
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,544	| IOT144 |	Challenge
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,312	| IOT144 |	That's going to come out
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,920	| IOT144 |	And actually I'm glad you mentioned that this is probably something that
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,944	| IOT144 |	You and I should
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:51,040	| IOT144 |	Consider doing as well as to the listeners every once in awhile go and download
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,808	| IOT144 |	All of your
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:54,624	| IOT144 |	Data that's available safe from your Google account
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,416	| IOT144 |	From Facebook or whatever
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,208	| IOT144 |	It is and go see what they really have
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,768	| IOT144 |	Because there's been a lot of interesting stories in the past year
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,536	| IOT144 |	About
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,096	| IOT144 |	You know Shadow accounts and so on so forth and let's
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,376	| IOT144 |	Probably
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,400	| IOT144 |	On us-22
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,680	| IOT144 |	Really dig into that
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| IOT144 |	All right
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,240	| IOT144 |	Just giving ourselves
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,264	| IOT144 |	More work
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,544	| IOT144 |	Next big Quest
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:17,408	| IOT144 |	What will the end of net neutrality mean
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:20,224	| IOT144 |	For iot assuming
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,248	| IOT144 |	That net
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,016	| IOT144 |	Neutrality
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:26,112	| IOT144 |	Does go by the wayside from the protections that were put in place two years ago
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:29,696	| IOT144 |	I don't know I can only because I don't
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,488	| IOT144 |	Know that we have all the details yet
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| IOT144 |	Split
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,304	| IOT144 |	I don't know what I'm sure you have thoughts on this
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,864	| IOT144 |	We don't have to that's why it's one of our biggest question
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,376	| IOT144 |	We don't have to know
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT144 |	We just have to
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,448	| IOT144 |	Bring it up as like
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,216	| IOT144 |	Hey
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:43,008	| IOT144 |	It's possible now we're recording this
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,800	| IOT144 |	Before the December 14th vote
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,080	| IOT144 |	So we don't know how
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,616	| IOT144 |	Tamarindo or if it's going to happen
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,432	| IOT144 |	There's also will that boat stand after
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,200	| IOT144 |	Comet Pride
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,992	| IOT144 |	What kind of a judge don't know
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,016	| IOT144 |	That's going to be stuffed
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,576	| IOT144 |	To be decided and then
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,368	| IOT144 |	Also just how are
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,416	| IOT144 |	Isps going to
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,184	| IOT144 |	Treat things
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,720	| IOT144 |	My Comcast has a very big
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,280	| IOT144 |	Smart Health effort and they also
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:08,096	| IOT144 |	Have been historically pretty aggressive
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:08,864	| IOT144 |	About
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:10,144	| IOT144 |	Walking things on their Network
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,984	| IOT144 |	It will be interesting
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,496	| IOT144 |	To say the least
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,056	| IOT144 |	Another big question we have is
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,336	| IOT144 |	Security
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,896	| IOT144 |	I don't think security is an issue is going to go away
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:24,224	| IOT144 |	I am not really helpful and I would love to see a new security
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:26,528	| IOT144 |	Model developed for connected devices
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,296	| IOT144 |	In the home
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,320	| IOT144 |	And Enterprise
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,088	| IOT144 |	So
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,880	| IOT144 |	My big question then for next year is what
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:38,048	| IOT144 |	And also just because we're talking about legislation I wonder if we will actually have some real legislation
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:40,864	| IOT144 |	From a security standpoint that's passed here in the US
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:43,168	| IOT144 |	Because every said earlier it's just been
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,984	| IOT144 |	Nonexistent or on the very very slow Rhode
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,848	| IOT144 |	And my final big question has to do with cellular network
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,896	| IOT144 |	Lyrics I'm curious of NBA
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,664	| IOT144 |	Katem
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,432	| IOT144 |	Will win
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,200	| IOT144 |	Actually
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,504	| IOT144 |	Probably should brag mat for low-power wide-area
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,040	| IOT144 |	What will win
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,112	| IOT144 |	Probably
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:07,744	| IOT144 |	Is there still Laura there sigfox all those are being deployed and I'm curious if we're going to see
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| IOT144 |	What networks
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:13,376	| IOT144 |	Become popular and what locations and for what types
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,424	| IOT144 |	Business situations
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,704	| IOT144 |	Yeah I was going to say
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| IOT144 |	What I think
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,752	| IOT144 |	We'll see is different
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,544	| IOT144 |	44 winners in different Geographic
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:24,896	| IOT144 |	Regions based on operators and what they've already started it deployed
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,176	| IOT144 |	Bro they've already started down
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,480	| IOT144 |	Well and I have lots of
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:32,064	| IOT144 |	Peter probably a good place to stop
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,368	| IOT144 |	And give you guys some food cuz I feel free to

EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,184	| IOT144 |	My family
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,232	| IOT144 |	So I got my lovely husband
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,512	| IOT144 |	Andrew
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,048	| IOT144 |	And my daughter Anna
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:14,816	| IOT144 |	Hi
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,608	| IOT144 |	As usual
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,912	| IOT144 |	Around this time of year they are here to join us
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:21,216	| IOT144 |	Did give you a mainstream perspective
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,984	| IOT144 |	On what it's like
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,752	| IOT144 |	2
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:23,264	| IOT144 |	Live in
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,592	| IOT144 |	So let's kick it off with this year
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,128	| IOT144 |	I feel like I personally have
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,712	| IOT144 |	I've tried out fewer devices and spent less time changing
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,272	| IOT144 |	Do you guys think that's true
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:36,576	| IOT144 |	I would say lately that's the
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:42,976	| IOT144 |	Case you know there's still some things that I wish would be tinkered with so they would work a little bit better but I think that's
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,768	| IOT144 |	It's probably true because you've got
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,328	| IOT144 |	Kind of a baseline together with all of our light temperature
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,608	| IOT144 |	So this year
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,888	| IOT144 |	I brought it in
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,656	| IOT144 |	A couple
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,960	| IOT144 |	New devices
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,264	| IOT144 |	I know everyone who listens to the show
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,288	| IOT144 |	Understands my husband
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,568	| IOT144 |	Affection for the June
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,104	| IOT144 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,896	| IOT144 |	In addition to that
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,176	| IOT144 |	What else
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,200	| IOT144 |	That you guys are like
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:03,712	| IOT144 |	It's not so bad
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:06,016	| IOT144 |	That's not so bad that's
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,296	| IOT144 |	What hasn't been so bad
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,856	| IOT144 |	All the Alexa's in the house
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:12,672	| IOT144 |	You do have quite a few more now don't we
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:17,536	| IOT144 |	They seem to increase over time
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,560	| IOT144 |	NAU
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:22,144	| IOT144 |	Previously told me that you did not want any smart devices
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,448	| IOT144 |	And now you have an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,240	| IOT144 |	Why was that the device
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,032	| IOT144 |	Because
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:34,944	| IOT144 |	Once I'd gotten to know a little bit better and feel how it affected me everyday
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:37,760	| IOT144 |	Since they were pretty much all over the house
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,040	| IOT144 |	I realize that
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,856	| IOT144 |	I would not mind having one of my room
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:44,416	| IOT144 |	Because there were some things I noticed about my house
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:47,488	| IOT144 |	And that Alexa could fix
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:54,912	| IOT144 |	I like to listen to music when I'm doing homework or studying or playing and
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,728	| IOT144 |	Designed to play music
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,312	| IOT144 |	No not really
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,360	| IOT144 |	What if I put a smart light bulb
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,736	| IOT144 |	Well maybe I'll sneak one in there and see what happens
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:13,088	| IOT144 |	Andrew what have you added or what if we added that
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:16,160	| IOT144 |	First of all in the Echo
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:21,792	| IOT144 |	I would say that they are helpful I'm not a huge fan of the Echo Show I believe there was this year
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:25,632	| IOT144 |	Compared to the regular Echo mainly downstairs
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,400	| IOT144 |	Because we have
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,704	| IOT144 |	Kind of the bank open downstairs
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:30,752	| IOT144 |	The Amazon Echo you know that big
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,544	| IOT144 |	Ring on top lights up
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:36,896	| IOT144 |	When it's listening for the echo show yet to be looking at it to know if it's listening or not
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:43,296	| IOT144 |	And I've also found that the sound quality isn't as good because it doesn't have the the speakers going all the way around
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,064	| IOT144 |	I'm also
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:50,976	| IOT144 |	If Google home had all the connections at the same time as early as Alexa I would say the Google home
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:53,536	| IOT144 |	Is better because it's so much better at search
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:30:00,448	| IOT144 |	Write them in there so many questions that I think are fairly simple that Alexa can't answer that Google can and Google seems to
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,472	| IOT144 |	Understand
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,776	| IOT144 |	My questions better than
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,568	| IOT144 |	The Madam a does as well
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:11,968	| IOT144 |	As far as new things in the home while the June oven obviously is nice another one was pretty simple.
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:14,784	| IOT144 |	Share but it's a huge help which is you put in that
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| IOT144 |	Connected
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:17,856	| IOT144 |	Switch for the under cabinet
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,624	| IOT144 |	Kitchen light
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:27,328	| IOT144 |	And connected to a pair of fluorescent bulbs that we have
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:29,120	| IOT144 |	Several fluorescent bulbs
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,632	| IOT144 |	So we had on our kid
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:34,752	| IOT144 |	Right and so it did two things for us one is
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:39,360	| IOT144 |	And when you've got your hands dirty with food and instead of reaching for that switch
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:44,480	| IOT144 |	Turn on the under cab lights you can just ask Madam a to turn them on at the other thing is
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,248	| IOT144 |	Bad habit
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,784	| IOT144 |	Leaving house lights on
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:51,648	| IOT144 |	And since they were connected where is the rest of kitchen lights were connected I got yelled at by
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,416	| IOT144 |	Not not yet
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:57,024	| IOT144 |	I got in trouble with a certain someone for leaving those lights on
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:31:00,608	| IOT144 |	When she would be going to bed and ask matamata turn off
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:04,192	| IOT144 |	The lights downstairs knows want to go off and then she'd have to walk over and do it so
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,472	| IOT144 |	That was help
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:05,984	| IOT144 |	All is well
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,056	| IOT144 |	All right helps you with your bad habits
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:09,568	| IOT144 |	And also
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,104	| IOT144 |	Just make life
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,640	| IOT144 |	Yay
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:15,200	| IOT144 |	Okay we also this year went through
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,224	| IOT144 |	Couple different thermostat
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:19,040	| IOT144 |	I say we had a Honeywell T5
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:19,552	| IOT144 |	For a while
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,368	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:25,440	| IOT144 |	Have historically had an ecobee smart SI
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:27,488	| IOT144 |	And then I just put it in a thermostat
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:30,304	| IOT144 |	From Luxe products which is a sponsor of the show
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,072	| IOT144 |	To try that out
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,888	| IOT144 |	And we also upstairs have a nest
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:38,240	| IOT144 |	So given that we played with a lot of different thermostats I'm actually curious like
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:42,080	| IOT144 |	Does it even matter what smart thermostat you have or do you even care if you
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| IOT144 |	Your thermostat smart
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,920	| IOT144 |	I just want something that works
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:49,760	| IOT144 |	You know it and frankly even if I just have to program it
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:55,136	| IOT144 |	If it has it's kind of a smart away future that's enough for me that thing that bothered
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:32:00,000	| IOT144 |	Me about the nest is when it decides on its own that would be more comfortable at a certain temperature
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:06,400	| IOT144 |	And it plays with it and then the middle of the night you get really hot I guess there was a bug on that this year fire caulk
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,168	| IOT144 |	Correctly
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:09,216	| IOT144 |	Slasher
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:14,848	| IOT144 |	I guess the answer is the basics I need I need an app on my phone so I can adjust the temperature
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,640	| IOT144 |	They were out of town
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:21,504	| IOT144 |	It needs to be easy to program when we want it to be certain temperatures
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:26,112	| IOT144 |	Really that's that's about it as long as it's working that's good
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,160	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:31,488	| IOT144 |	And I feel like we should do it connected toys this year
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,792	| IOT144 |	We've kind of spent most of your time just hanging out of the car
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,560	| IOT144 |	Computer instead
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:37,376	| IOT144 |	So are there any features or anything
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:40,448	| IOT144 |	Exciting that you like you actually like the Echo Show
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:46,592	| IOT144 |	Yes I like the Echo Show because I feel like it's a bit more interactive send
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:48,384	| IOT144 |	Other lights as because
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,152	| IOT144 |	You can ask
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,712	| IOT144 |	Steve information
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:55,040	| IOT144 |	And it gives you prompts for what to say when your just like
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,344	| IOT144 |	Well what else can Alexa do
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:59,136	| IOT144 |	And you can actually
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,696	| IOT144 |	CM Punk's and you can just look at it
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:03,232	| IOT144 |	Are the time instead of just
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,768	| IOT144 |	Having to ask
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,048	| IOT144 |	Madame payforit
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:12,192	| IOT144 |	And it's also helpful when you got like recipes or something that's pulled up because you can just
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,240	| IOT144 |	Look at it rather than
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,032	| IOT144 |	Haven't got you other
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,312	| IOT144 |	Trouble because
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,336	| IOT144 |	It's just
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:20,384	| IOT144 |	Like a voice programmed iPad
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:23,200	| IOT144 |	A couple times I called you guys while I was out of town
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:24,992	| IOT144 |	And I drop in on you on the echo
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:26,528	| IOT144 |	How did you guys
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,320	| IOT144 |	It was
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:32,928	| IOT144 |	Strange to see the sudden transformation of like a screen
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:35,744	| IOT144 |	Intuiface from distances away
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,512	| IOT144 |	And
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:40,352	| IOT144 |	It was kind of strange to know that the camera on Alexa
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,632	| IOT144 |	Stampwithbrian
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,912	| IOT144 |	Casting us
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:46,752	| IOT144 |	To somewhere else but I thought it was a nice feature because
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,776	| IOT144 |	We could talk
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,312	| IOT144 |	/ serial
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:50,592	| IOT144 |	No
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:54,944	| IOT144 |	You know they took the Amazon and Google who owns YouTube are in a fight
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:59,808	| IOT144 |	Which is why we can't watch her Corgi videos do you feel like this out loud
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,112	| IOT144 |	I know without that
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:02,624	| IOT144 |	Do you think
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,928	| IOT144 |	TV show is still worth it
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:07,744	| IOT144 |	That is a very tough question because
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:11,840	| IOT144 |	What are my priorities on it was that I was able to watch
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,376	| IOT144 |	Crazy videos on YouTube
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:17,472	| IOT144 |	I feel like the other stuff adds up and makes up for it
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,496	| IOT144 |	Because
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,032	| IOT144 |	Even though
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:23,616	| IOT144 |	Madam is having some conflicts with
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:27,968	| IOT144 |	Partners and stuff it doesn't limit its abilities to full extent
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,016	| IOT144 |	All right what about things that didn't work
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,576	| IOT144 |	I can think of one Gadget
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,856	| IOT144 |	It is driving my entire family
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:37,184	| IOT144 |	It's currently driving us crazy
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:38,976	| IOT144 |	I'll give you a hint
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,328	| IOT144 |	Cleverpet
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,120	| IOT144 |	Yes
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,144	| IOT144 |	To be fair this is
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:46,912	| IOT144 |	Cleverpet
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:47,424	| IOT144 |	Pet feeder
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:49,728	| IOT144 |	It's designed for people who are not at home
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,008	| IOT144 |	For their pets
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,288	| IOT144 |	Still like entertain themselves during
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:57,920	| IOT144 |	But since my family is off at home since we had it over the Thanksgiving holidays and some other days were
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,224	| IOT144 |	Still in the house
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,272	| IOT144 |	Treatment to find itself unplugged
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,040	| IOT144 |	Quite a bit
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,808	| IOT144 |	Well
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,832	| IOT144 |	Once or twice
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:08,928	| IOT144 |	But it is very annoying if you're sitting there in every
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:11,232	| IOT144 |	10 to 30 seconds it's making it
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:13,024	| IOT144 |	Loud mechanical noise
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:15,328	| IOT144 |	And our dog doesn't seem to appreciate it either
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,400	| IOT144 |	Okay I don't think she's learning
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,680	| IOT144 |	Skyrim
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,216	| IOT144 |	It's possible that our dog is
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:25,568	| IOT144 |	Okay what other gadgets any other things that we saw this year that
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,080	| IOT144 |	You guys were like
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,360	| IOT144 |	I want some of that
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,408	| IOT144 |	Why don't we have this installed
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,176	| IOT144 |	Or
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,456	| IOT144 |	Please take this out of my house
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:37,088	| IOT144 |	One thing I have noticed this year is that our internet seems to be working well and I think
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,112	| IOT144 |	I don't remember when we play
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:44,512	| IOT144 |	Put the first-generation erosion in the second generation but and I don't know if that's it but I was having lots of connect
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:48,608	| IOT144 |	Tivity issues before that and it seems to be going really well the past
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,144	| IOT144 |	6 to 12 months
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,680	| IOT144 |	Will give ear of the credit for that
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,960	| IOT144 |	Cuz yeah you definitely have some
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,240	| IOT144 |	Your computer does
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:54,752	| IOT144 |	Did not like steak
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:59,872	| IOT144 |	It didn't another thing to is a device I rarely used
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:06,272	| IOT144 |	But when I do use it it's extremely helpful and that's the Chamberlain MyQ for the garage door for example when your car was in
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,064	| IOT144 |	Rashad we had the loaner car
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,368	| IOT144 |	Didn't have the garage door opener or the
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,136	| IOT144 |	The Homelink
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:14,208	| IOT144 |	And so being able to open up the app
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,232	| IOT144 |	And select
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:20,096	| IOT144 |	Might see you in just open the garage door that way was helpful especially because we have such
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:26,496	| IOT144 |	A sloped driveway so to actually park it and get out and go into the garage and open it isn't all that easy so
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,776	| IOT144 |	That was very helpful as well
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,312	| IOT144 |	And speaking of the Mikey
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,848	| IOT144 |	Do they actually have added
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,152	| IOT144 |	A feature that would integrate it with like if
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:37,504	| IOT144 |	Or even like maybe your Google home and what it is is you would pay
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:39,040	| IOT144 |	Buck extra each month or
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:39,808	| IOT144 |	$10 a year
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,112	| IOT144 |	Right now we don't subscribe to
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:45,952	| IOT144 |	To any of these things but I'm very curious if you think there would be value
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:46,720	| IOT144 |	In
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,768	| IOT144 |	One of those types of subscriptions or maybe
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,792	| IOT144 |	Cloud-based camera system
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:56,960	| IOT144 |	It's a good question you know one thing we've done recently as go through look at all of our subscriptions in because they do that
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:59,008	| IOT144 |	And see which ones were actually using
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:05,408	| IOT144 |	I need to keep I can't think of anything off the top my head with the MyQ where I'm like oh I wish I could do this or that
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:10,272	| IOT144 |	That that said a lot of times you know I didn't think I needed voice activated stuff before the Alexa camera
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:15,392	| IOT144 |	So you know sometimes it's what you actually get it that you realize how valuable it is
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,184	| IOT144 |	Security cameras
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:22,560	| IOT144 |	I guess if they would record for a little bit longer or keep it store longer but for the most part
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:28,960	| IOT144 |	We would know if we need a recording pretty quickly after it happens right if we were robbed or something like that we would know
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:32,032	| IOT144 |	No I can't think of anything off top my head run like
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:35,360	| IOT144 |	I would pay a monthly fee for this at the same time
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:37,152	| IOT144 |	I'm sure there are some things that
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:38,688	| IOT144 |	Would add value that I
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,968	| IOT144 |	Say yes let's pay for it
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,504	| IOT144 |	Okay
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:42,784	| IOT144 |	Because you are young
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:44,064	| IOT144 |	You are the voice of the future
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,392	| IOT144 |	Can you come with your own theme music
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,928	| IOT144 |	In your Ideal World
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,976	| IOT144 |	What do you think the house that you live in
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,256	| IOT144 |	Like 20 years
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,536	| IOT144 |	10 years
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:55,584	| IOT144 |	What do you think how do you think it reacts to
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,888	| IOT144 |	In the future
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:02,752	| IOT144 |	It really depends because I feel like the way technology is going it's going to be
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,544	| IOT144 |	A lot more customizable
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,312	| IOT144 |	Journey
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,176	| IOT144 |	Brilliant light
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:11,456	| IOT144 |	Being in control
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:11,968	| IOT144 |	Troll
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,040	| IOT144 |	Less than being able to
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,576	| IOT144 |	Talk to things
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:17,344	| IOT144 |	So
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:17,856	| IOT144 |	I like
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,928	| IOT144 |	Having easily access
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:22,720	| IOT144 |	Too late
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,000	| IOT144 |	And control
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,280	| IOT144 |	So
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:27,840	| IOT144 |	It's pretty clear that this year was The Big Year for
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:30,144	| IOT144 |	Voice to become a smart home interface
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,424	| IOT144 |	Since we've been
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,752	| IOT144 |	When is it worked and when does
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,592	| IOT144 |	Well it's very helpful I think for lights
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:39,872	| IOT144 |	In general
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:44,992	| IOT144 |	Especially when your hands are full or in our case now we can we're going to bed we can just
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:49,856	| IOT144 |	Come upstairs and say turn off downstairs we also added the television
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,160	| IOT144 |	Thing this year what is that called
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:56,000	| IOT144 |	Logitech Harmony Hub which is kind of nice when you
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:02,912	| IOT144 |	You having a glass in your hand and you're heading over to the living room to watch TV to tell it to turn on the television
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:06,496	| IOT144 |	And have the TV and the Roku and everything just kind of boo'd up
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:08,800	| IOT144 |	I will say that it still seems like
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:09,568	| IOT144 |	Matinee
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,360	| IOT144 |	Miss carries us
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,128	| IOT144 |	A lot
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:18,528	| IOT144 |	And it's not getting any better in fact I feel like as we had more devices it gets worse because she gets confused
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,552	| IOT144 |	Between them
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:21,344	| IOT144 |	And so you know a lot of time she asks
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:24,672	| IOT144 |	For clarification and it just seems so far off from what we were asking
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,464	| IOT144 |	Well let me ask you this guy's
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:29,536	| IOT144 |	What if I swapped out Madame A4
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:30,048	| IOT144 |	Haji
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:35,680	| IOT144 |	I like the idea that the one thing I don't like
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,448	| IOT144 |	About the
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:37,728	| IOT144 |	The Google
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,752	| IOT144 |	Is that
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,544	| IOT144 |	It has soy
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:44,640	| IOT144 |	I mentioned the Alexa has that ring of lights on top so you know and it's listening
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:47,200	| IOT144 |	The Google home on the other hand has a slope top
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:49,248	| IOT144 |	And it lights up a little bit
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:51,552	| IOT144 |	But if it's facing away from you
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:54,880	| IOT144 |	If the slope is going the other way you can't tell if it's listening
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:40:00,768	| IOT144 |	So that's one downside but I'd I totally be up for trying like a swap downstairs and seeing how it works
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,304	| IOT144 |	We did it for a little bit
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:03,328	| IOT144 |	Hugh
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,400	| IOT144 |	Well was that
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:08,448	| IOT144 |	When we had the regular matinee
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,216	| IOT144 |	Yes
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:13,568	| IOT144 |	Cuz I think my big complaint with the Google was that I didn't know if it was
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:15,104	| IOT144 |	If it hurt us or not
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:18,176	| IOT144 |	Where is the matinee we could see that it was listening
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:20,480	| IOT144 |	Alright any gadgets on your wishlist
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,272	| IOT144 |	Oh I have one
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:23,296	| IOT144 |	It's about the
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:26,880	| IOT144 |	It comes in and actually sets up the expensive thing we have that
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:30,208	| IOT144 |	Makes our Shades go down automatically and allow us to control them
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,744	| IOT144 |	Every year
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,280	| IOT144 |	I just I just want to give you something
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:38,656	| IOT144 |	The house of 15 or 20 years from now it'll actually be set up
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:41,216	| IOT144 |	In anything that you're excited about or think would be fun
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:42,496	| IOT144 |	Onion
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:45,312	| IOT144 |	Smart toys these days
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:48,896	| IOT144 |	They're getting more and more interactive and I really
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:52,480	| IOT144 |	Appreciate that because it's not just so if I press
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,248	| IOT144 |	This
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,784	| IOT144 |	Something happened
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:56,576	| IOT144 |	Get you deeper into like
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:02,976	| IOT144 |	So if I do this combination that it's going to interact with me that I can interact back and it
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:07,072	| IOT144 |	Billy tentative sets Your Horizon towards a bigger goal when
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:09,888	| IOT144 |	You're playing and learning about tech
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,704	| IOT144 |	Was it last year that we got the
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,216	| IOT144 |	Robot
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:17,312	| IOT144 |	As I would call it the 7 minutes away
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,872	| IOT144 |	It was kind of a sentence like a
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,640	| IOT144 |	But yes
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,408	| IOT144 |	Yes
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:22,176	| IOT144 |	Cosmo
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:22,688	| IOT144 |	Cosmo
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:27,296	| IOT144 |	Yep the kids toys that you continue to play with the specialist
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,576	| IOT144 |	They cost over $100
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:31,136	| IOT144 |	Because when it's aimed towards kids
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:35,744	| IOT144 |	The main goal is not to show off the technology that's behind it
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,024	| IOT144 |	Its 2
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,816	| IOT144 |	Use that technology
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,864	| IOT144 |	And utilize it to keep
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:43,424	| IOT144 |	The buyer or purchaser Entergy
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,704	| IOT144 |	Because
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,520	| IOT144 |	Cosmo had some really advanced technology
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,568	| IOT144 |	Where it was using
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:51,360	| IOT144 |	Multiple codes to get
