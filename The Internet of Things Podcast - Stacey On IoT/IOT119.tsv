EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:33,344	| IOT119 |	Good reason not to have a show
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:39,744	| IOT119 |	The Amazon Echo Show it came out it was delivered on June 28th to anybody who pre-ordered the

EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| IOT119 |	Michelle makes me feel so lonely
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,232	| IOT119 |	Because it does
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,768	| IOT119 |	Because I have one
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:16,096	| IOT119 |	And the biggest problem with the Echo Show
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,376	| IOT119 |	Is that
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,424	| IOT119 |	It's really freaking hard to call people
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,984	| IOT119 |	It's hard to find your friends

EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,464	| IOT119 |	Actually it's an echo it's the whole Echo interface but I don't mind not being it
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,256	| IOT119 |	Caucus

EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,920	| IOT119 |	Show with the Echo Show I can do to differ
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,736	| IOT119 |	If someone else has an
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| IOT119 |	An Echo Show

EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,600	| IOT119 |	We would essentially have a video call
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,928	| IOT119 |	It looks nice it works really well actually
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,440	| IOT119 |	Or
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:17,280	| IOT119 |	If we're really good friends are like your parents or something like that

EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:25,471	| IOT119 |	Label someone is being okay in your contacts list to drop in and then they can call you
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,775	| IOT119 |	Any point in time in the actually
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,311	| IOT119 |	They can do this from
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,335	| IOT119 |	Madam ASAP
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,127	| IOT119 |	On the phone too

EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT119 |	To show
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:47,743	| IOT119 |	That's funny you say that because I was actually in the app as you were described as Mike I bet you I can
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,791	| IOT119 |	Have a video call with the phone and I could
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| IOT119 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,839	| IOT119 |	Or if I said

EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,911	| IOT119 |	To drop in on the show
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,239	| IOT119 |	Kevin could actually just use that drop in function
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,007	| IOT119 |	Pinterest
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,031	| IOT119 |	What happens then
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,543	| IOT119 |	Is
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| IOT119 |	He would
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| IOT119 |	Actually start seeing
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,175	| IOT119 |	Right away he would see a blurred version
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,735	| IOT119 |	Busy typing
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,039	| IOT119 |	Eventually it comes clear and clear
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,087	| IOT119 |	So this is time for you to put on your shirt if you're dating
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,671	| IOT119 |	Then suddenly would be like
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,951	| IOT119 |	And
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,999	| IOT119 |	We can talk video conference hands-free
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,023	| IOT119 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,303	| IOT119 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,839	| IOT119 |	Tell a couple things

EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,383	| IOT119 |	Phone number that's registered with
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:36,895	| IOT119 |	Amazon
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,455	| IOT119 |	If that is the same number registered with the
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:39,967	| IOT119 |	Echo
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,527	| IOT119 |	Or there a account
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,831	| IOT119 |	Then you'll see their name
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,623	| IOT119 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,415	| IOT119 |	So it's like it's your mom
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,487	| IOT119 |	The Amazon account is in your dad's name
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,767	| IOT119 |	You're going to have to have him
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,279	| IOT119 |	He'll beer
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,631	| IOT119 |	Pssi telephone number essentially
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:00,703	| IOT119 |	Yes in the phone number that they registered their Echo devices
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| IOT119 |	Weather
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,495	| IOT119 |	Padme stuff
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,519	| IOT119 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| IOT119 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,335	| IOT119 |	So that's
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,383	| IOT119 |	That's one so it's really not easy
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| IOT119 |	To connect
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,967	| IOT119 |	It's not as simple as sending out like an email in
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:18,623	| IOT119 |	And my mom is like to have one of these and she's I can't be just talk on Duo
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,647	| IOT119 |	I was like okay fine
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,439	| IOT119 |	Hide and then she's like I don't want Google to have
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:21,951	| IOT119 |	Have my phone number
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,095	| IOT119 |	No no no I don't want to talk into
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,655	| IOT119 |	So we're going to Skype
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,959	| IOT119 |	Stacy I don't want to talk to you anymore
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,471	| IOT119 |	Tall
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,799	| IOT119 |	And that's what my mom and I are no longer talking
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,847	| IOT119 |	So some other things about the echo
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:42,175	| IOT119 |	The show doesn't have the capabilities you want
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,967	| IOT119 |	I'm just going to say this to be
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,247	| IOT119 |	Totally real
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:48,831	| IOT119 |	The potential is really there in like doing things like
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,135	| IOT119 |	You can tie it to some of your video cameras
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,207	| IOT119 |	I wanted to tie it to my August doorbell
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:58,559	| IOT119 |	But so far that doesn't seem to be working for me I'm not sure why
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:01,375	| IOT119 |	Cuz I would like to be like hey
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,911	| IOT119 |	Animated show me my doorbell
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,447	| IOT119 |	Which cool feature
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,543	| IOT119 |	I'm you can also if it's linked into like
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:11,615	| IOT119 |	It's temperature sensors inside you can paint show me the indoor temperature
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,151	| IOT119 |	Edible show you that it
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,199	| IOT119 |	It's nice for features like the weather cuz you can see the
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:22,879	| IOT119 |	It is also nice for Amazon Prime this is a use case I didn't really think about that my daughter and I were
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,671	| IOT119 |	It's my show is in the kitchen
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,231	| IOT119 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,023	| IOT119 |	We put
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,303	| IOT119 |	The original Echo
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,839	| IOT119 |	Away from her
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,399	| IOT119 |	The kitchen at used to be in the kitchen and now it's not
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:34,911	| IOT119 |	But
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,215	| IOT119 |	The show is not as good
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,263	| IOT119 |	For two reasons one
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| IOT119 |	You can't tell
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,103	| IOT119 |	If the screen is not facing you you don't know if it's
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:47,455	| IOT119 |	There's no light indicator of any kind not on top of it
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,271	| IOT119 |	In into
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,855	| IOT119 |	I don't want their Mike's all around but when it's not facing me
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,623	| IOT119 |	It doesn't seem to hear
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:58,207	| IOT119 |	So it's hearing seems to be a little bit in
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,487	| IOT119 |	Compared to the rake
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:04,095	| IOT119 |	And this is an exact same position
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,375	| IOT119 |	The other one was
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:10,495	| IOT119 |	Right I think the original Echo has zika 7 array microphone
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:14,847	| IOT119 |	Or 7 microphone array I should say I don't know what the
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:19,199	| IOT119 |	Show house but they are far field mics
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,991	| IOT119 |	So it was It was kind of surprising to us
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,319	| IOT119 |	So keep that in mind
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| IOT119 |	And then
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,927	| IOT119 |	The scream can be a distraction
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,743	| IOT119 |	Cuz as long as it thinks you're there
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,279	| IOT119 |	It's showing you stuff it shows you
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,583	| IOT119 |	They're not actually ads
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:38,911	| IOT119 |	All the time there's like trending topics but they sometimes could be an ad
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:42,495	| IOT119 |	Also something.
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,543	| IOT119 |	Consider I like the fact that shows me the weather all the time
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,335	| IOT119 |	You can use it to show
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| IOT119 |	Photos if they're stored in your
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,151	| IOT119 |	Amazon
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,919	| IOT119 |	Photo account
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| IOT119 |	Apparently is a thing
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:58,111	| IOT119 |	Yeah it is an and I believe I got an email
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:03,999	| IOT119 |	Maybe 2 weeks ago that Amazon was getting rid of the lower-tier very inexpensive
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:08,607	| IOT119 |	Storage for photos and they're going to bump everybody up
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| IOT119 |	With a higher-priced larger
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,727	| IOT119 |	Tierce I don't know if people are aware that or not but
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| IOT119 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,799	| IOT119 |	But you can also put
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT119 |	Some photos
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,895	| IOT119 |	In there in into I think the app to show is like you
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| IOT119 |	Your home screen
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,967	| IOT119 |	I did that with a photo
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:27,295	| IOT119 |	It was granted it was a photo that I pulled from WhatsApp
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,599	| IOT119 |	It did not cover the whole screen
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,903	| IOT119 |	I don't know if it wasn't high enough resolution cuz I pull
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,415	| IOT119 |	Pull it from WhatsApp
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,951	| IOT119 |	It is just keep picture
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT119 |	Vacation
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:41,375	| IOT119 |	But could be but also that that touchscreen is actually I believe a lower resolution than one might think
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,447	| IOT119 |	1024x600 it's not even a 720P
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,007	| IOT119 |	Yeah so like some people I had read their lie
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:50,591	| IOT119 |	Watching videos on it and like you don't want to watch videos on this really
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| IOT119 |	For any length of time you can watch a movie on it
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,967	| IOT119 |	Maybe a YouTube video with a recipe or something but not
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,247	| IOT119 |	Something detailed
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,783	| IOT119 |	And that gets me to recipes
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,903	| IOT119 |	And yesterday I was making
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,183	| IOT119 |	A really complicated
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| IOT119 |	Recipe so
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:09,535	| IOT119 |	I actually pulled up it only pulls recipes for
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:10,815	| IOT119 |	Allrecipes
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,863	| IOT119 |	I wish I wish I could pull up the web on the
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:19,519	| IOT119 |	Now so when I pulled up all recipe skills
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,055	| IOT119 |	Basically I would
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,591	| IOT119 |	I was looking for a Cajun spice
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,103	| IOT119 |	Snakes eyes like
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,175	| IOT119 |	Show me recipes for
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,687	| IOT119 |	Cajun spice
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,503	| IOT119 |	And it pulled up a whole bunch
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:32,575	| IOT119 |	And I picked one and you can either pick up with your finger
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,671	| IOT119 |	Scroll through and pick up with your finger or you could say choose number 9
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| IOT119 |	We totally hands-free
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,511	| IOT119 |	I was like okay show me ingredient
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| IOT119 |	Show me the ingredients
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,887	| IOT119 |	But after about a minute
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,655	| IOT119 |	Outright
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,191	| IOT119 |	It stopped
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,727	| IOT119 |	It was like if you want to see
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:50,751	| IOT119 |	The steps
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,031	| IOT119 |	Continue
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,543	| IOT119 |	And it's a Spaceman
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,151	| IOT119 |	So I didn't say anything
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,247	| IOT119 |	Go back
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,527	| IOT119 |	But I had to do the search again
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,623	| IOT119 |	For the recipes I wanted it to stay longer because
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,159	| IOT119 |	I wanted to stay until I tell it to go
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| IOT119 |	Because that's all right
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:10,975	| IOT119 |	Could be alone
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:14,815	| IOT119 |	I don't know if there is a setting in
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| IOT119 |	The app for that
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:19,679	| IOT119 |	Terms of going back like the home screen or something that's possibility
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,215	| IOT119 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,775	| IOT119 |	But I totally agree that wouldn't want that to go away on me
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:27,615	| IOT119 |	I would think it's got an it's got a camera obviously so I would think if
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:29,919	| IOT119 |	You're still standing in front of it working your
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,455	| IOT119 |	You know spice mixing whatever
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| IOT119 |	It knows
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| IOT119 |	You're there
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,527	| IOT119 |	It does
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,135	| IOT119 |	It's just kind of like
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:46,047	| IOT119 |	Not to backtrack on the the device actually does have an 8 microphone array
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,559	| IOT119 |	What
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:49,119	| IOT119 |	It doesn't sound the top
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,423	| IOT119 |	Under 3 hardware buttons on the top of the
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,727	| IOT119 |	And it's that
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,519	| IOT119 |	Ring of dots at
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:59,615	| IOT119 |	Elliptical ring of dots around those three buttons that's where they microphones are
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| IOT119 |	Exact same space
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,199	| IOT119 |	My other Echo
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,295	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:09,599	| IOT119 |	Not good
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| IOT119 |	It does sound better though
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:18,047	| IOT119 |	I was just going to say it's got two speakers since the first Echo device has two speakers I would suspect
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,583	| IOT119 |	Bellatrix handled better
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,375	| IOT119 |	It does
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,983	| IOT119 |	Okay so that I felt like there was one other thing I wanted to go
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:30,079	| IOT119 |	How do you say I watch videos on it so it's right there at the
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,127	| IOT119 |	How do I get a breakfast bar that we have in the kitchen
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,943	| IOT119 |	My daughter and I were watching
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,735	| IOT119 |	Amazon
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,015	| IOT119 |	Cuz we're Amazon Prime subscriber
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,063	| IOT119 |	Possibly obviously
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:46,463	| IOT119 |	We were just sitting there a breakfast ghetto paging through videos and and watching trailers for movies to see what
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| IOT119 |	Where can I watch tonight
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:47,999	| IOT119 |	Lights out
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,535	| IOT119 |	That was actually kind of a neat
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:52,863	| IOT119 |	I don't know if I can
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,959	| IOT119 |	Check that out why didn't we
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:58,751	| IOT119 |	Why didn't we watch our usual
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:03,103	| IOT119 |	Okay so that's the show I would say
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,639	| IOT119 |	It is not a need to have device
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:08,479	| IOT119 |	The coolest thing is probably video calling but there's no one to call
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:13,087	| IOT119 |	Everything in the first fax machine
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,415	| IOT119 |	Exactly what I feel
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:19,743	| IOT119 |	But but but but I remember when the original Echo came out
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:25,375	| IOT119 |	I felt the exact same way there's not enough here to make us I must have it wasn't until
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,399	| IOT119 |	46 months later
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:30,495	| IOT119 |	That Services became available
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,775	| IOT119 |	Psychic reading things for it
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,055	| IOT119 |	Then I'm like oh I got to have it
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,591	| IOT119 |	Now I have four of them so
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:42,271	| IOT119 |	I give it time I think you know I think what you're saying is probably accurate maybe now it's not a must have but how long until it becomes
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:44,063	| IOT119 |	True and
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:48,671	| IOT119 |	Like if you have a video camera that works with this thing it would be great for you
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,207	| IOT119 |	Show me what's happening upstairs
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,231	| IOT119 |	You'll be able to see
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,839	| IOT119 |	That's the show
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| IOT119 |	Alright
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:13:59,935	| IOT119 |	Alibaba
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,775	| IOT119 |	Reportedly planning to challenge Amazon Echo
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,943	| IOT119 |	Not much detail here but that's what they're planning according to the Wall Street Journal and the information
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,735	| IOT119 |	It's at possibly as soon as next
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:16,319	| IOT119 |	Week which would actually be this week based on when this article was written
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,343	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,623	| IOT119 |	MN
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:21,695	| IOT119 |	How many people we have in China listening to show but good for them
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,463	| IOT119 |	Is
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,743	| IOT119 |	I'm assuming that
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,327	| IOT119 |	Google home is certainly not available in China
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:33,215	| IOT119 |	I'm assuming Amazon echos aren't available in China in either but that's a guess it's going to make an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,239	| IOT119 |	Bike
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,055	| IOT119 |	Anna story
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,615	| IOT119 |	Man whatever happened to xiaomi
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,407	| IOT119 |	Remember
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,455	| IOT119 |	It was coming on strong without weather
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:47,807	| IOT119 |	It was as me line of Smart Home Products they had all kinds of stuff and
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:53,439	| IOT119 |	And they were the big thing last year and I don't think it's a yes I saw
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:59,583	| IOT119 |	I know it will also mention its article is Baidu
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,351	| IOT119 |	Which is a big
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:05,471	| IOT119 |	Rival in China and apparently they launched their own voice controlled home robot
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,239	| IOT119 |	Call Little Fish
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,543	| IOT119 |	Which is interesting back in April
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| IOT119 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,407	| IOT119 |	I like the name but I
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,199	| IOT119 |	Is it or is it what it what is
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| IOT119 |	I don't like it says it includes a tablet screen so you can
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:21,087	| IOT119 |	Turn searches order food play music and movies
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,391	| IOT119 |	May 2nd show
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:23,903	| IOT119 |	Without
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,511	| IOT119 |	Alright also in a personal assistant
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,047	| IOT119 |	Smorgasbord
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| IOT119 |	Google home
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,375	| IOT119 |	Is rolling out bluetooth a little earlier than
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,703	| IOT119 |	Well
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:43,103	| IOT119 |	There's nothing official from Google saying this is rolling out yet however at Google IO back in may they did say Bluetooth stream
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,639	| IOT119 |	Available on Google home
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,919	| IOT119 |	And
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:47,967	| IOT119 |	Because
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:53,087	| IOT119 |	A lot of the Music Services I use are available on my Google home so which one of the reason I didn't buy one
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,647	| IOT119 |	But if I get Bluetooth streaming
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| IOT119 |	I can imagine
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:03,071	| IOT119 |	Stream something from my phone to the Google home like any other Bluetooth speakers so that's that's a bonus I think
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,607	| IOT119 |	Did you can still cast
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,631	| IOT119 |	Things but it has to have
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,167	| IOT119 |	The opposite house
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,935	| IOT119 |	Support for
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,727	| IOT119 |	Tom Cassell casting
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,287	| IOT119 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,359	| IOT119 |	This is also something we talked about cuz it was in the Android AP
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,127	| IOT119 |	BK
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,967	| IOT119 |	Correct
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,527	| IOT119 |	Some people were seeing speakers
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,343	| IOT119 |	They were seeing access to some of their Bluetooth speakers
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,623	| IOT119 |	It was not an option
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,207	| IOT119 |	What's happening yeah they must have gotten
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:36,607	| IOT119 |	They that firmware update I'm sorry that the software update for the Google home app a little bit early or it's just being rolled out
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:40,191	| IOT119 |	Gradually my check ready for the show I don't have the update yet so
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,959	| IOT119 |	I cannot either
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,983	| IOT119 |	Yasso
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,823	| IOT119 |	Well maybe this week will hear something official
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,591	| IOT119 |	News is out there
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,383	| IOT119 |	Wouldn't surprise me if schools
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,175	| IOT119 |	If it got it ready just says yet
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| IOT119 |	We have two kids coming this week
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,527	| IOT119 |	Eventually go up
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,439	| IOT119 |	For what it's worth
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,463	| IOT119 |	All right
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,743	| IOT119 |	Bad news
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,535	| IOT119 |	Pearl
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,559	| IOT119 |	I can't believe it in Taipei
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,839	| IOT119 |	Does last week cuz it did
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| IOT119 |	My bad
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,679	| IOT119 |	So Pearl
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| IOT119 |	Backup Vision Care
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,727	| IOT119 |	Rear vision camera
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,031	| IOT119 |	This was a company of Engineers from
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| IOT119 |	Former Apple dictionary
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:19,871	| IOT119 |	Camera
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,407	| IOT119 |	And they
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,431	| IOT119 |	Have decided
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:22,943	| IOT119 |	2 shutter door
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:30,111	| IOT119 |	Yeah then raised about 15 million dollars in VC funding the backup cameras integrated into it like a license plate
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,623	| IOT119 |	White frame
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,415	| IOT119 |	And I guess
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:37,791	| IOT119 |	It was a good idea but not a good idea
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:43,679	| IOT119 |	The ship now we've been a good idea to ship 3 or 4 years ago but they only found themselves in 2014
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:47,263	| IOT119 |	Selling it for $500
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,543	| IOT119 |	And
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:53,151	| IOT119 |	Correct me if I'm wrong that you would output the video camera to your connected phone
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:56,991	| IOT119 |	Yeah so it's not like a building solution which at this point
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,551	| IOT119 |	Most car makers are already integrating an
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,855	| IOT119 |	And why is that Stacy
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:02,879	| IOT119 |	Because
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,183	| IOT119 |	The National Highway
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,255	| IOT119 |	Castration says that my
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,839	| IOT119 |	2018 all new cars sold in the US have to have
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:15,423	| IOT119 |	Instant killer for pearl
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:21,311	| IOT119 |	People's old cars but a lot of people with old cars probably are not spending $500 on
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| IOT119 |	No I mean
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,687	| IOT119 |	I said this right before the show if this was like
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:31,551	| IOT119 |	5199 maybe 249 solution
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,343	| IOT119 |	It wouldn't have some traction but
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,367	| IOT119 |	Not as $500
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:40,255	| IOT119 |	Very sad that they actually were there apparently were some offers to act
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| IOT119 |	Acquire them
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,535	| IOT119 |	An act
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,815	| IOT119 |	Higher
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,095	| IOT119 |	Not enough choir
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:46,911	| IOT119 |	They didn't want to be
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:53,311	| IOT119 |	We'll probably see some other cool stuff
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,079	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,591	| IOT119 |	That's what you know
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:01,247	| IOT119 |	This is what we're going to see this is going to be the year of a positions in the space especially in the connector
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| IOT119 |	Kind of consumer Orient
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,807	| IOT119 |	Space
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,575	| IOT119 |	End
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:05,599	| IOT119 |	Deaths
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,135	| IOT119 |	There's no other
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:10,975	| IOT119 |	All right
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,351	| IOT119 |	Which is a low-power wide area network
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,911	| IOT119 |	Dedicated Networks
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,679	| IOT119 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,519	| IOT119 |	Long long distances
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,055	| IOT119 |	Cheap cheap pricing
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,871	| IOT119 |	So this is ingenue which
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| IOT119 |	Actually
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,431	| IOT119 |	Was formed by some former Telecom
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:30,943	| IOT119 |	Some guys
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,015	| IOT119 |	This is John Horn who
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,807	| IOT119 |	Joined ingenue in 2015
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:39,135	| IOT119 |	The company actually used to be on
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,695	| IOT119 |	And Horn used to be the director of
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,487	| IOT119 |	Machine-to-machine services at
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:43,999	| IOT119 |	Mytmobile
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,327	| IOT119 |	Basically this guy is out
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:50,143	| IOT119 |	My hunches in this is reporting from fiercewireless by
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,959	| IOT119 |	This is State they figure this out so good on them
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:57,567	| IOT119 |	This is going to we're going to see this happen we're about to see a consolidation in
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,103	| IOT119 |	The space because I think
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,407	| IOT119 |	Sigfox ingenue
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,735	| IOT119 |	There's Laura that's in the space now Laura is in a company that's
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,831	| IOT119 |	Smartstandard there's something but he's like Comcast is working with Laura
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,391	| IOT119 |	Other startups are working with Laura
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,183	| IOT119 |	What we're going to see here is
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:16,255	| IOT119 |	Increasing pressure from the cellular guys that are
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,607	| IOT119 |	Creating these nb-iot in LTE cat 1M
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:22,911	| IOT119 |	Basically
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,447	| IOT119 |	Cellular guys are creating their own
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:26,751	| IOT119 |	And so
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:32,895	| IOT119 |	There's a number of reasons why pregnancy pressure but I think the biggest thing we'll see is a bifurcation between
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,711	| IOT119 |	Cellular networks and then
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,223	| IOT119 |	Things like lore
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,271	| IOT119 |	That's my hunch so
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,063	| IOT119 |	Sigfox should be kind of worried
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT119 |	Ingenue
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,367	| IOT119 |	Also should be worried
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,903	| IOT119 |	So we'll see what happens
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:48,511	| IOT119 |	And related to this I just read this morning that one of the carriers
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,047	| IOT119 |	Vodafone New Zealand
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:54,655	| IOT119 |	Aveda playing a narrowband or NB iot Network really next year
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:21:00,543	| IOT119 |	Crosman Zealand they done some testing already there and do some more testing with some customers later this year but then
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,823	| IOT119 |	Phone network rollout
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,591	| IOT119 |	Next year is what they're saying
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:07,199	| IOT119 |	And you know any of our listeners have this
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:11,295	| IOT119 |	Of where the stuff is out so in the US Verizon and AT&T are doing MBA.
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,831	| IOT119 |	Works and they're supposed to be out
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,343	| IOT119 |	Next year
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,391	| IOT119 |	I kind of been like
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,952	| IOT119 |	Really really are they really coming out
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:23,072	| IOT119 |	Cuz they all started actually pushing the cat one in which are a little bit more band
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| IOT119 |	Out first but
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,216	| IOT119 |	I don't see a lot of
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,240	| IOT119 |	Fat people clamoring to
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:33,824	| IOT119 |	To use those just yet and I think the pricing still needs to kind of come into
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,360	| IOT119 |	Come into the picture
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,920	| IOT119 |	That's a lot of like
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,200	| IOT119 |	Well we don't know
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,968	| IOT119 |	But
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,504	| IOT119 |	We're see it the way things are coming
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,624	| IOT119 |	I would agree
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,928	| IOT119 |	Now
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,440	| IOT119 |	Kevin
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:54,304	| IOT119 |	Yes a rare purchase I haven't bought any iot stuff
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| IOT119 |	Well took my Google home but
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,120	| IOT119 |	This was some kind of crazy
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,424	| IOT119 |	But I ended up buying
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:03,264	| IOT119 |	A Home Security Suite as it's called from gocontrol
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| IOT119 |	And it contains one
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,872	| IOT119 |	Passive IR motion detector
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,176	| IOT119 |	And two door or window sensors
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,944	| IOT119 |	Kerstetter magnetic
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:11,968	| IOT119 |	And
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,296	| IOT119 |	Most people would buy them for what's in the name security
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,088	| IOT119 |	I didn't buy these for security however
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,880	| IOT119 |	I actually bought these
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:22,720	| IOT119 |	To have automatic lights go on when you open or close a door
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,488	| IOT119 |	4
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:29,888	| IOT119 |	A closet for example because of my bedroom closet we have that wink relay just outside of it and actually turned a dumb light in the closet
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,168	| IOT119 |	Smart light as a result
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:34,496	| IOT119 |	And every morning around 5:30 a.m. I
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:39,616	| IOT119 |	Kind of hear my wife I'm still in bed I hear my wife no going getting ready taking a shower
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,896	| IOT119 |	Then she goes to the closet
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,176	| IOT119 |	And then I hear her
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:45,504	| IOT119 |	Quietly cursing so she doesn't wake me and I'm giggling under the covers because
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:50,368	| IOT119 |	She presses the wink relay so hard that it kind of comes unconnected and then she can't turn the light on
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,648	| IOT119 |	In the closet
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,184	| IOT119 |	And I think
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,256	| IOT119 |	I know what's worse is that it's been giggling about it for 6 months now
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,328	| IOT119 |	I decided to research
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,632	| IOT119 |	What works is my wink Hub that way
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,936	| IOT119 |	Solve this problem so to speak
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:06,752	| IOT119 |	I can turn the wink relay switch on the promise no
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,544	| IOT119 |	Where to present where not to but that's only the store
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:13,920	| IOT119 |	And I thought about magnetic connectors and sure enough the gocontrol Home Security Suite
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,200	| IOT119 |	Does work with wink
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:21,344	| IOT119 |	Arrived just this morning but it's so easy to pair with the Hub and so easy to set up a quick robot
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:26,720	| IOT119 |	Master 2 robots one for the door opening to turn the light on and one for the door closing to turn the light off
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,488	| IOT119 |	That
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,792	| IOT119 |	I was already able to install it be just
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,072	| IOT119 |	Breaking for the shelves
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:34,400	| IOT119 |	Working great which comes off rotation got to be thrilled
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,704	| IOT119 |	I'm going to mention that when I researched this
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:42,592	| IOT119 |	On Amazon I saw one of these motion I'm sorry Wendy's door window sensors for like $35 a month
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| IOT119 |	That's expensive
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,176	| IOT119 |	But for $42
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,968	| IOT119 |	Just $7 more there was a kid with
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:52,320	| IOT119 |	Two sensors in the motion detector is also I sperm for that makes sense
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,088	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:57,696	| IOT119 |	Also easy to install is the infrared motion sensor witch and now have in my office
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| IOT119 |	So that way as soon as I walk in
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:02,304	| IOT119 |	I already have a robot set up to turn the lights on
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,864	| IOT119 |	Not sure when do about turn the lights off yet
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,912	| IOT119 |	And propose to have a wink Hub instead of robots
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:12,544	| IOT119 |	You don't have to have the running 7 by 24 like it when I walk in my office in the middle of the day I don't want the light on
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,848	| IOT119 |	There are settings in the wink robots
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,616	| IOT119 |	How to say
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,152	| IOT119 |	Do it from this time to that time
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,456	| IOT119 |	I'm so that's what I did for like Sunset to Sunrise
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,736	| IOT119 |	It will turn my lights on so
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,040	| IOT119 |	You right so far they are working right
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:25,856	| IOT119 |	You should be able to motion detected
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,136	| IOT119 |	Turn it off now I don't know
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:34,048	| IOT119 |	I don't know I kind of CSE I kind of sit still and watch TV or something on my iPad or something and I'm
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:36,608	| IOT119 |	I'm not moving around so I suspect at night time the White Witch shut off on me
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,144	| IOT119 |	I'd rather
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,168	| IOT119 |	Not deal with that
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,192	| IOT119 |	The exciting
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:43,008	| IOT119 |	Moving your hands
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,824	| IOT119 |	I'm still here I'm watching a movie
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:49,152	| IOT119 |	Okay well that's that's a good motion sensor
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:50,176	| IOT119 |	Several
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| IOT119 |	Places
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,456	| IOT119 |	Motion sensor
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,272	| IOT119 |	This is actually an open close sensor that's on the
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| IOT119 |	Okay answer you have another one
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:02,720	| IOT119 |	I'm decided yet though I don't know yet about to figure that out
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| IOT119 |	Liquor cabinet
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:05,792	| IOT119 |	That's always open
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,096	| IOT119 |	You must have a hue motion
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,120	| IOT119 |	Sensor
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| IOT119 |	Baidu
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,424	| IOT119 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,728	| IOT119 |	2 PSI promotion do they
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,264	| IOT119 |	Offer anything else because
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:18,080	| IOT119 |	I didn't realize it when I bought it but this gocontrol does
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:20,640	| IOT119 |	There's a temperature sensor inside but it's not at
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:26,016	| IOT119 |	Tied into openhab
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:28,832	| IOT119 |	And then open have picked up the temperature sensor
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,136	| IOT119 |	And he doesn't show it to me
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:31,904	| IOT119 |	But open
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,256	| IOT119 |	Will wink shows me the temperature on this motion
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:40,096	| IOT119 |	Sensor which is kind of nice I haven't actually another motion sensor
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:46,752	| IOT119 |	DigiTech temperature now in my very warm office so I might play with some robots for that to see if you had an Echo Show
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:50,336	| IOT119 |	You could be able to like show me the temperature inside and it'd be like
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,616	| IOT119 |	Bullet for the Wii
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,384	| IOT119 |	I don't know what that
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,200	| IOT119 |	I'll just send you pictures
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,272	| IOT119 |	Theoretically that should happen
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,040	| IOT119 |	Siri
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,064	| IOT119 |	All right
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,624	| IOT119 |	Well let's see I also have something
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,648	| IOT119 |	To tell you guys about
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,160	| IOT119 |	Because
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,440	| IOT119 |	I didn't buy it
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,976	| IOT119 |	They sent it to me and then
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,768	| IOT119 |	I sent it back and I bought one
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT119 |	Is it was already installed
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:15,168	| IOT119 |	Long story short I have a Leviton
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,448	| IOT119 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,008	| IOT119 |	Decora switch this is a
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,288	| IOT119 |	$50 light switch on
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:25,664	| IOT119 |	And it talks to the Amazon Echo without a hub it also talks to
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,200	| IOT119 |	The
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,016	| IOT119 |	Yes
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,088	| IOT119 |	And
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,928	| IOT119 |	I wanted to like this lights which I really did
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:39,488	| IOT119 |	Because I'm a sucker for smart switches and
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:43,072	| IOT119 |	It's not hard to install it's not hard to hook it up
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,632	| IOT119 |	What it is hard to do is turn the freaking light on
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,424	| IOT119 |	I hate that
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,472	| IOT119 |	Isn't that kind of a
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,496	| IOT119 |	Primary purpose of it
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:53,824	| IOT119 |	Exactly so you only have one job switch
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:56,384	| IOT119 |	End of the dimming switches this little
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:59,968	| IOT119 |	Dimmer on the side that's not an uncommon design even for none can
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:02,016	| IOT119 |	But I didn't like it
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:02,528	| IOT119 |	I hated it
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,832	| IOT119 |	I don't like touching this light
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,880	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:09,696	| IOT119 |	I feel that as a connected product it is
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| IOT119 |	Fine
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,232	| IOT119 |	It works
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:14,048	| IOT119 |	What is a product that occasionally I'm going to turn on and off with
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,072	| IOT119 |	Natural fingers
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,096	| IOT119 |	I hate it
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,400	| IOT119 |	This is going to be your mileage may vary
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,168	| IOT119 |	You may love it
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:25,568	| IOT119 |	But I didn't it's it's not it's not that
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,336	| IOT119 |	Play sand I just
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,896	| IOT119 |	Tell kind of Dewey when you
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,224	| IOT119 |	Press it it's not it's not a click it's more like a
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,832	| IOT119 |	Cinemagic
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,136	| IOT119 |	And it's $50 so you really have to like it my pen
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:43,232	| IOT119 |	Come with almonds
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:45,024	| IOT119 |	White and other color so
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,536	| IOT119 |	You know if your
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,328	| IOT119 |	If you have other Leviton switches
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:48,352	| IOT119 |	You know this could be
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,424	| IOT119 |	That was that
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:54,240	| IOT119 |	I feel like we answered this but I'm going to answer this again for p
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,288	| IOT119 |	What did new Eero router stick
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:28:01,152	| IOT119 |	TL DR version of the says it is backwards
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,944	| IOT119 |	Compatible with your old stuff
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:06,016	| IOT119 |	If you have the old Eero routers
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:08,832	| IOT119 |	You shouldn't have to upgrade unless you're going to want
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:13,440	| IOT119 |	Thread Network and then you can just buy a beacon
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,464	| IOT119 |	And that it's your old system
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,744	| IOT119 |	Yes so
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,536	| IOT119 |	If you've already got the Eros
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:19,328	| IOT119 |	You don't need a spring for a whole new system
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,888	| IOT119 |	If you got coverage hole that you want to make better
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,680	| IOT119 |	You know by the $149 Beacon
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:24,960	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,776	| IOT119 |	Just making that Crystal Clear forever
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,312	| IOT119 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,920	| IOT119 |	That's a lot that was a lot for this 4th of July week
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,712	| IOT119 |	I hope you guys didn't blow up any of your appendages
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:36,992	| IOT119 |	Shooting out fire
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,552	| IOT119 |	And I will also
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:41,600	| IOT119 |	End
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,136	| IOT119 |	I think that's it we will
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,696	| IOT119 |	Have you guys stay tuned for fari

EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,720	| IOT119 |	Fahri Diner Who is the
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:53,024	| IOT119 |	CEO and co-founder of plume
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,072	| IOT119 |	Hi Siri how are you doing today
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,352	| IOT119 |	Hi Stacy
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,376	| IOT119 |	Great thank you
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,912	| IOT119 |	Excellent
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,936	| IOT119 |	So
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:02,752	| IOT119 |	I got to talk a lot about Wi-Fi switch is
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,032	| IOT119 |	Basically the lifeblood of
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:05,568	| IOT119 |	Get home
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,176	| IOT119 |	People probably no clue as the company that makes these
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,992	| IOT119 |	Plug-in pods that will improve their Wi-Fi experience
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| IOT119 |	You however
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,088	| IOT119 |	Call yourselves in air traffic control
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,904	| IOT119 |	Can you kind of talk about
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,952	| IOT119 |	What you're actually trying to build with blue
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:25,280	| IOT119 |	WiFi pods that
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:28,096	| IOT119 |	We make give you awesome coverage around the home
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:34,496	| IOT119 |	But the key challenge is how to optimize the performance of your Wi-Fi across
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,776	| IOT119 |	Not just space
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,800	| IOT119 |	These things
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:39,616	| IOT119 |	Wi-Fi access points or pods
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:46,528	| IOT119 |	Will give you a good coverage around the home but you want to optimize your performance across time as well so you're
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:52,672	| IOT119 |	Wi-Fi not only has to work everywhere around the home but it also has to work all of the time and across a
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:56,768	| IOT119 |	Changing side of load so we think of it as more of a three-dimensional problem
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:03,680	| IOT119 |	And all of that requires a fairly sophisticated control at management plain and that's really the piece that
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:07,520	| IOT119 |	So this is the software that's in the cloud and it is
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,800	| IOT119 |	Actively managing
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,848	| IOT119 |	Network loads across my
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:11,616	| IOT119 |	House for exam
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,920	| IOT119 |	Also if my doorbell rings things are going to change
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,944	| IOT119 |	Is that how I should be thinking about it
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,528	| IOT119 |	Yep it deals with things there are a lot of things why are they
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:19,808	| IOT119 |	And Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:24,928	| IOT119 |	Particular as you know is a non-deterministic medium unlicensed Spectrum things change
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:31,328	| IOT119 |	And you want to have a system that responds to these changes both dynamically in Rio
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:34,400	| IOT119 |	Real-time as well as preemptively and predictably
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:37,984	| IOT119 |	So the conclusion control plane be call it
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,008	| IOT119 |	Adaptive Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,568	| IOT119 |	It deals with things like
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:47,968	| IOT119 |	Both Wireless and wired backhaul management and these multi-node environment so you have to worry about what the backhaul can be
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,736	| IOT119 |	Migration looks like
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:51,808	| IOT119 |	It deals with things like handing off client
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:58,208	| IOT119 |	From one pod to another in a smart algorithmic way it deals with things like interference management both in
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,512	| IOT119 |	Inside the home and across multiple
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,048	| IOT119 |	It also learns
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,072	| IOT119 |	Client and
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:04,864	| IOT119 |	Device behavior and patterns
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:06,656	| IOT119 |	To be proactive and predictive
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:10,752	| IOT119 |	Optimization the power of the cloud
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,544	| IOT119 |	Alright so there's a lot that's happening in
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:15,104	| IOT119 |	And people like myself work
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,128	| IOT119 |	Like crazy Network
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:19,200	| IOT119 |	Oh my gosh it's up where to find Wi-Fi
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:23,808	| IOT119 |	How did you come to this idea what was your core philosophy
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,344	| IOT119 |	Especially given
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:25,856	| IOT119 |	Your history
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,648	| IOT119 |	Clone myself
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,440	| IOT119 |	My co-founders
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,208	| IOT119 |	We are a team of
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:32,768	| IOT119 |	What's a telecom industry veteran
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:38,912	| IOT119 |	We worked on in Pioneer things like ultra-long-haul ultra-high capacity fiber-optic transport system
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:44,288	| IOT119 |	As well as be caught really high performance Wi-Fi into literally billions of devices
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:49,152	| IOT119 |	And the realization became to maybe about 3 years ago Stacy was that
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,200	| IOT119 |	Oldest digital stuff
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:57,856	| IOT119 |	It's piped into our homes today at a pre-trial fast and reliable and consistent rate but today what happens is older
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,672	| IOT119 |	Stop after going through a lot of fiber Networks
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,952	| IOT119 |	Kallax Networks
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,232	| IOT119 |	Etc they come to our home
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:07,328	| IOT119 |	Before reaching our devices in the living room something goes terribly wrong
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,864	| IOT119 |	That has to do with Wi-Fi
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:11,680	| IOT119 |	And also many of internet service providers
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,448	| IOT119 |	I told us
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:14,752	| IOT119 |	That this is a primary source of
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,288	| IOT119 |	Subscriber dissatisfaction
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:18,592	| IOT119 |	Leading into incoming service calls
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,152	| IOT119 |	Turn which is a very expensive problem
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,176	| IOT119 |	Bananas you know
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,736	| IOT119 |	Let's talk about that because I have peas
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:26,016	| IOT119 |	Have historically
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:28,064	| IOT119 |	Well I shouldn't say historically
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:30,624	| IOT119 |	Play because they've done a lot of things over the years
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,928	| IOT119 |	Important
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,464	| IOT119 |	The Wi-Fi point
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:36,256	| IOT119 |	Alone The Edge stopped
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:36,768	| IOT119 |	At the modem
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:41,376	| IOT119 |	And now what's happening is they seem to be interested once again
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,144	| IOT119 |	And going beyond that
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,424	| IOT119 |	Talk about
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:51,360	| IOT119 |	They have to because in our networking days until not long ago open Ben Meade Rudy's Network diagram
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:56,224	| IOT119 |	Routers and switches in fiber optic Transport Systems on the end of the network
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,784	| IOT119 |	This little picture of a cute little home
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,320	| IOT119 |	With a nice little roof on it
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:03,392	| IOT119 |	That was the end of the network in other words that was the
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,952	| IOT119 |	You have the Broadband Gateway if you want
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,720	| IOT119 |	In the home
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:10,560	| IOT119 |	Service providers are responsible for providing services to the home
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT119 |	What has happened now over the last
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:17,728	| IOT119 |	Let's say five years or so is that now they're providing services to the devices in our homes and example
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:24,896	| IOT119 |	Comcast is now saying what they have been saying for a while now you can watch your TV channels on your iPad
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:27,968	| IOT119 |	There's a little Comcast app now if you're up in the bedroom
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,016	| IOT119 |	Can you click on your app
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:32,832	| IOT119 |	And the Xfinity is not playing on your iPad
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,112	| IOT119 |	You have now on the right
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT119 |	Call Comcast
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:42,048	| IOT119 |	Complain you're not particularly complaining about your Wi-Fi you're just saying look Xfinity doesn't work on my iPad
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:44,096	| IOT119 |	Dinosaur is a service that I'm paying
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,376	| IOT119 |	If you know what I mean so
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| IOT119 |	That last
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:52,032	| IOT119 |	Peace in the home the last 2 or 5 or 10 what have you is now whether they like it or not
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,080	| IOT119 |	An extension of their broadband
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:54,848	| IOT119 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:35:01,248	| IOT119 |	Now it is just as important I might argue in so many ways that is more important than the two thousand miles of fiber.
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,296	| IOT119 |	They use to bring the Broadband to our home
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:06,112	| IOT119 |	Because that's the piece that the consumer is interfacing to
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:08,416	| IOT119 |	So this is not an option of saying
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:11,232	| IOT119 |	For service providers moving forward and we're seeing that
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:14,048	| IOT119 |	They have to own and control
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:19,680	| IOT119 |	The Wi-Fi peace otherwise it said it's a section in the middle of their Network
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,704	| IOT119 |	That they don't have
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:24,032	| IOT119 |	Visibility to and they get blamed for everything okay
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,336	| IOT119 |	So with that in mind I remember when
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,360	| IOT119 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:29,408	| IOT119 |	First started coming out
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,968	| IOT119 |	My cable provider the time was Time Warner
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,528	| IOT119 |	And they actually had a
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,296	| IOT119 |	They had a fee
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,832	| IOT119 |	4 Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:39,136	| IOT119 |	It was I think it's like $10 extra a month for
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:41,696	| IOT119 |	Wi-Fi I remember looking at that
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,488	| IOT119 |	Why can just go buy a router
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,256	| IOT119 |	The Best Buy
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,024	| IOT119 |	Pop that in
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,816	| IOT119 |	Why would I pay Time Warner
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:50,656	| IOT119 |	Credit they do have equipment rental fees now so we'll
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,960	| IOT119 |	Cable providers seek to tack on
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,520	| IOT119 |	Additional service charges on top of
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:56,544	| IOT119 |	Can a better wife
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,848	| IOT119 |	I think some will
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,640	| IOT119 |	And for some
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,152	| IOT119 |	Customers
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,224	| IOT119 |	We are engaged with many of them
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:04,992	| IOT119 |	As you know
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:10,624	| IOT119 |	There will be additional fees from some of them I believe for premium go to Whole home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,904	| IOT119 |	They may also look at it
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:14,464	| IOT119 |	In tears if your subscribing to ex-
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:17,536	| IOT119 |	Or second or greater maybe your whole home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,840	| IOT119 |	Will become as part of your sex
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:23,424	| IOT119 |	Scripture some service providers might very well I'll sell you
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,960	| IOT119 |	Devices like pods
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,984	| IOT119 |	Google home coverage
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:30,848	| IOT119 |	So I believe this is an area of that they're looking at both
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:36,224	| IOT119 |	I would say defensively and offensively defensively in the sense that they're very interested
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:36,736	| IOT119 |	And they must
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:39,552	| IOT119 |	Highly reliable WiFi
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:44,160	| IOT119 |	Offensively in the case that I think the retail in the
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,184	| IOT119 |	Street has pretty much
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| IOT119 |	Demonstrated
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:49,280	| IOT119 |	There's value in people are willing to pay
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:54,656	| IOT119 |	Whole-home reliable good wifi and service providers will take advantage of that
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:59,008	| IOT119 |	Now I believe from there isb perspective the defensive part is
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,288	| IOT119 |	Probably more important
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:00,800	| IOT119 |	To them
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,360	| IOT119 |	Which means when they go on the offense
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,920	| IOT119 |	And even if they were to charge you for this
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,712	| IOT119 |	I think it's going to be
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:09,248	| IOT119 |	Much much more affordable
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,832	| IOT119 |	To get highly reliable whole home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,880	| IOT119 |	From your ISP then
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,672	| IOT119 |	It will be to get it from the retail Channel
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:23,584	| IOT119 |	Imagine one of the reasons you're saying this is because you guys have this deal with Comcast this is one of your big service
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,376	| IOT119 |	Provider deals Comcast has made an investment
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:28,192	| IOT119 |	And they're also reselling and I think
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,472	| IOT119 |	Even helping manufacturer the
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:31,520	| IOT119 |	Can you kind of go into that
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,032	| IOT119 |	Pretty please
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:35,872	| IOT119 |	Of course Comcast is one of our service provider partners
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:41,248	| IOT119 |	I will be launching with them this year as well as a number of other tier-one operators
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:45,088	| IOT119 |	In the case of Comcast our relationship involves two element
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:48,672	| IOT119 |	That's one is better managing and optimizing their existing Gateway
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,720	| IOT119 |	So that is a very important
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:51,488	| IOT119 |	Art
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,816	| IOT119 |	The whole infrastructure here whereas when you go out to
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,144	| IOT119 |	Can you go out and buy retail access points
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:01,728	| IOT119 |	Everybody asks you to turn off your service provider Wi-Fi
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:02,496	| IOT119 |	We think that
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,264	| IOT119 |	Soulja Boy
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:05,824	| IOT119 |	Waste the Comcast has very good gateways
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:11,712	| IOT119 |	And there's a piece of Clone software in those gateways that connects it to our cloud
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:12,736	| IOT119 |	Amanda is an optimizer
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:16,064	| IOT119 |	And then we will also license
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT119 |	Our
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,624	| IOT119 |	Design of the pods
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:23,488	| IOT119 |	To our manufacturing Partners who will be able to make and sell them
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,536	| IOT119 |	Directly to service providers like,
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,584	| IOT119 |	We don't really want
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:30,400	| IOT119 |	To be in the middle trying to get an additional
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:33,472	| IOT119 |	Margin from these Hardware all in the interest
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,240	| IOT119 |	Making
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:39,104	| IOT119 |	The pods and access points as affordable as possible for the office for the consumer
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:39,872	| IOT119 |	Okay
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:42,688	| IOT119 |	That makes a lot of sense and it also makes sense with
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:45,504	| IOT119 |	Comcast and other service providers getting into
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:50,368	| IOT119 |	Home automation and security systems because those are definitely things where you want to be able to control the
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,392	| IOT119 |	Network all the way through
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,928	| IOT119 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:56,512	| IOT119 |	When it comes to retail though let's go back to that
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:00,608	| IOT119 |	Because there has been in the last probably three years just
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:02,912	| IOT119 |	Scads of new companies coming out with better
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,704	| IOT119 |	New improved WiFi
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,264	| IOT119 |	Erode securifi
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,824	| IOT119 |	Room is in there and even the big vendors of followed suit
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,360	| IOT119 |	And their focus has been on
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,384	| IOT119 |	If he's mesh net
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,152	| IOT119 |	Works
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:19,552	| IOT119 |	And I am curious do you think that consumers are going to go buy their own routers or do you think they're going to turn to the
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,320	| IOT119 |	The service provider
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,368	| IOT119 |	I know your
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,136	| IOT119 |	The Surface Pro
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:25,952	| IOT119 |	But it seems so far that consumers are turning to
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:26,720	| IOT119 |	Do these kind of
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,488	| IOT119 |	Off-the-shelf
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,256	| IOT119 |	Retail system
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:30,560	| IOT119 |	I don't think the retail
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,840	| IOT119 |	Segment will disappear
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:35,424	| IOT119 |	There will always be a certain portion of the consumer in my
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:40,288	| IOT119 |	Opinion Google buy their own routers and access points and nationalism song
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,312	| IOT119 |	Statistics
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,080	| IOT119 |	That I know
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,104	| IOT119 |	Are there in the US
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:48,736	| IOT119 |	About 70% of people get their Wi-Fi from their internet service provider
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:51,552	| IOT119 |	Places like Europe that percentage is even higher
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:57,952	| IOT119 |	So I believe though as the service providers get into whole home highly reliable life
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:40:00,512	| IOT119 |	Fight at retail Market segment with string
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:03,072	| IOT119 |	A lot of them have been launching
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:05,632	| IOT119 |	New services on top so for example
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:10,496	| IOT119 |	Eros launched a brand new service that does parental controls & Security for
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,008	| IOT119 |	$10 a month
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:15,872	| IOT119 |	There's scads of devices all the way from Disney Circle device that does print
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,152	| IOT119 |	Control through a box at
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:17,920	| IOT119 |	Attached to your network
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:19,968	| IOT119 |	Another security device
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:26,880	| IOT119 |	So I'm also looking at those and I'm like hey is that a real or is that something that's going to get eaten by the service
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,392	| IOT119 |	Is providers
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:29,696	| IOT119 |	I think the retail players
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:33,280	| IOT119 |	Who rely on Hardware margins are going to see
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,584	| IOT119 |	The price of these things become lower and lower
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:41,472	| IOT119 |	There are no now many players in this market and they're naturally looking for more margin
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:45,568	| IOT119 |	Some of these customers what companies are startups or other companies
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:51,456	| IOT119 |	Obviously they're in it for profit so I believe they're looking at these over-the-top additional services
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,760	| IOT119 |	Ass-kickers to improve their margins now
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:56,832	| IOT119 |	Problem again there I think that's a good lineup
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,624	| IOT119 |	Thinking about service
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:05,024	| IOT119 |	This is really the bread and butter of the service provider's whether it security or parental controls and so on that
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:11,168	| IOT119 |	Will all the sort of bundled into are available through your internet service providers
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,704	| IOT119 |	There is peace
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:16,544	| IOT119 |	Like I can't see give unless you're like in a very small
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,592	| IOT119 |	Sonic out in California
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:23,456	| IOT119 |	Most people find
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:27,808	| IOT119 |	Verizon so how do you think that might affect how people
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:30,112	| IOT119 |	See this shift controlling more of
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,648	| IOT119 |	Network inside their house
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:35,232	| IOT119 |	Everybody knows we all love to hate our service providers
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:36,512	| IOT119 |	And we blame the forever
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:39,584	| IOT119 |	You don't even if you are retail Wi-Fi doesn't work
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:42,656	| IOT119 |	An average consumer Bill calls offense at 11
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:49,056	| IOT119 |	Consumer it in a lot of times I don't even know if they don't even know the difference between tsar of your broadband and Wi-Fi and all that
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,592	| IOT119 |	Somebody says lock the internet
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,640	| IOT119 |	The phone and call wife
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:55,199	| IOT119 |	Call Comcast for service provider
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:55,967	| IOT119 |	Obviously
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,039	| IOT119 |	Discuss before the service providers are seeing this
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:00,831	| IOT119 |	Festival de technology
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:05,183	| IOT119 |	Whether it's the Silicon or the software
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,207	| IOT119 |	Etc so
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:08,255	| IOT119 |	I think there are many other reasons
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:09,535	| IOT119 |	2
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:12,351	| IOT119 |	Not be happy with our service providers but
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:18,239	| IOT119 |	Yavapai think Wi-Fi performance and Broadband is not going to be one of them and not system
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:23,871	| IOT119 |	What is the other things that I think is really fascinating about Wi-Fi as we've moved from like this
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,151	| IOT119 |	Is I don't know if
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:25,919	| IOT119 |	It's like a machine gun
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:31,295	| IOT119 |	Routers just like I'm covering the whole home by sending out message signal
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:36,671	| IOT119 |	To this mesh approach where you like we're going to cover the whole home by having everything kind of work together and then
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,951	| IOT119 |	You guys are taking that too late
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,511	| IOT119 |	WiFi 2.5
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,791	| IOT119 |	Actively managing it
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,303	| IOT119 |	Cloud
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:46,399	| IOT119 |	But I feel like like Wi-Fi 3. O was going to be
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:48,959	| IOT119 |	Wi-Fi embedded in just about everything
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:52,031	| IOT119 |	It's going to need a connection so I'm going to buy
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,591	| IOT119 |	TV and it's going to have a Wi-Fi
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,615	| IOT119 |	Repeater
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:58,687	| IOT119 |	Perhaps or maybe it's my cable box if it's ISP model
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:42:59,711	| IOT119 |	How do you envision that
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,735	| IOT119 |	Into the world
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:02,783	| IOT119 |	We want to enable it
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:08,927	| IOT119 |	As I mentioned plume is ultimately a control and management playing and you need something like plume to make all of that
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:14,815	| IOT119 |	That's been our vision from day one there are a lot of Wi-Fi resources that already exist in our home
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,607	| IOT119 |	Your TV has WiFi
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:19,679	| IOT119 |	If you have a Samsung family Hub refrigerator it has Wi-Fi
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,215	| IOT119 |	Your
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:24,799	| IOT119 |	MacBook or iMac that sitting on your desk has WiFi in it
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:27,359	| IOT119 |	And largely who using them as client
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,895	| IOT119 |	They don't contribute to the network
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:34,783	| IOT119 |	Our vision rvu is that many of these existing Wi-Fi resources that are in the home
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:38,367	| IOT119 |	Should not only be clients but also should be these
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| IOT119 |	Repeater points are Hotpoint
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,463	| IOT119 |	Pasar Wifi to other clients
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:44,511	| IOT119 |	And that requires
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:47,839	| IOT119 |	Unified control plane and that's what is all about
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,631	| IOT119 |	We are also partnering with Samsung
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:53,471	| IOT119 |	I think you're familiar with this product that they launched recently
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:56,799	| IOT119 |	In home product that has
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:59,359	| IOT119 |	Really nice iot capability and also
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:01,151	| IOT119 |	Bestop mesh WiFi
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:04,223	| IOT119 |	That device will soon be powered by Klum
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:08,063	| IOT119 |	Where you'll be able to see let's say a Comcast
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:10,623	| IOT119 |	The Gateway a Samsung connect home
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,927	| IOT119 |	Access point Igloo parts
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:16,255	| IOT119 |	Starting point all working
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:17,791	| IOT119 |	Coherently on the same network
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:20,607	| IOT119 |	Go to the beginning of this Vision that you just
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:23,423	| IOT119 |	Describe an in the future we want to roll in
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,959	| IOT119 |	All these other devices
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,727	| IOT119 |	To become
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,263	| IOT119 |	A part of the network
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:29,311	| IOT119 |	How does it work technically
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:32,383	| IOT119 |	Because I know in the case of Comcast at that I have firmware
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,663	| IOT119 |	On your gateway
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:34,943	| IOT119 |	He could have firmware on the
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,223	| IOT119 |	Device
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:39,807	| IOT119 |	Hear it sounds like there may be something like that happening so are you guys going to be
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:44,927	| IOT119 |	Software that's going to be at any endpoint and a variety of gateways that just met
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:45,951	| IOT119 |	Makes this
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:47,743	| IOT119 |	Seamless Wifi between devices
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:52,607	| IOT119 |	That's right so there's a there's a piece of software in the Gateway
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:54,143	| IOT119 |	Your service provider Gateway
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:57,215	| IOT119 |	Obviously there's a piece of software firmware in r-pod
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:03,871	| IOT119 |	And we can also put these for my are into other access point or other wifi-enabled devices
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,895	| IOT119 |	They all talk. Cloud
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:11,039	| IOT119 |	And we do the coordination across them in terms of treating them as either access points or clients
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:16,927	| IOT119 |	I'm doing the backhaul configuration among them dealing with interference and so on all from the cloud to the cloud
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:19,999	| IOT119 |	Gloom cloud is the element that enables Oliver
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:22,559	| IOT119 |	Okay what else do you want to tell me about
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:25,631	| IOT119 |	I want to tell you more about how we
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:27,935	| IOT119 |	See the control plane right now
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:30,239	| IOT119 |	We have focused s on Wi-Fi
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,775	| IOT119 |	Lte unlicensed Spectrum
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:33,055	| IOT119 |	Focused and in the home
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:35,359	| IOT119 |	The control plane will also
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:37,663	| IOT119 |	Stacy extend into other
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,687	| IOT119 |	Unlicensed
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:39,967	| IOT119 |	Protocols like
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:42,271	| IOT119 |	Zigbee Z-Wave Bluetooth and Salon
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:46,367	| IOT119 |	To really make these protocols at least for my power consumption
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:51,487	| IOT119 |	Expected as you know how many devices on the iot world are very sensitive to power consumption
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,303	| IOT119 |	And they do their own measurements on
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:58,143	| IOT119 |	In our concept you have a Wi-Fi access point literally in every room
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:45:59,679	| IOT119 |	Either by way of quads
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:02,239	| IOT119 |	Or other devices that exist in the home
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:08,895	| IOT119 |	Imagine a world where you able to actually do a lot of networking M on other protocols over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:12,735	| IOT119 |	So that would save power consumption because you would have to
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,015	| IOT119 |	Our devices would have to
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:16,063	| IOT119 |	Do quote-unquote shout at a lower DVT
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,087	| IOT119 |	To reach something
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:21,695	| IOT119 |	Exactly image thinking about doing kindness zigbee
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:23,743	| IOT119 |	Z wave over wifi
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:26,303	| IOT119 |	So instead of these low power
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:30,911	| IOT119 |	Devices having to speak to each other and mash and do whatever they need to do
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:34,495	| IOT119 |	Beatrice sang let him just talked to the nearest pot in the room
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:36,543	| IOT119 |	And then one another networking
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:42,175	| IOT119 |	Larry few old we can do this communication and anything quote smashing a month
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:43,711	| IOT119 |	That will save a lot of power
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,991	| IOT119 |	And beyond that
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:46,783	| IOT119 |	Y'all let's not forget about the license
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,063	| IOT119 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:52,671	| IOT119 |	So license spectrum is very expensive and it's not really available
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:56,767	| IOT119 |	So we also see this control plane expanding into
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,839	| IOT119 |	Author of coordinating across both the license
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:01,631	| IOT119 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:04,959	| IOT119 |	As a unified converged control plane
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,983	| IOT119 |	Sold a lot of exciting
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,543	| IOT119 |	Wow
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:12,127	| IOT119 |	I Wireless
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:15,711	| IOT119 |	Wireless
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:17,247	| IOT119 |	Very sad
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:23,391	| IOT119 |	Okay thank you so much for coming on the show this week it was
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,415	| IOT119 |	Really Illuminating
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,463	| IOT119 |	Thank you thank you Stacey
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,743	| IOT119 |	My pleasure
