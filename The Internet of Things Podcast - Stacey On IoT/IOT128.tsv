EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,912	| IOT128 |	And we've got
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:43,776	| IOT128 |	A message from one of our sponsors for track which actually just raised 88 million dollars this week
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,824	| IOT128 |	And our guest
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:48,384	| IOT128 |	Landon borders Who is the
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:52,480	| IOT128 |	Head of connected products at I can't say the full name of the company but is the big
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:53,760	| IOT128 |	Beep fanco
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:56,576	| IOT128 |	You can talk about what they've learned
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:58,368	| IOT128 |	By jumping in early into the
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:58,880	| IOT128 |	The connected Prada
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,672	| IOT128 |	And it's a really good interview
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:02,464	| IOT128 |	Stay tuned for all of that
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:03,744	| IOT128 |	But first
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,256	| IOT128 |	Another message
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:07,328	| IOT128 |	This response
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:12,960	| IOT128 |	Did you know on average it takes companies 18 months to lunch and iot connected product
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:17,824	| IOT128 |	But it doesn't have to get your product into the hands of your customers faster with cycling
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:24,224	| IOT128 |	Go from concept to connected in 4 months or less and get everything you need to run your connected product business cycle
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:30,624	| IOT128 |	Play offers everything needed to get up and running including Hardware integration a launch ready mobile app
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:37,024	| IOT128 |	And if I stayed up and prebuilt Integrations with tools like salesforce.com that's
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:43,168	| IOT128 |	I v e l y. Com for more information
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,448	| IOT128 |	Now
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,728	| IOT128 |	Moving on
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,496	| IOT128 |	To Eva
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,056	| IOT128 |	Oh Kevin I wish I was there
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,872	| IOT128 |	You know I feel the same way I have
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,920	| IOT128 |	Turn down going so many times
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:56,736	| IOT128 |	In the past and this year I think I'm good at most
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,296	| IOT128 |	Of all just because of all the connected products
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,576	| IOT128 |	Disappointed
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:03,904	| IOT128 |	So having never been this feels like it might be even more fun for a smart home
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,440	| IOT128 |	You know
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:11,840	| IOT128 |	UCS was always I think that big show to go to 4
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:14,912	| IOT128 |	Phones tablets and such but even that has bled over into
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:19,776	| IOT128 |	Even more this year and then because the smart home and iot categories are growing
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,592	| IOT128 |	There's just tons of stuff at you for this year and in that segment
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,384	| IOT128 |	So we were going to talk about.
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,664	| IOT128 |	The Crazy Ones
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,432	| IOT128 |	Since neither of us
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,808	| IOT128 |	Woot Germany hearing
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,344	| IOT128 |	All right all right
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,136	| IOT128 |	I was excited
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,904	| IOT128 |	Because higher
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,232	| IOT128 |	French
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,280	| IOT128 |	All right
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| IOT128 |	If you know me
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,608	| IOT128 |	You know I'm super psyched about this
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,912	| IOT128 |	Kitchen talking about
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:51,264	| IOT128 |	Bridges I'm like I don't want to touch pad on it I just want a camera so I can see what's in there
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:51,776	| IOT128 |	So
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:52,800	| IOT128 |	Higher history
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,848	| IOT128 |	And this is their link
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,360	| IOT128 |	Cook series / 4
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,688	| IOT128 |	The next cool thing they did is not just attic
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,224	| IOT128 |	They also
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,040	| IOT128 |	Let's see what's in your fridge at offers you a recipe
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,088	| IOT128 |	What's for dinner tonight
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,440	| IOT128 |	I like that because then you don't to worry about
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,232	| IOT128 |	What ingredient to do or don't have
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,512	| IOT128 |	You can just say hey fridge
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,792	| IOT128 |	You know what I have what can I make
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:18,912	| IOT128 |	Right so the freaking come with 10 ideas that you would live on your own and you don't have to go run out and buy anything else
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,704	| IOT128 |	See this is where they
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,008	| IOT128 |	Like even I'll just say it IBM's Watson
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,032	| IOT128 |	The chef
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,336	| IOT128 |	Contact would be really interesting
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,360	| IOT128 |	Although many of those recipe
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,664	| IOT128 |	Having
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,200	| IOT128 |	I'll take you guys I own the shuffle
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,112	| IOT128 |	Time into these kind of databases feels fun
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,904	| IOT128 |	My concern is in
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| IOT128 |	There's no details on pricing
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,744	| IOT128 |	When the sun be out so right now consider this kind
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,560	| IOT128 |	But what I'm worried about is
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,376	| IOT128 |	We're going to get these stupid like limits on
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:53,728	| IOT128 |	Because we don't have like a unified recipe format really yet
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,776	| IOT128 |	You're going to have to use the following
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,544	| IOT128 |	Place to get your recipe
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| IOT128 |	And really I want my recipes from
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,640	| IOT128 |	Wherever I want all recipes
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,712	| IOT128 |	Recipe
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,248	| IOT128 |	Annie Frazier
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,808	| IOT128 |	Open source recipes
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,136	| IOT128 |	So hopefully that's going to happen
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| IOT128 |	Right now it's
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,464	| IOT128 |	What we're getting today is things like
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT128 |	Drop which is the maker of a connected
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,839	| IOT128 |	To do the recipes for all of ge's connect
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:24,447	| IOT128 |	We just got news this week that sidechef is going to
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,751	| IOT128 |	Do the recipes for sharps u.s. Appliance
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| IOT128 |	Is swelling good
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,127	| IOT128 |	This is really a first world problem
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,895	| IOT128 |	Like oh my God
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,991	| IOT128 |	A recipe online I'm not going to be able to have my oven
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,015	| IOT128 |	Automatic
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:43,135	| IOT128 |	Two things one yet I'm glad you mentioned drop because I was going to bring it up
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,903	| IOT128 |	Because
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,207	| IOT128 |	Drophead me that Bluetooth connected scale
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,487	| IOT128 |	Maybe 2 years ago
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,559	| IOT128 |	And it would do something sort of similar in that
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,839	| IOT128 |	If you didn't have
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,631	| IOT128 |	Maybe sugar for a recipe
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,703	| IOT128 |	It would recommend what you might have instead and it would
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,775	| IOT128 |	Yo Gotti wait and tell you exactly how much of a substitute it was
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,823	| IOT128 |	Not to the scale of a fridge that could
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,591	| IOT128 |	Do all this obviously
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:08,991	| IOT128 |	Number one and the other thing is this gets back to that question that we asked a show or two ago are you buying Hardware or a service
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:12,575	| IOT128 |	It's so cool to have a connected fridge with a camera and everything else
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:18,975	| IOT128 |	What is the service light that goes with it who runs it where's that day to come from and then all the other obvious IRT question security
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,511	| IOT128 |	Personalized data Etc
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,351	| IOT128 |	You got to think about where they're going to get this information from her recipes
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:28,191	| IOT128 |	I wouldn't buy this fridge unless I knew it had a broad range of recipes for example
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,471	| IOT128 |	I agree
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,263	| IOT128 |	Because otherwise it's just to be like tonight
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,799	| IOT128 |	I see you have a cat
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:35,103	| IOT128 |	Crunch cereal
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,383	| IOT128 |	But I want
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,919	| IOT128 |	Captain Crunch crusted trout
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,551	| IOT128 |	I don't actually
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,647	| IOT128 |	Also in really cool and random
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,927	| IOT128 |	Bridges we have
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| IOT128 |	Panasonic
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| IOT128 |	Connected sake fridge
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,767	| IOT128 |	Which is basically
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,559	| IOT128 |	I feel like anybody who
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:58,655	| IOT128 |	Was an engineering student in college probably built one of these it's a fridge that you can
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,679	| IOT128 |	Call to you
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,239	| IOT128 |	And it will come to you and bring you your
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,007	| IOT128 |	In this case
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,287	| IOT128 |	Sake I'm sure it would also
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,079	| IOT128 |	They sold in the us to bring new cold beer
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:09,407	| IOT128 |	Just tiny little fridge looks like it sits on top of a Roomba
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,479	| IOT128 |	Has voice commands and
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,039	| IOT128 |	It's got lighter so it can map its way around your home
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,343	| IOT128 |	Just feel like Africa
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,671	| IOT128 |	Yes yes yes
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:27,583	| IOT128 |	Yes I had a R2D2 programmable robot couple years back and I actually
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:32,191	| IOT128 |	Metal extendable arm I read program the route from the fridge to my
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,495	| IOT128 |	Temperature in the TV and I would have it
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,519	| IOT128 |	Bring me a beer
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:41,151	| IOT128 |	Unfortunately it couldn't reach into the fridge to get a beer or store and everything so somebody
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,455	| IOT128 |	Put the beer in the armpit
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,223	| IOT128 |	Get the
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| IOT128 |	Idealist
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,439	| IOT128 |	Since this looks like a concept or talk to anybody been putting like
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,999	| IOT128 |	This isn't actually for the Fret set
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,047	| IOT128 |	Have Mobility
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,631	| IOT128 |	Yeah my son has parties all the time
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:08,543	| IOT128 |	It's a sucky fridge but it's for people with Mobility problems and I'm not saying the people with Mobility problems aren't drink
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,055	| IOT128 |	Sake
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,407	| IOT128 |	So okay that probably does it for the
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,175	| IOT128 |	Crazy
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:20,575	| IOT128 |	Fridge stuff I just got to restate for the record that I do not think a fridge really needs a giant touchscreen on the front
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,623	| IOT128 |	Even though manufacturers are really trying to sell this
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| IOT128 |	Alright just you know
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,207	| IOT128 |	If you disagree
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:26,719	| IOT128 |	Can call and let me know
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,999	| IOT128 |	I'm or Justine
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,559	| IOT128 |	So I also saw I didn't see
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,095	| IOT128 |	Coverage of
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,887	| IOT128 |	A washing machine that looks pretty cool
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:36,703	| IOT128 |	It is the AG 9000 series from
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,215	| IOT128 |	Okapi
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,751	| IOT128 |	And it is a
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,287	| IOT128 |	Combo washing machine and dryer
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| IOT128 |	Not the US market
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:45,919	| IOT128 |	Because we are giant space pigs who have room
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,431	| IOT128 |	For both
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,527	| IOT128 |	What this does is it has all kinds of sensors
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,319	| IOT128 |	To detect
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,855	| IOT128 |	Your Washington is
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| IOT128 |	How much
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,207	| IOT128 |	Washing is actually in there and then it also can detect
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,767	| IOT128 |	The type of clothes
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,279	| IOT128 |	Fabric
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,327	| IOT128 |	And we'll wash it based on that
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:09,471	| IOT128 |	I'd be curious how does this and I'm actually interested in something like that because
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,775	| IOT128 |	From my running gear which is snow all
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,591	| IOT128 |	Berkeley polyester Dri-Fit stuff Nike or whoever
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,663	| IOT128 |	You're not supposed to use fabric softener on those
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT128 |	And sometimes I forget
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:22,015	| IOT128 |	And it'd be nice to have this stuff automatically
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:25,599	| IOT128 |	Detective don't put in the fabric softener you know cuz it'll just
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:31,999	| IOT128 |	I'm thinking they'll just dropping fabric softener automatically but you know if I need a shower or not suck
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| IOT128 |	Yes 4 all that money
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:37,119	| IOT128 |	So I'd like to hear a curious how they can tell the different Fabrics apart
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:40,447	| IOT128 |	I talk to people from like P&G and they talk about you.
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,471	| IOT128 |	Either having messaging
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,519	| IOT128 |	Indications on the tags
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:48,127	| IOT128 |	Or just being able I mean if you think about a camera it could look at the fabric
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:53,503	| IOT128 |	Other option because then you could really tell Lake
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,319	| IOT128 |	The Weave based on maybe not later but at 3 DC
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| IOT128 |	What that feels like
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,767	| IOT128 |	Also you should not dry
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,303	| IOT128 |	You should always
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,655	| IOT128 |	I know I know so I don't even know why you're sticking
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,679	| IOT128 |	Dryer in the fur
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| IOT128 |	All right but this is
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,543	| IOT128 |	This is not a show about laundry
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,895	| IOT128 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,175	| IOT128 |	You know what else happened
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,943	| IOT128 |	This is not even news
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,735	| IOT128 |	Cool stuff from
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,575	| IOT128 |	Juicero
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,623	| IOT128 |	Down last week
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,903	| IOT128 |	And guys
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,671	| IOT128 |	Sweet wine
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,743	| IOT128 |	You may recognize juicero we talked about it
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,303	| IOT128 |	A couple times it was a $700
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,095	| IOT128 |	Cold pressed juice machine
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,863	| IOT128 |	They later dropped
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,631	| IOT128 |	Price $400
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,167	| IOT128 |	But
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| IOT128 |	Really what it was
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,215	| IOT128 |	Is
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| IOT128 |	Service
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,775	| IOT128 |	That was trying to bring you
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,543	| IOT128 |	Fresh
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,823	| IOT128 |	Vegetables get you
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,847	| IOT128 |	Eat your vegetables
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,359	| IOT128 |	Convenient easy way
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| IOT128 |	Fortunately
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,175	| IOT128 |	Crazy expensive
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:56,223	| IOT128 |	Very tough distribution model
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,735	| IOT128 |	Because
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,527	| IOT128 |	These cold pressed juices only
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,807	| IOT128 |	I kept for like 7 days
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,575	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,111	| IOT128 |	Is very expensive cookware
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,159	| IOT128 |	Yeah it's almost like they took the
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,951	| IOT128 |	Razer Blade Pro
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:08,255	| IOT128 |	To this by saying we'll make up a lot of money on
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:12,607	| IOT128 |	Description in the juices and saucer with the hardware itself was just so darn expensive
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,143	| IOT128 |	Hardware was not
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:23,615	| IOT128 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| IOT128 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,175	| IOT128 |	So yes and
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,479	| IOT128 |	I caution companies were building connected products
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,759	| IOT128 |	Hardware
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,063	| IOT128 |	To think about this are you really selling Hardware
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| IOT128 |	If you aren't
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,879	| IOT128 |	Don't spend too much on it
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,391	| IOT128 |	Because
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| IOT128 |	That is sadness
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,559	| IOT128 |	I'm not surprised
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,399	| IOT128 |	So yeah
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,679	| IOT128 |	If you have it you Sarah though
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,263	| IOT128 |	This is not a product that can be really replicated
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,311	| IOT128 |	So you bought something that
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,847	| IOT128 |	There are no other things to fit into it
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,919	| IOT128 |	Keurig when they stop producing cake
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,943	| IOT128 |	Cups
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,503	| IOT128 |	My life would not go on for me
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,599	| IOT128 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,903	| IOT128 |	Now into
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:08,927	| IOT128 |	A little bit of
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:12,767	| IOT128 |	Industrialist news we've got this is not Industrial
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,535	| IOT128 |	This is
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,559	| IOT128 |	Security Eros
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:15,839	| IOT128 |	Kevin Wendt
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:21,983	| IOT128 |	We are so if you have AT&T U-verse
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:28,383	| IOT128 |	Service and you have an Arris modem router or Gateway that was provided by AT&T I guess where you could have
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:32,735	| IOT128 |	About yourself listen up because no motion security
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:38,111	| IOT128 |	Has said we found five laws that are so easy to
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,415	| IOT128 |	Pax that we just go public with it
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:45,023	| IOT128 |	Fact they didn't even go to the vendor like I normally do with a waiting. To see if Eros would fix it
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:51,423	| IOT128 |	They just went public with it so there's a couple of issues here and I think we should have a link to the new motion
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| IOT128 |	Blog because they
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:56,799	| IOT128 |	They show how you can close some of these holes and that's what they are there holes
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,591	| IOT128 |	Cute cute cute
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,639	| IOT128 |	And to be fair I think some of these
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,199	| IOT128 |	May have been included for
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,735	| IOT128 |	AT&T 2
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:11,647	| IOT128 |	Provide customer service get logs and things like that that's not an excuse I think this is inexcusable I think regardless of Harrisburg
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:16,767	| IOT128 |	Reducing is modems AT&T is the service provider and they are the ones that should be on the hook to fix this in my opinion.
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,047	| IOT128 |	That's just me
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,351	| IOT128 |	One of the issues is
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,911	| IOT128 |	The exposure of an SSH
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,679	| IOT128 |	Shell
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,215	| IOT128 |	Remote access
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,519	| IOT128 |	To the internet from these routers
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,287	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:33,151	| IOT128 |	Username or password is hard-coded right in the firmware so you have
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:39,039	| IOT128 |	Access to have access to the mall so that is not good there other default credentials that are sitting in there that are just
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:45,439	| IOT128 |	Available for people exploit not good Motel said I see basically it just too many ways of poor
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:49,791	| IOT128 |	That's open for remote access that shouldn't be open just not good at all
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,327	| IOT128 |	Indeed
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:57,215	| IOT128 |	And you got a little rule in here saying you shouldn't be renting your modem about 80% of people in the US
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,751	| IOT128 |	Apparently do get their modem
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,519	| IOT128 |	Straight from there is
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:05,919	| IOT128 |	Please stop please stop people from 2 that there's actually some interesting things that are developing with the internet of things here
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,455	| IOT128 |	Will just take a note 2
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,759	| IOT128 |	Talk about it if you are a Comcast customer
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:13,087	| IOT128 |	You actually have to get their modem and Gateway because it's got software that
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,879	| IOT128 |	Works with their Pokemon
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:20,255	| IOT128 |	What's happening there is Comcast is like
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,535	| IOT128 |	Trying to make that
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,815	| IOT128 |	I think it's up to $10 a month
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,375	| IOT128 |	A little bit more worthwhile
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| IOT128 |	But
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,191	| IOT128 |	If they're doing
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,471	| IOT128 |	They should darn well make sure the
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:37,407	| IOT128 |	I'm I'm okay with paying a modem rental fee if you're going to have those additional features or years we paid a fee for just
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,687	| IOT128 |	Access Electric
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,455	| IOT128 |	Terrible
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,295	| IOT128 |	Not to mention the other reason I had this rule is as one you can save money by
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,599	| IOT128 |	Getting a cheaper modem never launched
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:47,135	| IOT128 |	The third-party routers
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,927	| IOT128 |	Offer features
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,207	| IOT128 |	Far faster
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:56,607	| IOT128 |	For earache far faster than what is provided by the isps you know today we got Mesh networking through various
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:01,215	| IOT128 |	Options that are out in the market you got faster speeds I think up until a year or year-and-a-half ago
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:07,359	| IOT128 |	Verizon was trying to get me to rent at 8 to 11 for a while get out of here
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:12,223	| IOT128 |	Very few reasons in my Pinto by rent a motorized if you can help it
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,991	| IOT128 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,759	| IOT128 |	All right
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| IOT128 |	In the show notes
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,111	| IOT128 |	So
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,135	| IOT128 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,439	| IOT128 |	Cat 1 Test
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,487	| IOT128 |	That's right
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,559	| IOT128 |	You really like cat M1 for some reason
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| IOT128 |	I just
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,375	| IOT128 |	Actually I like it be iot
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,471	| IOT128 |	What is
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:33,983	| IOT128 |	One of these
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,519	| IOT128 |	Low power
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,031	| IOT128 |	Wide area network
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,591	| IOT128 |	Technologies but it is a cellular
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,359	| IOT128 |	So
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,175	| IOT128 |	Think of it in the same kind of mental space
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,479	| IOT128 |	Sort of as sigfox
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,759	| IOT128 |	Lorawan nb-iot
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,319	| IOT128 |	The difference is it actually has
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,087	| IOT128 |	Way bigger
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,975	| IOT128 |	More Gatorade so this is
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,487	| IOT128 |	Better
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,511	| IOT128 |	Cellular
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,839	| IOT128 |	Right in the news
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| IOT128 |	This is not
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:04,447	| IOT128 |	Earth-shattering news but I want to bring it for two reasons one the first reason is that
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:10,847	| IOT128 |	MTN in South Africa is trialling their new cat M1 network with Ericsson and Qualcomm
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:15,711	| IOT128 |	That is the first test in the continent so that's kind of cool importantly I
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,991	| IOT128 |	Notice this little nugget
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,015	| IOT128 |	In that
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:23,135	| IOT128 |	They're adding Erikson's added support for voice over LTE
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:27,231	| IOT128 |	This platform for cat M1 that's been implemented trial
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,279	| IOT128 |	And like why would they do that
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:32,095	| IOT128 |	Will Boise is relatively low bandwidth so it's
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:38,495	| IOT128 |	There's enough speed enough pipe there to handle the why would you do it it's all for Internet of Things what Erikson said is that the
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| IOT128 |	Addition of
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,311	| IOT128 |	Voice over LTE on Cottman Ave Network
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,359	| IOT128 |	Let's telcos
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:45,919	| IOT128 |	Connect to iot devices in the apps and services
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:49,247	| IOT128 |	They could benefit from these boys services such a security alarm panel
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,271	| IOT128 |	First aid kits
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,295	| IOT128 |	Wearables digital lock
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,087	| IOT128 |	Disposable security garments
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:59,487	| IOT128 |	I'm like that's actually good idea so if you have a security system that's using say cat in one network to have its constant connectivity
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,023	| IOT128 |	G2a monitoring service
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,303	| IOT128 |	You could actually
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,095	| IOT128 |	You know in case of a break-in
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| IOT128 |	Make a call
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,399	| IOT128 |	On that same network
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:09,471	| IOT128 |	Or to those people I never thought about that
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| IOT128 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,799	| IOT128 |	And I don't disagree with that and I see
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:19,967	| IOT128 |	That's one way that Cellular Connection Ali win in this area cuz I think right now it's pretty expensive like for example and a half
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,503	| IOT128 |	Africa I know of several
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,063	| IOT128 |	I feel like
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,879	| IOT128 |	That's going to be a hard sell but
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,159	| IOT128 |	That's a good way to try to
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,951	| IOT128 |	Yay
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,999	| IOT128 |	I think it's time to talk about
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,023	| IOT128 |	Assistance
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,303	| IOT128 |	All the philosophical Quest
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:37,119	| IOT128 |	Question
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:38,911	| IOT128 |	So yeah
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:39,935	| IOT128 |	Antifa
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,471	| IOT128 |	Everybody had enough
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,495	| IOT128 |	Assistant
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,775	| IOT128 |	Baker, Laura
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:44,799	| IOT128 |	In Kevin and I were wondering
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,615	| IOT128 |	When do you need a smart speaker
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,151	| IOT128 |	What features do you need
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,431	| IOT128 |	Assistant speaker
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,455	| IOT128 |	Do you need a speaker
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,783	| IOT128 |	My gosh
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:57,599	| IOT128 |	What kind of features do we need in these smart
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,367	| IOT128 |	Home assistant
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,391	| IOT128 |	Should be calling them
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:07,071	| IOT128 |	I don't know if we should call them smart home assistants not all of them because you have and I haven't most people that was in the show
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:11,423	| IOT128 |	A digital assistant integrated to their phone already weather is Siri
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,703	| IOT128 |	Weathers Google Assistant
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,007	| IOT128 |	Whether it's Bixby whether it's
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:20,639	| IOT128 |	Even Amazon Echo Services because that is coming on more phones so
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:24,735	| IOT128 |	That's not a smart home assistant that's a digital assistant what I'm asking for information
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,063	| IOT128 |	Contextual information popping up reaching out to me that kind of thing
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,391	| IOT128 |	Like the number of times I use
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,415	| IOT128 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| IOT128 |	Is Winn-Dixie
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,511	| IOT128 |	And I don't know why I really don't know why
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:40,607	| IOT128 |	Let me ask you a question that may give you an idea
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:44,703	| IOT128 |	How often are you away from your Echo
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:47,007	| IOT128 |	Your Google home and other things like that
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:49,567	| IOT128 |	I am away from it but then I'm usually in
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,079	| IOT128 |	In public life
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,383	| IOT128 |	Stepping out so the only time I use it was probably in my
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,919	| IOT128 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,991	| IOT128 |	So I talk to my phone whenever I'm out of the house
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,527	| IOT128 |	And want information
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,855	| IOT128 |	Because there is no dedicated assistant around I mean it's just
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,391	| IOT128 |	There isn't there these are all fixed
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,415	| IOT128 |	Assistance in my house
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,695	| IOT128 |	Right
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,207	| IOT128 |	And I guess
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:11,327	| IOT128 |	State is not very social outside of the house
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:17,215	| IOT128 |	So you just walk up to people and say hey do you know how far it is to the Moon
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,335	| IOT128 |	B6 don't often come up when I do I actually usually
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:29,247	| IOT128 |	No it's a it's a different anything wrong with that seriously
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,551	| IOT128 |	Beijing ribs
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:36,927	| IOT128 |	We are sure you're not no you're not weird there are people who still do not want to talk to devices
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:39,743	| IOT128 |	Outinpublic not to their watch not to their phone and so on
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,279	| IOT128 |	I get it I don't judge that's fine
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,559	| IOT128 |	No I might go
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,839	| IOT128 |	I might still judge
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,655	| IOT128 |	Alright so
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:51,775	| IOT128 |	And it just a friend of mine actually just asked me if they should buy the Echo Show
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,055	| IOT128 |	The echo
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| IOT128 |	And I was like
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,127	| IOT128 |	You know it's kind of cool
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,919	| IOT128 |	Show me some
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,687	| IOT128 |	Corgi videos
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:05,343	| IOT128 |	I don't have anyone really to talk to drop and capability
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,367	| IOT128 |	Right
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,951	| IOT128 |	I don't think I would spend that much money on the echo show again
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,767	| IOT128 |	So I feel like I don't need a video screen
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,303	| IOT128 |	Because I don't
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,095	| IOT128 |	I got a TV
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,375	| IOT128 |	Really functions
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,399	| IOT128 |	Perfectly
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,935	| IOT128 |	If you have a Chromecast you can
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,471	| IOT128 |	Use Google to say hey
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,775	| IOT128 |	Show me this on the TV. Easily anyway
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,847	| IOT128 |	I think it's an intriguing product but I don't
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,615	| IOT128 |	Think it's
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:33,759	| IOT128 |	How can I be a speaker hit as maybe the original Echo devices quite honestly because it requires to get the most out of it
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,295	| IOT128 |	Requires more than one
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,087	| IOT128 |	So you can do the video call and so on
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,159	| IOT128 |	But that kind of stuff I just do over the phone or computer wherever I am anyway
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,719	| IOT128 |	I don't want a dedicated video box
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,511	| IOT128 |	They're definitely use cases
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:49,119	| IOT128 |	With kidney touch with his family that's far away that maybe they're not very technical I get that but
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,631	| IOT128 |	That's on me
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,983	| IOT128 |	I would love to have more Bass
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,007	| IOT128 |	What's a Google home
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:58,335	| IOT128 |	Things I would love to
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,383	| IOT128 |	Hey
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,919	| IOT128 |	Speaker assistant
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,479	| IOT128 |	Person add such-and-such at 12
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,295	| IOT128 |	I think
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| IOT128 |	That kind of interactivity
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:14,207	| IOT128 |	In the ability to affect other apps would be really cool and no one's really
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| IOT128 |	I breathe I'm hungry
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,535	| IOT128 |	What else do we need
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,303	| IOT128 |	We need good quality
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:26,239	| IOT128 |	I think it's fair I mean a lot of people buy these things now because of they're tapping into music services that can connect and they want
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:30,079	| IOT128 |	Voice Control music music
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,103	| IOT128 |	Chola people
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:34,687	| IOT128 |	Summer fine with say the standard assistance are available today that you
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:41,087	| IOT128 |	Echo is your Google home and so on so forth
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,623	| IOT128 |	New Google Assistant
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,415	| IOT128 |	Enable speakers coming out soon
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,463	| IOT128 |	Now that you Frozen play we got
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,487	| IOT128 |	Whole list
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,255	| IOT128 |	Of
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,071	| IOT128 |	Smart speakers and I've noticed something very interesting
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:55,679	| IOT128 |	They're all coming from big-name audio companies such as Harman Kardon
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,703	| IOT128 |	Sony
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,727	| IOT128 |	Panasonic
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,751	| IOT128 |	Onkyo
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:05,151	| IOT128 |	Their stuff is typically not cheap and sure enough these quote-unquote smart speakers or digital assistants are also looking.
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,223	| IOT128 |	Gucci prices look much higher than the echo products for example
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,015	| IOT128 |	And that's because
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:15,647	| IOT128 |	They have more robust speakers maybe some more features and so on and I think it's also because
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:21,792	| IOT128 |	They're getting in because they saw Apple's homepod for 350 and figure hey Apple can make a good sounding speaker
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,072	| IOT128 |	With additional assistance
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:26,144	| IOT128 |	350 we can do the same for two three four hundred dollars Etc so
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:28,448	| IOT128 |	It's just interesting the number of
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:34,080	| IOT128 |	Large audio companies getting it on the skin PPL is another for example
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:37,664	| IOT128 |	Fourth is expected to announce their digital assistants be
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,224	| IOT128 |	So it'll be
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,296	| IOT128 |	And whether or not my existing
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,624	| IOT128 |	Chris compatible through the echo is supposed to have
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:52,256	| IOT128 |	Cross your fingers on that way you know it's really nice though about all this
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,792	| IOT128 |	There there are
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| IOT128 |	Smart
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:58,912	| IOT128 |	Home digital assistant speakers for every type of budget
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,960	| IOT128 |	And every type of listener right now
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,520	| IOT128 |	You couldn't say that a year or two ago
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:04,800	| IOT128 |	Now you
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,616	| IOT128 |	There was only one
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:14,016	| IOT128 |	But even even so even the ones that have come out since then have been relatively inexpensive and some munchies
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:20,160	| IOT128 |	I know we talked about the UV before I think it was actually on sale for $29 but you know your Echo dot is $49
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,976	| IOT128 |	We talked about one called the fabric
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| IOT128 |	With a Q
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,280	| IOT128 |	And that was like
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:25,792	| IOT128 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,584	| IOT128 |	Low priced it was like
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,144	| IOT128 |	That wasn't one
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:36,032	| IOT128 |	Yep right wasn't always listening you've got more great choices again for every budget every sound level
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,848	| IOT128 |	Tell the speaker said I'm seeing that we're now sativa
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,408	| IOT128 |	This could be your whole sounds
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:47,040	| IOT128 |	System for your house and you get the added benefit of the connectedness
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,808	| IOT128 |	So this is
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,320	| IOT128 |	I think
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,136	| IOT128 |	You know it
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,416	| IOT128 |	I like playing music
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,464	| IOT128 |	Over my existing speaker
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,488	| IOT128 |	I don't want to
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| IOT128 |	I don't want a constant
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,560	| IOT128 |	It is kind of a pain
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,376	| IOT128 |	But
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:04,192	| IOT128 |	You got the Amazon is built into
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:08,800	| IOT128 |	Lighting it is built into things like the ecobee so you've got a bunch of products that
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,336	| IOT128 |	Their justice system
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:12,896	| IOT128 |	They're not even not speakers exactly
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:17,760	| IOT128 |	Exactly they are the interface really for your smartphone that's what started all this and I think that will still open
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:22,112	| IOT128 |	To be Central to all the types of products speakers is a big one because
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:28,256	| IOT128 |	The dual purpose of listening to these Music Services since most people are now streaming music not no uploading or playing CDs or
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| IOT128 |	Vinyl Runner
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:34,400	| IOT128 |	I have my. I have the entire Beatles collection on vinyl thank you
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,496	| IOT128 |	Once a month or so
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,520	| IOT128 |	Versatile
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,360	| IOT128 |	All day everyday on SiriusXM
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,408	| IOT128 |	That's what I thought
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,176	| IOT128 |	We should do a
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| IOT128 |	Minor quiqup
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,528	| IOT128 |	I got yelled at so badly by my child
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:54,368	| IOT128 |	Because I switched the multi-room audio on the echo
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,392	| IOT128 |	Just try it out last
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:24:00,512	| IOT128 |	Are you guys on Amazon music settings
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,024	| IOT128 |	Spotify didn't
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:05,376	| IOT128 |	And she was getting so frustrated cuz she was trying
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT128 |	Play her
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,984	| IOT128 |	Music she's like nothing is available to me
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,496	| IOT128 |	I realized
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,568	| IOT128 |	Leominster dog
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:14,848	| IOT128 |	It's still broken yellow
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,408	| IOT128 |	Until I can play the music I want
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,432	| IOT128 |	When I want it it's just not you
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:24,832	| IOT128 |	Especially for everybody who still trying to build off these clothes Chico CA
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,880	| IOT128 |	If you don't support everything
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,928	| IOT128 |	Hi God it's like you support nothing
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,256	| IOT128 |	Are at this point
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,304	| IOT128 |	What's a good sex
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,096	| IOT128 |	Ruined it into
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,864	| IOT128 |	Voicemail
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,168	| IOT128 |	Okay so last week we started
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| IOT128 |	Highline
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,264	| IOT128 |	Can dial it
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,568	| IOT128 |	You know the number I have
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| IOT128 |	63
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,480	| IOT128 |	85122
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,760	| IOT128 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:55,040	| IOT128 |	742 4
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:58,880	| IOT128 |	We've already had a lot of gall so thank you guys
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:01,696	| IOT128 |	We will play some some we're going to hold off on
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,464	| IOT128 |	Just for now
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,512	| IOT128 |	And some are actually lovely
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,816	| IOT128 |	Questions that don't want to be on the air which is totally fine
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,144	| IOT128 |	We had a voicemail from Jonathan
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:13,984	| IOT128 |	Then and he noted that it's kind of interesting with like the Microsoft
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,800	| IOT128 |	Amazon Cortana speaking to Madame a
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:17,312	| IOT128 |	News
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,128	| IOT128 |	Connected speakers are
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,640	| IOT128 |	Now talkin
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:27,808	| IOT128 |	And he didn't really have a question he just threw that up and I was like you know he's right it is and I think this is actually a disturbing
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,600	| IOT128 |	Worrisome trend
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:32,928	| IOT128 |	Because what we're seeing is Brands getting in there and saying
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,208	| IOT128 |	Hey this
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:35,232	| IOT128 |	Smart home stuff
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,256	| IOT128 |	It's going voice
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,840	| IOT128 |	Okay if voice has been extra why I need to get my brand in here
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,864	| IOT128 |	And how many do that
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,704	| IOT128 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:51,104	| IOT128 |	It is interesting I drew Jonathan it's concerning to me because I don't want to do prison with Jonathan
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:54,688	| IOT128 |	Said he'd said that there's an Amazon Echo skill that talks to Google
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:26:00,064	| IOT128 |	So you would ask the echo to reach out to Google to get information but that's like second and third hand
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,624	| IOT128 |	Commands and I don't want the interface
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:07,744	| IOT128 |	Just gets me my information I don't want to have to think about who I'm asking the question to an how to ask it right
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,304	| IOT128 |	And probably this means that we should have
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:12,352	| IOT128 |	Oh my gosh you know we talked about open recipe standard
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,376	| IOT128 |	Voice UI
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,704	| IOT128 |	Getting access to this data should probably be something like
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| IOT128 |	XML
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,520	| IOT128 |	Or HTML and not
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,544	| IOT128 |	Controlled by
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,056	| IOT128 |	Central
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,640	| IOT128 |	And I say that because I'd rather just be like
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,920	| IOT128 |	Computer just do this for me
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:27,200	| IOT128 |	Right as opposed to
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:32,064	| IOT128 |	What's happening now is one you have to pick between the Amazon Echo Google home
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:35,648	| IOT128 |	Apple's homekit and then those guys are going to have their own skills that
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:39,488	| IOT128 |	Can't wait so right now GE actually has Geneva
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,280	| IOT128 |	Will tell you how
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:42,816	| IOT128 |	How to cook your
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:43,840	| IOT128 |	Cakes
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,400	| IOT128 |	Roast chicken in your ovens
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,216	| IOT128 |	That's well and good except you got to be like oh hey
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,800	| IOT128 |	You know mattimeo let me talk to Geneva Geneva I want to cook something
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,336	| IOT128 |	Preheat my oven
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:56,128	| IOT128 |	When really you just want to talk to
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,152	| IOT128 |	One thing and say hey
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| IOT128 |	And then you were at at 2
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:06,880	| IOT128 |	I agree with you I think it's going to be a challenge until we decide that we want to separate the interface
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:12,256	| IOT128 |	From the data if we have a standard interface for voice perfect and then everybody can compete
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:16,608	| IOT128 |	Who's got the best data to answer the question get the best recipe etcetera but I don't
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:22,496	| IOT128 |	Think that's going to happen because everybody's push for their own natural language processing technology in addition to the data
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,520	| IOT128 |	So
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,544	| IOT128 |	It's kind of a mess
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,568	| IOT128 |	We broke the open
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| IOT128 |	All right here
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,432	| IOT128 |	The lovely Quest
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,480	| IOT128 |	Craig
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,552	| IOT128 |	Hey folks this is Greg here first
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,088	| IOT128 |	Time caller long
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,856	| IOT128 |	Time listener
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:41,952	| IOT128 |	Feel free to embed my message in your show that would be awesome
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:45,792	| IOT128 |	Question about a bunch of light switches I've been putting in my home lately
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:49,376	| IOT128 |	They're made by a company called homeseer I believe that
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:51,680	| IOT128 |	The New England area maybe New Hampshire
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,192	| IOT128 |	Vermont
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,984	| IOT128 |	What do you know about these folks
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,288	| IOT128 |	Have you experimented with the products before
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:28:00,384	| IOT128 |	And you have anything to say about the Hub that they build I currently want to wink hub
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:04,992	| IOT128 |	At home ear would sure love to see me used on HUB I'd love some comments for you about that
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,136	| IOT128 |	I do I have an opinion I guess I should
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,440	| IOT128 |	Did say I'm because I'm not used homeseer
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:19,328	| IOT128 |	Ever and I don't think Stacy you have either a couple questions so I just told Kevin that we should get a hug
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,864	| IOT128 |	Start playing
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:25,728	| IOT128 |	Which I agree we should definitely do that but in the meantime just to give an opinion on Craig's question I think
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,520	| IOT128 |	Hamster has some nice qualities
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:30,336	| IOT128 |	Is that you know your data can be local now.
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:34,944	| IOT128 |	The cloud so you know maybe your internet connection goes down and you know all your stuff still work
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:39,040	| IOT128 |	The problems that I see though with homeseer even though it may be a stellar solution
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,880	| IOT128 |	Is a couple things one it is not cheap the cheapest
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:49,280	| IOT128 |	Smart home controller right now from Home Series 19995 and then there's a second one that has more stuff in it
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,072	| IOT128 |	399 95 and then the
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:53,632	| IOT128 |	Best one is $899.95
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:57,472	| IOT128 |	So it's not cheap compared to a wink or SmartThings or some other hub
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:02,848	| IOT128 |	In addition to that not all of the service Integrations are free in fact if you go to home Siri
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,616	| IOT128 |	Site
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:06,176	| IOT128 |	You can see that you can purchase plugins
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,944	| IOT128 |	For homeseer
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:13,344	| IOT128 |	Some of these are free which is great you know you can say work with Z-Wave and insteon
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,112	| IOT128 |	No problem
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,392	| IOT128 |	But if you want
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:20,256	| IOT128 |	To add Lutron caseta
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,840	| IOT128 |	Yeah it gets expensive and
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:26,144	| IOT128 |	I want to go throw them cuz there's a whole list of plug-in
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,424	| IOT128 |	Summer free
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:33,824	| IOT128 |	My fear is that you really have to think ahead what products you want your husband support before you invest in a home syrup
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,104	| IOT128 |	Because you're going to
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:38,176	| IOT128 |	Implement this and then if you want to add something later is that going to cost me
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:40,224	| IOT128 |	Were you $50 as I get the drivers and they asked
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:46,624	| IOT128 |	Will say that you get to try all the plugins for free for 30 days so it's not by have to keep buying
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:53,024	| IOT128 |	Get to try stuff but I just worry about that it's an interesting business model but it's not one that I would personally want to
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:58,912	| IOT128 |	Go for I would go for something that has much broader product range that is included or included at no extra charge
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,680	| IOT128 |	All right
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:04,032	| IOT128 |	Next week more listener questions and in the meantime though I did want to do an update
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,616	| IOT128 |	To me this week we lost internet
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:09,152	| IOT128 |	Access we lost power and internet
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,736	| IOT128 |	Access so as a reminder to everybody who's dealing with connected
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,504	| IOT128 |	Homepro
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:19,904	| IOT128 |	It's important to understand how these things behave when your power goes out so for example your hue light bulb
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,952	| IOT128 |	ABS because your switches on they will
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:25,536	| IOT128 |	Power goes out they all and comes back on they all go back on
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,584	| IOT128 |	Everywhere in your house all your hue light bulbs
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:30,144	| IOT128 |	Turn right back on max power
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:35,008	| IOT128 |	There are other things like the Amazon Echo Power and Boots back up
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,032	| IOT128 |	It will also go
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,360	| IOT128 |	And I believe
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| IOT128 |	So
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,944	| IOT128 |	As a fun little test
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,272	| IOT128 |	If you want I can do this for you by turning my house off
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,552	| IOT128 |	I'm telling you what
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,064	| IOT128 |	Brakes
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,648	| IOT128 |	Hit your power button just to see what happen
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,184	| IOT128 |	Because
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,488	| IOT128 |	You're likely if you've invested a lot of smartphone
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,328	| IOT128 |	We ran through
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,888	| IOT128 |	Because we didn't want to wake up
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:04,960	| IOT128 |	My daughter and turning off the Hue Lights at the switch that we
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,728	| IOT128 |	We remembered we had
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,776	| IOT128 |	And I think we still were surprised by some
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:09,568	| IOT128 |	I don't remember what it
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,640	| IOT128 |	Oh it was our air filter but that is not connect
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,664	| IOT128 |	So it just talks to us
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,944	| IOT128 |	Just for fun
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,992	| IOT128 |	So not even connected products
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,808	| IOT128 |	And then the other thing is a couple nights ago
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:20,832	| IOT128 |	We lost internet access
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:23,392	| IOT128 |	Normally The Echoes will let you
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,672	| IOT128 |	You know if it has no enter
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,696	| IOT128 |	Access but
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,464	| IOT128 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,512	| IOT128 |	I guess in the middle tonight I'm not sure what happened there
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,792	| IOT128 |	Put my WeMo
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,840	| IOT128 |	Dimmer switch so that the product
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,608	| IOT128 |	To put in my bedroom
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,144	| IOT128 |	To my chagrin
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,704	| IOT128 |	It started blinking
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,472	| IOT128 |	Bright red
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,008	| IOT128 |	And it was very bright
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:41,056	| IOT128 |	Is a very bright LED
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:41,824	| IOT128 |	I was like oh
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| IOT128 |	Is Boogie bright red what does that mean
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,640	| IOT128 |	So at 4 a.m.
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,920	| IOT128 |	Consulting my WeMo app
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,456	| IOT128 |	What is this
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:51,040	| IOT128 |	Psycho it needs the internet's out I don't care I'm sleeping but I couldn't get back to
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,552	| IOT128 |	So I
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:52,576	| IOT128 |	A washcloth
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:54,624	| IOT128 |	Because that's how I
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,720	| IOT128 |	Where is painters tape
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:02,048	| IOT128 |	But I did find out that I could actually manually hit that
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,096	| IOT128 |	Even though I swear to God I did on that button
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,680	| IOT128 |	And it's supposed to turn it off
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:14,336	| IOT128 |	24-hours so should your I still think this is
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,152	| IOT128 |	Little baby don't have to Blink the light in
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,688	| IOT128 |	Maybe I'm sleepy
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,456	| IOT128 |	Agreed
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:22,272	| IOT128 |	If this happens to you apparently if you hit that button
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,296	| IOT128 |	It will
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,320	| IOT128 |	Turn it off for 24 hours and
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,624	| IOT128 |	You don't have to
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,440	| IOT128 |	Shuffle around for painters tape
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| IOT128 |	All right
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,512	| IOT128 |	That is all the smart
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:35,584	| IOT128 |	Dick and Let It Go
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,096	| IOT128 |	From one of our sponsor
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:41,472	| IOT128 |	Before we do stay tuned for Landon borders from big
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,776	| IOT128 |	Bleep fans I can't say the name
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,360	| IOT128 |	And still retain our PG rating on iTunes but it's
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:48,384	| IOT128 |	Big butts
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:51,968	| IOT128 |	I really don't know what
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,504	| IOT128 |	You guys fight
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,296	| IOT128 |	I like big phones and I cannot lie
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:56,576	| IOT128 |	Like big fan
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,648	| IOT128 |	You really got to sing this
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,720	| IOT128 |	Not going to happen
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,488	| IOT128 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,280	| IOT128 |	Landed is going to tell us
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:10,400	| IOT128 |	What is company learned by building a connected product all the way back in 20
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,168	| IOT128 |	T12
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:13,728	| IOT128 |	Which is you know ages ago in Internet time
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,568	| IOT128 |	Re-echo so stay tuned
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:23,968	| IOT128 |	Hey everyone we are breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:29,856	| IOT128 |	Forgerock and I have Ashley Stevenson who is the identity technology director at Fortress
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:35,488	| IOT128 |	If we're going to talk about what companies are doing with your digital identity management solution
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:40,608	| IOT128 |	So let's just get started with what you guys are doing with TomTom
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:46,496	| IOT128 |	Identity platform to secure and manage a business asset that really is becoming an increasingly hot commodity
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:50,848	| IOT128 |	These days and that is digital identity
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,872	| IOT128 |	Manager growing range
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:55,456	| IOT128 |	Including those of iot devices
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:57,504	| IOT128 |	And I need to understand the relationship
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,272	| IOT128 |	Between
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,296	| IOT128 |	Their customers
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,576	| IOT128 |	Across the different business
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,368	| IOT128 |	The spine and how they relate to those device
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,208	| IOT128 |	See this with many of our customers they had
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:08,768	| IOT128 |	Digital identity living in a lot of different places
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,816	| IOT128 |	There's a lot of different disconnected places
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,608	| IOT128 |	Which made it very difficult for them
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:17,728	| IOT128 |	Single picture of what their customer is doing what their customer needed
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:20,800	| IOT128 |	And it made it difficult for them to give their customers
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:23,104	| IOT128 |	Experience across their different offerings
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,152	| IOT128 |	So what does that mean in practice
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:32,320	| IOT128 |	They were able to connect with the Ford rock-a-dundee platform all of the different psilocybe ID
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,368	| IOT128 |	And that would enable them
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:36,416	| IOT128 |	Provide different and better service
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,440	| IOT128 |	For their customers
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,744	| IOT128 |	Single sign-on across
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,024	| IOT128 |	Services
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,072	| IOT128 |	And the ability of their
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,096	| IOT128 |	In-car device's
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:46,400	| IOT128 |	This is actually have digital identity
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:49,216	| IOT128 |	The identities of the devices
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,008	| IOT128 |	Customers
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,032	| IOT128 |	Cross all of the
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:57,920	| IOT128 |	Difference
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,712	| IOT128 |	What's the identities of the devices
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:00,736	| IOT128 |	In the cars
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:02,016	| IOT128 |	And the customers wear
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,808	| IOT128 |	And give the customer the best
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,088	| IOT128 |	Possible sign in
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:10,464	| IOT128 |	User experience possible
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,768	| IOT128 |	So what does it do to add to it
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,280	| IOT128 |	The business value
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,608	| IOT128 |	Personal single sign-on really is the culmination
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,704	| IOT128 |	We talked about on the back
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:23,264	| IOT128 |	Ties together integrated
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,544	| IOT128 |	What sites done
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,824	| IOT128 |	It really does ADD
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:28,640	| IOT128 |	Three main business benefits for the customer
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:30,176	| IOT128 |	Experience it's easier
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:32,224	| IOT128 |	It's more efficient but the other one is
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:36,064	| IOT128 |	It's more efficient not to single sign-on but bringing together all these identities
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:39,904	| IOT128 |	Springs more business efficiencies as well because now
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,672	| IOT128 |	TomTom
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:44,512	| IOT128 |	Doesn't have to try to understand their customer and their data across all the
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,304	| IOT128 |	Silo's lacrosse
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:46,816	| IOT128 |	Alien
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:52,960	| IOT128 |	They actually have a more efficient method of providing services to their customer and understanding their customer
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:54,240	| IOT128 |	Last but not least
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:57,312	| IOT128 |	Security is another large business benefit of
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,384	| IOT128 |	Single sign-on
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:04,224	| IOT128 |	Capability because it effectively reduces the attack surface
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:06,528	| IOT128 |	Compromising one of the TomTom customer
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:11,136	| IOT128 |	Because when there's only one account to authenticate and if you're up in any one of them
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:15,488	| IOT128 |	Push authentication where you don't even have a password now you only have one
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:19,328	| IOT128 |	Places open instead of 15 or even more
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,400	| IOT128 |	And where can someone go to find out more about
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:29,312	| IOT128 |	Definitely recommend for draft.com where we have this and many other case studies lots of other information about our
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:43,648	| IOT128 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:48,256	| IOT128 |	And today's guest is Landon borders who is the director of connected devices
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,424	| IOT128 |	So this large fan
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,520	| IOT128 |	I'll put it in the show notes
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,056	| IOT128 |	Landon you guys make
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:02,080	| IOT128 |	Ceiling fans
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:06,688	| IOT128 |	Residential or commercial you guys also actually have a bunch of other products
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:09,504	| IOT128 |	Right exactly you know we started as a
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,552	| IOT128 |	A company that makes large-diameter ceiling
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:15,392	| IOT128 |	Dan's but got into the lighting business and we sell lights
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:18,208	| IOT128 |	For industrial applications and for the home and
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,744	| IOT128 |	Residential ceiling fans
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:23,584	| IOT128 |	Things we do controls for our products so yeah we kind of branched out a little bit
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:26,656	| IOT128 |	All right and I first discovered you guys actually probably in the pages
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:29,472	| IOT128 |	But it was back in
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:37,152	| IOT128 |	How to say the 2013 2012 time frame when introduced
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:40,992	| IOT128 |	Haiku can you talk to me about what was going through your mind
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,272	| IOT128 |	Back in 2012
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,296	| IOT128 |	Cuz you were doing this
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,344	| IOT128 |	What were you guys thinking about
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:47,392	| IOT128 |	What was the impetus for logic this
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:52,000	| IOT128 |	What we wanted to really provide our customers was a fan that just
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,536	| IOT128 |	Knew how to keep you
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:58,656	| IOT128 |	We wanted to get rid of the pull chain we wanted to get rid of the dimmers on the wall and
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,936	| IOT128 |	We wanted a fan that was
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:02,240	| IOT128 |	Smart enough to just keep you comfortable based
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:05,312	| IOT128 |	Two ponds the room temperature whether not you were in the room
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:08,384	| IOT128 |	And so forth so that's when we launched the sense
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,688	| IOT128 |	Give me technology feature for the haiku
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,224	| IOT128 |	2014
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,272	| IOT128 |	Okay so up until 2014
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:14,784	| IOT128 |	Your products
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,320	| IOT128 |	That's correct
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:19,136	| IOT128 |	All right in this sense me though was amazing
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:25,536	| IOT128 |	Because like you said it was kind of like bringing that Nest mentality of algorithms and intelligence happening behind the scenes
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,560	| IOT128 |	To just be like oh
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,840	| IOT128 |	It's warm in here we should totally turn
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,376	| IOT128 |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:32,448	| IOT128 |	Exactly and you know really we also launched app
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,216	| IOT128 |	Control and it was
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,520	| IOT128 |	Was primarily at the time we saw that is up
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:37,056	| IOT128 |	Configuration tool
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,080	| IOT128 |	First scheduling
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,360	| IOT128 |	In setting the fan
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:41,920	| IOT128 |	Settings just as you wanted them but ultimately
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:45,760	| IOT128 |	You know our philosophy was get our users out of the app as soon as possible
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:48,320	| IOT128 |	We wanted the fan operators autonomously is pause
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,880	| IOT128 |	Batman that was actually kind of novel
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:57,280	| IOT128 |	Because I had a lot of companies I would be trying their devices
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:39:00,352	| IOT128 |	You have to remember that this launch before the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:03,424	| IOT128 |	So it came out the end of 2014 but the
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,728	| IOT128 |	Voice control for smart home devices
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,008	| IOT128 |	March or April
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,824	| IOT128 |	I just got to set the stage for ever
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,128	| IOT128 |	All right so back in this history
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,176	| IOT128 |	And what happened
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,456	| IOT128 |	What
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,480	| IOT128 |	Did you learn
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:16,992	| IOT128 |	From this process
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:18,784	| IOT128 |	Yes we launched
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,832	| IOT128 |	The sense me feature
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:27,232	| IOT128 |	And it wasn't for us it was never a you know we're going to launch this and make it available to our customers and then
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:32,608	| IOT128 |	And that's just what it is we had a very ambitious roadmap we were working on Partnerships with
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:34,400	| IOT128 |	Companies like nest and others
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:37,216	| IOT128 |	We had a plan and we wanted to
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,496	| IOT128 |	Continue building and can
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,032	| IOT128 |	Continue providing value
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:40,800	| IOT128 |	To darkest
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:45,152	| IOT128 |	Tremors through software updates and through the launch of
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:45,920	| IOT128 |	Integration
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:47,200	| IOT128 |	As frequently as
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:47,968	| IOT128 |	Sweets office
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,016	| IOT128 |	So that's exactly what happened
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:51,296	| IOT128 |	And you guys were also
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:53,856	| IOT128 |	As soon as part of your roadmap but you actually helped
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| IOT128 |	With the development of
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,416	| IOT128 |	The thread protocol
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:40:00,256	| IOT128 |	Which is a wireless protocol with nest in Samsung
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,536	| IOT128 |	Now
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:03,072	| IOT128 |	Your first sense me did not have
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,656	| IOT128 |	But how did that go and how did that align
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:10,240	| IOT128 |	Yeah it was all part of our strategy
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,544	| IOT128 |	And we works with nest
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:15,104	| IOT128 |	What's the early stages actually pre-acquisition
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:17,152	| IOT128 |	And as you noted we shared
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,944	| IOT128 |	Very similar philosophies
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:19,968	| IOT128 |	Somehow these products
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,992	| IOT128 |	Working operate
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,272	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:26,112	| IOT128 |	We got to understand the vision For Thread and how it relates to the home
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,904	| IOT128 |	So we invested
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:28,928	| IOT128 |	Eveleigh in
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,696	| IOT128 |	Helping to
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,464	| IOT128 |	Develop
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,000	| IOT128 |	That specifications
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:34,048	| IOT128 |	I believe it's red just was
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,328	| IOT128 |	Wildly amazing
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| IOT128 |	In terms of
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:37,632	| IOT128 |	Membership and in terms of
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,400	| IOT128 |	Contribution
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:40,704	| IOT128 |	So that was a pretty amazing adventure
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:42,496	| IOT128 |	Okay thread has not exactly
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:47,360	| IOT128 |	I know the formal specification took awhile to come out but it's been out for about a year
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:50,688	| IOT128 |	And I still don't see a lot of thread
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,456	| IOT128 |	Products
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,224	| IOT128 |	Does that disappoint
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:54,272	| IOT128 |	Yes or no
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:56,320	| IOT128 |	I mean I'm very proud of the work
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,344	| IOT128 |	That's thread group
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,904	| IOT128 |	Put into building the specification
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,952	| IOT128 |	I think the technology is great
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:03,232	| IOT128 |	It's designed
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:06,560	| IOT128 |	Quite well by a lot of very smart people but
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:09,376	| IOT128 |	Thread is more analogous to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,680	| IOT128 |	Then it is to Bluetooth in what I mean is
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,704	| IOT128 |	Frozen Network
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:14,752	| IOT128 |	Lair
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:18,848	| IOT128 |	Templates the networking layer stack only it does not contemplate the application
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:22,432	| IOT128 |	An application layer is what end users
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:24,992	| IOT128 |	Understand and know so I think
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:27,552	| IOT128 |	One of the reasons why adoption is not
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:31,904	| IOT128 |	Widespread is that this industry is still trying to solve for the
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,952	| IOT128 |	Unified application layer
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:37,536	| IOT128 |	Problem if you will and so there appears to be a convergence
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,304	| IOT128 |	Chinese ecosystem
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,096	| IOT128 |	Such as the one
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,888	| IOT128 |	Provided by Amazon
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,656	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,192	| IOT128 |	Google home and
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,472	| IOT128 |	Homekit but
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:50,080	| IOT128 |	Again the adoption of those ecosystems if you will don't include
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:51,872	| IOT128 |	Fred as of yet so
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:52,895	| IOT128 |	Because that's just
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,431	| IOT128 |	My opinion is that
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,455	| IOT128 |	You'll see
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:57,247	| IOT128 |	Larger or widespread adoption
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:42:01,087	| IOT128 |	Kenneth read once it includes or is included by those he goes to
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:04,159	| IOT128 |	Well maybe the new Echo will have a
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:06,207	| IOT128 |	Thread radio eyes closed
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:06,975	| IOT128 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:09,791	| IOT128 |	So let's talk about your CEO did an article
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,095	| IOT128 |	The Harvard Business Review that I read in
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:14,143	| IOT128 |	I said I was part of my newsletter in a lot of other people
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:17,983	| IOT128 |	And he basically we're talking about the lessons you learned
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,751	| IOT128 |	From connecting
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:24,639	| IOT128 |	Your products with this idea that not all of your consumers really wanted
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,919	| IOT128 |	Connectivity so
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:29,503	| IOT128 |	Is it only half of your users actually use some of the sense miracle
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,271	| IOT128 |	Connected options
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:34,111	| IOT128 |	Yeah that's correct so at roughly half and
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:36,159	| IOT128 |	As I mentioned we were
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,695	| IOT128 |	Extremely proud of
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:43,071	| IOT128 |	Listen to me products that we launched and we continue to build and introduce new features
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:46,143	| IOT128 |	As time went on and what we decided was
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:48,191	| IOT128 |	Well you know these
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,215	| IOT128 |	Other half
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:49,983	| IOT128 |	Of our customer
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:50,751	| IOT128 |	Base they would
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:55,103	| IOT128 |	Really appreciate these features to and use them if only they had access
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,663	| IOT128 |	Rather than
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:59,711	| IOT128 |	Charge extra for them let's just make this
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:03,295	| IOT128 |	Standard offering in all of our Haiku fans
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:05,343	| IOT128 |	I thought that was great now
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:08,159	| IOT128 |	You also talked about the adoption curve like
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:10,207	| IOT128 |	Who is getting curious
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,743	| IOT128 |	If you can talk a little bit more about
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:15,327	| IOT128 |	That's because like for ceiling fans are really interesting product
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:17,119	| IOT128 |	Me because they are something consumers
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,399	| IOT128 |	Yours are
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:19,423	| IOT128 |	Kind of expensive
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:20,191	| IOT128 |	But there
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:20,959	| IOT128 |	Well worth it
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:22,751	| IOT128 |	But I haven't installed them
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:26,079	| IOT128 |	Because it's a big job and I already have some that work just fine and
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,359	| IOT128 |	Extra
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,127	| IOT128 |	Seamlessness
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,663	| IOT128 |	Is it really work
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:33,759	| IOT128 |	No so I'm curious where your other customer
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,551	| IOT128 |	Why you think they are
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:36,831	| IOT128 |	Adopting the
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,367	| IOT128 |	Quite as rapidly
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:40,415	| IOT128 |	I think what we learned
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:43,487	| IOT128 |	You know cuz we made this a standard feature the beginning a toy
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,535	| IOT128 |	In launch today
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,303	| IOT128 |	CES
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:50,143	| IOT128 |	But since then what we've learned is that nothing has really changed the p
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,935	| IOT128 |	People that really want these
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:55,519	| IOT128 |	Smart features on our products are the ones that use the mullet
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,543	| IOT128 |	And there's
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:59,359	| IOT128 |	Just a large portion of our customer base that
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:43:59,871	| IOT128 |	Values
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:03,199	| IOT128 |	The beauty of the fan that values the energy efficient
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:08,319	| IOT128 |	And all these other features of the fan that make it a great product less the technology
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:13,183	| IOT128 |	I think in hindsight and when you read this article that's the message that were really trying to
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:13,695	| IOT128 |	I convey here
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:14,975	| IOT128 |	Is that thrust
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,767	| IOT128 |	This is a feature that we build we thoughts
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:20,095	| IOT128 |	Your people had it they would adopt it but in hindsight is just
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:21,375	| IOT128 |	Some people don't want the tech.
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:25,983	| IOT128 |	And which is fine with David are we still value those customers just as much as any other
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:27,519	| IOT128 |	Of course
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:29,055	| IOT128 |	Unlike your ceiling fans
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,079	| IOT128 |	So exact
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:34,175	| IOT128 |	This is another element of connected products that I think a lot of people
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:36,735	| IOT128 |	Belt connector products may be ignored it
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,271	| IOT128 |	First but this idea that
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:43,647	| IOT128 |	If I buy a ceiling fan I expected to last for a really long time which includes maybe software update
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,439	| IOT128 |	It's overtime if I'm using those pictures
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:49,023	| IOT128 |	So would you change anything differently and maybe it's
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:51,839	| IOT128 |	Budgeting for software development over a 10-year life
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:55,679	| IOT128 |	Maybe it's introducing a an expiration date for software updates I don't know
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:58,495	| IOT128 |	Anything about the business of building a Connect
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,543	| IOT128 |	Good product that you've learned in your life
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:02,079	| IOT128 |	We should adapt this way
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:03,103	| IOT128 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:05,151	| IOT128 |	Let's face it we are at Midwestern
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,431	| IOT128 |	Product,
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:07,711	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:08,479	| IOT128 |	This was
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,527	| IOT128 |	Speedo blue ocean for many of us
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:13,343	| IOT128 |	And we know we're isolated from binos
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:17,695	| IOT128 |	The San Francisco technology braintrust and we're learning a lot of things
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,975	| IOT128 |	As we went along
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:22,815	| IOT128 |	And you don't understanding where the market wood trim to and
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:26,143	| IOT128 |	Cost of the technology over time as we
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:31,775	| IOT128 |	In the background you know pay for PRI AWS bill
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:37,151	| IOT128 |	And so forth right so I'd say that we didn't have good foresight into that but we certainly do now
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:39,455	| IOT128 |	I know by the way that market is changing
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:41,503	| IOT128 |	Quite a bit right it's getting a lot less
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:43,039	| IOT128 |	Expensive for manufacture
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,319	| IOT128 |	Like ourselves
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:48,415	| IOT128 |	I think we wouldn't change much I think actually our philosophies
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,183	| IOT128 |	Still a great
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:54,047	| IOT128 |	And I think the only thing that we would change in hindsight would be to just simply
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:56,607	| IOT128 |	Make this feature available to the people that want
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:59,679	| IOT128 |	What's in the people that don't we still have a great product and then
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:00,703	| IOT128 |	You know I think that
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,727	| IOT128 |	A very unique
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,519	| IOT128 |	Approach to this Market
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:06,079	| IOT128 |	What does it mean to say make
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,871	| IOT128 |	That feature available to those who want
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:10,687	| IOT128 |	I know that you guys talked about making only one
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,711	| IOT128 |	All of your products are
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:18,623	| IOT128 |	Because otherwise you're carrying different skews in that's complicated so what is it mean when you say
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:22,463	| IOT128 |	We talked about the modularity of our
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:25,791	| IOT128 |	And we designed them in a way such that
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:26,815	| IOT128 |	The technology
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,863	| IOT128 |	You can be easily added or removed
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,143	| IOT128 |	The technology that
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,167	| IOT128 |	Ads cost
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:32,703	| IOT128 |	Basically to the product
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,239	| IOT128 |	Sofa manufacturers
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,007	| IOT128 |	Perspective
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:39,871	| IOT128 |	As our products are going down the assembly line theoretically then we can add a removed
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:42,175	| IOT128 |	This technology before it goes right custom
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:43,199	| IOT128 |	Send it doing this
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:45,247	| IOT128 |	The customers that want these features
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:48,063	| IOT128 |	We can provide those to them by just simply adding
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:49,343	| IOT128 |	This module
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,903	| IOT128 |	If you will and then those that don't want it
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:54,463	| IOT128 |	Just get the same product when I'm less the technology
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:56,767	| IOT128 |	So we see that taking this modular
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:58,815	| IOT128 |	Approach works really well for our cus
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:00,351	| IOT128 |	Got it
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:02,399	| IOT128 |	Have you changed to start doing
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:05,983	| IOT128 |	Yeah it's been a work-in-progress you know starting with
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,519	| IOT128 |	BL series fan that we launched
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:08,031	| IOT128 |	26
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,311	| IOT128 |	Superstar to take
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:14,943	| IOT128 |	Approaching not to give away too much but we've ever as you might expect lots of products in development
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:18,783	| IOT128 |	And have been taking this approach to designing New Prague
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:20,831	| IOT128 |	Over the course of the past several months
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:24,671	| IOT128 |	And there's an idea about you guys had
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:26,719	| IOT128 |	Common in there about dealing with customers
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:27,743	| IOT128 |	And customer service
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:29,791	| IOT128 |	So what have you learned
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:36,191	| IOT128 |	Has you've introduced
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,215	| IOT128 |	It's starting to come into
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:37,983	| IOT128 |	To the market a little
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,519	| IOT128 |	What if you learned there
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:42,335	| IOT128 |	Well starting with your first question
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,359	| IOT128 |	Regarding
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:45,407	| IOT128 |	Customer service
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:46,687	| IOT128 |	I think some Growing Pains
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:47,967	| IOT128 |	The early days
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:50,527	| IOT128 |	We had to become networking experts here
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:52,575	| IOT128 |	But you know that was anticipated
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,087	| IOT128 |	When did we adapt
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,879	| IOT128 |	Quite well to that
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,159	| IOT128 |	But of course you know there's a
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:56,927	| IOT128 |	Expense associated
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,975	| IOT128 |	But we have a very unique
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:47:59,999	| IOT128 |	Sales Channel
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,279	| IOT128 |	Soho cigar products
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,047	| IOT128 |	Sold directly
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:02,815	| IOT128 |	You are customer
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:05,631	| IOT128 |	So as a product developer such as myself
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:07,167	| IOT128 |	That provides us with
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:09,471	| IOT128 |	Very direct feedback to and from our cost
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:10,751	| IOT128 |	What we've learned
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:14,079	| IOT128 |	To do and to value is to really invest in
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:14,591	| IOT128 |	The customer
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:18,431	| IOT128 |	And we're in at because of our unique position we can
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:19,711	| IOT128 |	Can do that and adapt
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,991	| IOT128 |	Quickly whereas
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:22,527	| IOT128 |	List lot of manufacturers in the
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:24,575	| IOT128 |	Space really rely on retail partner
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:26,111	| IOT128 |	So they lose that connection
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:28,671	| IOT128 |	As a customer start
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:30,975	| IOT128 |	Using Integrations how does that change
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:32,255	| IOT128 |	Customer service
EDL	00:48:34,047	00:48:35,327	| IOT128 |	It probably does
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:37,119	| IOT128 |	Yeah it does
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:40,191	| IOT128 |	So you know we did launch our integration
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:41,471	| IOT128 |	Chicken with Amazon
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:42,239	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,007	| IOT128 |	The Voice
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:45,311	| IOT128 |	Control features in again it was
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:46,079	| IOT128 |	Huge success
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:49,663	| IOT128 |	For us and our customers loved it and in fact
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:51,711	| IOT128 |	They use it a lot more than we
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:55,039	| IOT128 |	Originally anticipated to control our fans and lights in the
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,319	| IOT128 |	That mean it's quite amazing
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:59,647	| IOT128 |	So that he knows we course correct when these types of things happen in
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:01,183	| IOT128 |	When we look to invest in
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:04,511	| IOT128 |	And similar Integrations as you might expect
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:06,047	| IOT128 |	Now let's homekit
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:12,447	| IOT128 |	Specifically you know that is as I mentioned before we have this direct line if you will try our customers and that is something
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,471	| IOT128 |	Thing that are customers
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:14,239	| IOT128 |	Want
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:16,031	| IOT128 |	And ask for a lot
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:17,823	| IOT128 |	But frankly it's not been
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:18,847	| IOT128 |	Azizi
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:19,871	| IOT128 |	To develop
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:20,895	| IOT128 |	Homekit integration
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:22,175	| IOT128 |	As it has been
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:22,687	| IOT128 |	For sale
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,735	| IOT128 |	Nestor the Amazon
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,527	| IOT128 |	The integration
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:29,343	| IOT128 |	Is complicated I guess for manufacturers and
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:31,647	| IOT128 |	I would venture to guess that's why you haven't
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,671	| IOT128 |	Cny
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:33,183	| IOT128 |	Brand adoption
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:35,487	| IOT128 |	At home care by other similar me
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:41,631	| IOT128 |	Okay yeah well I was Casino, kid it seems that there is kind of a moving Target
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:43,423	| IOT128 |	And it feels like just
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:46,495	| IOT128 |	Recently we got a lot of good news from Apple
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:47,775	| IOT128 |	Quit home-based voice can
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:49,567	| IOT128 |	Supposed to just Siri Bay
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:52,895	| IOT128 |	On the phone this
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,687	| IOT128 |	Doesn't have to be a hardware Serta
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:55,455	| IOT128 |	Vacation ship
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:57,759	| IOT128 |	Was I think a big deal for companies for like
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:00,831	| IOT128 |	Modular home kits Pacific lines
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:03,647	| IOT128 |	Terrible so it feels like that's been
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:04,415	| IOT128 |	A bit of a moving toy
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:06,207	| IOT128 |	Yeah I think that's
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:09,791	| IOT128 |	Fair to say it has been but you know just as well
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:11,071	| IOT128 |	Everyone's learning center
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:14,143	| IOT128 |	Exactly what I was going to say and even here just is
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:16,191	| IOT128 |	The little guys if you will like us or learning
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:18,751	| IOT128 |	On the way does the big guys are too and
EDL	00:50:18,751	00:50:19,519	| IOT128 |	Dark Horse correct
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:21,311	| IOT128 |	That's just how this
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,079	| IOT128 |	Is going to evolve
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:25,919	| IOT128 |	So how do you build a product that's flexible enough to
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:26,687	| IOT128 |	Course correct
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:32,063	| IOT128 |	Because I do think in the past and even going forward I think we're still we are not at the finals
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:34,623	| IOT128 |	Someone who's got a
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:37,183	| IOT128 |	Like a semi-permanent install in someone's home
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:41,279	| IOT128 |	How do you build a product is flexible enough to handle that course correction Dothan
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:42,815	| IOT128 |	Hardware but also in software
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:46,143	| IOT128 |	You hit the nail on the head you have to treat both of those
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:47,167	| IOT128 |	Differently in
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:48,191	| IOT128 |	You have to have strategies
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:52,287	| IOT128 |	And so on the software side I think that
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:55,103	| IOT128 |	Companies like ourselves and most iot
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:58,687	| IOT128 |	Companies provide a means for updating the software in their Prime
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:01,247	| IOT128 |	Typically over the Internet or through an app
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:02,783	| IOT128 |	I think that's how you
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:04,063	| IOT128 |	Accommodate
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:04,831	| IOT128 |	Implants
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:05,599	| IOT128 |	Tour
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:07,135	| IOT128 |	The future on the software
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:09,439	| IOT128 |	But the more difficult
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:11,487	| IOT128 |	Thing to plan for is only Hardware
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:15,071	| IOT128 |	So it wasn't that long ago that we all had
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:17,119	| IOT128 |	802. 11 B
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:18,399	| IOT128 |	Wi-Fi routers that are
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:20,191	| IOT128 |	Our home and those are now obsolete
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:22,239	| IOT128 |	And then you have other technology such as
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:25,055	| IOT128 |	Just thread that are up-and-coming and you know how do you plan for that
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:25,823	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:26,591	| IOT128 |	For us
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:27,359	| IOT128 |	Especially
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:30,687	| IOT128 |	Our company the products that we still have very long
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,199	| IOT128 |	Life cycle
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:34,527	| IOT128 |	And are warranties are conducive to that
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:35,295	| IOT128 |	So
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:36,831	| IOT128 |	We have to be thinking 30 years
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:37,855	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,391	| IOT128 |	With the way that we've
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:40,671	| IOT128 |	Accommodated
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:42,463	| IOT128 |	The hardware that I've it is
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:44,255	| IOT128 |	By taking this modular approach
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:45,791	| IOT128 |	You know just as
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:46,559	| IOT128 |	We can
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:50,143	| IOT128 |	Add a remove this Hardware feature in our product
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:53,215	| IOT128 |	Internet on the assembly line we've done it in a way that
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:54,751	| IOT128 |	It's simple for customers
EDL	00:51:54,751	00:51:56,287	| IOT128 |	To do that so that
EDL	00:51:56,287	00:51:57,823	| IOT128 |	If yours to come the neck
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:52:00,639	| IOT128 |	Great networking protocol comes out than week
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:02,175	| IOT128 |	Develop that
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:05,759	| IOT128 |	Portion of the hardware and shipped to our customers that I want
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:13,183	| IOT128 |	Okay that makes sense no a 30-year warranty on the hardware are you prepared to offer like 30 years worth of likes
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:13,951	| IOT128 |	Security update
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:14,463	| IOT128 |	For those fans
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:17,279	| IOT128 |	I'll just so that our sales team
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:18,303	| IOT128 |	Doesn't kill me
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:19,071	| IOT128 |	For saying that
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:21,119	| IOT128 |	Sitar lifecycle I mean
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:22,143	| IOT128 |	Fans are expected
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:22,911	| IOT128 |	The last 30
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:25,727	| IOT128 |	But our warranty is
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:27,007	| IOT128 |	15 year war
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:28,287	| IOT128 |	So
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:29,311	| IOT128 |	I wanted to clarify
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:32,383	| IOT128 |	I don't get in trouble
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:33,663	| IOT128 |	15
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:35,711	| IOT128 |	All right
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:41,855	| IOT128 |	Warranty on these things doesn't mean you're going to warranty or software you guys have plans to update and do all of that
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:44,927	| IOT128 |	We're still all in
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:46,463	| IOT128 |	And you know our plan is to
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:47,231	| IOT128 |	Continue.
EDL	00:52:47,231	00:52:48,255	| IOT128 |	Support these customers
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,023	| IOT128 |	And
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:54,911	| IOT128 |	They are the products that they bought and they know as of right now I don't we have no other plans other than
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:55,935	| IOT128 |	N to continue to
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:57,215	| IOT128 |	Support these customers
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:53:00,543	| IOT128 |	Provide software updates as the world around us changes as
EDL	00:53:01,311	00:53:02,335	| IOT128 |	There's new iOS
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:06,431	| IOT128 |	Update or new networking updates we continue to
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:08,223	| IOT128 |	Provide that extra value.
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:08,735	| IOT128 |	Our customers
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:10,783	| IOT128 |	Okay that's a tall order
EDL	00:53:10,783	00:53:12,319	| IOT128 |	Because like if I think about you guys
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:13,855	| IOT128 |	Just spending
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:15,647	| IOT128 |	$3 a year
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:16,927	| IOT128 |	On AWS for a
EDL	00:53:17,695	00:53:19,999	| IOT128 |	Example or 8
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:21,279	| IOT128 |	87 million fans
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:23,327	| IOT128 |	You've got a $3000000 line-item
EDL	00:53:23,327	00:53:24,095	| IOT128 |	Every year
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:24,607	| IOT128 |	For the next 50
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:26,655	| IOT128 |	And that feels
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:27,167	| IOT128 |	I don't know
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:29,215	| IOT128 |	Balance sheet
EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:30,495	| IOT128 |	Cuz your private company
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:31,519	| IOT128 |	I feel significant
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:34,591	| IOT128 |	Yeah well you know it's not for everyone
EDL	00:53:34,591	00:53:35,871	| IOT128 |	And you know IR
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:39,455	| IOT128 |	Again premium fans that were selling to our customers in
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:39,967	| IOT128 |	Materials
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:41,247	| IOT128 |	And Technology
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:42,527	| IOT128 |	And performance
EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:45,087	| IOT128 |	And so you know we have that affordance
EDL	00:53:45,087	00:53:46,879	| IOT128 |	But you know if we were
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:48,927	| IOT128 |	Not to pick on anybody but if we were
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:51,743	| IOT128 |	Selling at a light bulb then that's a whole different ball game
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:59,935	| IOT128 |	So maybe it's a different ball game but they have the market will dictate what they're willing to pay for these products and
EDL	00:53:59,935	00:54:03,519	| IOT128 |	I think we've all seen the smart light bulb market is
EDL	00:54:03,519	00:54:05,311	| IOT128 |	Continue to go down in price
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:08,383	| IOT128 |	And more manufacturers have gotten to that game
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:12,223	| IOT128 |	It may not make sense for those companies to offer that level of support for that.
EDL	00:54:13,759	00:54:16,319	| IOT128 |	Alright Linda take so much for coming on the show this
