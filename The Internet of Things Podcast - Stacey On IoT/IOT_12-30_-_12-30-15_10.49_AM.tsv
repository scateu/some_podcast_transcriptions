EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:28,928	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	SIM lighting Products
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:30,720	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But I am really excited about
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:32,256	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So let's get with the show
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:36,864	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Kevin you want to start out with your psychic prediction that has since come true
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:40,192	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I do not want to say I told you so but
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:45,312	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You know I won't it's funny because my kids always say I'm from the future I was
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:47,104	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Predict things and then
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:50,432	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	How many personal things you can get most of them right at some point.
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:53,760	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I might remember when it was but I could have sworn I said
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:57,856	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I don't want any more of these smart home hubs hanging off my routers
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:01:00,672	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We got only screens in the house all these TVs why not just
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,720	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Put the Smart Home
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:04,768	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Hugs in the TVs
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:05,792	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Guess what
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:08,608	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Samsung is going to do that in 2016
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:11,680	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	They are integrating smart hubs right into their
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:15,520	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	4K TVs that are 1080p
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:21,664	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If there s UHD TV so it sounds to me like it's all 4K TVs not 1080p is but
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:28,064	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Doesn't matter I want one I'm super excited by this and we need to talk about what it means we found some tidbits
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:29,600	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	After the announcement earlier today
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,696	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Tidbits and we should say this is a very specific hub
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:34,464	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It is
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,232	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Samsung
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:36,768	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Hug which we all know and love
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,792	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Incall
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,840	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,400	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Alright so
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,472	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Let's go with tidbit that was tidbit number one
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,776	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	This is the SmartThings Hub you can
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,056	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:53,664	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It's actually the SmartThings software and to get this inside your television
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,200	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	What must you do
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,296	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Will you have to buy a 2016 television personal
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:02,624	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Second of all this is kind of interesting
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:05,184	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Samsung is going to offer a
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,976	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Free USB adapter
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,536	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It's called the SmartThings extend and
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:16,192	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Before the show station I were not sure what that was going to be or how much was going to cost we've just said it's free so now we know it's free
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:22,336	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Interesting way it's going to add the ability to Monitor and control zigbee and Z-Wave devices from your TV
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:26,688	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So what's inside the TV radio wise does not include zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,712	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:32,576	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You had this little USB dongle and 212 to the compatible TV that is
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,112	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And you'll be able to
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Work with zigbee and Z-Wave devices
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,184	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yay
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:40,256	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That's if you if you care about that so
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:44,352	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	In a lot of ways zigbee and Z-Wave are going to be kind of the Legacy Smart Home
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,632	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Radios
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,168	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Even even though
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Smart things guys will say
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:52,544	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,104	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So the TV will have the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:58,176	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And I bet it has Bluetooth to
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:01,248	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Oh I thought I would would not doubt at 1 for one second
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:04,064	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So yeah cuz the V2 of the SmartThings Hub has
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,600	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Z-Wave zigbee
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,624	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Wi-Fi Bluetooth
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And I believe it has a spot
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,720	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Or has a dongle break
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,232	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Unplugging
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Cellular
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,048	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,584	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	With all of that
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:20,192	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Applaud the sin and you got the SmartThings soft
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:26,080	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And what were unclear on right now is if it's running tizen which is the operating system
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Samsung uses on it
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:27,872	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	TVs
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,432	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And we're trying to figure out if
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:32,224	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The current generation of
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:32,992	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	SmartThings
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,272	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Hubs runs ties
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,088	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because way back when it was
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Announce
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,624	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Lafayette
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It wasn't an ounce
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,720	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is it like the SmartThings Hub was
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,232	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Running tights
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,536	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	They wanted to move to
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:54,240	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That's that's my educated guess is that the current SmartThings Hub does not run on tizen
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,056	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You can call it Legacy software from
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:59,872	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	When before SmartThings was bought by Samsung
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,920	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You and I are at the big gay
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:08,064	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Iot keynote sing last year at CVS where Samsung was on stage and Tyson was going to save the world
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:11,904	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Can let all our devices talk to each other my guess is that
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,952	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Samsung spent 2015
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,488	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Getting that ready
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,768	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,303	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I know the TVs are on tizen
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,095	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I also know that
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:25,471	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm expecting that tizen version 3.0 the next version of tizen will be out
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Next month
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:31,359	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	After CS is what I'm hearing but that wouldn't preclude a CES announcement obviously so
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,127	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm thinking
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,919	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The new
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:39,551	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Call the new SmartThings platform for better word is going to be tizen-based
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,855	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Right so tizen hopefully 300
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Will soon come out
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,927	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And we'll see that
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,463	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Running
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,255	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Auntie Dee's and
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,815	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,839	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Exciting
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,351	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Will get
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,167	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	For people like Kevin who hate hugs
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,215	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You will soon have to buy only this
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,983	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Samsung
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,543	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	S UHD what is the used
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,895	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Ultra that that's why I'm picking it up
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:08,223	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yeah that's why I'm thinking it's
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:15,903	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That's why I'm thinking it's going to be the 4K TVs actually Can Shed a little more light on that just now as I'm re-reading what they put out today
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,719	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Let me say this out loud for Dragon celebrities
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,511	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because actually have two things here
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:23,327	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We're excited to announce that all 26

EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:36,127	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And all s UHD TVs which is the 4K set
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:41,759	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Will have iot Hub technology so the TV can become the heart of your smartphone
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,783	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	A slightly different
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:48,671	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Oh okay so it sounds like for one of them they will be the Hub and the other one was sounds like it will be
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,463	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Become integrator because
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:50,975	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Comparto
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Got it
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,327	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That is so true
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,631	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	2 related answers with their TVs and iot
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,935	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Okay and it sounds like
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,727	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You probably will then be able to

EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,063	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Teens
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:19,647	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You can also get notifications on that sucker when important thing
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,415	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Things happen
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:24,255	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	2nd Annual connected cameras right on your TV

EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,559	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Devices for me
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:28,863	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Fancy
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:33,727	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So the forecast Wednesday when they get
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,519	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If your SmartThings
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,311	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If you're not a smart thing
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:38,847	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Okay
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Okay
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:42,431	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Let's take a moment here and just Lament The fact
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Did the sounds really great
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,015	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,551	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It also sucks
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Here is why
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,367	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Tell me why
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:50,879	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:55,743	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We and I have seen this I have seen this dream come to fruition
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,279	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	In labs
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	With all join
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,119	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And other Open Standards
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,423	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	223 years ago
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,239	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Where all of this was happening
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:10,591	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And things were whizzing around my house through invisible radio waves and software
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,639	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Open Standards
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,711	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Years ago
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,991	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It it's not coming
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,503	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Troop
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,831	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But there's a difference there's a difference here
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:26,975	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I agree with you that the Open Standards and and SmartThings it's all very similar to All Join
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:31,839	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	What all joints didn't have and what Samsung does have is it also owns the hardware side of things
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,935	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Right we'll see in this gets into this can get into
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,959	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If we want to talk about
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,239	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:38,751	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Why
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,311	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Why this is fundamentally broken
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,335	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Thing 1
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,455	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yes I got some data heading into CES
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	From
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,247	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Let's see this is
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,343	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Parks Associates is saying that 43% of people next year
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	43%
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,207	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	People in the US will buy a smart device
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,743	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	In the next year
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,791	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I want to tell all those people
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,303	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	No Doubt
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,703	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Different kind of counter to our show
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,263	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I usually don't do that
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,543	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So because
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:18,431	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You are about to set yourself up what was happening right now is everybody is creating these.
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:23,807	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Please lock and standards that we've talked about we talked about for three years we talked about it last episode with friends a few
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,855	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:28,927	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We're about to talk about it now because this is very much on my mind
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:35,327	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Going into CS where we're about to see a lot of other walled Gardens
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,607	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Being built
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,447	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:44,799	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	With Samsung what they're doing is I know that last year at CES
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,591	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	They got to her
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Their CEO got up and
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:51,199	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Did this wonderful everything must be open presentation and
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,247	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm sure he still feels that way
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:59,135	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But that is not what's being built right here this is very much a hay
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,463	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I got a Samsung TV that's going to work with tizen
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:07,071	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And a hug that also will it possibly eventually run tizen
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,351	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And everything
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	What happened on this TV
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,447	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,287	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It is very frustrating for me
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Soap
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,407	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	6 best rating for everybody it's it's one of the biggest challenges that
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:26,783	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Smart Homes in iot devices really have them in your right way I'm not going to rehash it cuz we talked about this
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:30,367	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I don't say every episode but darn it comes up on off alot how
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,903	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	There are just too many
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:38,303	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Competing call them standards if you will that competing efforts by different companies in groups
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,327	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Companies in
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,631	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And Kickstarter projects and so on that
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,399	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Want to
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,191	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Give you the solution but
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:47,519	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If they're not going to play nice with others if there is a lock-in
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,103	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	2 to a large degree still on next it's frustrating as all get-out
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:55,199	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So there's an interesting perspective out there and I want to draw your attention to it audience
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,247	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'll put it in the show notes but Bruce scheiner
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,551	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Read about it over the Atlantic
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,599	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And he'd kind of drawers
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:06,207	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	He talks about this he talks about in relation to Hugh he talks about in relation to John Deere's
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,023	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Tractors where they're trying to send
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:15,423	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	On the software associated with this and Keurigs coe's on their their pots and dram
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:20,287	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And he blames the Digital Millennium Copyright Act which I thought was really crazy
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,591	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,895	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Whose theory is
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,735	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is that
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:32,319	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And I'll just I'll just read part of his his theory here
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:37,695	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Stop competitors just reverse engineering the proprietary standard and making compatible peripherals
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:42,559	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	For example another Coffee manufacturer put in Keurig codes on their own pods
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:46,911	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	These companies rely on a 1998 law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,191	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The dcma

EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,847	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Well it hasn't done a lot of good in that regard
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is anyone who

EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because we're
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,391	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because we have

EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,279	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And then we also see that we want them to connect
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:23,679	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	There are enough products out there that are starting to be on the market

EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,775	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It has some form of
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,287	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Intelligence
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,383	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm going to say the Bluetooth felt more like a gimmick
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,407	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Than anything
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,455	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	One because it didn't connect
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,223	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Anything else
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:24,319	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If Phillips wants to make it connect to other things it could be maybe better
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:30,463	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Like maybe if it wants to connect to my jaw bone to be like most aces up
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,743	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Turn on the coffee machine
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,815	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Although this thing heats up in a matter of like
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,583	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Less than a minute
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,607	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:39,167	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I don't really need it to like
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,215	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I mean it's not like a huge weight for coffee
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:47,871	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Still be nice to like connected to if this then that and set up a trigger on the echo.and
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:51,199	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Same can you make me a cup of coffee and by the time you get downstairs
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:54,015	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Ready that's true I would also like to be my echo Jeeves
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,063	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because that would be amazing
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,111	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Cousin Augustine Cheves
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Make me a cup of coffee
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,207	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	All right while I'm dreaming
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,255	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So yes if all that happens
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:04,767	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That would be
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:12,959	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But that doesn't happen the best thing about it the Bluetooth is that it gives you access to the app
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,775	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And the app does make it easier
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,055	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Then that it has a
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,103	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It hasn't LED touch screen
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,151	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,967	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	There's a lot of buttons you can press there's like
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,759	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I think 16 total drinks you can make
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:31,135	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	There is a kind of a lot to do on the touch-screen although you can do it
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,159	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	All from the
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,183	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Touch screen
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,207	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That's fine
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,767	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Doing it from the app is a little bit easier
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,047	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,095	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If you can't find your phone
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,863	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You're kind of like
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,935	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If you're like myself and don't always have your phone on you
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,751	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You may kind of be like
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,543	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You gotta do not want to run back upstairs and
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:56,991	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I like the app cuz it's got pretty little pictures of all the drinks so if you're not sure what it's called you can just do it by sight if that's the one
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,551	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yes Andrew is Daffy drinks
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:01,343	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	From the app you can be like
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:07,743	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Oh this needs to be much stronger or I need more milk or I need less milk or I need less coffee any more coffee
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,255	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yeah I did this
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It's very much fun
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:10,815	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,863	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So but it also feels kind of like
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,911	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Do I need the Bluetooth
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,191	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:21,055	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Maybe not but let me did you know if they sell egg
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,615	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Similar non-bluetooth Edition like you have you
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,919	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	They do and I'm curious what the price differences
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,199	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,991	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Do you think I would know
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,271	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But I don't know
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,831	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You can like
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,647	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The thing is that they come out with new models all the time
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:39,231	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yeah no like you could probably buy last year's model
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,767	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Very similar features for like
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,047	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Much less
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,095	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,911	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Where you could buy like a giraffe or a
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,935	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	DeLonghi
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:53,055	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We're getting into it we're getting into clock
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,823	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,847	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If you're if you really want
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:58,175	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Today's high-end really amazing connected coffee maker
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,479	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The coffee on this
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,247	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is consistent
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It makes it has a nice
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,599	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Crema Crema
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:10,207	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The little the little foamy stuff on top of your espresso is nice
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:12,511	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I will say that the flat white was not good
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:13,791	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,839	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The flat white not gray
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,607	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Cappuccino
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,399	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Good the latte
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:23,007	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	People ask me if they wanted me to test it with almond milk
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Soy milk
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,287	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Skim milk
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,847	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So I did those
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:28,383	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It's Frost all of them
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:33,247	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It didn't do as good as the job as it did with whole milk
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:38,111	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I don't drink those milks normally so they all tasted pretty bad to me
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:41,439	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because I just don't drink them
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:48,351	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Whole milk or nothing for me
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,911	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Kind of nice but it still tastes too kind of watery like an almond milk
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,191	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Short
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,751	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So what if you like almond milk it tasted
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,287	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Like toasted almond
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Belk in the drink so
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,967	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm going to stick with my Nespresso
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,063	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So the coffee was consistent I felt like if you had good beans
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,087	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You probably could do it
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:12,927	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I have a friend who has the Jura A9
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:17,791	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Like I will make coffee amazingly well kind of fancy coffee maker
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,351	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If you came over any tested it and
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,143	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We found some that we like
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,935	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We found that
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,519	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Some that we're kind of watery
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,359	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But you can actually dial
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:37,247	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Up your bean Grimes and all that kind of stuff you can customize like just about everything on this thing so I feel like it
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,039	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You spent a lot of time on it
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,855	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You probably could have cheese like
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,623	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Greatness
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,415	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Except
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:45,695	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That is that
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:53,375	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	No I wish I wish you would had like some kind of Wi-Fi access so I could like make you a cup of coffee on the show
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:57,727	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Mm
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,055	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I felt like Wi-Fi would really do Oaks
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:04,127	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Okay my to ask for this Woody Wi-Fi access
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,431	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And then a little weight sensor
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,199	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	At the bottom
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,503	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Iowa caucus
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,551	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yes you can see if there was a cup there because
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:14,367	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We even with Bluetooth access
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:21,280	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Like I couldn't always tell if I wanted to make a cup of coffee and I couldn't see the coffee maker if there is if I couldn't remember if I put
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:26,656	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Put a cup there or not
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,448	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Except for if there's a cut there
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,472	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And I was like
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,080	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I had to get up before I made another
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,384	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Oh the shame
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,664	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Theogony
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:40,992	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Moving a couch in the bed
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:47,392	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But you be you be then burning calories doing so and that's what apparently a lot of people are doing this holidays
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,416	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because they bought
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,208	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Surprisingly fitbit's
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:53,536	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yeah it was like the top app in the in the App Store
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:57,632	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So the conclusion was that everyone has fitbit's and everyone loves them
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,680	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And they all got them for Christmas
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:01,728	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And not shot way up
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,288	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And ye everyone got tickets for the holidays
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:10,176	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Everybody should be tracking their steps
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,480	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Still have my job
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:15,296	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Had a lot of server trouble leading into the holiday
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,576	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Which
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,112	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You know was a pig
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,672	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	No one's talking about this
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,208	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Except on the jaw bone like
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Jawbone support Twitter
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:28,352	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Account but you know if you got a job own and it's been slow to upload
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:31,168	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Know that they have been having some real issues
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,704	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And they're really not copping to it
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,520	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Except they're they're like
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:41,408	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Some server trouble it should be fixed now but mine is still actually uploading kind of slowly
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:44,224	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So and apparently other people are still having
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Trouble so
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:50,880	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Now you know but this brings me to CES that was a really long convoluted segue
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:54,720	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	CES
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:55,744	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Where

EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:00,352	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Are going to be a thing but not the thing
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:04,960	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We're going to keep it pretty General because I'm actually going to be at the show
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:05,984	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Next week

EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:42,592	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Robots that they've always had a little robot section and it's growing every year there
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,872	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Intel makes sense
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,152	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Intel CEO Brian

EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,624	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Kevin and Stacy who talked about people whose names they cannot pronounce
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,928	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And products whose names they cannot print
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,464	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That should be the name of our show
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:04,096	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Alright so Brian K from Intel's going to be there I expect a lot on Intel's wearable strategy

EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,712	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We saw a lot of that last year
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:24,320	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And the year before in the year before but last year was really the year of iot

EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:50,432	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I think I'm just see a lot of Smart Home Products from larger vendors
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:53,760	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The last year I saw a lot of Smart Home Products from light
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:55,040	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Newer kind of companies
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:59,904	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm getting a lot of invites from Big established companies with

EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,520	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	You know we can't really give that away but
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:18,592	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I think you're you're spot-on I don't think
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:24,992	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I don't think those smaller smart-home players are going to be gone or missing I think they're just going to get lost in all the noise
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,296	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Canasa because you're right the bigger companies an hour

EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:44,448	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Just so people are where we're still waiting for a lot of homekit profiles
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:49,056	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We haven't seen a video like profile yet on homekit all we've got right now

EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,360	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Kind of some sensors
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,640	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	We've got the

EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,296	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I can't think of any
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,320	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I know that
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:05,696	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	A few of the hubs now work with homekit in stands newest Hub does

EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,280	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And we've got lights
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,120	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Space it's a very limited selection though at this point
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,168	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And that's because we still don't have
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,472	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Homekit works with profile
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,032	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Rights we have a profile for each product

EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,760	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Do we have the homekit door lock
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,040	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	If we don't
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:35,648	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Then we're still waiting, I don't think so

EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,680	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yes they do
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:51,008	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So we have it or not profile it's still just seems like

EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:12,256	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It's just a while there's nothing interesting in there you don't want to live there yet
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,048	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	All right
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:17,120	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And in terms of new device categories
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,424	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm not seeing a lot
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:19,936	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	There is one
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:24,800	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Product category I am really excited about it's not a product
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,568	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Categories of product
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:32,224	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I was going to tell you about it because it's so freaking exciting and then we should probably in the show cuz we have talked a lot
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,248	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	All right
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,784	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Just company
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,832	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Cut stack lighting
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,880	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I interviewed them
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,464	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	A couple like before before this version of the iot podcast
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:45,024	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And I've got a review unit coming
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,536	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	End
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,608	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	When it's here we're going to talk about it in Greater depth
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,120	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	But
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,192	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It is a light
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:52,960	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That is
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:56,288	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Responsive in this is actually really interesting Trend we're going to keep following
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,104	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	It's
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,920	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Instead of calling them smart because they feel like the
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:04,480	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Turn smart has been to so bastardize
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,760	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Over there,
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:11,136	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Responsive and idea is these lights have a motion sensor an ambient light sensor
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,928	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And a
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,256	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Occupancy sensor
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,048	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm not sure
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,376	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And what happens is when you walk in
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,656	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	They
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:23,680	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Turn on
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:31,104	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And if it needed if there is not enough light in the room and they also turn on in regard in Black release
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,640	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Listen to the circadian rhythms of the day
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:33,920	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,456	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Their white lights
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,992	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Politico
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,272	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Brighter in the morning and
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:41,088	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Turn yellow room dimmer towards the evening
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,648	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And so the idea is they
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Turn on
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,184	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	When they're needed
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,976	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And when someone's in the room
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,744	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	When you leave
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,024	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Turn off
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,048	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:51,584	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And you do nothing
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,448	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And then they also will
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:58,752	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Work with other systems
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,776	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is the plan
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,800	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So they will act as
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,848	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	An occupancy sensor for your neck
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,408	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Or other
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:06,944	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Thermostat
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:07,968	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Overtime
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:11,040	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And they will work through if this then that
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,856	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So why am I really pumped
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,136	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	About these and I'm going to get
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:20,512	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Towards sometime after CES I'm going to get the first so they come and be our 30s right now
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,072	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And there are a hundred and fifty-four
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,400	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Hub and to BR30
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,472	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And it's 60 bucks for each additional bulb
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,800	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I know they're very expensive there Q expensive
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:39,712	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That's okay then just starting out with a new product I mean you know until you can scale up and bring your prices down today
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,992	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Crosstown I did that
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm not
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,064	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm not going to write them off because of that
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And see how they work
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,672	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yeah. I'm at the exactly cuz I'm kind of excited
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:52,000	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Occupancy
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,024	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Without
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,304	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Relying on a phone
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,864	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Kind of exciting
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,632	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Right
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,680	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is it said it's semi presents
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:03,776	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Semi presents but they report back like if there's a person in there
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,080	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Without needing the phone
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:12,992	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	So so in a sense I can provide presents information to other devices such as your nasty as you said
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:13,504	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	In particular
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:16,064	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Great
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,624	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I'm but I'm I'm still kind of stone
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,904	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Because you know man
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,440	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And left
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:25,536	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That is that is the product I'm really excited about
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:28,608	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And that is kind of some thoughts about CEs
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:31,168	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And we will
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:33,984	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Now let you guys go I have a cool guest for you

EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,624	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,160	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	What I took from this kind of
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,952	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Report
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,512	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	A couple things one is this idea that
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,048	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Working with clients
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:46,816	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Like your side
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,584	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Clients like
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,352	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Yourself
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:50,144	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Midea is the venture capitalist
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:53,472	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	May not be super successful investing here
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,520	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Is because they don't have the domain expert
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:56,032	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Expertise
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,336	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Industrial clients
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,360	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Like yourself require
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:04,224	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And at the exits here may not be huge so maybe they should leave it tonight corporate development officer
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,320	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And I don't know do you
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,600	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Do you have an opinion on
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:16,768	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I think it matters by the component of Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:19,072	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Technologies are activities in
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:21,632	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I think we would think of it as a value chain
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,472	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Subsistence
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:26,752	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Technology
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:30,848	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	That's required from a security networking employee to extract
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:33,152	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Data from machine
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,688	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I can't believe that
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:41,088	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Could be a relatively horizontal technology that could be applied to a broad brush
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,880	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Total addressable Market
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,416	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	There is
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,976	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Networking in cloud-based

EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,936	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And I'd argue that that later as well
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:37:00,032	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Could be applied to a broad total addressable Market
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:04,384	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	In the top layer which is
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:07,712	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The set of applications that are created to help
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:11,040	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	Crazy business outcomes that the Industrial company
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:18,464	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And that maybe something that has a more limited total addressable Market
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:25,120	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	And it's probably more nuanced to the needs of unlike ourselves or particular subset.
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:29,472	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	What about this idea
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:29,984	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	The big

EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:39,712	| IOT_12-30_-_12-30-15_10.49_AM |	I feel like in reading this report
