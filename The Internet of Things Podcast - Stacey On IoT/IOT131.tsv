EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,976	| IOT131 |	Our secret
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,256	| IOT131 |	Where they talk about
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,280	| IOT131 |	Whole bunch of
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:09,792	| IOT131 |	Echo products
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,864	| IOT131 |	And of course they did that after we recorded
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,680	| IOT131 |	But we love you guys so much
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,448	| IOT131 |	That we decided
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,728	| IOT131 |	We are going to do
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,496	| IOT131 |	Just tell you what we thought
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,032	| IOT131 |	You kept
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:20,544	| IOT131 |	Keep us down
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,336	| IOT131 |	Can I tell you what
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,128	| IOT131 |	So I
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,152	| IOT131 |	There were two things that like
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,736	| IOT131 |	There are two things I was super excited about 1
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,528	| IOT131 |	Okay and then one thing I was like what
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| IOT131 |	What day was the Super
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,136	| IOT131 |	The echo
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,648	| IOT131 |	Plus
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,696	| IOT131 |	This is 100
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,232	| IOT131 |	$49 device that
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:44,096	| IOT131 |	This means it has an additional radio it has
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:44,864	| IOT131 |	Zigbee
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,448	| IOT131 |	So obviously it has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi because the original one did
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,472	| IOT131 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,496	| IOT131 |	I should not neglect those
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,056	| IOT131 |	The one aspect about this is
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,568	| IOT131 |	You
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,848	| IOT131 |	Can't get rid of
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,896	| IOT131 |	Your hubs that speak
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,408	| IOT131 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,944	| IOT131 |	If you have Z-Wave devices
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,736	| IOT131 |	Because this doesn't have it
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| IOT131 |	But if you're only dealing with
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,040	| IOT131 |	With zigbee devices
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,576	| IOT131 |	You could
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:10,976	| IOT131 |	Write this is one of multiple devices they announced today and this is the Echo Plus model which is Jesus
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:14,560	| IOT131 |	Said 14999 and that includes a Philips Hue smart light bulb
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,352	| IOT131 |	Included with it while supplies last
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:22,496	| IOT131 |	I'm kind of curious and I'm not sure if you know Stacey but I'm kind of curious on the Hub itself
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:26,592	| IOT131 |	Because obviously I have a wink Hub you fuse Dwayne give you SmartThings
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:30,688	| IOT131 |	I bought all these works with wink things now I guess we're going to buy
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| IOT131 |	Works with
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,224	| IOT131 |	Echo thing
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,272	| IOT131 |	And they're actually probably
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:34,784	| IOT131 |	NSA works with
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,624	| IOT131 |	Okay well you either way
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:43,488	| IOT131 |	I think bad news for the Lincoln Samsung folks in general
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,048	| IOT131 |	I'm just curious I assume I don't have to
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,632	| IOT131 |	Repurposing my old stuff cuz I can control it now
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,424	| IOT131 |	If you've got the
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,728	| IOT131 |	All the existing stuff that
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,264	| IOT131 |	It's a lot of it's done over Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,032	| IOT131 |	Anyway
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,568	| IOT131 |	Now what might be interesting
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,592	| IOT131 |	Is if
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:01,664	| IOT131 |	You don't Phillips decided to work with them and they actually
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,432	| IOT131 |	They put their zippy
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,736	| IOT131 |	Bulb switch if this comes with it
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,016	| IOT131 |	It just did away with the
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,296	| IOT131 |	Philips Hue hub
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,088	| IOT131 |	Right right
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,392	| IOT131 |	Does that mean this is good news for people who
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:11,904	| IOT131 |	Weight hopsewee
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:20,607	| IOT131 |	Which is which is me I don't want like extra hugs extra Bridges and so on I'm still curious the devil's going to be in the details for me because
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| IOT131 |	Cuz I want to see how the
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,911	| IOT131 |	A smartphone
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:26,239	| IOT131 |	Companion app works with this because obviously he's my Wink app quite a bit
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:32,383	| IOT131 |	I'm also wondering you know some of my things are going to get some of them or not is that good
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,455	| IOT131 |	PÃ©kin issue here I don't think so but I'm still curious
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| IOT131 |	Yeah this isn't going to support
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| IOT131 |	It doesn't say that it does
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:40,831	| IOT131 |	They would have said
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:41,855	| IOT131 |	So
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,903	| IOT131 |	Now
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,719	| IOT131 |	So that was my Hulu that's exciting there's also
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,487	| IOT131 |	A new Echo
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,023	| IOT131 |	Which is 99
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:49,791	| IOT131 |	99
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,143	| IOT131 |	And this is
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,935	| IOT131 |	Just a better speaker smaller
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,727	| IOT131 |	Cloth cover
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:02,847	| IOT131 |	Kilby processing this this to me is the
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:07,199	| IOT131 |	Late competitor to Apple's homepod because that's going to focus
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,991	| IOT131 |	Salon sound quality and
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| IOT131 |	Siri
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,063	| IOT131 |	So this should be sound quality and Madame a
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,343	| IOT131 |	And then
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,135	| IOT131 |	This is the other devices
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,439	| IOT131 |	Here's the device I'm also a
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:20,255	| IOT131 |	The echo spot cuz it's super cute
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,535	| IOT131 |	Askew
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,327	| IOT131 |	Echo with a little
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| IOT131 |	Alarm clock
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| IOT131 |	The little clock face
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,703	| IOT131 |	Did question
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:32,799	| IOT131 |	It's like a modern chumby it's like I'm not as jumpy it is exactly
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| IOT131 |	But how bright is it going to be
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,127	| IOT131 |	That's what I want to know I don't know
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,431	| IOT131 |	I'm totally buying one
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,711	| IOT131 |	It's $130
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,759	| IOT131 |	129
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| IOT131 |	Right right now
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,207	| IOT131 |	This is true
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:54,815	| IOT131 |	This is true so this is I guess I almost a replacement for a. In that it's small
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:59,423	| IOT131 |	But it also has a display so it's kind of combined the. Show this would be there if their baby
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:03,519	| IOT131 |	So you can see things on the little screen instead of 2.5 inch display
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,847	| IOT131 |	I thought I read and I'm just double-checking
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:11,967	| IOT131 |	You can get your camera feeds and you could even take a video call this at somebody on your little chunky like device
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| IOT131 |	Looking at you and you looking at them
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,831	| IOT131 |	Then if there is not a manual cover on that
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,343	| IOT131 |	My camera I do now
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,903	| IOT131 |	My bad my bad
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,183	| IOT131 |	Give up a lot of my
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,743	| IOT131 |	Right right
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:29,887	| IOT131 |	Sound-wise at 8 probably isn't much better than the. The current. Because it's only a 2 watt speaker very small acts like a smartphone
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,399	| IOT131 |	On speaker
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,959	| IOT131 |	All right maybe I'm not going to buy this
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,311	| IOT131 |	It's all good
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:38,847	| IOT131 |	Camera
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,407	| IOT131 |	Amazon have a heart
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:42,943	| IOT131 |	Shutter
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,295	| IOT131 |	We could probably like make one and a 3D printer market and make noise
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:51,647	| IOT131 |	Low-tech
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,671	| IOT131 |	It's not a sexy
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,767	| IOT131 |	So there's also a new Fire TV which
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,559	| IOT131 |	Not a big deal
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:03,167	| IOT131 |	OIC I like because if they've added they already have a 4K
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:06,495	| IOT131 |	Support in the current Fire TV which is what I use and they've added
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,031	| IOT131 |	High dynamic range
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:12,639	| IOT131 |	Which brings out more color pops wider range of color and
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,479	| IOT131 |	Better contrast I have to 4K TV so this is it
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:16,991	| IOT131 |	Ostomy
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| IOT131 |	And then
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,807	| IOT131 |	We got lots of new
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:22,111	| IOT131 |	Skill so they said the vehicles are coming
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,159	| IOT131 |	Your Fire TV
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,671	| IOT131 |	You could tell Matt
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| IOT131 |	The play catastrophe
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,255	| IOT131 |	On the
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,815	| IOT131 |	Weather Channel
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:37,215	| IOT131 |	Showtime PlayStation Vue
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,519	| IOT131 |	All access NBC Bravo etcetera
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,799	| IOT131 |	They're integrating those
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,103	| IOT131 |	Video content partners
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:43,615	| IOT131 |	Sport
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| IOT131 |	Control
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,175	| IOT131 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,687	| IOT131 |	Aunt
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:47,967	| IOT131 |	Two more things
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,295	| IOT131 |	One we're going to actually talk about this later in the show but we were
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| IOT131 |	We didn't know this so
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:08:00,767	| IOT131 |	Amazon's introducing routines which allow you to control multiple devices with a single voice commands
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,303	| IOT131 |	All of this. We'll have
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| IOT131 |	Later is actually how to do the Sun
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,143	| IOT131 |	Home so
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,167	| IOT131 |	Prism play Battle
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| IOT131 |	That's still a relevant answer
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,239	| IOT131 |	Button
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,007	| IOT131 |	4 people
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| IOT131 |	Go to bed at night
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:16,127	| IOT131 |	Turn off this
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| IOT131 |	Now you can just be like Madden a good night
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,991	| IOT131 |	Final item
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,759	| IOT131 |	Calling
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,527	| IOT131 |	And messaging
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,295	| IOT131 |	To a phone
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,575	| IOT131 |	A
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,111	| IOT131 |	Right-of-way / landline
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,903	| IOT131 |	And so this is a box that you
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,695	| IOT131 |	You buy it reminded me of
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,207	| IOT131 |	I remember
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,791	| IOT131 |	It's still around its magicJack 2.0
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,071	| IOT131 |	There you go
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,607	| IOT131 |	So yeah it's 35 bucks
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,119	| IOT131 |	The echo
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,191	| IOT131 |	And this sun like Google will dial91
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,775	| IOT131 |	Because this is a landline.
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,591	| IOT131 |	Text spacing over. Voice over IP to
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,639	| IOT131 |	Cellular you need to have a lan
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| IOT131 |	Right
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,991	| IOT131 |	If you're like me and you don't have a landline
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,343	| IOT131 |	Same here but
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:00,927	| IOT131 |	You know this is good because so there are still some people with landline that's that's fine
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,487	| IOT131 |	Second as you said $35 is not expensive
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,255	| IOT131 |	And it
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,303	| IOT131 |	Broadens the range of calling because
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,583	| IOT131 |	Before we could just do like
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:10,655	| IOT131 |	Echo to Echo type calling you those are Echo devices or two
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,935	| IOT131 |	The Echo app
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:14,495	| IOT131 |	Now it's actually going through cellular other
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,031	| IOT131 |	Landline phones you can make phone calls
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,823	| IOT131 |	And
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,871	| IOT131 |	Condition of this
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,919	| IOT131 |	They're adding we're rolling out
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,687	| IOT131 |	Voice calling
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,199	| IOT131 |	Puyallup
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| IOT131 |	Play Just Like Google home
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:26,783	| IOT131 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,319	| IOT131 |	Yay
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,623	| IOT131 |	All right so that's all the Echo news that's fit to
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,647	| IOT131 |	Well talked about
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT131 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,999	| IOT131 |	Rastelli start
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,279	| IOT131 |	Let's start
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,327	| IOT131 |	Off by tooting my own horn
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:39,839	| IOT131 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| IOT131 |	Last week
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:46,495	| IOT131 |	I have been working on a story all summer long
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:49,055	| IOT131 |	Try to figure out what a company called logo
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| IOT131 |	What's doing
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:53,919	| IOT131 |	And I knew it was some former Nest Executives and who is consumer products
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,735	| IOT131 |	Finally last Friday
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| IOT131 |	An FCC notice
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,831	| IOT131 |	Application and basically this is a smart lighting startup
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,879	| IOT131 |	So this is from
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| IOT131 |	Eric Charlton
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,695	| IOT131 |	Who is a family member of the Nestea
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:09,279	| IOT131 |	Former head of business he's got people on there from GoPro from
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:13,119	| IOT131 |	Fitbit Kathy Sanders who was the former CMO it August is actually
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,399	| IOT131 |	Part of this team as well
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,679	| IOT131 |	In what way
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,703	| IOT131 |	Is it as a lighting Prada
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,775	| IOT131 |	It is a wifi-enabled dimmer switch
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,543	| IOT131 |	Which
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT131 |	Is there two of them
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,127	| IOT131 |	Elvis and Wanda
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| IOT131 |	Sativa and
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,943	| IOT131 |	I also
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,991	| IOT131 |	Heard so this isn't in the story that I wrote
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:33,343	| IOT131 |	Time but I also have heard that this is a smart lighting switch
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,111	| IOT131 |	Doesn't
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,879	| IOT131 |	Choir
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| IOT131 |	Neutral wire
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| IOT131 |	Is really interesting
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:45,631	| IOT131 |	And also in the FCC filing this also has bluetooth support Dimension Wi-Fi but it says both right
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| IOT131 |	It does
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,191	| IOT131 |	And
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| IOT131 |	Assuming
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:53,055	| IOT131 |	I will assume that it will have mesh capabilities cuz that makes a lot of sense for lighting
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,335	| IOT131 |	Because your phone's name
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,407	| IOT131 |	Phone won't always be close enough
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,431	| IOT131 |	Turn it on or off
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,199	| IOT131 |	So yeah
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,527	| IOT131 |	Again we don't know the details we won't know the details until
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| IOT131 |	Sometime hopefully
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:14,047	| IOT131 |	I'm really excited about it but should be soon because typically want something go through FCC certification it's usually
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:17,631	| IOT131 |	Within weeks or one or two months at most before
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,655	| IOT131 |	Prague is actually launched
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| IOT131 |	Formation Apso
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,495	| IOT131 |	You know Jose
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| IOT131 |	Christmas almost over so we'll say I
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:24,799	| IOT131 |	October
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:25,823	| IOT131 |	Maybe November
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,919	| IOT131 |	And as a lighting aficionado
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,783	| IOT131 |	Iams you need more ways to control your thoughts
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:38,111	| IOT131 |	Like I still have some dumb switches in my house and
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| IOT131 |	Got to take out my
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,207	| IOT131 |	WeMo dimmer switch because I have decided that it
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:45,023	| IOT131 |	WeMo dimmer switch
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,559	| IOT131 |	Do not put it in
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| IOT131 |	In your bedroom
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,351	| IOT131 |	Very bright
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,655	| IOT131 |	Not just when it goes off in the middle of the night be
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,703	| IOT131 |	Because it has no internet access but also just in general
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,263	| IOT131 |	Little indicators
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:55,775	| IOT131 |	In a dark room
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:56,799	| IOT131 |	Universim
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:00,127	| IOT131 |	I just to be clear we say dumb switch we're not judging
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,687	| IOT131 |	Number one and number two I agree with you on pretty much
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:09,087	| IOT131 |	Any device or switch or anything that hasn't LED I've actually used electrical tape
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,415	| IOT131 |	My sister shut off for cover of the LEDs in the bedroom in particular
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| IOT131 |	You're just too bright
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,023	| IOT131 |	If I let it it would look like
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,535	| IOT131 |	Like a little like
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| IOT131 |	What is glowing
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,887	| IOT131 |	All right
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,911	| IOT131 |	Next story
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,215	| IOT131 |	Is it a question
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,727	| IOT131 |	Issaquah
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:32,895	| IOT131 |	I guess my question is to you because I can't answer it because I do not have an Amazon Echo Show and you do so my quest
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,967	| IOT131 |	Question is do you watch YouTube videos on it
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| IOT131 |	Baidu
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,759	| IOT131 |	So I
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:41,087	| IOT131 |	We watch gory videos all the time cuz it's right there at the
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,647	| IOT131 |	I called the breakfast bar it's where my daughter and I will sit in
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| IOT131 |	Breakfast sometimes
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,439	| IOT131 |	More like hey
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,231	| IOT131 |	Madimak show us some Corgi videos and
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,255	| IOT131 |	Pick one and we watch
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:56,703	| IOT131 |	Well I guess you're not doing that anymore because Google has basically shut that service down
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:59,775	| IOT131 |	On the Echo Show
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,567	| IOT131 |	So no more videos on Echo Show from YouTube
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| IOT131 |	I know
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:03,871	| IOT131 |	End
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,383	| IOT131 |	Why
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:11,039	| IOT131 |	What's that's the thing nobody's talking about
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,599	| IOT131 |	Companies don't play nice together you can't buy a Chromecast
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:20,511	| IOT131 |	Google lets you know support certain Amazon services
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,791	| IOT131 |	But I think is
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,607	| IOT131 |	Amazon uses a fork of Android
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,655	| IOT131 |	And that is there fire OS
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:33,055	| IOT131 |	They are not a licensee of Google's GMS or Google mobile services that's an agreement that all device maker
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:39,455	| IOT131 |	Your sign if they want include the official Google apps so this is no different than the Fire tablet that's the issue
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:42,783	| IOT131 |	Eric and I don't think it's going to change anytime soon because I don't see Amazon
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:47,135	| IOT131 |	Signing on as a GMS license
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:51,231	| IOT131 |	I don't think it's going to happen I think you not going to get you two back at least not an official capacity
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,511	| IOT131 |	So Google shut this off
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| IOT131 |	Because they were just waiting for
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,375	| IOT131 |	The official statement is at its
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:00,959	| IOT131 |	Ifrit technical problem then I guess you could say well technically
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,263	| IOT131 |	Amazon is not a licensee I don't think it's a
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,543	| IOT131 |	A true technical Pro
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,687	| IOT131 |	Obviously you can get YouTube running on just about any device and Google
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:13,759	| IOT131 |	So this is not unprecedented by any means
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,831	| IOT131 |	But I don't know the stories that I read everybody
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,599	| IOT131 |	Open today
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,671	| IOT131 |	Nobody's talking about the GMS license which to me is the core issue here
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,743	| IOT131 |	Believe you because
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,767	| IOT131 |	Sounds very
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:25,791	| IOT131 |	Not ever
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,631	| IOT131 |	Consumer but like as a business person
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:33,983	| IOT131 |	And I think we're going to see cuz Amazon is also pushing really hard on its part
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,287	| IOT131 |	To work within its show ecosystem
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:36,799	| IOT131 |	Do certain thing
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,359	| IOT131 |	I think things are getting kind of dirty
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:43,967	| IOT131 |	Smart speaker assistants
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:46,015	| IOT131 |	Looking good
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,319	| IOT131 |	I'm feeling a little down here about this
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,623	| IOT131 |	So no more Corgi videos for me
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,647	| IOT131 |	But
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| IOT131 |	I might
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,463	| IOT131 |	Get better wearables that are
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,511	| IOT131 |	Tested by the FDA which
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:58,047	| IOT131 |	I'm kind of excited about I don't know
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:04,191	| IOT131 |	I am super excited about this for a couple reasons one is I think I'm the last show I mention I got the Apple watch
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:06,495	| IOT131 |	Three with LTE and I'm already seeing
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:07,775	| IOT131 |	More
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:11,615	| IOT131 |	Informational Health Data being sucked in by this thing
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,943	| IOT131 |	Metrics that I have not seen before which is awesome but
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| IOT131 |	Secondly
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT131 |	When
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:22,879	| IOT131 |	We can start getting these things certified as medical devices and you'll cease consolidation you won't have people have to wear a sir
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,671	| IOT131 |	Turn device to measure save it
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,695	| IOT131 |	You know heart rate because
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:30,303	| IOT131 |	Cuz they have me be at yours me or whatever maybe when that can be approved
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:34,399	| IOT131 |	Certify into an existing device such as
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,447	| IOT131 |	Device you want to wear song
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,983	| IOT131 |	Yay
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:41,823	| IOT131 |	Yes that is awesome and I'm super excited because I would like more
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,615	| IOT131 |	Accountability on a lot of these device
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,967	| IOT131 |	So you know how I was always looking at these studies from places that talk about
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,247	| IOT131 |	Hey
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,807	| IOT131 |	This heart rate is actually accurate or this calorie burn
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,879	| IOT131 |	Is totally inaccurate so I am looking forward to having
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,647	| IOT131 |	High quality
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,927	| IOT131 |	Jada and then is someone who
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,439	| IOT131 |	Who I actually
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,975	| IOT131 |	For a while had to
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,279	| IOT131 |	Some heart issues that my heart was fine
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,327	| IOT131 |	But they're trying to figure out why
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| IOT131 |	I kept fainting all the time
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,935	| IOT131 |	Let's put you on a Holter monitor which is horrible
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,727	| IOT131 |	Battery powered Giant
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,751	| IOT131 |	Thing that you strap on
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,287	| IOT131 |	Where all the time
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| IOT131 |	24/7
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,383	| IOT131 |	Uncomfortable it's cumbersome and I decided not to do it
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,663	| IOT131 |	Because it was so cumbersome
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| IOT131 |	If only I could just
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| IOT131 |	Actually use my
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:22,271	| IOT131 |	Fitness watch or something
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:22,783	| IOT131 |	Like that
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,319	| IOT131 |	We here
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,087	| IOT131 |	We're close
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:25,599	| IOT131 |	Close
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,695	| IOT131 |	Yes I mean the deal is it that certain products such a
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:35,071	| IOT131 |	Those from Apple Fitbit Samsung Etc can get pre-cleared through the FDA
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:41,215	| IOT131 |	And I agree with you on getting some kind of standards for the data because there isn't a smartwatch or
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,007	| IOT131 |	Exercise tracker that I haven't tried
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:46,847	| IOT131 |	And the variance in heart rate for example it's just
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:53,247	| IOT131 |	Massive still and we need to have some type of certification says we'll take a little tolerancia no not a wide
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:59,647	| IOT131 |	The data that we have
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,695	| IOT131 |	Several times in the past year
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,719	| IOT131 |	However
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:04,255	| IOT131 |	They announced health
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:08,351	| IOT131 |	Way back with the Apple watch 3 issues ago
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,631	| IOT131 |	They've done a lot here
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:13,215	| IOT131 |	And they should be commended because they're the ones that I think have really pushed
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:16,287	| IOT131 |	More so than anybody else for this type of standard
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:21,919	| IOT131 |	They stopped at every closed ecosystem is sometimes a real pain to get your data out of apple health
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,455	| IOT131 |	I give him credit B
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,223	| IOT131 |	Because they have not
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,551	| IOT131 |	I'm going to throw up
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,111	| IOT131 |	Cool little monkey
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:34,207	| IOT131 |	I would be excited about this not just for like the fitness and
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,975	| IOT131 |	Heart rate
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,511	| IOT131 |	But there's also a
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,535	| IOT131 |	A whole.new
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,071	| IOT131 |	Kind of class of things called
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,839	| IOT131 |	Shareables
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| IOT131 |	And it's a stupid name
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:46,751	| IOT131 |	But the reason they call it that and not hearing aids is because the FDA certified
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:51,871	| IOT131 |	But there are a bunch of classes of devices that you can plug into your headphone type devices
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,175	| IOT131 |	Put in your ear and you can actually hear better
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:57,503	| IOT131 |	I would love to see some certification moving
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:59,551	| IOT131 |	Forward I'm hearable Zora
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:03,647	| IOT131 |	Being able to actually call them hearing aids and seeing a lot of innovation in that
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:06,975	| IOT131 |	Area because there is so much Innovation happening
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,511	| IOT131 |	On the chip side
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:11,327	| IOT131 |	And on the product side about audio processing
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,631	| IOT131 |	The old hearing aids
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,423	| IOT131 |	You just going to stick like your airpods or something
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,471	| IOT131 |	Be better
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,239	| IOT131 |	And so I'm actually
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:23,359	| IOT131 |	Maybe not the first thing everyone thinks about when they think about FDA
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,383	| IOT131 |	Pre-certification
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,663	| IOT131 |	Or getting some sort of
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,455	| IOT131 |	Leniency and developing these things
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:29,247	| IOT131 |	I think that will be a huge area
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,343	| IOT131 |	I'm also going to the audiologist
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:34,879	| IOT131 |	Worried about my hair
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:37,695	| IOT131 |	Used to cover music
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,207	| IOT131 |	Can the day
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,327	| IOT131 |	Covered it's just a little too much to do we did it
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:46,655	| IOT131 |	Honestly
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,679	| IOT131 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:49,215	| IOT131 |	Autonomous cars
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| IOT131 |	Because
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,359	| IOT131 |	Because the sooner I stop driving
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| IOT131 |	Happier
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| IOT131 |	So
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,967	| IOT131 |	Ford is teaming up with
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,479	| IOT131 |	Lyft
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| IOT131 |	Tell us about
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,527	| IOT131 |	Yes please
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:09,439	| IOT131 |	Yeah this is interesting and recently announced so therefore it has been working in autonomous cars for the better part of six
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,743	| IOT131 |	7 years now they are partnering with Lyft
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,791	| IOT131 |	To try and figure out how to effectively
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:17,375	| IOT131 |	Dispatch self-driving Vehicles so if you're a Lyft driver
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:20,703	| IOT131 |	Where I can send Uber driver to you in the future
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:25,055	| IOT131 |	Cedar Tavern
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:28,127	| IOT131 |	Partnering with these Ride On Demand services but
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:34,527	| IOT131 |	Basically just trying to figure out where should we do this with cities what kind of infrastructure do we need to maintain the fleet
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,063	| IOT131 |	And so on and so forth
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,343	| IOT131 |	Customer experience
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:41,439	| IOT131 |	Kind of interesting on how a big car manufacturers starting with a
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:45,023	| IOT131 |	This ride on demand service it's also worth noting that for was one of us
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,303	| IOT131 |	First feedback
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:52,703	| IOT131 |	2010 to work on the Wi-Fi connectivity between cars not Wi-Fi in your car but
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:59,103	| IOT131 |	Car talking to another card using WiFi they demonstrated
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,407	| IOT131 |	Structure it doesn't use Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:05,247	| IOT131 |	Uses I believe a spectrum band that is also allocated for Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,527	| IOT131 |	But it's not
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| IOT131 |	Correct
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,695	| IOT131 |	Vehicle vehicle
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:16,511	| IOT131 |	Structurescan Point Smart City it's all part of the same
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,791	| IOT131 |	Pay myself yes
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,327	| IOT131 |	Yes they did do that
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| IOT131 |	Actually Qualcomm put out a chip
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:21,887	| IOT131 |	Probably
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,423	| IOT131 |	I'm going to say
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,447	| IOT131 |	Out there sponsored by the way
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:30,335	| IOT131 |	Two months ago it's actually one of the first pieces of silicon
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,871	| IOT131 |	Embed allof
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,175	| IOT131 |	This vehicle to vehicle and vehicle infrastructure
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,687	| IOT131 |	Connectivity into
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,735	| IOT131 |	Which is a big step because
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,503	| IOT131 |	Beforehand
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,295	| IOT131 |	You know it was all talkative silicon
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,063	| IOT131 |	So now they're silicone
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,087	| IOT131 |	People can actually start
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,391	| IOT131 |	So that's a big deal
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:47,487	| IOT131 |	So we're actually going to start seeing cars that communicate something to other cars
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:48,511	| IOT131 |	Relative
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:55,423	| IOT131 |	Yeah if I'm not mistaken that Qualcomm chip with a 9150e cd2
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:59,775	| IOT131 |	Which is the first cellular vehicle to everything solution as they say
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| IOT131 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,103	| IOT131 |	Yes I never remember the
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,615	| IOT131 |	Ship names
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,431	| IOT131 |	I'm surprised it's so aptly named
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,199	| IOT131 |	Like because I'm a
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,039	| IOT131 |	All right and now
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,575	| IOT131 |	We should move to Kevin
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,367	| IOT131 |	Your secret crazy cool project
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:15,391	| IOT131 |	I called your
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:18,720	| IOT131 |	Play my secret lab haswell
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,512	| IOT131 |	I'm just starting to work on this
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,328	| IOT131 |	Sad and it is basically a way to use
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:30,240	| IOT131 |	An Apple Watch or actually any iOS device that has Siri to control non homekit device
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,520	| IOT131 |	Faces by voice
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:37,920	| IOT131 |	There's a project out on GitHub called bridge and are plugins Google or for home
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:42,272	| IOT131 |	She set up the homebridge project on a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:45,344	| IOT131 |	Plugin for wink for example so I could then say
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:51,744	| IOT131 |	Tell Siri to control things on winky another not get certified so that's something I'm working out
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:54,048	| IOT131 |	Future but in doing all this research
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:57,888	| IOT131 |	Kind of transfer how to do this I realized with the Apple watch
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:03,776	| IOT131 |	People probably overlooked Siri if they don't use homekit Smart Home devices and here's just a little tip that I found
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,544	| IOT131 |	When I
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:10,944	| IOT131 |	Want to use my wash to turn on the lights or turn lights off or whatever I actually have to go and open my Wink app on the Apple watch
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:17,344	| IOT131 |	Watch and that's not the quickest thing to do because you got to press the digital crown and a little wink icon in the
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:22,208	| IOT131 |	See your bubbles of apps it's so easy to just tell Siri to open wink or
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,256	| IOT131 |	Open SmartThings when I do that
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,560	| IOT131 |	It literally just shows my shortcuts
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:30,656	| IOT131 |	From my Wink app to turn the kitchen light on turn the kitchen light off
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:34,752	| IOT131 |	Don't go talking around on your watch if you're using wink or SmartThings just say
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,800	| IOT131 |	Tell Siri to open the app
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:40,896	| IOT131 |	Chicken much faster for you
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,712	| IOT131 |	We'll have more information on the project I really get that working
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:50,880	| IOT131 |	Good luck bridge is probably in the same scale is openhab which is my pet
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,440	| IOT131 |	Been working with on and off
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:56,256	| IOT131 |	And I haven't really talked about it much on the show
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,536	| IOT131 |	Is getting it up and running
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,304	| IOT131 |	Was just
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,072	| IOT131 |	Not user-friendly
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:03,424	| IOT131 |	Their intention of listeners who are probably
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,704	| IOT131 |	Really Adept at coding
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,520	| IOT131 |	Loading things onto a pie or
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,336	| IOT131 |	For most people
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,360	| IOT131 |	This is going to be 2
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,664	| IOT131 |	Much so that's why we haven't talked about it but
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,688	| IOT131 |	I should probably write it up
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,968	| IOT131 |	Put it out there
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:16,480	| IOT131 |	Sometime in
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,552	| IOT131 |	We each have our secret side projects
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:21,088	| IOT131 |	Kevin is probably a little bit
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:28,256	| IOT131 |	I'm not a coder I just love tinkering so I'm learning on the way so I don't want people to have an expectation that I can just go
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:32,096	| IOT131 |	Whip up lines and lines of code it takes me some time but there's tons of great
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:35,680	| IOT131 |	Create documentation out there
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| IOT131 |	Once I had open have running
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,264	| IOT131 |	On my way
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,544	| IOT131 |	I
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,312	| IOT131 |	Could spend
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:46,176	| IOT131 |	Hours it's like a PowerPoint presentation where you start moving things
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,688	| IOT131 |	Adjusting stuff
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,736	| IOT131 |	You have that much granular
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,760	| IOT131 |	Control over your device
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,112	| IOT131 |	So
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:57,952	| IOT131 |	Kevin you should actually tell us a little bit about because when we last talked
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| IOT131 |	Have your Apple
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,488	| IOT131 |	Watch with LTE
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,072	| IOT131 |	Oh that's right
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:06,144	| IOT131 |	That's right I've only had it for about 5 days so real quick
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:11,520	| IOT131 |	I am very impressed I think it was well worth the upgrade for me I had an Apple watch
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,056	| IOT131 |	Series 2 that I sold
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:16,896	| IOT131 |	Privately so I have tested LTE calls quite a bit they work
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:22,784	| IOT131 |	Really really well for me I was actually out on a 3-mile run using Apple watch
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:29,184	| IOT131 |	Offering to play music but always to track via GPS and heart rate what you can do with the series 2 model
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:31,232	| IOT131 |	And
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,512	| IOT131 |	Friend of mine called me
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:36,864	| IOT131 |	It's about 8:30 at night as I'm running down the street in my local little town and I just
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,656	| IOT131 |	Tap the watch to pick the call
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| IOT131 |	Did not have my headphones on
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:44,544	| IOT131 |	It was a little challenging for me to hear him because there was traffic going right
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:47,872	| IOT131 |	Next to me I was on the shoulder he said I sounded fantastic I was
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,432	| IOT131 |	Shocked so we had a 5-minute chat while it was
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:54,272	| IOT131 |	Keeping up about 8:30 mile pace and I'm like dude there's a hill coming I got to go
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,296	| IOT131 |	So I hung up
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,856	| IOT131 |	I later tested the next day a call to
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:03,232	| IOT131 |	That same person while I was taking the dog for a walk out on the trail and I'd this time did have
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,256	| IOT131 |	I had set on
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:10,144	| IOT131 |	He said I sounded the same which was surprising that that speaks to how well the microphone is on the Apple watch
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:16,544	| IOT131 |	I could obviously hear him much better because of being pipe cancer my headphones but on the plus side those are all good things I can connect
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:22,944	| IOT131 |	I can reach out to my family make a call in an emergency
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:29,344	| IOT131 |	I need to work on my notification
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,112	| IOT131 |	4 second
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:33,696	| IOT131 |	Things to watch and I'm like it's not important
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,488	| IOT131 |	Side detriment here
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:41,376	| IOT131 |	Vacations but all in all
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,400	| IOT131 |	Okay and
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:45,472	| IOT131 |	Do you get a sense that this could be the future of devices like
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:45,984	| IOT131 |	The future compute
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,008	| IOT131 |	The new model for it
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:51,616	| IOT131 |	I would say so and connectivity is liberating when your attitude
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,200	| IOT131 |	So from that perspective yes
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:26:01,600	| IOT131 |	Obviously we have battery life challenges a 10-minute phone call took the watch battery down 10%
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:05,696	| IOT131 |	For example so this is not a primary phone device I've read reviews and
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,488	| IOT131 |	People that sang this is going to be like
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:14,400	| IOT131 |	And it shouldn't you shouldn't expect that when the Box battery is 10% of the capacity of a smartphone battery
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,936	| IOT131 |	Literally so
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,984	| IOT131 |	We have to figure out a battery problems
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:21,312	| IOT131 |	Challenges there but yeah I do think you know having that kind of connectivity
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,384	| IOT131 |	Are you all the time we had it with the phone today
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,176	| IOT131 |	So it's just moving into wearable absolutely
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,248	| IOT131 |	Computing and accessed
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,784	| IOT131 |	Intelligence as opposed to phone
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,344	| IOT131 |	Phone calls cuz
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,368	| IOT131 |	Phone calls most
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,416	| IOT131 |	Phone
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,184	| IOT131 |	Applications
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| IOT131 |	Information so
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:43,584	| IOT131 |	To that point that's really good actually have tested Siri a couple times
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:47,168	| IOT131 |	Just as on a walk just to get information because in the new watch
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,704	| IOT131 |	She will actually sweet back to you
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:52,032	| IOT131 |	Which is nice to look at your screen that will only work if you have Kinect
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,800	| IOT131 |	So
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:56,640	| IOT131 |	I could try that on an Apple Watch to when you're out and about and don't have your phone with you
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:57,664	| IOT131 |	Siri is not going to work
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,456	| IOT131 |	So by all means this could actually
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:02,016	| IOT131 |	Bring more intelligence to your wearable because it's connect
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,064	| IOT131 |	Write that to me is excited
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,856	| IOT131 |	Cuz you know how many times do you pick up
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,624	| IOT131 |	Your phone's like
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,136	| IOT131 |	Look up the weather
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,928	| IOT131 |	20 minutes later
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:12,768	| IOT131 |	Twitter
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:14,560	| IOT131 |	This is my personal challenge
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,840	| IOT131 |	Well let's pick up
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| IOT131 |	Voicemail so
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,144	| IOT131 |	We have
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:18,656	| IOT131 |	Voicemail
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:19,680	| IOT131 |	Jonathan
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,752	| IOT131 |	Who is wondering how to handle multiple action
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,056	| IOT131 |	So let's
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,616	| IOT131 |	Hey this is Jonathan from
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,384	| IOT131 |	Australia
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,664	| IOT131 |	Listening to
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,432	| IOT131 |	Stacy on
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,968	| IOT131 |	This week in Google thank you
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,528	| IOT131 |	Not really
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:38,112	| IOT131 |	Planning to be noisy person but now I have the Google home
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,136	| IOT131 |	I'm wondering
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,672	| IOT131 |	10 MI
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,976	| IOT131 |	Get it to do two top with one
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:45,792	| IOT131 |	I want to say to my Google home
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,328	| IOT131 |	Lake my life
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:51,168	| IOT131 |	Civil and for the Google home to turn on
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,704	| IOT131 |	The TV in my bedroom
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:55,776	| IOT131 |	I don't say maybe play music on Spotify
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,544	| IOT131 |	In the kitchen
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,568	| IOT131 |	Not really able to see
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:28:00,128	| IOT131 |	Figure that out I know that's probably not
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:05,248	| IOT131 |	Technical questions but if you can get me through this I'm going to stop buying stuff
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,576	| IOT131 |	Thanks Stacy
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,648	| IOT131 |	All right I love getting Australian
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,720	| IOT131 |	That's my site
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,512	| IOT131 |	To I
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:20,864	| IOT131 |	Have done what you asked I done it will talk about it both for your case.
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,144	| IOT131 |	With the Google home
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,192	| IOT131 |	And also with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,008	| IOT131 |	Because a lot of people have those and might also want to
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:27,776	| IOT131 |	Create basics
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,824	| IOT131 |	What are scenes
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,616	| IOT131 |	Ways that I
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:35,456	| IOT131 |	The first is or the Google home
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,504	| IOT131 |	It's company called stringify we've talked about it but
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:39,808	| IOT131 |	Have been purchased by
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,320	| IOT131 |	Comcast
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:44,160	| IOT131 |	So I feel like will this be supported
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,464	| IOT131 |	But what you can do is
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:48,000	| IOT131 |	Yoodownload stringify
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,536	| IOT131 |	Uconnect whatever devices you
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,840	| IOT131 |	Want to it so your Google Assistant
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,352	| IOT131 |	21
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:59,264	| IOT131 |	To go home and what you end up doing is you create a command so like movie night and then you pull in all
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:01,056	| IOT131 |	What's the other devices
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,824	| IOT131 |	That work with that
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:04,128	| IOT131 |	Make basically what stringify calls
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,664	| IOT131 |	Flow it's a little
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,712	| IOT131 |	It's not complicated but it is a little
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| IOT131 |	Weird to do
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:09,760	| IOT131 |	If you don't know what you're doing
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,552	| IOT131 |	The flows flow from
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,344	| IOT131 |	The left rights
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:14,880	| IOT131 |	We do
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:17,952	| IOT131 |	Not everybody does
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,512	| IOT131 |	So the flows will come
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,608	| IOT131 |	Pull the devices onto the screen
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,376	| IOT131 |	Basically
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,400	| IOT131 |	Then you're like soap
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,936	| IOT131 |	When this happens
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,448	| IOT131 |	You can do
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,520	| IOT131 |	Possibly a dozen I've never gotten more
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,848	| IOT131 |	Loso and basically
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,616	| IOT131 |	You just say
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:37,920	| IOT131 |	Tell stringify to
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:38,432	| IOT131 |	Start move
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,736	| IOT131 |	And then poop
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:41,760	| IOT131 |	Your scene has been
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,808	| IOT131 |	So that software is current
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:46,880	| IOT131 |	Play free and it works really well sometimes there's a bit
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,696	| IOT131 |	It's not a lag exactly but sometimes it takes a while if
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,976	| IOT131 |	If you have a lot of stuff
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,256	| IOT131 |	Look for it to all happen
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,792	| IOT131 |	So be patient there it's not
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,816	| IOT131 |	Instantaneous
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:57,888	| IOT131 |	This is all happening on the server side like after 8
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,216	| IOT131 |	Like a good night scene
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:02,496	| IOT131 |	Can take like a man
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,264	| IOT131 |	For everything today
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,848	| IOT131 |	It's a lot of time to me
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,896	| IOT131 |	Yes I mean
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:11,200	| IOT131 |	Yeah maybe you don't do it for things like
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,992	| IOT131 |	I had one setup for when I
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,784	| IOT131 |	Yoga and I would have it
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,576	| IOT131 |	It's still very handy
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,600	| IOT131 |	Tell stringify to
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,160	| IOT131 |	Start yoga in my
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,440	| IOT131 |	Shades will go down
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,208	| IOT131 |	My
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,744	| IOT131 |	Hue Lights with turn to the
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| IOT131 |	Take out soft
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,816	| IOT131 |	Color at 50% my Harmony
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:30,144	| IOT131 |	Would come on because to Amazon video that I would do it would come on to
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:30,656	| IOT131 |	Do the Amazon
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:31,936	| IOT131 |	Prime on my
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:32,704	| IOT131 |	My television
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:35,008	| IOT131 |	And my AC would go down to like 75
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,288	| IOT131 |	And that was
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,824	| IOT131 |	All of that happened
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,360	| IOT131 |	I didn't really
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:43,456	| IOT131 |	Tell you what this I wish we had a localized
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:49,856	| IOT131 |	Version of a string of fire and if that we could run a server at the house at the device so it wasn't cloud-based but that
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,392	| IOT131 |	It's just me your next project
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:56,000	| IOT131 |	Olivia other option this won't work for you Jonathan because
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,536	| IOT131 |	You don't have an echo you
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,048	| IOT131 |	You have Google
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,608	| IOT131 |	A similar sort of
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| IOT131 |	Effort can be done
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,936	| IOT131 |	Untrue a site called you know me yof
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,704	| IOT131 |	Vendo MI
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,984	| IOT131 |	They support the Amazon
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:08,544	| IOT131 |	Echo stringify also supports the Amazon
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,848	| IOT131 |	Echo yonomi does not support
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:11,616	| IOT131 |	Google home
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| IOT131 |	That I can see
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:14,176	| IOT131 |	Yet so same set of action
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,712	| IOT131 |	Very fun
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,016	| IOT131 |	Works well and
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:19,296	| IOT131 |	You can also do things with
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,064	| IOT131 |	Gift
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,648	| IOT131 |	You can actually so you can do it yes recipes to set some scenes
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:26,720	| IOT131 |	Set scenes
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,256	| IOT131 |	Through stringify
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:28,768	| IOT131 |	With
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,072	| IOT131 |	Which is a little weird
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,096	| IOT131 |	But if you
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,120	| IOT131 |	You really want to just bring that in
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,400	| IOT131 |	I don't know why you were
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:39,520	| IOT131 |	I would also say it cuz you've mentioned the word and it's the right word you mentioned work scenes many times
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:43,360	| IOT131 |	And that's really what we're trying to do here in a sentence
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:49,760	| IOT131 |	And what I would do I would keep an eye out on the Google assistant app because they have
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,784	| IOT131 |	Listen to past they have
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,808	| IOT131 |	Shortcuts
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:54,368	| IOT131 |	They support shortcuts where you can customize what
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:57,440	| IOT131 |	Your command is what you're going to speak and what it does
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,000	| IOT131 |	But you can't do multiple actions with those yet
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:06,144	| IOT131 |	I would not be surprised if shortcuts becomes word Racine do multiple
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:06,912	| IOT131 |	Thanks
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:09,728	| IOT131 |	If the gas on my car I don't have any inside information
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,496	| IOT131 |	But that's
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:12,800	| IOT131 |	Truly missing from Google home and I would
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,360	| IOT131 |	Meet
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:18,176	| IOT131 |	You know I still can't get the actual shortcuts
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,968	| IOT131 |	Work well for me
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,528	| IOT131 |	I'm cursed you guys man I try to install all kinds of
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:26,112	| IOT131 |	In like this week I was going to tell you about the August smart locks
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:28,672	| IOT131 |	But so far my installation effort is
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:32,000	| IOT131 |	Great big brick wall
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,024	| IOT131 |	Star Wars their butt
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:34,048	| IOT131 |	For some reason it
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:34,560	| IOT131 |	Just can't find
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:35,840	| IOT131 |	In the app
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,120	| IOT131 |	It's always something
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:40,704	| IOT131 |	So yeah this I say this not to throw August under
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,472	| IOT131 |	The bus
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:46,336	| IOT131 |	Because you guys
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,896	| IOT131 |	Sometimes this is hard and I do this all the time
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:49,664	| IOT131 |	For a living
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,200	| IOT131 |	And I still
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,992	| IOT131 |	Hit these weird walls where I'm I
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:53,504	| IOT131 |	Like what's happening
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,296	| IOT131 |	The people who sent me this
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| IOT131 |	Persevere
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,648	| IOT131 |	Let us
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,952	| IOT131 |	Take a break for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,488	| IOT131 |	And then after that
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:06,048	| IOT131 |	We will have Matt Rogers who is a co-founder of
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:06,816	| IOT131 |	Nest
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,608	| IOT131 |	Talking about Nest security
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:13,216	| IOT131 |	Google Assistant it's going to be a good
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,008	| IOT131 |	State
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| IOT131 |	For all of that
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,336	| IOT131 |	Hey everyone we are interrupt
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:18,848	| IOT131 |	AT&T internet
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,640	| IOT131 |	With a message
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,152	| IOT131 |	From our sponsor
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,944	| IOT131 |	This week sponsor is
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:25,760	| IOT131 |	Qualcomm and I have Raj talluri here
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,808	| IOT131 |	Who is an SVP and GM
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,856	| IOT131 |	Iot at Qualcomm
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,392	| IOT131 |	Hi Raj how are you doing
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,416	| IOT131 |	Breakfast
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,208	| IOT131 |	Call, Ms
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:34,976	| IOT131 |	Well-known
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,256	| IOT131 |	As a semiconductor
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:36,768	| IOT131 |	Hair designs
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,560	| IOT131 |	You guys are getting into the smart
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,120	| IOT131 |	So people have been talkin
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,400	| IOT131 |	About the concept of the smart
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,424	| IOT131 |	Four-decade
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,216	| IOT131 |	When do you think it'll be realized
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,032	| IOT131 |	Actually very gradual
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,336	| IOT131 |	Single event in time
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:52,640	| IOT131 |	You have to come look at the whole ecosystem
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,408	| IOT131 |	Most of us
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,432	| IOT131 |	Funeral homes
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,712	| IOT131 |	And I don't just buy like
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,784	| IOT131 |	Smart home setup one time you'll be by
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,832	| IOT131 |	No one at a time like this
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:03,136	| IOT131 |	Smart TV yellow speaker
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:07,232	| IOT131 |	Light bulbs and so on so what happens is that gradually your home
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT131 |	Get smarter and smarter
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,816	| IOT131 |	Problem is the fact condition
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:17,216	| IOT131 |	Because you don't buy them all at once you may end up buying different things from different manufacturers that have various kinds of ecosystems
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,240	| IOT131 |	Psychedelics
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:21,312	| IOT131 |	Make them all work together is really dead
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,664	| IOT131 |	So what is Qualcomm doing
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,016	| IOT131 |	Approach is to build
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:32,832	| IOT131 |	Products that can support multiple protocols
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:33,856	| IOT131 |	Add multiple videos
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,136	| IOT131 |	1 SOC
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:37,440	| IOT131 |	For example recently launched
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,488	| IOT131 |	NSLC called UCF 4020
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,280	| IOT131 |	I do that she the first
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:44,096	| IOT131 |	Chip that support multiple RadioShack Wi-Fi
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,120	| IOT131 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,656	| IOT131 |	15.4
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:48,448	| IOT131 |	So this device can
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,496	| IOT131 |	Connect to different
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,264	| IOT131 |	Protocols
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:51,776	| IOT131 |	Different
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,592	| IOT131 |	F-35 customers
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,872	| IOT131 |	Make a product
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,944	| IOT131 |	Then what happens is all the different products
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,992	| IOT131 |	Different radios
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,528	| IOT131 |	Each other and being something
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,296	| IOT131 |	No
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,832	| IOT131 |	In addition to the physical layer
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:05,856	| IOT131 |	We also put in
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:06,880	| IOT131 |	Enough memory
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,648	| IOT131 |	Time in Australia
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,672	| IOT131 |	Austin power this chip
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,464	| IOT131 |	So that it can support multiple
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,072	| IOT131 |	And so on so that
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:15,840	| IOT131 |	Different
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:17,888	| IOT131 |	Products from different manufacturers
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:20,448	| IOT131 |	That support different profiles can also intraplate
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,752	| IOT131 |	And how do you handle
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:23,520	| IOT131 |	Security with device
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,872	| IOT131 |	But why does Noah connected
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:28,896	| IOT131 |	System can be
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,920	| IOT131 |	2% + 20
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:32,480	| IOT131 |	Security Incorporated lot of Hardware basic unit
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,504	| IOT131 |	Features in Terraria
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:38,624	| IOT131 |	Set so that when customers make products using a chipset they're very secure even though they
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:39,136	| IOT131 |	Connect multiple
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,952	| IOT131 |	Where can listeners learn more and get started
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:45,280	| IOT131 |	Qualcomm.com

EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:58,592	| IOT131 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's game
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,128	| IOT131 |	Is Matt Rogers
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,408	| IOT131 |	B founder
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,432	| IOT131 |	Product officer
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT131 |	Over it
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:04,736	| IOT131 |	Hi Matt how are you doing today
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,576	| IOT131 |	It's super great to have you
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,624	| IOT131 |	Alright so last week was a big one
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:11,648	| IOT131 |	I asked you guys
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,464	| IOT131 |	Launched a security system
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:17,536	| IOT131 |	Upcoming doorbell and made some product updates
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,072	| IOT131 |	So we talk about those
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:22,656	| IOT131 |	And we'll get started with just the first Big Sean
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,680	| IOT131 |	Can question that everyone's
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,704	| IOT131 |	Asking which is
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,008	| IOT131 |	Nest security why
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,288	| IOT131 |	Go there
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:31,360	| IOT131 |	That especially since it feels like
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| IOT131 |	Everybody is
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:32,640	| IOT131 |	It's goin down
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:36,992	| IOT131 |	Don't think about building new product want to find out
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,808	| IOT131 |	A lot of people actually everyday problems that you have
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:43,648	| IOT131 |	Energy
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:47,232	| IOT131 |	Home safety felt like the next natural extension
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:50,560	| IOT131 |	A lot of our cameras are Nest cams are used for
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,840	| IOT131 |	Security license
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,632	| IOT131 |	Is really unnatural condition
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:56,448	| IOT131 |	I'm already there anyway and you thought about building
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:58,240	| IOT131 |	Security out in Chicago
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,176	| IOT131 |	Why use umbrella
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,480	| IOT131 |	Okay so what are the holes that you
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,248	| IOT131 |	You saw that you see
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:09,760	| IOT131 |	I think you're feeling with
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:15,904	| IOT131 |	Is it still too hard
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,952	| IOT131 |	So we serve a lot of people have security
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:24,096	| IOT131 |	The ones that do they feel like
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,144	| IOT131 |	A pastor remember the PIN code
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,936	| IOT131 |	Did not reach out the door
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:33,824	| IOT131 |	Yeah because of race against the clock for the alarm system goes on when they get back to their home and the middle tonight
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:42,528	| IOT131 |	Around 90% of time when you're just living with it everyday
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:45,600	| IOT131 |	As opposed to that 1% of time and you actually I need to use
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:48,160	| IOT131 |	And what kind of features in body that
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:50,720	| IOT131 |	Do we think about
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,024	| IOT131 |	We purchase it from several different angles
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:54,048	| IOT131 |	You make it easy
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,888	| IOT131 |	Go to the pin pad if you want to use that
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:04,032	| IOT131 |	But we don't think most people use that so we created this mess
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:08,128	| IOT131 |	For kids
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:17,600	| IOT131 |	Everything that could be
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,136	| IOT131 |	It is there.
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:23,488	| IOT131 |	So you can open up the best app and disarm you on that way and if you forget
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,768	| IOT131 |	Which is xur paper play
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,560	| IOT131 |	Did you forget to arm
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:28,864	| IOT131 |	You're on the road are you already at work
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,656	| IOT131 |	Will send you notification saying hey
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,960	| IOT131 |	Do you want on your system
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:34,496	| IOT131 |	And
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,800	| IOT131 |	Right now you guys have the
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,104	| IOT131 |	Tags you have some sensors that have
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:41,152	| IOT131 |	A couple capabilities built into them and then you have to
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,176	| IOT131 |	The guard The Hub
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,224	| IOT131 |	How other Nest products
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:44,736	| IOT131 |	Work within
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,624	| IOT131 |	People use our Nest cams today for security
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,648	| IOT131 |	Flying drone
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,928	| IOT131 |	You're not there
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:56,256	| IOT131 |	So integrating our cameras with Nest secure was our first priority
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:58,304	| IOT131 |	About the whole experience
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:00,352	| IOT131 |	What things would you want to know end
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:02,912	| IOT131 |	We've learned
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:05,728	| IOT131 |	Is that the video feed is IQ the most important thing for them
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,056	| IOT131 |	To verify that something thrown into home
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,640	| IOT131 |	Those who have security systems today usually have false alarms
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:15,200	| IOT131 |	And the false alarms can be caused by any number of things
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:17,504	| IOT131 |	Having that video to know what's really going on
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,576	| IOT131 |	So
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:23,648	| IOT131 |	Do your phone notifies you that notification itself
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:25,696	| IOT131 |	What's happening in your home
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,976	| IOT131 |	What did you learn for the robbers
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:34,912	| IOT131 |	And at the most basic level they don't want to be caught
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:39,520	| IOT131 |	So they look for homes were doors unlocked and it's really easy to get in
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:42,336	| IOT131 |	Look for master bedroom
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,456	| IOT131 |	So if they see a camera
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:51,040	| IOT131 |	That's already a big barrier that I can work on that house I want to be on sale
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:52,064	| IOT131 |	I want my face overseas
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:55,904	| IOT131 |	With this I talk to some people and they're at they're looking at this and they're like
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:56,672	| IOT131 |	This is
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,696	| IOT131 |	Neat I like
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:58,464	| IOT131 |	DIYs
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,232	| IOT131 |	Security this week
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,512	| IOT131 |	What's compelling for that perspective
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,048	| IOT131 |	But they're looking at the Price Point Inn
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:02,816	| IOT131 |	They're saying
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:03,840	| IOT131 |	Expensive
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,888	| IOT131 |	And I know that when the nest thermostat came
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,680	| IOT131 |	That was a big deal
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:08,704	| IOT131 |	For many teeth
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,984	| IOT131 |	So do you think this is
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,008	| IOT131 |	Price for the Main Street
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,824	| IOT131 |	We think about pricing
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:20,224	| IOT131 |	Total cost of ownership with all of our products as well as something that you buy one value over time
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:23,552	| IOT131 |	There's no contract no walk in those under think so
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:25,088	| IOT131 |	Yes
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:30,464	| IOT131 |	First point of purchase it says on the high side and frankly wanted to build a premium best-in-class
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:38,144	| IOT131 |	Those things always change over time and you want to start at the top and build the best experience possible and things
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:40,960	| IOT131 |	The premium version
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,776	| IOT131 |	That's the only kind of the value of the product
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,824	| IOT131 |	Is immense compared to cannabutter
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,384	| IOT131 |	Of course you get lots more valuable
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,200	| IOT131 |	Okay I am looking forward to being able to
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:52,224	| IOT131 |	Unlock my alarm system
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,528	| IOT131 |	Which I feel like
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,296	| IOT131 |	You guys could totally
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,088	| IOT131 |	That's My Hope
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:41:00,160	| IOT131 |	You're right we could probably do it today
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:05,024	| IOT131 |	This is anything that we
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,840	| IOT131 |	You working a lot of beta testers and field testers of our current
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:12,704	| IOT131 |	And facial recognition technology
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:14,752	| IOT131 |	Is not ready for
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:20,384	| IOT131 |	Today is a lot of situations where we still see every once in awhile we'll get it wrong
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:27,552	| IOT131 |	Especially comes to your home security and safety
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,856	| IOT131 |	Uncertainty but also user in
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:32,416	| IOT131 |	The one we created
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,488	| IOT131 |	Play explicit that the users taking the tag
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,936	| IOT131 |	But that doesn't signal enough user
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,472	| IOT131 |	Have you want to ask
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,752	| IOT131 |	That way song
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,056	| IOT131 |	All right
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:52,895	| IOT131 |	Let's move to the other I thought this was actually a big deal in the announcements
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,943	| IOT131 |	So you made which was putting Google Assistant
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:55,967	| IOT131 |	On the nest cam
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:56,479	| IOT131 |	Indoor IQ
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,295	| IOT131 |	And
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,623	| IOT131 |	So it feels like nesting Google are actually
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:06,207	| IOT131 |	Maybe trying to work a little bit more closely together for a while
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:08,511	| IOT131 |	There were two weaves there was
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:10,559	| IOT131 |	Google home and then there is nasty
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,095	| IOT131 |	It felt like they were
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:14,143	| IOT131 |	Working together basically so what
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:15,167	| IOT131 |	Can we take from this
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,703	| IOT131 |	About how things
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:19,263	| IOT131 |	I don't know how have they changed it Google and nest
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,031	| IOT131 |	Are you guys working
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,799	| IOT131 |	More together
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:25,407	| IOT131 |	We are working very well together
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,199	| IOT131 |	Virgo
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,991	| IOT131 |	We really do working quite closely together
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:34,879	| IOT131 |	Delete the Google Assistant Nest cam IQ
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,183	| IOT131 |	But we could do in terms of
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,279	| IOT131 |	The eyes and the ears and hands
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,559	| IOT131 |	What you want to do with your voice
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:46,399	| IOT131 |	Your people use their Google home a lot for music today
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:48,447	| IOT131 |	Google play me some music
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,983	| IOT131 |	What more things can you do with it
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,591	| IOT131 |	Partnership
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,639	| IOT131 |	Can I check a little bit further
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:00,735	| IOT131 |	Significantly
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:06,367	| IOT131 |	Device to device Communication in town
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:09,695	| IOT131 |	All the way
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:10,719	| IOT131 |	Okay and then
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:12,255	| IOT131 |	There's really became Android
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:13,791	| IOT131 |	So
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:15,583	| IOT131 |	They're still
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,263	| IOT131 |	Give me an offer exists
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:28,127	| IOT131 |	Android things is a great package.
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,271	| IOT131 |	I have to do
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:39,391	| IOT131 |	So it was really important that allows just started to go and
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,159	| IOT131 |	Grab this
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:43,231	| IOT131 |	Operating system get some software by some still working
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,535	| IOT131 |	Get up and running size heated
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:48,351	| IOT131 |	Are you guys using that in your new devices or
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:57,823	| IOT131 |	We are see my end up in the brain
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:01,407	| IOT131 |	I'm sure they appreciate the advice you guys
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:03,455	| IOT131 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:07,807	| IOT131 |	So you talked actually about feeding some of the nest information
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:10,623	| IOT131 |	The Google home and I think that's a really important thing
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,439	| IOT131 |	Back in the day I remember
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,207	| IOT131 |	Talking to Tony
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:16,767	| IOT131 |	Tony fadell about the site
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:19,327	| IOT131 |	Siri context aware
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,607	| IOT131 |	It feels like
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,911	| IOT131 |	On one side Google has a lot of the machine
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:23,423	| IOT131 |	Learning ability
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,727	| IOT131 |	To make the sort of context aware home
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:26,495	| IOT131 |	Possible
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,287	| IOT131 |	And you guys have a lot of the physical Hardware
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:31,103	| IOT131 |	So I'm curious if that Vision still stands
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:32,383	| IOT131 |	How its chain
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,223	| IOT131 |	20 left
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:41,599	| IOT131 |	Setting up my job to keep it going
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:45,951	| IOT131 |	Admission is not changed at all we are still looking to build the conscious home
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:48,255	| IOT131 |	To take care of
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:50,815	| IOT131 |	Turn the World Around It that has not changed
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,095	| IOT131 |	Is anything actually
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,447	| IOT131 |	How do you build that given
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,215	| IOT131 |	The market that we
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,519	| IOT131 |	We have today which is super fragmented
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:01,567	| IOT131 |	And Boolean products
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:04,383	| IOT131 |	From a bunch of different places and maybe different operating systems
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,663	| IOT131 |	Mobile devices in the
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:08,479	| IOT131 |	I don't see them
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:11,807	| IOT131 |	Yes there's a lot of different varieties of Technologies out there
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:15,391	| IOT131 |	But at the time the most important level witches have a user's level
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,695	| IOT131 |	That you were able to tie them all together so
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:19,743	| IOT131 |	Fireworks at Nest program has
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:24,863	| IOT131 |	Even now
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:28,959	| IOT131 |	Things to Google assistant so with the apis for the Google Assistant
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,591	| IOT131 |	Michael Anderson
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:43,039	| IOT131 |	And we'll start school
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:45,855	| IOT131 |	Most homeowners never have to worry about that because
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:46,879	| IOT131 |	It's our jobs
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,647	| IOT131 |	To make it all works
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:50,719	| IOT131 |	Okay and how do you think most homeowners are going to interact
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,767	| IOT131 |	Because I agree with you that a lot of this
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:58,911	| IOT131 |	Taking place it still feels kind of far off for like an easy user interface but voice was a big deal
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:45:59,679	| IOT131 |	So how do you think
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:00,959	| IOT131 |	Will call
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:04,799	| IOT131 |	Intuitive homemade I don't know what to think about this
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,567	| IOT131 |	How are you
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,591	| IOT131 |	Peking that will exist
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:07,615	| IOT131 |	People winter
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:15,807	| IOT131 |	Voice is great but you can't use it for everything
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,855	| IOT131 |	So the reality I think we need to have
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,391	| IOT131 |	Variety
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:23,999	| IOT131 |	But people use phones don't really important
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:25,023	| IOT131 |	Watches
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,607	| IOT131 |	Interacting with something
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:32,703	| IOT131 |	And that one day hopefully we will use our watches to tag in and out of her house
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:33,471	| IOT131 |	An example
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,519	| IOT131 |	Del Sol TVs are greater face
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,799	| IOT131 |	Actually watching video
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:38,335	| IOT131 |	Everything about having
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:44,735	| IOT131 |	3 cameras in your home for cameras watching the
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:45,503	| IOT131 |	TV
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:46,783	| IOT131 |	Is a fantastic experience
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:51,135	| IOT131 |	You want to be able to tie all these things together
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:57,279	| IOT131 |	We have to have teams working on all these different
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:58,303	| IOT131 |	It's worth it
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:00,351	| IOT131 |	I don't disagree with it being worth it
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:05,215	| IOT131 |	Okay what's a homekit the biggest question that I see coming in is about
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:06,751	| IOT131 |	These Multi-Device household
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,543	| IOT131 |	Or should I buy homekit
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,847	| IOT131 |	Or should I limit my device
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:12,127	| IOT131 |	Purchases only those that are
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:16,991	| IOT131 |	Our home should be locked into anyone platform
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:18,015	| IOT131 |	You changed
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:20,063	| IOT131 |	Smartphones every year every two years
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:22,367	| IOT131 |	But your home is probably most expensive purchase
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:25,439	| IOT131 |	It's your longest turn asset
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,463	| IOT131 |	Tire home
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,231	| IOT131 |	Switch phones
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:28,511	| IOT131 |	It doesn't make any sense
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:34,399	| IOT131 |	So you obviously have a great presence in Iowa
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,935	| IOT131 |	And we're always talking about Apple
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,263	| IOT131 |	Integrated home care experience
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:41,567	| IOT131 |	We're not there today but one day we will be
