EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:52,480	| IOT178 |	Our Guest is Tyler Baker who is the CTO of foundries. IO this is a brand-new iot
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:53,248	| IOT178 |	Platform from the
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,528	| IOT178 |	The people who brought you lindaro
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:56,320	| IOT178 |	This is
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:01:00,160	| IOT178 |	We'll talk about is basically offering security-as-a-service
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,720	| IOT178 |	Interesting points there
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:06,304	| IOT178 |	And we're going to have a message from our sponsor Netgear
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:07,328	| IOT178 |	Talking about
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,120	| IOT178 |	Inside wi-fi system
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,936	| IOT178 |	So let's get this show started
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:13,472	| IOT178 |	With a message from
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:13,984	| IOT178 |	Another one
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:21,920	| IOT178 |	This week sponsor is a pharaoh are you looking for an iot platform find out why Kenmore
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:28,320	| IOT178 |	Angelique picked a farro a farro customers have experienced as much as 80% reduction in
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:34,720	| IOT178 |	I'm too Market 99% you are support calls and a 10x higher activation rate
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:41,120	| IOT178 |	They can we use 90% of their work from one project to the next to learn more is it a pharaoh
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:44,960	| IOT178 |	Bro. IO that's a f e r o. IO
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:47,520	| IOT178 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:50,080	| IOT178 |	Let us get this
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:50,592	| IOT178 |	Party started
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:51,872	| IOT178 |	Let's talk about Facebook
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,152	| IOT178 |	Aloha
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,456	| IOT178 |	I don't know if they mean Hello or goodbye
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:58,016	| IOT178 |	That is there
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,784	| IOT178 |	Voice
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| IOT178 |	Service that they are
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:06,464	| IOT178 |	Planning to do there's a Code out there for Aloha even leading to additional code talking about a smart
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,232	| IOT178 |	Speaker called
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:07,744	| IOT178 |	Portal
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,024	| IOT178 |	And
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,792	| IOT178 |	I think
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:12,608	| IOT178 |	We talked about a Facebook speaker in the past because
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:15,680	| IOT178 |	They were supposed to be rolling out
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,264	| IOT178 |	Speaker earlier last year
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,544	| IOT178 |	499
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,848	| IOT178 |	That is high 1 and 2
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:26,688	| IOT178 |	Yeah she makes sense because Facebook doesn't make any hardware so I don't know what kind of
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,248	| IOT178 |	Economies of scale they have to build off of it.
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,272	| IOT178 |	Point right so that's
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,064	| IOT178 |	It's going to be a challenge for that Miss fat is
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,344	| IOT178 |	True on the price
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,160	| IOT178 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,928	| IOT178 |	Lynch
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| IOT178 |	Pink is
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,464	| IOT178 |	Privacy
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| IOT178 |	Privacy
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,512	| IOT178 |	Facebook
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,536	| IOT178 |	People don't really trust based
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,096	| IOT178 |	And that was why
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,912	| IOT178 |	Put their plans on hold it sounded like originally
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:49,728	| IOT178 |	I don't think they've actually solve their problems
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:53,312	| IOT178 |	Sweet People worried about privacy I know that people are still on Facebook
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:56,128	| IOT178 |	But think about how prevalent the rumor is that
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:03:01,504	| IOT178 |	Your Facebook is constantly listening in even on your phone people take this all the time cuz they'll be talking about something
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,040	| IOT178 |	Sunnyvale CA
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:08,928	| IOT178 |	Yeah that's a good point in fact the whole speaker plans
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,952	| IOT178 |	Seem to fall
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:16,352	| IOT178 |	Part last year when there were major privacy concerns brought up by the US government with the election and
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:20,192	| IOT178 |	Other consumer issues there so yeah and it made sense to back off on that up
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,240	| IOT178 |	I'm not even sure it makes sense to
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:27,872	| IOT178 |	Continue it though you tell me and I do use Facebook Facebook for my private stuff we have a Facebook page
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,920	| IOT178 |	Stacey on iot
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,944	| IOT178 |	So we use it
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,480	| IOT178 |	Mail from business standpoint
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,808	| IOT178 |	And I use messenger with the family because that allows me to be crossed
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,600	| IOT178 |	Platform since I switched phones
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,136	| IOT178 |	SOI Theron on iMessage
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,696	| IOT178 |	Set reminder on Android you can't get me there so
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,232	| IOT178 |	I don't really see the
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,304	| IOT178 |	Point of this because they want to add voice to their
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,584	| IOT178 |	Messaging apps
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,864	| IOT178 |	And
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,632	| IOT178 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:56,032	| IOT178 |	Through your posts even through Instagram is a chat service and I don't see a huge benefit they're from
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:00,128	| IOT178 |	An end-user standpoint I certainly see a benefit for Facebook cuz maybe we'll get even more of our day.
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,200	| IOT178 |	What do you think even though you may not use Facebook as much as I do
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:07,040	| IOT178 |	Will it might be because when you talk to Facebook
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| IOT178 |	Messenger
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,832	| IOT178 |	You're actually using
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,136	| IOT178 |	Google are apples
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| IOT178 |	Speech to text
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:18,559	| IOT178 |	Yes because that's the keyboard will pop up so whatever keyboard you're using and it could be a third-party keyboard in fact on Android
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,167	| IOT178 |	Somebody else is getting the data Facebook is not
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:28,287	| IOT178 |	The only thing you can do natively in the app is record a voice clip which then gets sent as an audio file
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:32,383	| IOT178 |	Okay so Facebook probably wants access to that sweet sweet voice data
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,919	| IOT178 |	Because then you can build all kinds of
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,527	| IOT178 |	Another idea in this does not throw me at all but
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:42,367	| IOT178 |	Die-hard Facebook users might but imagine something like Google's
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:46,975	| IOT178 |	Flip camera that uses machine-learning to understand when to take the best pictures
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:51,839	| IOT178 |	Maybe imagine like something like that in your home from Facebook and then you could just send those pictures to your loved ones
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,911	| IOT178 |	I would again never do that
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:05:01,311	| IOT178 |	But I would never do that either but your point makes more sense when you even think about the patents that Facebook
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:07,455	| IOT178 |	Has which also came to like this week via TechCrunch reported this story they have they been Facebook as a pet
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| IOT178 |	For a smart
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,039	| IOT178 |	Speaker as well as a
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,599	| IOT178 |	Smart camera and a video
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,879	| IOT178 |	Camera so
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:19,743	| IOT178 |	Doesn't mean you're going to use those patents for actual products but you're right they could
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,047	| IOT178 |	Facebook with
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,631	| IOT178 |	And so when I can people
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT178 |	I guess I mean
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:30,239	| IOT178 |	It's really a shame that we don't have unified platform
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,519	| IOT178 |	Farms for video chat
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,567	| IOT178 |	Thanks apple with FaceTime
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,591	| IOT178 |	Hangout I guess
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,663	| IOT178 |	I'm just kind of like
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,759	| IOT178 |	You know the telephone at work so well right now we're adding video
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,807	| IOT178 |	We want to share so much more with our loved ones in
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:51,231	| IOT178 |	The telephone was great except that little rotary thing with numbers on it and it just doesn't make sense to Millennials it's actually kind of funny
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,511	| IOT178 |	Chords
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| IOT178 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,607	| IOT178 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,679	| IOT178 |	This is an iot story
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,959	| IOT178 |	Sort of
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,751	| IOT178 |	It's been
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| IOT178 |	What is why you put all these sensors in place
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:09,407	| IOT178 |	It's not because you're like
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,991	| IOT178 |	It's so you guys should do cool things
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:19,391	| IOT178 |	Lake Google basically save 40% in cooling cost or electrical cost for there
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| IOT178 |	Data Center
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:21,951	| IOT178 |	Beihai
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,255	| IOT178 |	And again the sensors that.
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| IOT178 |	People that data
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:30,655	| IOT178 |	So every time we talk about businesses and iot we're talking about this idea
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,935	| IOT178 |	Digital transformation
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,983	| IOT178 |	This is a really great
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,263	| IOT178 |	And scary example
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,823	| IOT178 |	Doing that and moving from
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,639	| IOT178 |	The AI making recommendations to people
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,431	| IOT178 |	To actually
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,711	| IOT178 |	Take action in automator
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,807	| IOT178 |	This is a really scary step whenever I talk to Industrial iot people there like
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:51,135	| IOT178 |	That's a terrible idea will never do it
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:51,903	| IOT178 |	Well they made
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,183	| IOT178 |	Google did
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,207	| IOT178 |	And again
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| IOT178 |	Energy-savings
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:03,935	| IOT178 |	And see I think this is what people lose when they talk about IRT because it means so many things to so many different people weave
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:07,519	| IOT178 |	We've had data collection and big data for several years now
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,567	| IOT178 |	Analyzing data is not new
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| IOT178 |	Doing something
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,615	| IOT178 |	Automated
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,151	| IOT178 |	Based on the data
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,687	| IOT178 |	That is new
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:20,575	| IOT178 |	The new wish in a way that people can have a bad day and I noticed something
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| IOT178 |	And then you can make even finer
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:25,439	| IOT178 |	More finely-tuned things when you're automating based on machines
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,023	| IOT178 |	I'm excited about
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,351	| IOT178 |	So this is a big deal it almost actually
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,631	| IOT178 |	The Energy savings
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,191	| IOT178 |	Garnered from this almost made up for
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,215	| IOT178 |	The cost
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,007	| IOT178 |	Energy using
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,823	| IOT178 |	Kris of adding new data centers
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,615	| IOT178 |	So is a big deal because
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| IOT178 |	As you guys are
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:48,479	| IOT178 |	Crusader digital footprint
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:53,343	| IOT178 |	Connected devices best we need to build data centers and eventually we could be like
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,135	| IOT178 |	Data centers are sucking on their power
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:59,743	| IOT178 |	About 1.8% of all electricity generated according to a report in 22
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| IOT178 |	16
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,279	| IOT178 |	Is a long time ago
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,863	| IOT178 |	That actually that report was saying that by now would be
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,655	| IOT178 |	We almost be screwed but
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:10,495	| IOT178 |	So far we're using things like Renewables and
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,775	| IOT178 |	Techniques like this to
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| IOT178 |	Keep it
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,823	| IOT178 |	Relatively flat
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:16,383	| IOT178 |	Which is good now we just need the Bitcoin miners to stop
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,479	| IOT178 |	Yeah a lot of areas have you
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,039	| IOT178 |	Speaking of what type of scary
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,343	| IOT178 |	This is a survey from dynatrace
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,463	| IOT178 |	Over half of consumers worldwide are using iot devices
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| IOT178 |	Two-thirds of those
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,071	| IOT178 |	I've already encountered
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:35,839	| IOT178 |	Performance issue
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,119	| IOT178 |	And
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:40,191	| IOT178 |	SLO with lots of devices
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,471	| IOT178 |	True statement
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:45,823	| IOT178 |	Consumers experience on average 1.5 digital performance problems every day
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:51,711	| IOT178 |	And 62% of people fear the number of problems they encounter in the frequency will increase due to the rise of iot
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| IOT178 |	Just call that glitches
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:09:01,439	| IOT178 |	This ridiculous that was interesting as well 72% of consumers Faith likely that glitches in iot apps will cost
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| IOT178 |	Serious injuries
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,231	| IOT178 |	Yes I could
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,791	| IOT178 |	Of course
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:09,631	| IOT178 |	They're including in the survey they talked about self-driving cars and so on
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,167	| IOT178 |	Support so yeah you have a glitch there
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,447	| IOT178 |	Certainly you
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| IOT178 |	Probably have an injury but
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,239	| IOT178 |	Regardless
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:21,407	| IOT178 |	It's a valid concern performance issues they're worried about RB
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| IOT178 |	Because of bugs in them
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:25,247	| IOT178 |	Technology
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:30,367	| IOT178 |	It has not been part of the reason it has not it's because I
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,671	| IOT178 |	WiseWay two years ago we bought this house
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,463	| IOT178 |	I've never carried a key to this house
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,255	| IOT178 |	But the Smart Lock I bought
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,791	| IOT178 |	Has a
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| IOT178 |	Keypad as well
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,375	| IOT178 |	So the only way I can be locked out is it the battery
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:41,887	| IOT178 |	Actually die
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,423	| IOT178 |	That is
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,495	| IOT178 |	However however
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:50,591	| IOT178 |	Just like people use the little high-tech he's actually hide a key somewhere
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,871	| IOT178 |	Somebody smart locks
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,175	| IOT178 |	Have 9 volt terminals
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,247	| IOT178 |	Hidden underneath them if you have a 9-volt battery you can give enough
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| IOT178 |	Juice to actually get in your house
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,343	| IOT178 |	I'm not saying I hit a battery but
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:01,855	| IOT178 |	You never know
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,767	| IOT178 |	Karaoke I carry a knife
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,095	| IOT178 |	Little steel wall I can start a fire
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,631	| IOT178 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,703	| IOT178 |	Absolutely put steel wool on a 9-volt battery new and turns into flames
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| IOT178 |	Very handy for camping
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,591	| IOT178 |	Life or death situations
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,431	| IOT178 |	Okay you're my friend I'll carry steel wool
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,711	| IOT178 |	You carry your battery and
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,479	| IOT178 |	And together
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,503	| IOT178 |	When we conquer the world
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:30,783	| IOT178 |	We're ready for the Apollo
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| IOT178 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| IOT178 |	Zombies
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:37,951	| IOT178 |	Let's talk about some another performance problems associated with the iot
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,303	| IOT178 |	64% of customers fear not being able to control lights in the
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,863	| IOT178 |	Okay this is happened to me
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| IOT178 |	Insomniac
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,191	| IOT178 |	Vacations all ask madame
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,239	| IOT178 |	Somehow
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| IOT178 |	My
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,287	| IOT178 |	Get connected light switch
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,311	| IOT178 |	Become disconnect
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| IOT178 |	From something
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,359	| IOT178 |	Or they'll get reset
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| IOT178 |	So this is a legit
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| IOT178 |	Agreed
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,943	| IOT178 |	Senior
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,479	| IOT178 |	And this is kind of a
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,015	| IOT178 |	This is why we think trust is sober
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:08,159	| IOT178 |	81% of consumers are concerned that technology or software problems with Smart Meters will lead to them being overcharged
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,439	| IOT178 |	Forecast electricity
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:09,951	| IOT178 |	In water
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,487	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:16,607	| IOT178 |	I never thought about that but it's valid all the time both from like
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:19,423	| IOT178 |	You know your electrical provider all the way from
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,983	| IOT178 |	Like Verizon in your phone bill and
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,591	| IOT178 |	This is not necessarily a function of like sensors and iot Tech as much as it is like
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,407	| IOT178 |	Billing systems on the back end everything is automated
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,943	| IOT178 |	Why do things make
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| IOT178 |	Crunches
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,479	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:36,063	| IOT178 |	I may start going out to my meters in manually recording because
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| IOT178 |	I never thought of this
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,415	| IOT178 |	Two-sided
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:43,487	| IOT178 |	I guess it double-sided access to some of these things
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,511	| IOT178 |	There are
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,279	| IOT178 |	Devices
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,327	| IOT178 |	Like curb or smapi
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,607	| IOT178 |	Or I can sense
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:51,423	| IOT178 |	That you can install on your phone that measures your electricity
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:51,935	| IOT178 |	Consumption
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| IOT178 |	So you can actually check that against you
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,543	| IOT178 |	Entirely
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,847	| IOT178 |	The same like one-to-one the same but it should be right
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,943	| IOT178 |	Yeah yeah some of those they go right into your electrical panel
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,455	| IOT178 |	If I recall
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,551	| IOT178 |	And so something like that or having a water flow meter
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:10,879	| IOT178 |	Are there so many
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,999	| IOT178 |	You can actually double-check that so I actually think
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:21,375	| IOT178 |	Yeah you get the added benefit because a lot of those water flow things will
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,935	| IOT178 |	Actually shut your water off because they're smart enough to know there's
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:26,751	| IOT178 |	Water slide when it really shouldn't be or normally isn't
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,335	| IOT178 |	So would prevent leaks and then you get the added benefit of being able to monitor
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,359	| IOT178 |	The actual slow as well
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,895	| IOT178 |	Yasso
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,687	| IOT178 |	While I agree that
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,711	| IOT178 |	Iot
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:38,783	| IOT178 |	He's going to add another layer of complexity to are already comp
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,551	| IOT178 |	Complex systems
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,575	| IOT178 |	I don't think it's
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,111	| IOT178 |	Will get more glitches but
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,135	| IOT178 |	You know we still don't have
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:45,439	| IOT178 |	Systems in place really too
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:49,791	| IOT178 |	Affect the glitches we have already in our existing systems look at like what happened with
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,327	| IOT178 |	Verizon employee not turning
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,863	| IOT178 |	Not not throttling
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,167	| IOT178 |	In California
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,703	| IOT178 |	That's something that actually
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,215	| IOT178 |	Automation
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,263	| IOT178 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:05,663	| IOT178 |	One would think yes I'm working on this fire for Emily weeks now let's not throttle the fire
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,199	| IOT178 |	Men and women that are fighting this fire
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,503	| IOT178 |	I don't know
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,015	| IOT178 |	I feel like
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,343	| IOT178 |	Doesn't change it at
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:15,903	| IOT178 |	But
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:20,767	| IOT178 |	It's because people don't understand all the things you can do once you've connected
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,279	| IOT178 |	Things like
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:27,679	| IOT178 |	That's me what it is they haven't thought through every possible use cases there are so many it's not until something bad happens like
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,727	| IOT178 |	We could have prevented that we have that data
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,263	| IOT178 |	And then the problem gets off
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,287	| IOT178 |	Yeah but that's kind of how
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,103	| IOT178 |	I know enough
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,431	| IOT178 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,455	| IOT178 |	Scary
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,991	| IOT178 |	This is an interesting article
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,015	| IOT178 |	Wolfram bleeping come
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,087	| IOT178 |	Computer tell you about flaws in smart irrigation system
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| IOT178 |	And in this is actually
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:50,463	| IOT178 |	A team of Israeli researchers
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,511	| IOT178 |	Showed how
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,047	| IOT178 |	If you attack a couple
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:56,351	| IOT178 |	Irrigation system so smart Homer
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,631	| IOT178 |	You can actually use them
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,679	| IOT178 |	Campuses use them all kinds of
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,007	| IOT178 |	Please use them as well but if you attack enough sprinklers
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:05,311	| IOT178 |	You can empty a water tower
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,615	| IOT178 |	Dtac sprinklers
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:10,943	| IOT178 |	From Blue spray machine
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,991	| IOT178 |	And they found me
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,759	| IOT178 |	The sand
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,807	| IOT178 |	They reported all their vulnerabilities
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:19,135	| IOT178 |	But in drought-stricken areas this is actually a big tissue
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,927	| IOT178 |	And a problem
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:24,255	| IOT178 |	Do I tell people not to connect to their sprinklers
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,535	| IOT178 |	I don't know what's
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,815	| IOT178 |	The solution here
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:32,959	| IOT178 |	No I mean I wouldn't not have the product if you need it and you're aware of the vulnerabilities and the fact that these
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,519	| IOT178 |	Bardos are reported and likely be fixed
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,567	| IOT178 |	I wouldn't say don't do it
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,383	| IOT178 |	But it's scary that if it's almost like a denial-of-service
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,687	| IOT178 |	Like on the internet if somebody had control it
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:48,831	| IOT178 |	Theoretically here they did a damage calculation of 13550 sprinklers they could get rid of
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,111	| IOT178 |	3
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:54,207	| IOT178 |	1787 cubic meters of water in
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:58,815	| IOT178 |	6 minutes from a water tower and that is what they say typical water tower capacity
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,583	| IOT178 |	6 minutes
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| IOT178 |	You would drain
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,447	| IOT178 |	The local water tower in this actually ties that something I put in
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:04,959	| IOT178 |	My newsletter
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:10,847	| IOT178 |	I had talked about again it's like a DDOS attack on the electrical grid basically
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:14,175	| IOT178 |	You can overwhelm an electrical grid if you pull
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,711	| IOT178 |	Too much demand
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT178 |	On the system
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:22,111	| IOT178 |	So the idea was you just use you know what your tacoyote devices and you
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,975	| IOT178 |	Increase air conditionings for example air conditioners to all run at the same time
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,815	| IOT178 |	I called it like flushing all the toilets at once in a door
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,839	| IOT178 |	Again this is
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,887	| IOT178 |	These are real world impacts from
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,727	| IOT178 |	Insecure devices that we might not think about like I may not be like
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,263	| IOT178 |	Soma air conditioners
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,055	| IOT178 |	An extra 20 minutes
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,335	| IOT178 |	If you time
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,615	| IOT178 |	Play across all of
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:44,895	| IOT178 |	That could be a problem
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,431	| IOT178 |	That's a brown out
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:52,831	| IOT178 |	So there we go there scary things in the Internet of Things a popular connected device
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:56,159	| IOT178 |	You may own it has been
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,231	| IOT178 |	I guess we'll say has been hacked
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,535	| IOT178 |	Again
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,095	| IOT178 |	We talk about these things all the time this one is pretty
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,119	| IOT178 |	Chicken dip
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,655	| IOT178 |	So I'm not unplugging
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:12,031	| IOT178 |	And it's only the WeMo Insight smart plug which is an older model
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,311	| IOT178 |	I know this
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:17,151	| IOT178 |	I have two of them as well in fact I recommended people use that
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,943	| IOT178 |	Plug your Hub into it because
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:22,527	| IOT178 |	You could get your hand goes down you could remotely start your hub
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:24,831	| IOT178 |	With a WeMo Insight smart plug
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:31,231	| IOT178 |	Yeah you're right this is that very particular attack I wouldn't want you to panic over it but the McAfee folks essentially down
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,791	| IOT178 |	Downloaded or extracted the firmware off
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,119	| IOT178 |	Open insight smart plug created their own little
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,655	| IOT178 |	Smart plug on a board
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:45,055	| IOT178 |	And then hacked it and then they can punch holes in your router and all that the thing is they would actually have to be on your
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,591	| IOT178 |	Neural network to do this
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,895	| IOT178 |	Be physically present is not a
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:52,991	| IOT178 |	Thing that you should worry about per se and I'm sure that WeMo will fix it
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,759	| IOT178 |	But it should be
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,295	| IOT178 |	But yes it
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,319	| IOT178 |	Another
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,111	| IOT178 |	So if anyone
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| IOT178 |	When comes into your house as
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,671	| IOT178 |	Your Wifi password
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,951	| IOT178 |	Don't get it don't give it to
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,535	| IOT178 |	This is where I'm going to just stress the importance of guests
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:11,423	| IOT178 |	If you're going to build an iot this is another thing.
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:14,495	| IOT178 |	And you put them on a guest Network and that's the same network you give to like
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,007	| IOT178 |	Your kids friends
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,031	| IOT178 |	That's a bad idea to
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:21,663	| IOT178 |	Just use the rule that I use at my house when you come over it's BYO I bring your own internet
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,687	| IOT178 |	Just use your for cheap
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,039	| IOT178 |	You're getting nothing
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:27,807	| IOT178 |	Zippo
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,135	| IOT178 |	Terrifying
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,183	| IOT178 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,839	| IOT178 |	So if you guys are familiar with Vera
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,607	| IOT178 |	Z-Wave hub
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:48,799	| IOT178 |	The company has been bought by a company which makes its own
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,567	| IOT178 |	Z-Wave hub
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,615	| IOT178 |	So what can we expect for this
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,151	| IOT178 |	Z-Wave hub
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,783	| IOT178 |	Well it's interesting what easy yellow and I don't know if it's that works as a little but whatever
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,343	| IOT178 |	It's interesting with Z-Wave hubs they make
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:05,183	| IOT178 |	They are super small and one reminds me of the Samsung
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:11,583	| IOT178 |	SmartThings link USB stick that I have in my Nvidia Shield which add zigbee and Z-Wave to my
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,887	| IOT178 |	Shield and it makes it run the SmartThings
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:19,007	| IOT178 |	Software so it becomes a hub easy yellow makes really small Z-Wave only hubs
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,543	| IOT178 |	One is a USB stick
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:24,895	| IOT178 |	One is actually a plug you just plug it into your electrical outlet
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:28,223	| IOT178 |	And I love that idea I love it cuz I don't want to see boxes all over
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:31,807	| IOT178 |	Correct
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:32,831	| IOT178 |	Avira soft
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:36,927	| IOT178 |	On
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,375	| IOT178 |	Yeah I don't know about
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,703	| IOT178 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| IOT178 |	Never use it
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,239	| IOT178 |	No idea
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:50,751	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,055	| IOT178 |	C3 is another tire
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:57,663	| IOT178 |	So C3 which is Tom siebels company they started out doing smart grid Smart Energy Management
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,479	| IOT178 |	Slowly transition to iot and
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,271	| IOT178 |	Of course AI
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,295	| IOT178 |	They have
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:07,135	| IOT178 |	Done a link up with the Google Cloud this means they support now the cuckoo
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:11,743	| IOT178 |	Cloud Amazon and Azure what's interesting to me here is that Google has
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:16,095	| IOT178 |	Really beat up their industrial iot efforts they did a deal with company called
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| IOT178 |	Foghorn
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,143	| IOT178 |	Dayton
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:20,703	| IOT178 |	Others with industrial companies on the last Light
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,239	| IOT178 |	I hear maybe since CES
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:29,151	| IOT178 |	They've really started digging into industrial iot cuz they have been very far behind
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,687	| IOT178 |	An Enterprise is
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:37,855	| IOT178 |	Yeah we've talked about that a number of times but what is Google's iot strategy which is not a cohesive message and so I'm but I agree
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:44,255	| IOT178 |	This year has been a big year of catching up I'm not going to say they have caught up or haven't we'll see but this is definitely
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:48,863	| IOT178 |	The year they have made big strides and just real quick to plug something
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,655	| IOT178 |	Not smart plug but just plug plug
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:53,215	| IOT178 |	I was on the twit network
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:56,031	| IOT178 |	Know-how show which they cover IRT
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,311	| IOT178 |	And I was a guest
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:00,383	| IOT178 |	Talking about Google Android Android things
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:06,527	| IOT178 |	Industrial iot so I don't know if what I said make sense but if you want to listen to it and go to twitch.tv
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,111	| IOT178 |	Did I do okay
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,415	| IOT178 |	I don't like you did all right
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,463	| IOT178 |	Yes I did
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,839	| IOT178 |	The other person was a homekit person with
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,911	| IOT178 |	Enterprise industrial iot and I
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,191	| IOT178 |	Didn't agree at all with
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,751	| IOT178 |	What he said I didn't hear it until after it was
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,311	| IOT178 |	Published so I couldn't reply that so to speak but
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,103	| IOT178 |	Yeah that could just be me
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,967	| IOT178 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,783	| IOT178 |	Let's move on to Wi-Fi for airports
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:44,927	| IOT178 |	Security I know this is a Wi-Fi story is it an iot story only reason I put it in here it's cuz we talked actually
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,463	| IOT178 |	About various systems in
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,231	| IOT178 |	The home
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,791	| IOT178 |	That use Wifi as a security system
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,559	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:54,655	| IOT178 |	Wi-Fi is radio waves you guys and if you analyze those ready you can see things
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,447	| IOT178 |	And apparently you can see the
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,727	| IOT178 |	Very clearly
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,519	| IOT178 |	According to this research
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,591	| IOT178 |	You can find
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:05,151	| IOT178 |	Dimensions of metal objects or estimate the volume
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,175	| IOT178 |	Liquids
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:09,759	| IOT178 |	And this is a 95% accurate system
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:13,599	| IOT178 |	And this might make it so you don't have to do things like pull your laptop out of your thing
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,135	| IOT178 |	The TSA line
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,647	| IOT178 |	War
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,440	| IOT178 |	Toiletries
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,720	| IOT178 |	3 oz
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,256	| IOT178 |	Containers in the ziplock bag
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:25,376	| IOT178 |	The wi-fi system had a success rate of 99% for recognizing dangerous objects
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,680	| IOT178 |	98% / metals
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,448	| IOT178 |	And 95%
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,800	| IOT178 |	Now here is it perfect
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,080	| IOT178 |	Use for something that
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,104	| IOT178 |	They wouldn't use
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,872	| IOT178 |	Because it's
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,896	| IOT178 |	Kimpton products
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,920	| IOT178 |	Google Glass
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:41,504	| IOT178 |	If you had TSA agents while you were standing in line walking around
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,576	| IOT178 |	They could be getting a feedback from the Wi-Fi signal
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:50,720	| IOT178 |	House and seeing individuals and who should be taking stuff out of their bag
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,024	| IOT178 |	Looks like a brick and I want to know what it is or you got
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:55,072	| IOT178 |	Too much liquid in there
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:57,376	| IOT178 |	Actually you could disable the Google
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,400	| IOT178 |	Last.of.the couldn't take
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:58,912	| IOT178 |	Screenshot switch
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,472	| IOT178 |	Indeed
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,776	| IOT178 |	Yasso though although although
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:08,128	| IOT178 |	That would also be useful for known Travelers and people who are on the do not fly list
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,688	| IOT178 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,480	| IOT178 |	What can revive Google Glass on the Shelf
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,040	| IOT178 |	I still have my
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,320	| IOT178 |	That's why you want
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:21,696	| IOT178 |	But here's my cautionary tale for those of you guys who are like looking at this for a sec
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:25,024	| IOT178 |	Security system and maybe feel more secure because it's not a camera
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,328	| IOT178 |	This is pretty granular
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,376	| IOT178 |	So it may not actually be
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,144	| IOT178 |	Camera
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:32,704	| IOT178 |	But it's going to know a lot about you
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,472	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,008	| IOT178 |	Keep that in mind and
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:38,336	| IOT178 |	Because Wi-Fi signals are not contained unless you live in a faraday cage
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,920	| IOT178 |	You can actually read this outside your building so people can actually
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:44,224	| IOT178 |	Using this type of gear see what's
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:48,064	| IOT178 |	Like motion and what's happening inside your house even if they're not in
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,576	| IOT178 |	Insight it
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,904	| IOT178 |	Alright so
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| IOT178 |	That's my a lake
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,488	| IOT178 |	Before we get all excited about this technology
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,536	| IOT178 |	Which I do hold you or
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,376	| IOT178 |	RAB
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,144	| IOT178 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,936	| IOT178 |	Has a Duo device
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,984	| IOT178 |	Reduce the Fitbit charge 3
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,008	| IOT178 |	Which
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,800	| IOT178 |	I'm excited about
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,848	| IOT178 |	Because I have a charge 2
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,896	| IOT178 |	I love it I wear it almost everyday
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:17,504	| IOT178 |	But I don't wear it it means I'm losing with my best friend cuz we have a competition going on
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,552	| IOT178 |	Who can burn the most calories in
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,320	| IOT178 |	Take the most steps
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:26,976	| IOT178 |	So I think I might get this I'm going to be due for a new Fitbit probably in six months or so this one goes on sale after
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,000	| IOT178 |	First
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,280	| IOT178 |	I might pick it up
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:33,888	| IOT178 |	This one is $150 I don't know what you paid for your charge 2
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:40,800	| IOT178 |	As far as what you're going to get if you do upgrade
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:47,200	| IOT178 |	You will get app notifications what you don't currently get on your charge 2 I'm sure that's optional if you don't want them
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:47,968	| IOT178 |	Not
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,504	| IOT178 |	Easy to no problem
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:52,576	| IOT178 |	I thought I would think you would because you don't carry your phone
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:58,720	| IOT178 |	More often than not and as long as you're in range of Bluetooth of your phone you would get notifications I could be a poor
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,888	| IOT178 |	What's eating out
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:10,752	| IOT178 |	Applications are actually useful for me because when I'm not near my phone
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:15,104	| IOT178 |	Animal my Apple watch and you pay me via Hangouts chat which happens we talk during the week
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:21,248	| IOT178 |	A chat on hangouts rather I get that on my watch has a notification and I know that you have a question I can even see the question
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:24,576	| IOT178 |	And so the question you don't know I'm not far
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,112	| IOT178 |	Computer you can't do that
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,136	| IOT178 |	I don't know
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:32,000	| IOT178 |	Okay I don't want to know when Kevin wants to know something
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,048	| IOT178 |	Really need to get me you should probably
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| IOT178 |	Or you should actually
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,632	| IOT178 |	Or
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,192	| IOT178 |	Hack into my WiFi
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,984	| IOT178 |	System and dim my Philips lights
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:48,896	| IOT178 |	Yeah okay so Stacy isn't one of notifications but everybody else can get them on the charge 3
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:52,992	| IOT178 |	On your charge 2 you have an OLED display that you can tap
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,528	| IOT178 |	I know the charge because they
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:58,880	| IOT178 |	Touch screen so I can you can do more than just tap and you can scroll around a little bit easier which is
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,416	| IOT178 |	Probably better navigation
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:06,816	| IOT178 |	You can't go swimming with your charge 2 cuz it's splash-resistant charge 3 is water resistant up to 50m
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,352	| IOT178 |	Kneaders so if you can scuba diving
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,888	| IOT178 |	You know With The Stingrays
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,912	| IOT178 |	That's useful
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:16,288	| IOT178 |	You should get 7 Days on the charge 3 what do you get on your charge 2 right now
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:18,080	| IOT178 |	Roughly actually I get about for 2
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,872	| IOT178 |	Depending on how much
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,968	| IOT178 |	Bright and that you don't get app notifications that's even
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,504	| IOT178 |	That's helping your battery life to I'm sure
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,528	| IOT178 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,064	| IOT178 |	Since I'm such a curmudgeon
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,088	| IOT178 |	Who hate us
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,904	| IOT178 |	Yes so I'm
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT178 |	I'm all in on the
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,208	| IOT178 |	Arnott
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,304	| IOT178 |	Because I need
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:42,912	| IOT178 |	GPS on my wearable because I run everyday and I need to track her
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,192	| IOT178 |	How far in Payson
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,984	| IOT178 |	Splits and so on and so forth
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:52,384	| IOT178 |	So you can do heart rate on the charge devices which I can do on my Apple watch but I have a built-in GPS as well
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,408	| IOT178 |	And
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,688	| IOT178 |	This has a GPS
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,248	| IOT178 |	It's not a cyst it's connect
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:59,040	| IOT178 |	Is your phone
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,088	| IOT178 |	Yeah you can I was like you can get that huge
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,928	| IOT178 |	I don't want to run with my phone
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,232	| IOT178 |	So I don't run with my phone
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,840	| IOT178 |	So yeah and you know Kevin and I were talking about
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,400	| IOT178 |	What you want cuz there's a lot of options out there in the
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:17,472	| IOT178 |	Instatracker / Smartwatch / whatever world
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:21,824	| IOT178 |	And it's kind of nice to say you know what I really need GPS cuz that's going to narrow your
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,592	| IOT178 |	Options
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,360	| IOT178 |	Considerably
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,920	| IOT178 |	Very quickly yes for me I want deep
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:29,248	| IOT178 |	Sleep tracking stats and I also for some reason I'm obsessed
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:31,808	| IOT178 |	So those are
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:38,208	| IOT178 |	And I get that I mean I would never pick a device for you and vice versa
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,768	| IOT178 |	You know what I want what I want and need someone so forth but
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:44,352	| IOT178 |	A lot of people might be saying why aren't you running with us because
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:49,472	| IOT178 |	If you have a problem you need to call somebody in emergency that's another factor that
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,496	| IOT178 |	You should consider
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,264	| IOT178 |	I opted
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:53,056	| IOT178 |	Did for the LTE version of the Apple watch
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,872	| IOT178 |	So my family can call me text me
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:58,432	| IOT178 |	I can call them an emergency
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:02,272	| IOT178 |	I can call the police very quickly with the SOS feature and my
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,576	| IOT178 |	Peeps can find me on find my friends
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,368	| IOT178 |	Because when I leave the home
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:08,416	| IOT178 |	That starts tracking to watch not my phone
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,232	| IOT178 |	Oh and I should tell everybody
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,768	| IOT178 |	Remember back in the day

EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,720	| IOT178 |	Work with
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,000	| IOT178 |	Location of the song
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:56,608	| IOT178 |	Ridin through my wink Hub or buy Amazon Echo
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,632	| IOT178 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,168	| IOT178 |	Could be possible
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,984	| IOT178 |	Feel like it's the Holy Grail I've been doing some errands
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,288	| IOT178 |	Thanks so much guys. The podcast
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,056	| IOT178 |	You should be doing twice a week
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:11,456	| IOT178 |	Oh mark this is an eminently reasonable request and you can do it so many ways we can
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:14,528	| IOT178 |	Can I tell you how to do it
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,552	| IOT178 |	Free to
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:17,088	| IOT178 |	Oh my God now I'm buying it
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,880	| IOT178 |	Entire home security system
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,160	| IOT178 |	Let's get started with three
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,672	| IOT178 |	Because we all
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,208	| IOT178 |	10
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,744	| IOT178 |	You want to start with the iPhone version
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:26,048	| IOT178 |	So I don't know which
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,584	| IOT178 |	Phone platform
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,608	| IOT178 |	Mark and his kids
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,376	| IOT178 |	Have
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:29,888	| IOT178 |	AR
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,704	| IOT178 |	And is to use the find my friends with you
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,472	| IOT178 |	Your family
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:34,752	| IOT178 |	That is free
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,032	| IOT178 |	If you're on iOS
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:39,360	| IOT178 |	There are downsides right off the bat when you
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:43,712	| IOT178 |	Set up a notification for let's say notify me when my kids
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,480	| IOT178 |	Come home
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,248	| IOT178 |	Basically
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,040	| IOT178 |	When I come home you'll get a message
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:49,088	| IOT178 |	The problem is it's a one-and-done thing
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,624	| IOT178 |	So I don't recommend it
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,904	| IOT178 |	Turn all the time you
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:58,048	| IOT178 |	But it is possible to do if your on iPhone you could do it also on Android they have a similar feature
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,072	| IOT178 |	With Google
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,352	| IOT178 |	Maps sharing
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,400	| IOT178 |	I'm not used it for notifications though
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,680	| IOT178 |	It's more of a
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,704	| IOT178 |	Looking
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,240	| IOT178 |	Where people are in a set
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:09,824	| IOT178 |	You may be able to notification I have not tried it yet but those are two
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,616	| IOT178 |	Options not ideal but could work
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:12,896	| IOT178 |	But
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,432	| IOT178 |	Still keeping with the
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:17,504	| IOT178 |	Free but now we've got maybe some more ideal stuff
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,552	| IOT178 |	You can actually put if
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,344	| IOT178 |	Service that
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:23,136	| IOT178 |	Ties web services together
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,928	| IOT178 |	On your handset
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,976	| IOT178 |	Be there a iOS or Android
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:30,304	| IOT178 |	And you would put it on your kids phones to and you would actually
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,840	| IOT178 |	Create applets
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,632	| IOT178 |	It would say when this phone
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| IOT178 |	Either geo-fenced
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,984	| IOT178 |	Or gets into connect to the
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,008	| IOT178 |	Home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:39,776	| IOT178 |	Get a notify
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,056	| IOT178 |	Vacation so then you get it
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:41,824	| IOT178 |	Like a text
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,592	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:43,872	| IOT178 |	That is free
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,664	| IOT178 |	Your kids do have to have that on their phone
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,712	| IOT178 |	So this is not surreptitious but
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| IOT178 |	Your kids probably know that you're trying
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:50,784	| IOT178 |	When they come here
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:57,696	| IOT178 |	I wonder though is there a trigger event for when somebody leaves the Wi-Fi network because Mark wants to track the arrival
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| IOT178 |	DeLand
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:58,976	| IOT178 |	Departure
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:06,912	| IOT178 |	I think there must be an Android I believe there is because I have one when I leave
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,680	| IOT178 |	My phone
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,216	| IOT178 |	Android phone leaves the Wi-Fi net
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,032	| IOT178 |	That's a trigger that I can use to take certain
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:12,800	| IOT178 |	Actions
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,080	| IOT178 |	The natural work
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,640	| IOT178 |	That also means
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,408	| IOT178 |	When
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,944	| IOT178 |	Your kids turn off the Wi-Fi net
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,480	| IOT178 |	For whatever reason
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:20,992	| IOT178 |	You're going to get a
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:24,320	| IOT178 |	Gravely disabled WiFi radio that's correct
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,600	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,392	| IOT178 |	If you want to move up a layer
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,440	| IOT178 |	There's a couple options you can add
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,232	| IOT178 |	Camera with facial recognition
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:35,328	| IOT178 |	Ignition so doorbell cameras I actually have a doorbell camera the nest
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,352	| IOT178 |	That recognizes
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:39,168	| IOT178 |	People in my home and when I walked by it there like
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,448	| IOT178 |	And I just passed the door
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:43,264	| IOT178 |	Or you know they say Anna's home
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:43,776	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,896	| IOT178 |	So this is good if you don't have
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,432	| IOT178 |	A camera in front of every door that you
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:50,944	| IOT178 |	Your kids are going to use
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,808	| IOT178 |	And that may include a subscription fee I'm thinking Nest aware
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:58,880	| IOT178 |	10 bucks a month
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,672	| IOT178 |	Another option
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:03,488	| IOT178 |	Is you just have a nest camera and like facing
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:06,048	| IOT178 |	The front area or an area that you're
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,072	| IOT178 |	Your kids have to pass through
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,864	| IOT178 |	And you'll get the same sort of in
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:12,448	| IOT178 |	Information that you get a notification that movement has been detected
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:18,080	| IOT178 |	And you can go back into the nest app and look and see what the movement was in there for you could then see
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:20,640	| IOT178 |	Who is it and which were they going in around Etc
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:23,456	| IOT178 |	Slightly more proactive options include
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:27,552	| IOT178 |	Lighthouse camera where you can say tell me if you see my kids
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,368	| IOT178 |	Which is kind of fun
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:33,184	| IOT178 |	But it's pricey and that actually has a subscription
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,208	| IOT178 |	And
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:34,976	| IOT178 |	If
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,280	| IOT178 |	You're worried about like your kids sneaking out
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:44,192	| IOT178 |	We're trying to figure out every possible about your kids sneaking out my assumption is you're going to want install
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:44,960	| IOT178 |	Call something on there
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,240	| IOT178 |	Their phone that's going to
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:49,312	| IOT178 |	Biggio fence to your location or your Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,336	| IOT178 |	Cuz they're not going to leave without their
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,408	| IOT178 |	Right I actually have the canary
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:56,224	| IOT178 |	System which you can find now on some decent discount
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:57,504	| IOT178 |	Quite honestly
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:03,648	| IOT178 |	I think I paid 179 or 199 for the base camera and one extension camera cuz I got it free
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:11,840	| IOT178 |	There you go again not for you but not too expensive either and it's the home security camera system it also measures
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:18,240	| IOT178 |	Air quality in your home but it also does the geofencing for you as long as everyone in the family has the canoe
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:24,128	| IOT178 |	Canary app installed and they actually want that installs I'll tell you why because when they come home if the alarm is
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:27,968	| IOT178 |	Active on the canary they can disable it on their phone before they walk in the door
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:31,552	| IOT178 |	Otherwise you may have a siren go off where you may have a police get called back
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,856	| IOT178 |	System so we have
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:37,696	| IOT178 |	The geofencing it set up so every time somebody in my home
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:43,584	| IOT178 |	Leaves the geofence area or arrives I literally get a notification on my Apple watch and on my phone that
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,864	| IOT178 |	So and so is home
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,144	| IOT178 |	So-and-so has left
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:50,240	| IOT178 |	So that's exactly what you want Mark and then again there's a cost
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:55,104	| IOT178 |	And there's a subscription it's 999 a month I had pay for I think the two cameras but
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:56,640	| IOT178 |	It has the geofencing which is
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:59,456	| IOT178 |	Probably the best way to go if you don't mind spending a little money
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,272	| IOT178 |	Markdown options
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,808	| IOT178 |	Options for you
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,088	| IOT178 |	Various price ranges
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,368	| IOT178 |	And I'm sure actually
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,416	| IOT178 |	That we didn't eat
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,696	| IOT178 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,976	| IOT178 |	I would try the free option
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:15,072	| IOT178 |	Tiffany work for you and which case you know you don't have to spend any extra money
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:18,144	| IOT178 |	Good luck and now stay tuned
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,936	| IOT178 |	For our guests who is
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:23,520	| IOT178 |	Tyler Baker the CTO at foundries
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:27,616	| IOT178 |	Which is a new company that's launching
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,640	| IOT178 |	Iot
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:35,040	| IOT178 |	Security platform will talk more about that after the break we are taking a
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:39,904	| IOT178 |	Break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,928	| IOT178 |	Netgear
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:45,024	| IOT178 |	And we have John McHugh who is general manager of commercial networking
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:47,072	| IOT178 |	At Nick here here to talk to us
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:53,216	| IOT178 |	We've been talking a lot about how Netgear has adapted the inside line for the internet of things and no
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:55,008	| IOT178 |	You guys allow
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:59,360	| IOT178 |	Companies to control their power over ethernet devices over the inside line
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,896	| IOT178 |	Do you want to dig into that a bit
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:01,920	| IOT178 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,224	| IOT178 |	And appeal we
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,248	| IOT178 |	We are like
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:08,576	| IOT178 |	Perfect companions one of the things that has more people
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:11,136	| IOT178 |	Putting out Solutions like monitoring
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:13,696	| IOT178 |	Cameras or security lock
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,976	| IOT178 |	Or
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:15,488	| IOT178 |	Speaker
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,048	| IOT178 |	Various other Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,584	| IOT178 |	Controllers and monitor
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,376	| IOT178 |	Defining one of the
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,912	| IOT178 |	Wonderful attributes
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:24,192	| IOT178 |	Network connect
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,520	| IOT178 |	Wired network connection is you can power that device
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:30,080	| IOT178 |	No having to worry about batteries and other things
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:33,664	| IOT178 |	You can power it with a cable that's easy to run and doesn't
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:38,784	| IOT178 |	Represent an electrical shock hazard or require a specialized person to install a
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:43,136	| IOT178 |	What and so what this means is it's kind of a do-it-yourself thing where you at this
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,928	| IOT178 |	DC driven power
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:51,328	| IOT178 |	It is now making all of your internet stuff operate there's a lot of efficiencies around this one of them is if you can
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,352	| IOT178 |	Power your network
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:58,752	| IOT178 |	Would like a backup generator in the case of an emergency all of these devices are going to function as well
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,776	| IOT178 |	Off the same
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:00,800	| IOT178 |	Network cabling
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,104	| IOT178 |	So what I found most interesting
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:03,872	| IOT178 |	About
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:08,224	| IOT178 |	Your control of power over ethernet devices was actually that it's not just control
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:11,040	| IOT178 |	You let customers handle automation tasks
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,320	| IOT178 |	Stutter normally handle
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| IOT178 |	Completely different software
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,368	| IOT178 |	Can you talk about that
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:18,464	| IOT178 |	We knew when we were looking at the application so we're going to run on the
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,768	| IOT178 |	News networks that this power thing was
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:23,328	| IOT178 |	Very fertile ground and if you look at most
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,096	| IOT178 |	Competitor
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| IOT178 |	Devices out there
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:27,168	| IOT178 |	I mean I'll let you turn power on
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,192	| IOT178 |	They let you turn power off
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:31,520	| IOT178 |	We thought a lot about what how customers work
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,288	| IOT178 |	Going to use this
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,848	| IOT178 |	And softly created a bunch of features
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:38,688	| IOT178 |	To enable the models that we thought sit with these devices
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:44,832	| IOT178 |	For example I can power cycle apart so right it's not turning it off and then waiting and then turn it back on
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,368	| IOT178 |	Push a button
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,392	| IOT178 |	A power cycle
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:50,464	| IOT178 |	That's something we need to do to remote devices
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,512	| IOT178 |	Regularly is part of the troubleshooting
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,560	| IOT178 |	Process the other thing is people said
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,352	| IOT178 |	Going to be really cool if I could just
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,632	| IOT178 |	Turn off my WiFi
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:04,544	| IOT178 |	I mean turn it completely off from when I leave at the end of the day till the next morning what could be more so
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,312	| IOT178 |	Secure the net
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,080	| IOT178 |	So you can
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,152	| IOT178 |	Schedule that your all your power devices are certain
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:11,712	| IOT178 |	Shut down a certain time
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:18,112	| IOT178 |	Turn on when you show up the next day at work and so it provides you with this level of Direct Control and phone
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:22,464	| IOT178 |	Functionality to frankly standard Solutions in Computer Solutions just don't have
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:25,024	| IOT178 |	Where can we go to find out more about the in
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:29,632	| IOT178 |	Www.netgear.com
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,168	| IOT178 |	/ inside
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:44,224	| IOT178 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:47,040	| IOT178 |	And today's guest is Tyler Baker who is
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| IOT178 |	CTO at
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,088	| IOT178 |	Foundries
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,856	| IOT178 |	Dot IO
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,160	| IOT178 |	Hi Tyler how are you doing
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,952	| IOT178 |	I'm doing well Stacy how about yourself
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,464	| IOT178 |	Great
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,024	| IOT178 |	I almost said Lennar okay
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,072	| IOT178 |	Cuz that's where half of you guys are from but
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:38:59,584	| IOT178 |	You guys
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:02,144	| IOT178 |	Just launched your company this week
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,168	| IOT178 |	Quickly
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,936	| IOT178 |	Let's
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,960	| IOT178 |	Talk about
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:06,496	| IOT178 |	Just very briefly what you're trying to
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:13,664	| IOT178 |	So we're building a secure iot platform they can be leveraged by many many customers and
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,432	| IOT178 |	The idea is that is
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:17,248	| IOT178 |	Is minimal and is updatable
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:19,296	| IOT178 |	And we have a couple different platform
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:20,832	| IOT178 |	1 for a deeply embedded
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:27,488	| IOT178 |	And the other one would be for the nice class devices
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,024	| IOT178 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:31,840	| IOT178 |	So for some of us were like why what was that
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,376	| IOT178 |	So let's talk about stories for
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:34,656	| IOT178 |	What
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,936	| IOT178 |	Is the problem you are trying
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:36,704	| IOT178 |	How to solve
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,728	| IOT178 |	That is a great
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,032	| IOT178 |	Really what we're trying to solve
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:42,848	| IOT178 |	Is distributed denial-of-service attack
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:45,152	| IOT178 |	That's have a higher bandwidth
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,944	| IOT178 |	Throughput and we never seen before some even
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:52,064	| IOT178 |	And where they're coming from our compromise iot
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:54,624	| IOT178 |	Cameras but it
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:55,136	| IOT178 |	Router
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,608	| IOT178 |	Providing a
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,168	| IOT178 |	People or companies that would like to build IO
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:09,984	| IOT178 |	And allowing them to be
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:10,752	| IOT178 |	Sure
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,288	| IOT178 |	And allowing them to have
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,312	| IOT178 |	Update capabilities
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,968	| IOT178 |	Security is our biggest concern and being able
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:23,040	| IOT178 |	To have the latest software available for a customer
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,160	| IOT178 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:28,928	| IOT178 |	What it take
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,720	| IOT178 |	Cakes to create a secure iot
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,280	| IOT178 |	Because that's the everybody's in gold
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,072	| IOT178 |	Let's make this more secure
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,864	| IOT178 |	So what are the steps that need
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,656	| IOT178 |	What is the bare minimum
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:42,240	| IOT178 |	Yes
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:44,544	| IOT178 |	Images
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:48,128	| IOT178 |	Cryptographically sign
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,456	| IOT178 |	Image into a device
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,760	| IOT178 |	The second thing is
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:56,576	| IOT178 |	The solution that is provided needs to be threat models
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:59,392	| IOT178 |	Innocence that we identify the attack vector
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,672	| IOT178 |	And we decide which
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,464	| IOT178 |	Tigers are not in scope
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:07,328	| IOT178 |	And the ones that are in scope we model them and we say here's the medication
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:12,192	| IOT178 |	So we're under the impression that our software offering here is
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:14,496	| IOT178 |	Completely secure in fact I don't believe any software
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,312	| IOT178 |	D'usse is
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:19,104	| IOT178 |	We use
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:24,224	| IOT178 |	The Upstream software and we basically
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,504	| IOT178 |	Continuously
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,784	| IOT178 |	If you want to look at something like
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:30,624	| IOT178 |	Spectre meltdown bug
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:32,416	| IOT178 |	Turtle very quickly
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:36,000	| IOT178 |	However with older LTS kernel
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,768	| IOT178 |	You can use
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,304	| IOT178 |	Many many weeks
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:40,352	| IOT178 |	Is distribution
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:44,704	| IOT178 |	Should be updated which means a lot of the cloud
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,984	| IOT178 |	Inspector
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,824	| IOT178 |	So our goal is to provide the latest software that's
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,967	| IOT178 |	Imitation
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:03,903	| IOT178 |	Is transmitting data to an educate way
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:07,231	| IOT178 |	So that sounds good I understand the kind of
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:10,815	| IOT178 |	Platform that's always updated with the latest most secure
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,583	| IOT178 |	Version
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,095	| IOT178 |	Of the software
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:13,631	| IOT178 |	But you guys are
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,191	| IOT178 |	You're supporting a bunch of different versions of soft
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:19,007	| IOT178 |	Because you've got your artists you've got basic Linux
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:20,543	| IOT178 |	And then you've got container
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:21,311	| IOT178 |	Focused
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,591	| IOT178 |	Locations so
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,871	| IOT178 |	Explain how all of that
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:24,895	| IOT178 |	Works together
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:31,551	| IOT178 |	What we do is we are actually we work Upstream with those projects a lot of us on the team or maintainers at them so we have a good
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:36,927	| IOT178 |	Advantage
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:44,351	| IOT178 |	Able to understand what's very important
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:46,911	| IOT178 |	Security patches
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:47,679	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,727	| IOT178 |	Wallets very complex systems
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:50,239	| IOT178 |	We have
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:53,311	| IOT178 |	I believe the right expertise in the right places
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:55,359	| IOT178 |	To help us achieve these goals
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:58,175	| IOT178 |	So let's talk about this from the perspective of someone building a
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:42:59,967	| IOT178 |	If I'm making a lipo
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:02,271	| IOT178 |	I need to put your Zephyr
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:02,783	| IOT178 |	Artist
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:03,807	| IOT178 |	Micro plaits
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:04,831	| IOT178 |	On the way
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,111	| IOT178 |	And then
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:08,415	| IOT178 |	I got to put your Linux micro platform
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:11,743	| IOT178 |	It's going to be on the Hub or Gateway that
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,023	| IOT178 |	Stocking a lightbulb and then
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:13,535	| IOT178 |	Talks to the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:16,863	| IOT178 |	And then if I got servers running in the cloud
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,423	| IOT178 |	That's also going to have the Linux micro platform on it
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:26,079	| IOT178 |	So none of those pieces have to be there you could use the platform independently of our Linux microphone
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:30,431	| IOT178 |	The way we've designed the software stack
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:34,015	| IOT178 |	Is that there is no law on open source projects
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:40,159	| IOT178 |	If you choose to use the micro popcorn and maybe you've developed a proprietary Gateway standard
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,719	| IOT178 |	TT
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,767	| IOT178 |	All your educate Wings Temple Modesto
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:50,143	| IOT178 |	We use standard there as well
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,167	| IOT178 |	To allow people
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:51,935	| IOT178 |	Plugged in
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,447	| IOT178 |	Any clubs
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,775	| IOT178 |	It really depends on the use case and where you see
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:44:00,127	| IOT178 |	Ideally we'd love you to run
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:00,895	| IOT178 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:03,455	| IOT178 |	So talk to me about how I would make
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:04,223	| IOT178 |	This decision
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:06,527	| IOT178 |	Because actually first tell me your Revenue
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:09,087	| IOT178 |	So am I being charged
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,367	| IOT178 |	For every version of the micro platform
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:13,439	| IOT178 |	No sew you paid sensually a year lease
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,255	| IOT178 |	Army Zephyr micro platform
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:18,047	| IOT178 |	It is $10,000 a year
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,839	| IOT178 |	And there's no per unit
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| IOT178 |	So it is a per product
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:24,191	| IOT178 |	If you have a stalker build let's say
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:29,567	| IOT178 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:33,151	| IOT178 |	Hardware that is only
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:40,575	| IOT178 |	It's $25,000 a year
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,343	| IOT178 |	Steampunk
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:43,391	| IOT178 |	What is it is a paper product
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:48,767	| IOT178 |	Okay so then what are the trade-offs and reasons I might run it on the edge
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,815	| IOT178 |	So on the light bulb versus on the
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,583	| IOT178 |	The Gateway or
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,887	| IOT178 |	So what would I do
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,423	| IOT178 |	Is we realize that
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:56,703	| IOT178 |	The enterprise software Concepts
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,751	| IOT178 |	Updating your software
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,543	| IOT178 |	Using containers in virtual machine
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:02,591	| IOT178 |	Is really good practices
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:04,895	| IOT178 |	These concepts are widely known by developers in
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:11,807	| IOT178 |	When you go to embedded it's kind of a choose-your-own-adventure
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:13,855	| IOT178 |	Beyond the Edge
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:15,135	| IOT178 |	We can standardize
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,671	| IOT178 |	Some of the stuff for deployment
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,463	| IOT178 |	And the way people deployed harappa
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,743	| IOT178 |	Locations to the edge
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:23,327	| IOT178 |	Using containers using virtual machines and using tools at the Enterprise
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:23,839	| IOT178 |	Already
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:29,471	| IOT178 |	You don't have to learn new tools or create your own
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,519	| IOT178 |	Already managing Enterprise
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,031	| IOT178 |	Trucks today
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:35,103	| IOT178 |	Okay so one of the challenges with
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:37,151	| IOT178 |	Connected devices is
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:39,199	| IOT178 |	Companies don't tend to
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:39,967	| IOT178 |	Update them
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:44,063	| IOT178 |	Forever right I might expect something to sit on my factory floor for like
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:45,087	| IOT178 |	20 years
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:49,439	| IOT178 |	Or even Thirty but the idea of supporting software for that long is just
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:51,231	| IOT178 |	Anathema to the IT guy
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:52,511	| IOT178 |	So
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:54,815	| IOT178 |	With your experience from the embedded world
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:55,839	| IOT178 |	Is this product
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,607	| IOT178 |	Going to
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:57,375	| IOT178 |	Help
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,143	| IOT178 |	Solve those kind of
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:00,447	| IOT178 |	I believe it is
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:03,519	| IOT178 |	Intestinal problems
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,543	| IOT178 |	Just an industry
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:07,615	| IOT178 |	I think there's a two ways how this product helps
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:11,455	| IOT178 |	Enterprise developers that want to maintain a product or
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:14,527	| IOT178 |	Building Products
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:18,879	| IOT178 |	Especially when they're based on movies open source projects like Linux
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,671	| IOT178 |	And you're probably
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:22,207	| IOT178 |	You're onto the next project
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,767	| IOT178 |	Working on
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,559	| IOT178 |	There's no time for you to really
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,583	| IOT178 |	Keep up-to-date
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:30,911	| IOT178 |	What's happening of streaming the security things that are Basics there
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,727	| IOT178 |	So what we provide
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:36,799	| IOT178 |	What is a summary every 3 days every 5 days
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:41,663	| IOT178 |	Where are small bits of information that are easily digestible
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,735	| IOT178 |	30 minutes and understand what's happening
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:48,831	| IOT178 |	Software
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:50,111	| IOT178 |	The second part of that is
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:51,647	| IOT178 |	We're doing a lot of fasting
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:52,927	| IOT178 |	Internally
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:55,999	| IOT178 |	And our partners also do a lot of testing and feed the results back
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:47:00,351	| IOT178 |	As the suffers moving forward it ideally it gets better and that's how it's
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:03,423	| IOT178 |	But we're constantly offering update
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,983	| IOT178 |	You have the Machinery that's on
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,263	| IOT178 |	Automation floor where
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:12,639	| IOT178 |	Processor like a consumer device like a refrigerator or a light bulb
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:14,943	| IOT178 |	Necessarily the companies don't need to update it
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:18,527	| IOT178 |	Because there's no exploit but what an exploit is found in their product
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:20,063	| IOT178 |	They want to be able to make a move
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:23,391	| IOT178 |	Latest software
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,159	| IOT178 |	Updates
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:30,303	| IOT178 |	So they can make it there right now
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:33,375	| IOT178 |	So if I'm using something like this
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:35,679	| IOT178 |	My device isn't automatically
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:37,983	| IOT178 |	Secured I still need to handle basic cracked
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:45,151	| IOT178 |	Encryption between
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,711	| IOT178 |	Storing data in database
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,831	| IOT178 |	Provide
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:54,367	| IOT178 |	We've done that like work for you
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:56,927	| IOT178 |	So we provide dtls on the
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,511	| IOT178 |	And we use mqtt S
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,279	| IOT178 |	Between
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,559	| IOT178 |	In device
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:08,447	| IOT178 |	And the Gateway rain so we're able to show you this is how you use encryption to move your data from the edge
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:09,471	| IOT178 |	To the cloud
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,495	| IOT178 |	And provide you the best price
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,103	| IOT178 |	And we
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:20,479	| IOT178 |	So when it comes to security
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:21,759	| IOT178 |	One of the challenges is
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:23,807	| IOT178 |	Is that a lot of these companies
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,599	| IOT178 |	456 years down the line
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:29,183	| IOT178 |	They don't have the infrastructure to track and monitor
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:32,767	| IOT178 |	Hey what's happening in the security World in their exploits
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:39,679	| IOT178 |	They don't actually know how to track without in the world and actually roll out the security updates to it so it's
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:41,215	| IOT178 |	Still a pretty complex
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:42,239	| IOT178 |	Big thing
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,007	| IOT178 |	To ask
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:44,031	| IOT178 |	A manufacturer
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:46,335	| IOT178 |	To take on security so do you guys kind of
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:47,359	| IOT178 |	Help absolve them
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:51,711	| IOT178 |	Yeah I think you're absolutely right so for your question a
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:52,735	| IOT178 |	Do provide
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:54,015	| IOT178 |	All the information
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,807	| IOT178 |	On a regular basis about this
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:58,367	| IOT178 |	Security exploits and the fixes that are going into our platform
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:00,415	| IOT178 |	So you're at least notified at that
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:04,255	| IOT178 |	If you still have it
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:13,983	| IOT178 |	Practice this weather that security or opens for soccer practice
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:16,799	| IOT178 |	They have
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:20,383	| IOT178 |	Nothing else to do other unresearched
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:21,663	| IOT178 |	They're able to Leverage
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:24,223	| IOT178 |	We built and built on top of that as part of their
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:29,087	| IOT178 |	All of the software that we provide
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:31,391	| IOT178 |	Is open
EDL	00:49:34,719	00:49:39,583	| IOT178 |	Able to cancel it anytime
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:45,471	| IOT178 |	So if they decide that they want to take on managing
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:49,055	| IOT178 |	Create appointment
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:55,455	| IOT178 |	All right so let's talk about other security efforts so you mentioned things like you have to have a secure Boot and this is not something you guys
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:57,759	| IOT178 |	Provide this is something the underlying Hardware that
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:58,783	| IOT178 |	You choose should have
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:49:59,807	| IOT178 |	Correct
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:03,391	| IOT178 |	Don't let friends do have cryptographic managers that store keys
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:06,463	| IOT178 |	Write a we will our software will allow
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:07,487	| IOT178 |	Product makers
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:09,023	| IOT178 |	Use that those Hardware devices
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:17,727	| IOT178 |	Those are the security measures that benefit the low level
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:20,287	| IOT178 |	Assurance
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:28,479	| IOT178 |	And send them at the edge
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:30,015	| IOT178 |	How much overhead do you guys need in
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:33,599	| IOT178 |	Yeah so where does that
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:36,159	| IOT178 |	In Our Lifetime we need to optimize
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:42,047	| IOT178 |	Yet we plan on offering multiple flavors something
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:48,447	| IOT178 |	It doesn't like 500
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:52,287	| IOT178 |	And then the image that we provide today is kind of got everything
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:54,079	| IOT178 |	Things like that is right around
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:51:00,223	| IOT178 |	For most applications but the
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:01,759	| IOT178 |	The way to configure alcohol
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:02,527	| IOT178 |	The extra stuff
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:07,647	| IOT178 |	Designer
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,415	| IOT178 |	Cytosine
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:13,279	| IOT178 |	Har Ram
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:14,815	| IOT178 |	And a really minimal not a slash
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:29,407	| IOT178 |	And that they can be verified by the bootloader and then booted
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:32,991	| IOT178 |	So we're working on optimizing it there or not
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:37,087	| IOT178 |	Our customers guide us there
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:38,879	| IOT178 |	Thank you so much this was super helpful
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:40,415	| IOT178 |	Tyler thanks so much for
