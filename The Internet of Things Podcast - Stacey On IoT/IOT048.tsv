EDL	00:00:07,680	00:00:12,288	| IOT048 |	Hey everyone welcome to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host
EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:13,312	| IOT048 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,312	00:00:14,080	| IOT048 |	And this is
EDL	00:00:14,080	00:00:14,848	| IOT048 |	Is your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:15,616	| IOT048 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,128	00:00:18,688	| IOT048 |	And today we have an awesome show for you
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:21,760	| IOT048 |	Cuz we've got a brand new Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:24,832	| IOT048 |	Stuff from Saudi
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:26,624	| IOT048 |	Ready to take on the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:30,720	| IOT048 |	I don't know if that's a gay or boo I was waiting for Kevin I'm on the fence
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,000	| IOT048 |	All right
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:32,768	| IOT048 |	Wechat
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:33,792	| IOT048 |	Cheaper watches
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:34,304	| IOT048 |	And do watch
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:36,608	| IOT048 |	We've got
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:38,656	| IOT048 |	Update from last week because we didn't talk about
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:40,448	| IOT048 |	New developments in the stand
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:41,216	| IOT048 |	Community
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:47,616	| IOT048 |	And I guess this week is Chad Curry who is the managing director for the center of real estate technology at the Nash
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:48,640	| IOT048 |	National Association of Realtors
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:50,944	| IOT048 |	You got it
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:51,968	| IOT048 |	Bringing smart houses
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:56,320	| IOT048 |	And I'm really curious to hear the interview because
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:57,344	| IOT048 |	Cos
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:01:00,416	| IOT048 |	That's a lot of opportunity for iot type
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,976	| IOT048 |	Connected devices in the home real estate market
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:05,536	| IOT048 |	I'm finding more and more Realtors I talk to
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,816	| IOT048 |	Are really getting into this thing
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:13,216	| IOT048 |	Okay so let's get this party started with the raspberry
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:13,984	| IOT048 |	Reply
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:16,032	| IOT048 |	Always room for pie
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:19,104	| IOT048 |	So latest and greatest in this is like only a few
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:19,616	| IOT048 |	Months
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,664	| IOT048 |	Jax Ali like 2 months
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:23,968	| IOT048 |	That node 3 months
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:24,480	| IOT048 |	Because it came out
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,528	| IOT048 |	November
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:29,088	| IOT048 |	The pi zero this is a better equipped by this is
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,160	| IOT048 |	And it has
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,952	| IOT048 |	Integrated thank you
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:34,976	| IOT048 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,512	| IOT048 |	On board
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:37,536	| IOT048 |	So everyone's like this
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,352	| IOT048 |	Raspberry Pi for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:46,496	| IOT048 |	Yep yep yep this is nice because I don't believe the previous pies had integrated connectivity
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:50,080	| IOT048 |	I could always do add-ons look forward to things like that
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:55,456	| IOT048 |	They're doing this at the same price for the Raspberry Pi 2 which you can still get for $35 but
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,480	| IOT048 |	Why would you
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,784	| IOT048 |	Cuz for $35 you can get a faster chip
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,832	| IOT048 |	It's a 1.2 gigahertz
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,624	| IOT048 |	64-bit
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,392	| IOT048 |	Quad core
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:08,512	| IOT048 |	Other thing is 10 times the performance of the original Raspberry Pi which the make sense
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT048 |	It's been 4 years now
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:12,096	| IOT048 |	Debut that
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| IOT048 |	It's the first six
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,168	| IOT048 |	64-bit Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:18,240	| IOT048 |	Which is Big because you can turn this into like a little mini server
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:25,664	| IOT048 |	Yep yep that one of the things I like that they did over the Raspberry Pi so it's it's fully compatible with the original
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:32,064	| IOT048 |	Pies and all the accessories in such all the try to keep all the pins in the same spot I think they only move like one LED
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:32,832	| IOT048 |	D indicator
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:36,416	| IOT048 |	Unisex he's got like add-on boards from the older pies
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:40,256	| IOT048 |	You should still be able to use them with the Raspberry Pi 3
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| IOT048 |	Oh that's nice so I was
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,888	| IOT048 |	It's still good feel good exact
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,984	| IOT048 |	Exactly so I think it's still broadcom empowering this right
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,288	| IOT048 |	It is still a broadcom chip there still
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,080	| IOT048 |	Stay in bed with broadcom
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,384	| IOT048 |	Hey now
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:59,456	| IOT048 |	I don't know where that came from
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,504	| IOT048 |	That wasn't supposed to be anything
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,016	| IOT048 |	Negative
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,600	| IOT048 |	But you can't unlike would like the Arduino are other
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,928	| IOT048 |	Things you cannot buy the chips that powers the pie separate
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,976	| IOT048 |	So that's something worth noting
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,792	| IOT048 |	Because you could buy the other chips that are the brains behind
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:17,376	| IOT048 |	Like Arduino or any of those others you can buy those separately but not with
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,936	| IOT048 |	And if you have kids I should tell you
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,752	| IOT048 |	That Cato the the computer for kids
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,544	| IOT048 |	I should say that I
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,848	| IOT048 |	Put together as my daughter and love so much
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,152	| IOT048 |	They actually have something
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,432	| IOT048 |	They have a new computer coming out soon
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| IOT048 |	It will work with this
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| IOT048 |	Pi
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| IOT048 |	And
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,832	| IOT048 |	They're going to be available for pre-order for one night
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,600	| IOT048 |	149
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,392	| IOT048 |	It won't ship till June
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,440	| IOT048 |	But if you want
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,232	| IOT048 |	You can buy this version of the pie
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,536	| IOT048 |	And you can just download the
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,328	| IOT048 |	Pokeno software on it today
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:47,840	| IOT048 |	Inner work
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,168	| IOT048 |	And I only say that because I really liked the
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| IOT048 |	Aquino and I thought it was a really cool
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,520	| IOT048 |	OS and system for teaching
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| IOT048 |	My nine-year-old about like
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:02,176	| IOT048 |	Parts of a computer and here's how to like program your own stuff in Minecraft which she was
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:03,968	| IOT048 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,016	| IOT048 |	A software perspective
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,832	| IOT048 |	Just in case people are interested you can still use all the old
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,856	| IOT048 |	Software the raspbian
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,136	| IOT048 |	Pi
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,160	| IOT048 |	Suffer image
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:16,000	| IOT048 |	They are still keeping that same 32-bit software but they're going to consider
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,303	| IOT048 |	Making that a 64-bit
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,095	| IOT048 |	Operating system in the future
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,631	| IOT048 |	Because you know I'm in
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,679	| IOT048 |	You got the hardware that can support it so maybe it makes sense
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,727	| IOT048 |	Okay so on the
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,495	| IOT048 |	Next topic
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,263	| IOT048 |	Sony
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| IOT048 |	And it's
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,567	| IOT048 |	New Amazon Echo
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,359	| IOT048 |	Tell us a little bit about
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:37,759	| IOT048 |	Yeah this is an interesting prototype device that Sony debuted at Mobile World Congress last week it's called the Xperia
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT048 |	Agent
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,831	| IOT048 |	Not yet for sale and they don't have any
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,879	| IOT048 |	Potential dates running like that they were showing it off
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,207	| IOT048 |	Is very similar to an Amazon Echo it looks
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:48,255	| IOT048 |	Have a similar form factor although it's more
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:52,351	| IOT048 |	It's not supposed cylindrical against tapered at the top and that's because they have this
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:56,703	| IOT048 |	Rotating ball that actually has a camera in it and a projector
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,751	| IOT048 |	So unlike the echo
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,543	| IOT048 |	It can actually project information
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,383	| IOT048 |	So that you know if you ask questions about maybe the stock market I could just show you
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:11,295	| IOT048 |	The stock market numbers at the time or something it's a small projector made it a little it looks like it's projecting maybe a 2in
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:15,135	| IOT048 |	Square down on a tabletop it's going to work through voice
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:19,231	| IOT048 |	So just like the Equitable control it asked questions just like any personal assistant
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,791	| IOT048 |	I'll search through gestures because it has a camera
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,839	| IOT048 |	They haven't really explained what those gestures
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,607	| IOT048 |	Would be what
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,119	| IOT048 |	You adieu
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| IOT048 |	People also
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,959	| IOT048 |	Potentially they said be tied to your smartphone
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:32,031	| IOT048 |	So that way using your smartphone for information
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,799	| IOT048 |	Presence
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,079	| IOT048 |	When you walk into a room
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:38,943	| IOT048 |	It would see you get information on you and literally set the room up in a scene that
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,967	| IOT048 |	Is custom to you
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:43,551	| IOT048 |	Turn certain lights on perhaps turn music on to a certain station
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,575	| IOT048 |	And so on
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,367	| IOT048 |	It's like jam packed with sensors
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| IOT048 |	And have a lot of
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:50,463	| IOT048 |	Potential but it is still just a prototype at this point
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,815	| IOT048 |	OC that seems really very close to prototypes I've seen from like
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,631	| IOT048 |	Almost a decade ago
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,703	| IOT048 |	I'm really excited about this
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:03,263	| IOT048 |	The concept i think was frogdesign had something called
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,055	| IOT048 |	The room
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,847	| IOT048 |	And it had a projector it had cameras
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,639	| IOT048 |	I think it used modified connect
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,663	| IOT048 |	Is actually
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| IOT048 |	And
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,711	| IOT048 |	You would gesture
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,039	| IOT048 |	And it would turn on lights if you gesture to a light
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:19,647	| IOT048 |	Or if you set you know lights on it would turn whatever you were gesturing at on for example
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,439	| IOT048 |	And if you were
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,487	| IOT048 |	Looking at used also like
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:28,095	| IOT048 |	It's image recognition to understand if you were looking at it so if you were addressing
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:32,703	| IOT048 |	The device is opposed to another person to ask it a question so you never had to do anything like
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,495	| IOT048 |	Funny wake words
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:41,407	| IOT048 |	It was really kind of cool but it was also super clunky and kind of like weird to set up but
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,199	| IOT048 |	The other cool thing about the camera was
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:48,063	| IOT048 |	Then you could interact with what was projected on the screen because the camera could see what you were
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:48,831	| IOT048 |	Interacting with
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,855	| IOT048 |	Which is really kind of fun
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,647	| IOT048 |	I like the surface table
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,207	| IOT048 |	That sounds cool
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,791	| IOT048 |	Again they the projections really small so I don't at least at this point
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,815	| IOT048 |	Smalls I don't know if
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:02,911	| IOT048 |	You be able to interact with it or anything I think it's more Just for information and
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,191	| IOT048 |	I like the idea that
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,007	| IOT048 |	As much as I like the idea of gestures as well
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:12,639	| IOT048 |	I personally prefer voice control over gestures any day of the week and I found that out
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,687	| IOT048 |	Long-term using my Xbox Kinect
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,759	| IOT048 |	I voice control the thing all the time
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,575	| IOT048 |	I could do dressers for things but I tend not to
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,879	| IOT048 |	It's his voice always seems easier to me
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,183	| IOT048 |	I think it depends on what kind of what you're doing
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:30,303	| IOT048 |	Voice is great when your hands are full but you do have to think a lot more like I found when I
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,327	| IOT048 |	Controlling the echo
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,143	| IOT048 |	I often give it the wrong command cuz I've got
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,447	| IOT048 |	Five different lighting commands
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,727	| IOT048 |	SportZone Lake
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,007	| IOT048 |	Oh I'll be in
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,543	| IOT048 |	In one of them
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,567	| IOT048 |	Suunto turn on
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,591	| IOT048 |	Running rampant
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,687	| IOT048 |	You know what then she's like what are you talkin
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,271	| IOT048 |	Yep in a situation where I was like he just turn on the lights
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,135	| IOT048 |	And then I was gesturing and both of those things could be put together to turn up what I wanted on
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,927	| IOT048 |	Because I'm not.
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,439	| IOT048 |	Articulate
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,975	| IOT048 |	That would be really nice
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,767	| IOT048 |	It's tough but you know what
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:04,607	| IOT048 |	It would also help if the natural language processing word prove which
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,143	| IOT048 |	It is
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:10,495	| IOT048 |	So that way you can be a little more vague I mean obviously I can give it the wrong like a turn-on that's
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,287	| IOT048 |	That's exactly what's going to happen
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,567	| IOT048 |	That's user error
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,871	| IOT048 |	So we call user error in the industry
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,151	| IOT048 |	But you're right there certain
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,199	| IOT048 |	Phrases that have a very
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,967	| IOT048 |	Particularly
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,735	| IOT048 |	Spoken
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,063	| IOT048 |	Especially like stay with it the triggers and skills that
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,343	| IOT048 |	The echo is using these days
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:31,999	| IOT048 |	So yeah I'd like to see more freedom in an improvement there
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,791	| IOT048 |	Of this weird
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,375	| IOT048 |	Isolation is perspective I feel like
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,655	| IOT048 |	The people who design
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,727	| IOT048 |	The smart home scenarios must like not live with people
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:42,751	| IOT048 |	Because
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:49,407	| IOT048 |	Music and do whatever you want
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,687	| IOT048 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:53,247	| IOT048 |	How many people actually walk into their like
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,551	| IOT048 |	House like their actual home
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,087	| IOT048 |	And
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,855	| IOT048 |	Live alone
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:01,439	| IOT048 |	And don't have other people to contend with when these things are happy
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,743	| IOT048 |	Cuz if I walked in and like my music played
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,559	| IOT048 |	I guarantee you that my husband would be like
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,583	| IOT048 |	Oh my God why is this
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,887	| IOT048 |	Who are you Stacy in the Royal we
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| IOT048 |	The program
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,191	| IOT048 |	The house
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,495	| IOT048 |	Yeah that's that's definitely a good point I think it's
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,567	| IOT048 |	Set plates interesting is it practical
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| IOT048 |	For a lot of people know
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,895	| IOT048 |	Exactly I'm just imagining my 9-year
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| IOT048 |	Run music
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,735	| IOT048 |	We'd all be like
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:25,759	| IOT048 |	Jamming down

EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| IOT048 |	Okay so
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,559	| IOT048 |	Cool things SoDo pricing
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,327	| IOT048 |	Prototype
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,351	| IOT048 |	Still a concept
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,119	| IOT048 |	So much stuff
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:47,263	| IOT048 |	Sony doesn't sell cheap stuff so right off the bat I would agree
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| IOT048 |	Okay well we'll look for
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,383	| IOT048 |	Things like this I imagine many people out
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:58,527	| IOT048 |	Maybe not many but some of y'all out there probably built similar things feel free to tell us about it because I'm kind of curious
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,575	| IOT048 |	Thoughts on speakers it's a big
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,087	| IOT048 |	Fun topic
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,367	| IOT048 |	Next topic
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,719	| IOT048 |	Fitbit has a new watch out
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,743	| IOT048 |	The Fitbit Blaze
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,279	| IOT048 |	Did Market udderly
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,559	| IOT048 |	Fidget
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| IOT048 |	Is shipping now
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,375	| IOT048 |	And I don't have one
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,399	| IOT048 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,215	| IOT048 |	I think my next like
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,239	| IOT048 |	Wearable
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,031	| IOT048 |	Is going to be something that has my heart rate
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| IOT048 |	And
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| IOT048 |	I don't dyslexia
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| IOT048 |	Pure pulse heart rate
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,015	| IOT048 |	I just I feel like $200
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,087	| IOT048 |	It is a lot of minister
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:38,975	| IOT048 |	What color the flagship device it's got a totally different design and their prior devices that looks more like a regular watch
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,839	| IOT048 |	I didn't want to say that but yet it does what it it's
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,375	| IOT048 |	What did you with the corners cut off
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,423	| IOT048 |	Also it's Sino octagonal and
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:50,495	| IOT048 |	But it has it looks more like a traditional watch than their prior
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,543	| IOT048 |	Products which look like tracking devices
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,567	| IOT048 |	So
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:59,711	| IOT048 |	You know it's our Flagship and it does everything that I think most people would want like you said it's at the heart rate monitor
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,503	| IOT048 |	It does include
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:04,319	| IOT048 |	Call and text notifications and calendar alerts so that has
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,087	| IOT048 |	A little bit of
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,879	| IOT048 |	Smart watching is to it
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:11,231	| IOT048 |	You can record running cycling cross training Etc attraction
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,559	| IOT048 |	Steps to distance calories floors climb Auto sleep
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,839	| IOT048 |	Got a 5-day battery life
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,375	| IOT048 |	It's nice
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,423	| IOT048 |	I will say it's nice
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,471	| IOT048 |	I actually just bought something different
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| IOT048 |	For about the same price
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,103	| IOT048 |	That is all the same stuff plus electric store and play Wireless music on
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,943	| IOT048 |	Do what you buy the TomTom cardio
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,479	| IOT048 |	Plus music device
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,599	| IOT048 |	It was serious like $25 more than this and it was actually a
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:41,183	| IOT048 |	On sale so you would probably spend more I would have paid full retail
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:45,791	| IOT048 |	But I'm very happy with it and it's great for everything we just said
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,631	| IOT048 |	Plus I have forgiven stores to put music on and go running
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,703	| IOT048 |	With the GPS in the heart rate monitor that's built into it and
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,983	| IOT048 |	And listen music at the same time
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,775	| IOT048 |	Remember that
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| IOT048 |	We're going to get to music
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,823	| IOT048 |	Just a minute
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| IOT048 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:01,151	| IOT048 |	But first we should tell you also in Smartwatch news
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,711	| IOT048 |	I'm thinking about it
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,783	| IOT048 |	Smartwatch news
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,575	| IOT048 |	Pebble time has actually lowered
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,111	| IOT048 |	Racing
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,135	| IOT048 |	Yay
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,463	| IOT048 |	Yeah that was actually the extended on I believe
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| IOT048 |	2
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,279	| IOT048 |	Devices the time and the time round
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,559	| IOT048 |	Time in the time
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| IOT048 |	Timer on but the time still stays
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,375	| IOT048 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,655	| IOT048 |	Haircut
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:25,215	| IOT048 |	Cuz it around versions of the Pebbles have been out that long
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:28,031	| IOT048 |	No they haven't which makes me wonder how are they
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,543	| IOT048 |	Just not said
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,895	| IOT048 |	I do not know I haven't seen sales figures
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,663	| IOT048 |	So War
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:36,991	| IOT048 |	I think last I heard they had over million sales as of
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:41,343	| IOT048 |	Oh I don't recall when it was but I haven't heard any numbers in a while it's well say
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,647	| IOT048 |	So the time
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,183	| IOT048 |	Is 149 99
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:47,487	| IOT048 |	In-N-Out on round 1 round
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,303	| IOT048 |	Is 199
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,583	| IOT048 |	It's $200
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,375	| IOT048 |	Who's got a $50 price
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,959	| IOT048 |	Cuz I was just too much
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| IOT048 |	29
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,239	| IOT048 |	I'm just going around
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,823	| IOT048 |	In the time steel is still 200
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,895	| IOT048 |	Yeah I actually had a pebble time
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:08,991	| IOT048 |	That I sold to somebody at a discount because I wasn't using it
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:13,855	| IOT048 |	Part of me says that maybe I should have done that because they did add some help features back in December
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:18,719	| IOT048 |	And you know it's using some sensors to track things like sleep and activity and whatnot
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,255	| IOT048 |	It just wasn't granular enough
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| IOT048 |	For me to
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,559	| IOT048 |	Be that desirable
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:27,423	| IOT048 |	You know. Dedicated Fitness tracker with heart rate monitor that's kind of where I was going
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,983	| IOT048 |	So I have my ancient first pebble
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,519	| IOT048 |	I loved
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| IOT048 |	Because it was
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:37,407	| IOT048 |	It did exactly what I needed it to do and I still wear like my one-off tiny little tracker
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,711	| IOT048 |	And I've stopped kind of wearing it
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,015	| IOT048 |	Because I tend to wear my ring
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:46,111	| IOT048 |	My ring late now and I need to notifications and
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:50,463	| IOT048 |	I also carry my phone more places but I'm wondering if the weather gets warmer and I start ditching
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:55,071	| IOT048 |	My phone cuz I'm not wearing pockets as often if I'll strap it if I'll be
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,375	| IOT048 |	I need upgrade my SmartWatch
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,423	| IOT048 |	I could be
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:13:59,935	| IOT048 |	I could be
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,495	| IOT048 |	Even though you had the older pebble
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:09,407	| IOT048 |	I think in and you can correct me if you know I think you got the time interface that they launched last year
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,479	| IOT048 |	I did as a software update
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,783	| IOT048 |	Past present and future stuff
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,319	| IOT048 |	It was an interesting take on things
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,599	| IOT048 |	I like their interpretation
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,135	| IOT048 |	Changes not
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,439	| IOT048 |	I'm not one to be like
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:27,071	| IOT048 |	But I tended to use my Watch solely as a watch
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,887	| IOT048 |	And then I only had notifications for like
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,167	| IOT048 |	Text
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,191	| IOT048 |	And that was pretty much it
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:38,335	| IOT048 |	And I tend to keep my phone on silent so the watch or the ring is the only thing I have that's like
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| IOT048 |	Gotcha gotcha
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,783	| IOT048 |	Everybody everybody
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:53,183	| IOT048 |	You know we should mention down to folks who just bought a pebble timer time around if they bought it after January 21st
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,207	| IOT048 |	At the higher price
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,511	| IOT048 |	You can reach out to Pebble by April 1st
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,327	| IOT048 |	And get a price adjustment on the difference
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| IOT048 |	No.2
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| IOT048 |	50 bucks
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,727	| IOT048 |	Back to music
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,519	| IOT048 |	I saw this
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,055	| IOT048 |	And I wanted so much
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,335	| IOT048 |	I think it's so cool
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,615	| IOT048 |	I may actually
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| IOT048 |	I'm so this is
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,735	| IOT048 |	Hang on a second I have to say before the show
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,271	| IOT048 |	As we talked about what to talk about
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:23,135	| IOT048 |	Stacy was gushing over this thing so if it's not a parent enter voice right now to trust me
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| IOT048 |	She is dying to see this
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,719	| IOT048 |	I love it okay so this is called the mighty
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,743	| IOT048 |	And this is
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,047	| IOT048 |	It's an iPod Shuffle for your Spotify play
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,839	| IOT048 |	That is like
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,863	| IOT048 |	I don't know who called it that
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,399	| IOT048 |	How did that but
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,191	| IOT048 |	That is what it is so you need to have a Spotify
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,239	| IOT048 |	And it has to be premium
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,847	| IOT048 |	Spotify songs that you have
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| IOT048 |	Download certain songs
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:51,295	| IOT048 |	Download your songs for offline listening when you have a Spotify premium account
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,343	| IOT048 |	So when you decide logos onto this life
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,111	| IOT048 |	Little
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,135	| IOT048 |	Device that is
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,671	| IOT048 |	I-75 in
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,719	| IOT048 |	Yeah it looks like
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:05,375	| IOT048 |	It's just cuz it's a little square with a basically not like a jog dial but round button placement
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:08,959	| IOT048 |	It very much looks like a iPod Nano or Shuffle rather
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,751	| IOT048 |	That there's not much in it I mean it
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,799	| IOT048 |	There's a battery there's
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,823	| IOT048 |	Ortega storage
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:18,431	| IOT048 |	There's a wireless connectivity for Bluetooth headphones there's also a regular headphone jack
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:25,087	| IOT048 |	Oh yeah I didn't realize I thought I had to I thought you had to do it over USB very cool
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:27,647	| IOT048 |	Sweet
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:32,255	| IOT048 |	Anyway it's such a Nifty little something
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,791	| IOT048 |	Would make Maybe
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,583	| IOT048 |	That would sell gazillions of
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,351	| IOT048 |	Puppies
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,375	| IOT048 |	Units units
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,399	| IOT048 |	Students
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,727	| IOT048 |	Man I'm so glad this is being crowdfunded
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,519	| IOT048 |	Although I don't think it's made it to it
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| IOT048 |	It's cool yet so it's
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,823	| IOT048 |	70
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,335	| IOT048 |	$9
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT048 |	For one of these
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,455	| IOT048 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,223	| IOT048 |	Right
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,759	| IOT048 |	You can also pledged $5
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| IOT048 |	And getting in
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,391	| IOT048 |	Yeah I think I won't do that
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:02,207	| IOT048 |	So it is raised 180000
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:02,975	| IOT048 |	Send
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,279	| IOT048 |	Now that's $10 you can have a photo of one
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,303	| IOT048 |	Excellent
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:10,399	| IOT048 |	So they raised about a hundred eighty thousand
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,423	| IOT048 |	Send 200
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:14,495	| IOT048 |	I go back at its going to ship in November
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,287	| IOT048 |	Actually happens
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,823	| IOT048 |	I am content
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:21,407	| IOT048 |	Concerned about licensing hopefully Spotify works with them
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:25,759	| IOT048 |	Hopefully the licensing of the music like I can see how there might be problems
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:30,879	| IOT048 |	I don't know about that and I'll tell you why I mean if you can already download
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,183	| IOT048 |	Music with a Spotify Premium subscription
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,743	| IOT048 |	Can listen to offline on your phone
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,791	| IOT048 |	I can't really see the difference
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT048 |	2
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,631	| IOT048 |	Pushing across one more wire to another device
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,679	| IOT048 |	There might be intelligence
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| IOT048 |	DRM associated with
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| IOT048 |	The app on the phone
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:49,055	| IOT048 |	Typically cuz I believe Microsoft
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:53,919	| IOT048 |	Do this way back when with the zoo and you could download all the music you wanted
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,199	| IOT048 |	From your subscription
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:57,503	| IOT048 |	But you had to resync the Zune
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:58,783	| IOT048 |	With your car
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,575	| IOT048 |	Computer so we could go and double-check
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:03,647	| IOT048 |	Your subscription status every 30 days or less to make sure
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,207	| IOT048 |	That you still were paying if not
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,767	| IOT048 |	That it would automatically DRM lock all the songs
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:14,655	| IOT048 |	And that's what I'm assuming what happened cuz it was Spotify the same thing also like you have to
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,935	| IOT048 |	Castle link every
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| IOT048 |	I think it's at 4:30
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,239	| IOT048 |	Days may be hung
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| IOT048 |	So
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,615	| IOT048 |	I love this because I like to go out without my phone
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,407	| IOT048 |	I love the idea of having
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,479	| IOT048 |	Dislike little tiny clippy thing on when I go running or working out
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,247	| IOT048 |	And
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,807	| IOT048 |	Maybe then I wouldn't need a smartwatch that
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,575	| IOT048 |	Guitar music
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,855	| IOT048 |	FairPoint
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,183	| IOT048 |	Alright good luck
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT048 |	Good Law School
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,743	| IOT048 |	All right
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,511	| IOT048 |	Now
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| IOT048 |	Industrial news
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,815	| IOT048 |	We don't talk about this
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,095	| IOT048 |	Because I forgot
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,959	| IOT048 |	Occasionally
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,031	| IOT048 |	There is trouble in standard land
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,847	| IOT048 |	And let's see if we can get this right with all the acronyms
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,871	| IOT048 |	Hellboy
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:57,407	| IOT048 |	I know
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,431	| IOT048 |	We got a new
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:58,943	| IOT048 |	Foundation
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:01,503	| IOT048 |	It is called the open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| IOT048 |	Ocf
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| IOT048 |	Dallas New Consortium
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,903	| IOT048 |	Includes Intel Microsoft Samsung Qualcomm
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,927	| IOT048 |	A whole bunch of other vendors
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:12,255	| IOT048 |	And they're going to push what's known as the iotivity stand
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:13,791	| IOT048 |	Going forward
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:17,631	| IOT048 |	In this standard is used for discovery of devices
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,399	| IOT048 |	In
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,423	| IOT048 |	Communicating what they can do
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,239	| IOT048 |	You guys might be going
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:22,751	| IOT048 |	Wait a second
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:26,847	| IOT048 |	Some of these guys have their own standards right
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| IOT048 |	Allcom
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,151	| IOT048 |	Had
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,711	| IOT048 |	All joy and they actually form the all seen alive
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,783	| IOT048 |	With some of these Microsoft actually was a premier member
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,551	| IOT048 |	They were really important
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:41,183	| IOT048 |	Electrolux in some of the other kind of companies
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,207	| IOT048 |	And
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,839	| IOT048 |	When Intel launched their Foundation
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,375	| IOT048 |	Which they called the open internet
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,399	| IOT048 |	Consortium
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,423	| IOT048 |	2014
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,031	| IOT048 |	Intel launches a Qualcomm freestander
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,103	| IOT048 |	Because that's
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,895	| IOT048 |	Essentially what it was both kind of groups
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,431	| IOT048 |	Pushing the same
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:05,247	| IOT048 |	Standard which was device discovery
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,783	| IOT048 |	That never happens with standards
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,319	| IOT048 |	Never
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,207	| IOT048 |	So here's here's the bottom line
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:16,255	| IOT048 |	What I discovered in tok
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,023	| IOT048 |	People
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,815	| IOT048 |	And this was not easy cuz no one ever wants to admit
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,631	| IOT048 |	Things made out of
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,655	| IOT048 |	Rosie
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,215	| IOT048 |	The Qualcomm folks that were working on
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,239	| IOT048 |	The development of all joy
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,799	| IOT048 |	That whole team is actually DeCamp
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,311	| IOT048 |	10 God / 2
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:32,383	| IOT048 |	So those guys are not working until
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,151	| IOT048 |	Which I
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,919	| IOT048 |	Imagine hat
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,431	| IOT048 |	No small
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,527	| IOT048 |	Leaving it we're taking our standards with us
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:42,879	| IOT048 |	Still exist
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:43,903	| IOT048 |	Is there still
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,695	| IOT048 |	Working for the good of
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,535	| IOT048 |	You know the Internet of Things in the standard blah blah blah
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,559	| IOT048 |	It looks like
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:54,143	| IOT048 |	Almost all of the code and development is going to be happening
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,703	| IOT048 |	Under the open connectivity Foundation
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,263	| IOT048 |	We should expect to see
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,799	| IOT048 |	Most of the work happen
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,335	| IOT048 |	There
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,103	| IOT048 |	Device discovery
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,175	| IOT048 |	Most of this looks like a license
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,687	| IOT048 |	That's an issue
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:10,015	| IOT048 |	Can get into the Arcane politics
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,319	| IOT048 |	Standard settings organization or
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,367	| IOT048 |	It really super duper arcade politics of license
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,647	| IOT048 |	Guess who
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,208	| IOT048 |	But that's kind of what seems to be
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,232	| IOT048 |	Driving
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,256	| IOT048 |	Is
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:25,632	| IOT048 |	To license the standard and who has to pay if we use this technology
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:32,544	| IOT048 |	It's rather interesting to me after watching Intel on Qualcomm go at it in the chip business for
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,848	| IOT048 |	The past I'll say 10 years or so
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:37,664	| IOT048 |	When it comes to mobile and desktop / laptop
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,944	| IOT048 |	And now they're
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,504	| IOT048 |	Fighting it out / working together
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,808	| IOT048 |	For the iot chip business
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,624	| IOT048 |	It's
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:50,208	| IOT048 |	It's nice right you like
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:56,352	| IOT048 |	One less standard right is what it kind of feels like
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,888	| IOT048 |	But yeah it's essentially one list
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,192	| IOT048 |	It's by no means
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,960	| IOT048 |	The singular stand
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,984	| IOT048 |	Because
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| IOT048 |	Homekit
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,824	| IOT048 |	Is trying to do the same darn thing only it's closed in
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT048 |	Apple
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,616	| IOT048 |	And then Google
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,384	| IOT048 |	With
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:08,896	| IOT048 |	Weave
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,432	| IOT048 |	Is not necessary
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,736	| IOT048 |	Which
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,528	| IOT048 |	May or may not be doing this
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,320	| IOT048 |	Is also doing this
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,088	| IOT048 |	So
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:22,208	| IOT048 |	We can't really have like some singular standard when we have two of the largest players in the industry
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,488	| IOT048 |	From the handset side
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,560	| IOT048 |	We like our
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,096	| IOT048 |	Let's try to make these
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,888	| IOT048 |	Yeah
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,448	| IOT048 |	Say hey
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,216	| IOT048 |	Headsets
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:35,776	| IOT048 |	Not needed we're going to go with gesture control invoice
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:37,824	| IOT048 |	Smell you later Google and Apple
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,104	| IOT048 |	What do we think
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,224	| IOT048 |	No I think the smartphone isn't going away anytime soon
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,784	| IOT048 |	Maybe find why someone try though
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:49,344	| IOT048 |	Good luck with that
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,112	| IOT048 |	Smell Ya Later app
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,464	| IOT048 |	Okay so that was that was one on the
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:57,024	| IOT048 |	Kenneth Moore Industrial side of things are the more
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,304	| IOT048 |	Can Enterprise E
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,840	| IOT048 |	Less Fun Gadget side
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,888	| IOT048 |	And let's see what else do we have here
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,400	| IOT048 |	We have
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:05,728	| IOT048 |	We have it's time for a guest I guess that's right
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:11,104	| IOT048 |	Like we said it is Chad Curry the managing director for the center of real estate technology and if you stay tuned
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,408	| IOT048 |	He is going to talk to us about
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:20,832	| IOT048 |	Touchy Realtor about technology giving smart hubs as a closing gift and how your ml
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:27,232	| IOT048 |	Things may change
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:31,072	| IOT048 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,864	| IOT048 |	This is your house Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:35,168	| IOT048 |	Our Guest today is Chad Curry
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:38,752	| IOT048 |	Managing director of the center for realtor technology
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,568	| IOT048 |	National Association of Realtors
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:46,432	| IOT048 |	I'm great CC thank you so much for having me on here
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,456	| IOT048 |	I'm so excited
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,736	| IOT048 |	So
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:53,088	| IOT048 |	We had this awesome conversation
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,392	| IOT048 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,416	| IOT048 |	And he told me
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,720	| IOT048 |	Why Realtors
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,232	| IOT048 |	Interested
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,120	| IOT048 |	Absolutely you know
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:09,728	| IOT048 |	Here's the thing is is we ran a 108 year-old Association
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,264	| IOT048 |	With 1.1 million members
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:18,176	| IOT048 |	And they are in more homes than anybody else you know they sell about 5 million homes a year in a lot
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:22,016	| IOT048 |	Happening in the space right now and you know by 2020 their estimates of
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,320	| IOT048 |	No 26 billion
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,112	| IOT048 |	To 250 billion
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:28,416	| IOT048 |	Iot devices being connected to the web
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,208	| IOT048 |	And so we got to get out of that
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,256	| IOT048 |	So that's why we turn to slap
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:36,864	| IOT048 |	When we talked before you you had talked about improving the existing
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,144	| IOT048 |	In home stock in what
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,680	| IOT048 |	Is
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,448	| IOT048 |	2
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:42,496	| IOT048 |	Get maybe new homeowners
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,008	| IOT048 |	I'm bored
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:46,592	| IOT048 |	Sensors that showed them things like
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,872	| IOT048 |	Hey your air quality
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,384	| IOT048 |	Could be.
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,712	| IOT048 |	Show them their air quality
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,272	| IOT048 |	Didn't think to make investments
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:54,784	| IOT048 |	In their home
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,088	| IOT048 |	Then boosted
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,600	| IOT048 |	The value of the home
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:58,624	| IOT048 |	Realtors happy
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,488	| IOT048 |	Winger
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,560	| IOT048 |	Yeah so it did that that is predicated
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,096	| IOT048 |	If you think about
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,656	| IOT048 |	You know say that you didn't care about
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:14,240	| IOT048 |	Taking 10000 steps until you got one of those turn things right
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:17,312	| IOT048 |	And that's kind of what we think is going to happen with Environmental Quality sensor
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:23,712	| IOT048 |	I mean you got this invisible are around you your breathing and you have no sense of what's in it and we think as a closing gift
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:24,992	| IOT048 |	What if
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,016	| IOT048 |	A realtor
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,808	| IOT048 |	Gave a homeowner
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:28,320	| IOT048 |	Ihob
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:32,672	| IOT048 |	And some Environmental Quality sensors that could allow that homeowner to understand
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,976	| IOT048 |	What the CO2 levels are for the home
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,024	| IOT048 |	What's the temperature and humidity are for the home
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:41,120	| IOT048 |	What do you particular matter levels are for that home in the vocs
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:45,472	| IOT048 |	And those metrics are going to help them understand how their living
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,776	| IOT048 |	And those things affect our health greatly
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,824	| IOT048 |	NIH just put a study out of
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,360	| IOT048 |	A few months ago actually about
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:55,200	| IOT048 |	CO2 levels outside it was Booth focus on Commercial properties office spaces
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:26:00,064	| IOT048 |	And they talked about what a difference a regular office space
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:03,136	| IOT048 |	Makes compared to the Green Plus or green
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,416	| IOT048 |	Office spaces that have
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:07,488	| IOT048 |	No air filters that are
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,512	| IOT048 |	Much more
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,048	| IOT048 |	What's improved
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:17,216	| IOT048 |	I mean that's what I bring to the existing home stock we want to make it so that people who buy an existing home because Millennials are
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,520	| IOT048 |	Clamoring for existing homes
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,544	| IOT048 |	And so we would have been
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,080	| IOT048 |	Bring things to them
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:26,432	| IOT048 |	I can help them have a better quality of life and was existing homes homes are built a hundred years ago that didn't
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:30,528	| IOT048 |	They were considering air quality air temperature and humidity at that time
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,320	| IOT048 |	But if you could mitigate
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,368	| IOT048 |	Problems like mold or bacterial growth
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:38,464	| IOT048 |	Bi monitoring what your humidity levels are in a home
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:44,096	| IOT048 |	Going to go a long way to having a better quality of life in that home and we think our membership can be a part of that to a partnership
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:48,192	| IOT048 |	What's really interesting is if you start taking that a step further and you give
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,728	| IOT048 |	People the tools
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,312	| IOT048 |	It makes them familiar with it in their homes
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,360	| IOT048 |	They could actually take that to
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,176	| IOT048 |	You know things like home water testing and then
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,968	| IOT048 |	Implicit activism on the scale
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,504	| IOT048 |	You could see
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,832	| IOT048 |	Leaving out of prevention of Something Like Flint Michigan
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,344	| IOT048 |	But I mean
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,416	| IOT048 |	Empowered enough
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:10,976	| IOT048 |	It said holy cow
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,000	| IOT048 |	My hair is
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:12,512	| IOT048 |	Really toxic
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:19,424	| IOT048 |	Yeah this is this is about improving the housing stock and quality-of-life for everybody and then that's exactly right
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:24,288	| IOT048 |	Things that where we're actively participating in our things like the array of things project
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,080	| IOT048 |	Keep using the word things but I
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:29,152	| IOT048 |	I can't get away from it right now we're talkin the iot podcast
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:36,064	| IOT048 |	But the array of things project is happening here in Chicago and the city of Chicago
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:39,136	| IOT048 |	University of Chicago Argonne National Labs
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:43,232	| IOT048 |	All received a 3.1 million dollar Grant from the National Science Foundation
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:48,608	| IOT048 |	Put 500 nodes around the city of Chicago so we can monitor things like air quality
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:54,752	| IOT048 |	The amount of people in an area outside it's not it this is not a surveillance thing it's that is not anything we're interested in
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,056	| IOT048 |	What were interested in though is
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:03,456	| IOT048 |	Is traffic levels in an area because that could impart you know what's happening with the commercial
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:03,968	| IOT048 |	Real estate
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:08,576	| IOT048 |	Immunotherapy trophic levels go down there might be an issue in that area that could
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:13,440	| IOT048 |	I'll be improved upon to improve the commercial real estate space where the residential space
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:18,816	| IOT048 |	Project the way we are approaching this entire
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:22,400	| IOT048 |	Space is if we think of the home as a cell
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:25,472	| IOT048 |	Right now there's nothing in the home that allows for homeostasis
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:30,336	| IOT048 |	The self-regulating as you have in a Cell for biology any of the eukaryotes that have the nucleus
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,384	| IOT048 |	And self-regulation
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,688	| IOT048 |	So you think about that you got the home and sell
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:38,272	| IOT048 |	As you work those homes work together and you have an aggregate of data
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:39,296	| IOT048 |	You start to build tissue
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:42,112	| IOT048 |	Commercial buildings and become like organs
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:46,720	| IOT048 |	And the city itself becomes like a body so you have this organic living breathing thing
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,792	| IOT048 |	And this is this is already happening these things are organic
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:52,352	| IOT048 |	But we don't have any insight into their performance
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:56,704	| IOT048 |	So we can't make improvements upon what's happening already and that's what we want to do is
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,984	| IOT048 |	Has helped build that
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,752	| IOT048 |	So
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:04,896	| IOT048 |	Our communities can take action to improve upon their quality of life and homeowners can do the same thing in our members can be a big part
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:08,480	| IOT048 |	Okay so you start with data about Environmental Quality
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:13,344	| IOT048 |	The Next Step though once you have this data is taking action
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,136	| IOT048 |	Where are you guys
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,720	| IOT048 |	Or is the array of things project
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,256	| IOT048 |	Going that next step
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,024	| IOT048 |	Or is it just
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,304	| IOT048 |	Okay so what are you
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:27,424	| IOT048 |	Project open data
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,984	| IOT048 |	I'm so app developers can build upon that
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:35,360	| IOT048 |	So the data coming off of these devices will be in a repository at the city Chicago site
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:40,736	| IOT048 |	So people can take that data and start building apps that can tell you about the best path to walk if you have asthma
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,296	| IOT048 |	Or you know what's that
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:46,112	| IOT048 |	How quickly is standing water being taken care of in a city
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:49,440	| IOT048 |	Or what are the traffic patterns like on a
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:52,256	| IOT048 |	July vs December in Chicago
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,816	| IOT048 |	And what I should mention about that
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:57,120	| IOT048 |	Project or not only other thing they looking at
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:59,936	| IOT048 |	Chicago they have 15 partner cities around the globe
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:04,288	| IOT048 |	We're also going to do the same thing put these devices out so
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,056	| IOT048 |	And so
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,848	| IOT048 |	What we're hoping is
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:13,248	| IOT048 |	With our little project we've been doing we're calling Rosetta home and I know I given you some screenshots when we
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:17,600	| IOT048 |	Meet we talked about last time about what that looks like with CO2 monitoring and temperature humidity in
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,160	| IOT048 |	And an energy monitoring
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| IOT048 |	We want that
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,696	| IOT048 |	2B you know
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:26,304	| IOT048 |	Got to be a place of action for these homeowners in for the community itself
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:30,400	| IOT048 |	And I think that's a really important
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,216	| IOT048 |	And I I'll be curious to see how
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,264	| IOT048 |	Home Motors any good Realtors kind of take
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,800	| IOT048 |	Action because
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,568	| IOT048 |	It's one thing
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| IOT048 |	Here's an informative app.
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,712	| IOT048 |	Succezz
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,736	| IOT048 |	This is happening
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,504	| IOT048 |	And then
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,272	| IOT048 |	There's things that
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:51,136	| IOT048 |	Individual action and then there's the collectively
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,648	| IOT048 |	Better axe
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:54,208	| IOT048 |	Yeah and I think you know for us
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:31:00,352	| IOT048 |	Our members you know the value to our membership here is that they have a relationship without a homeowner
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,376	| IOT048 |	Outside the transaction
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:06,752	| IOT048 |	Right so they're able to work without homeowner in and be a partner in the ownership of that home
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:13,152	| IOT048 |	And the value is you know that they've got a relationship that they formed and in that naturally becomes a elite generator
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,968	| IOT048 |	But also when that house comes back on the market and 7
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:19,040	| IOT048 |	Veneers that homeowner is going to work without realtor
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,112	| IOT048 |	And when they work with that Realtor
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,160	| IOT048 |	Things that can become gachas
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:27,232	| IOT048 |	Over the process of owning a home things like mold you didn't know you had
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,792	| IOT048 |	Because you weren't monitoring the humidity or
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,328	| IOT048 |	Particulate matter that could cause
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:38,496	| IOT048 |	A child to have a hard time breathing with respiratory issues those are things that you work with that homeowner to help mitigate so when it goes on Mark
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,544	| IOT048 |	That's less time you have to spend on
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| IOT048 |	Dealing with those issues
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:45,664	| IOT048 |	Proactive type thing between the homeowner in the realtor
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,200	| IOT048 |	Will we ever see
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:47,712	| IOT048 |	Sensor data Spark
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:55,648	| IOT048 |	Also that's the project we worked on is exactly that we both over a course of a few weeks we took it to
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:32:00,256	| IOT048 |	Are standard body in real estate is called reso the real estate standards organization I'm a board member
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:05,376	| IOT048 |	And I took my team down there Chris Cote Varley lab engineer and Dave Conroy who's our lab engineer
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:09,728	| IOT048 |	The three of us went down there and we presented what we done which is where we took a listing
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,032	| IOT048 |	Tv listings right now
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,104	| IOT048 |	There static there is essentially what you had in the listing books
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,128	| IOT048 |	Before we had the intern
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:16,896	| IOT048 |	Why not make that
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,712	| IOT048 |	Why not have that information accessible
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:26,112	| IOT048 |	22 Byers you know in and we think that when a buyer's first moving into that process of of going
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,904	| IOT048 |	Away from the home they own to this new home
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:31,744	| IOT048 |	And we give him a closing gift of this device with the sensors
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:34,304	| IOT048 |	That's an opportunity for them to them start
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,584	| IOT048 |	Moving down a Paso
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:39,424	| IOT048 |	A corrective action on that home in a way that is informed
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:46,080	| IOT048 |	You know that they know what to work on because they have that data we had a few mls's talk to us about including that data and their list
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:49,152	| IOT048 |	Now I wouldn't want my actual data
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,920	| IOT048 |	Set the show at
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:50,432	| IOT048 |	Catholic
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:58,112	| IOT048 |	It would be aggravated you don't want you know you don't want to be able to see certain patterns like CO2 patterns
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:01,952	| IOT048 |	You know if you had CO2 patterns listed on a on a regular basis
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:07,072	| IOT048 |	Hourly basis somebody could look at that and see how I know when they're not home
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:09,376	| IOT048 |	Why do we break into their house then we that we do not
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:13,216	| IOT048 |	Of course so that's yeah I would have to be an aggregate a type of date
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:20,128	| IOT048 |	Now you can totally tell when people in my house are taking a shower
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:20,640	| IOT048 |	Yeah
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,224	| IOT048 |	Because
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,760	| IOT048 |	You are so associated with
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:29,088	| IOT048 |	Real estate market in everyone loves
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:29,856	| IOT048 |	Or at least that's what
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:32,160	| IOT048 |	Everybody I know loves talking about
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,720	| IOT048 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,768	| IOT048 |	Well it's not really a game
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,584	| IOT048 |	What bone exist
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,632	| IOT048 |	In homes of tomorrow
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,400	| IOT048 |	So
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,680	| IOT048 |	I think this all the time
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:45,984	| IOT048 |	That's my job
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,752	| IOT048 |	Because I'm a weirdo
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,568	| IOT048 |	So I'm going to throw it out there I think
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,336	| IOT048 |	Cheese
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:52,128	| IOT048 |	These are probably something we won't have like
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,200	| IOT048 |	No I don't know what
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:55,712	| IOT048 |	What are you thinking
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:34:00,064	| IOT048 |	Yeah so I gave a talk at a conference
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:04,160	| IOT048 |	About a month ago where I talked about was called 5 mind-blowing Technologies but
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,184	| IOT048 |	It was really about
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:08,000	| IOT048 |	What are home would look like in 2026
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:10,048	| IOT048 |	Things I don't think we're going to exist
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:14,912	| IOT048 |	In 2026 are things like the thermostat on the wall I think that
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,192	| IOT048 |	Within our
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:16,960	| IOT048 |	Homes
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:19,776	| IOT048 |	We're going to have sensing technology integrated into the wall
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:26,432	| IOT048 |	So you can see temperature and humidity all up and down that wall as well as air quality sensors built into that
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:32,320	| IOT048 |	So you get a good sense of what's happening at ruin water sensors to I mean if you have a leak behind your wall
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:35,648	| IOT048 |	Yeah so what if a wall could
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,952	| IOT048 |	Change color where there's a leak in a way that's
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:39,232	| IOT048 |	And also alert you
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:41,024	| IOT048 |	Yeah
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:46,656	| IOT048 |	Takes it takes some time so what if it is soon as that leak happens
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:51,520	| IOT048 |	You are able to be informed upon you know that you're good but whatever device I would have limited to a phone
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,312	| IOT048 |	I with the wearables coming out
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:55,872	| IOT048 |	But whatever device you're wearing what if you could receive
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,640	| IOT048 |	An alert
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:35:00,224	| IOT048 |	On that and that's the beauty of that's a beauty this technology
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:03,808	| IOT048 |	Drywall will have sensors built into it your windows
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,832	| IOT048 |	I imagine it
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,648	| IOT048 |	Future Stacy where as you update your home
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:11,488	| IOT048 |	The listing is updated with data from those devices you're putting in your home you know
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,792	| IOT048 |	There's that there's a commercial
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:20,192	| IOT048 |	All kinds of card building information modeling I think that's going to come to the residential market and it's going to be informed by these smart device
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:26,336	| IOT048 |	We're putting in our homes I think you could have less and less of dog was not talk to people at work a beacon companies and they talk about beacons and what they can do
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:29,152	| IOT048 |	Anna Begins now are these these
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:33,248	| IOT048 |	Little Rock sir would have you devices that are freestanding
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:37,088	| IOT048 |	But I think Beacon Technologies going to be built in things like your lights
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,112	| IOT048 |	Or
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:40,160	| IOT048 |	Outlets whatever else you know wall fixture
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:47,584	| IOT048 |	So I think it's the world we interact with become less obvious in the home you know what I mean by it's not visual you don't
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,864	| IOT048 |	See the thermostat on the wall
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,912	| IOT048 |	I would I would love that
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:54,496	| IOT048 |	I would also love for my power outlets to go away but I think we're a little far off from
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:59,872	| IOT048 |	Tesla What will what happened to Tesla's hopes and aspirations you know
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:00,896	| IOT048 |	No one wants
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,712	| IOT048 |	Just yet we're working on it
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:05,760	| IOT048 |	Eventually
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,040	| IOT048 |	So here's that yours
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,344	| IOT048 |	I thought because this is something I think about
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,112	| IOT048 |	What about lights
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,160	| IOT048 |	Stairs
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:12,928	| IOT048 |	There's an inherent
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:17,536	| IOT048 |	I actually had a designer in the show a couple weeks ago and he got me really
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,816	| IOT048 |	It was really the Scott Johnson
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:22,400	| IOT048 |	And he was talking about you know different types of lighting
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:24,960	| IOT048 |	Ambient lighting
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:27,008	| IOT048 |	Lower levels versus are overhead lighting
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:28,288	| IOT048 |	In
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,824	| IOT048 |	I was really fascinated by thing
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,336	| IOT048 |	Thinking about like
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,896	| IOT048 |	Yeah why limit lighting till Aiko
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,016	| IOT048 |	Q has with a light strip
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:41,344	| IOT048 |	So that allows you to do different
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:43,648	| IOT048 |	Places there and they have the bloom I think it's
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:47,488	| IOT048 |	So I mean you know I didn't end
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:48,512	| IOT048 |	I agree with you
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:52,096	| IOT048 |	Going to be limited just to the fixtures above your head I
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,400	| IOT048 |	I in fact it was a really interesting
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:58,752	| IOT048 |	Concept that is University of Cincinnati adult novel devices group over there
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,032	| IOT048 |	They had
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:03,360	| IOT048 |	Office in the office but I can see it working on as well
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,128	| IOT048 |	World Harvest
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,920	| IOT048 |	The Sun's light
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,200	| IOT048 |	End broadcast
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:09,504	| IOT048 |	Throughout the the office
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,528	| IOT048 |	She don't have that
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,320	| IOT048 |	Fluorescent light beer actually using sunlight
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:16,672	| IOT048 |	To create Lighting in the home so it's a very passive type of lighting
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,440	| IOT048 |	Isn't
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:20,256	| IOT048 |	A critical smart but it can be controlled without you knowing
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:22,560	| IOT048 |	Baffle of sorts so you can you can
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:25,376	| IOT048 |	You could have it be brighter and darker based on
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,912	| IOT048 |	Are there natural light but
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,960	| IOT048 |	I think the integration of
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:35,360	| IOT048 |	Smart devices in the lighting will lead to things like you know sad mitigation that seasonal affective disorder
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:37,408	| IOT048 |	And it's already happening with you but I think that
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,456	| IOT048 |	A sad room
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:41,760	| IOT048 |	As it were almost like a safe form of typeset
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:47,136	| IOT048 |	I think that helps you almost know it sounds really silly for me to say it that way I know
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:52,256	| IOT048 |	There's somebody there are so many things I want to take back in
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:52,768	| IOT048 |	That statement
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:56,608	| IOT048 |	You're actually you have a room that's going to help you be happy
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,656	| IOT048 |	We'll call it a happy room
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,448	| IOT048 |	Anyway but I think
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:07,360	| IOT048 |	There's so many opportunities for light to to be more natural and more surrounding and not feel like it's coming it's just
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,128	| IOT048 |	One Direction
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,664	| IOT048 |	I think there's a lot happening in that space
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:10,944	| IOT048 |	Let me go with
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,968	| IOT048 |	Like a super contra
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,480	| IOT048 |	Burchell predict
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT048 |	It feels kind of disturbed
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,648	| IOT048 |	Good everybody
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:20,672	| IOT048 |	Clearing House
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:25,280	| IOT048 |	This is less for somewhere like the us but more for a place like chinaware
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,560	| IOT048 |	You know
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,584	| IOT048 |	Density is important
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:28,864	| IOT048 |	Sitting
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,656	| IOT048 |	The cities are jam-packed full of people
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,192	| IOT048 |	But also wear
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,312	| IOT048 |	What about this idea that
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:41,152	| IOT048 |	With TVs in it you don't 4K and soon-to-be 8K
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,200	| IOT048 |	What about we lose windows
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,224	| IOT048 |	Which actually makes
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:45,504	| IOT048 |	Buildings
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,296	| IOT048 |	Very interesting
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,832	| IOT048 |	And somehow you think about Lake
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:51,392	| IOT048 |	Lighting that can be delivered via LEDs
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,928	| IOT048 |	Can prevent
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:54,208	| IOT048 |	Seasonal affective
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,256	| IOT048 |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,304	| IOT048 |	How to screen
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:00,608	| IOT048 |	I don't know is that crazy
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:02,912	| IOT048 |	Yeah I mean I think I think it's not
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:09,312	| IOT048 |	In fact our lab we have no windows that we have glass that is out to a hallway and I often think about
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:12,128	| IOT048 |	I mean you can make an experiential
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:16,480	| IOT048 |	Something very experienced you know there might be a place you love to visit and maybe it's
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:18,784	| IOT048 |	You know I love Florence maybe I have
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,320	| IOT048 |	Florence projected on a wall
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:21,856	| IOT048 |	You know it it has.
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:25,952	| IOT048 |	Natural light color with feels like I'm sitting in a conference room with a large window
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,000	| IOT048 |	Ionic and not
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,536	| IOT048 |	Can affect you
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:33,376	| IOT048 |	Office productivity in about about Smart Technologies I had there's a
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:38,240	| IOT048 |	Center for the built environment at Aaron's and his team David layer
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,544	| IOT048 |	Out in Berkeley they've been looking at office
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,824	| IOT048 |	Productivity and
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:48,224	| IOT048 |	Comfort levels in the office and they come down to it being a behavioral in fact they talked about Heating and Cooling and how much energy
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:50,016	| IOT048 |	E-Waste trying to cool
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:56,416	| IOT048 |	Are heat entire room and they come down to having products actually have something called hyper chair which is an office
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,720	| IOT048 |	Trailer has fans and heating and cooling elements in it
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,256	| IOT048 |	And you can control
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,792	| IOT048 |	Your comfort locally
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,840	| IOT048 |	At that space you know what I think
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,864	| IOT048 |	I think you know that
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:09,472	| IOT048 |	I kind of figured out there but I think that window you're talking about or that of that led technology
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,288	| IOT048 |	That that fits a long it's the same type of thing or your
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| IOT048 |	Dealing with someone who has a personal preference
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:19,968	| IOT048 |	You know what I think you could have some really resting I mean I can get to the micro units and smaller places
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:21,504	| IOT048 |	Can you start to have
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:26,368	| IOT048 |	Less and less opportunities to have like come in naturally and so what can you do to
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,648	| IOT048 |	2 offset
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,464	| IOT048 |	And make out to pleasing environment there's actually a
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:34,048	| IOT048 |	Call Black Mirror have you seen anything for you
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,560	| IOT048 |	That's what I
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:35,840	| IOT048 |	Picture of the guys
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,352	| IOT048 |	Riding bikes
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,400	| IOT048 |	Yeah exactly that's that's
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:40,448	| IOT048 |	I was thinking about that as well but I like to think
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:44,800	| IOT048 |	What's dystopia with respect to that I hope I'm hopeful La time
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:47,360	| IOT048 |	I'm pretty hopeful for the the quality you can bring till
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,920	| IOT048 |	Cuz yeah you're right I mean it could be very
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:50,944	| IOT048 |	Very lonely
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,504	| IOT048 |	You know there's a possibility
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:56,064	| IOT048 |	So what about let's let's go cuz
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:59,904	| IOT048 |	We brought up Black Mirror so it in the episode that we're thinking of it I can't remember the title of it
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,232	| IOT048 |	Stationary bikes
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,280	| IOT048 |	People energy to generate energy
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,352	| IOT048 |	One thing that I think about a lot with
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:10,912	| IOT048 |	Smart Home in a lot of these Technologies is that
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:15,008	| IOT048 |	We're probably going to consume more energy because we have more devices
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,800	| IOT048 |	Set to consume energy
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,128	| IOT048 |	There are energy saving things out their butt
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,176	| IOT048 |	What are you kind of working on
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,480	| IOT048 |	You know what the idea that
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:27,552	| IOT048 |	Hey yes we are adding more stuff to her wall outlet
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:28,576	| IOT048 |	But what are we doing
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:29,600	| IOT048 |	Please save energy
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:35,744	| IOT048 |	Yeah you know there are some really interesting things happening in the What's called the energy harvesting space
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,048	| IOT048 |	University Michigan has group
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:42,656	| IOT048 |	Collab 11 and a Gentleman and purple. So it's his group they have a lot of
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:46,752	| IOT048 |	Smaller devices actually when I talked about having sensors inside the walls they have a
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:53,663	| IOT048 |	Something called smart dust to these computers that are about the size of a grain of sand and you can have an array of them that mesh
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,431	| IOT048 |	And they
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:56,479	| IOT048 |	Have different sensors in them but
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:42:02,879	| IOT048 |	They are working on a lot of different types of energy harvesting Technologies solar panels that Harvest energy from the light above you radio wave Harvest
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:04,415	| IOT048 |	Testing Technologies
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:07,231	| IOT048 |	So that those those devices are self-powering
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:11,839	| IOT048 |	But I think energy harvesting is the is what's going to happen for those devices met something I'm very interested
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:16,703	| IOT048 |	You know I talked about beaconing technology earlier and you have the limit of the battery so
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:20,287	| IOT048 |	As you to play more more sensing technology around the city what if we could
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:21,823	| IOT048 |	Be responsible for its own energy
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:25,151	| IOT048 |	Solar panels that I don't think
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:31,551	| IOT048 |	They're going to have solar panels just yet but I can imagine a future where those devices could be powered by solar is it becomes cheaper
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:34,111	| IOT048 |	For those devices to be produced
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,391	| IOT048 |	It's actually Kevin and I are
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:39,487	| IOT048 |	Actually right after CES we had we talked about
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,791	| IOT048 |	Arm has shown off some of the
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,351	| IOT048 |	The smart dust kind of Motes
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:46,911	| IOT048 |	And this was a tiny little chip that had
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,191	| IOT048 |	Like
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,215	| IOT048 |	Basically
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:53,311	| IOT048 |	I can't remember the arm processor name but it was like it did on the edge of my fingertip
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:56,895	| IOT048 |	Kevin and I were kind of puzzling out different things we could use it for
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| IOT048 |	And I should have thought about
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:42:59,711	| IOT048 |	Powering
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:00,223	| IOT048 |	Wallpaper
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:02,527	| IOT048 |	Cuz it's solar-powered we're like
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:06,367	| IOT048 |	You can't swallow it we were talking about using it as like blood pressure in the eyes but
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,671	| IOT048 |	You think about sticking it you know
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,695	| IOT048 |	Wallpaper
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,231	| IOT048 |	Connecting with natural light
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,023	| IOT048 |	SodaStream might have Windows
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:17,375	| IOT048 |	Really interesting or you know there were others that could be powered by
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:17,887	| IOT048 |	Temperature change
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:20,447	| IOT048 |	Interesting options
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:27,871	| IOT048 |	Yeah I mentioned University Michigan they actually had some a research project where they had this
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:31,199	| IOT048 |	Additional Bluetooth connected device that sat on the
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:33,503	| IOT048 |	On the pipe of a shower head
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:38,879	| IOT048 |	And you could tell how much hot water the whole was using because it would heat up to a specific
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,159	| IOT048 |	Point
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,439	| IOT048 |	And it would fire off
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,999	| IOT048 |	Play music by a capacitor that they would fire off
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,279	| IOT048 |	Answered
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,327	| IOT048 |	You know give you a sense of the temperature for that
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:50,143	| IOT048 |	The shower scene with hot water you were using
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,655	| IOT048 |	Very interesting
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,191	| IOT048 |	Research project they were doing
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,471	| IOT048 |	Thought so
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:54,495	| IOT048 |	Yeah but I think
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,543	| IOT048 |	Lobbying
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:58,335	| IOT048 |	Being what it is and in
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:04,223	| IOT048 |	Things like the pi zero coming out and Chip and and all that they cost you the stuff is coming down
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:05,247	| IOT048 |	Pretty greatly
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,063	| IOT048 |	So I think in the pi 3 coming out
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:11,391	| IOT048 |	Do you know what side the Bluetooth connection now
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:12,927	| IOT048 |	As of today
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,719	| IOT048 |	So that was pretty exciting me
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:16,255	| IOT048 |	Cheaper and cheaper
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:22,911	| IOT048 |	And the worst of a difference doing with their their iot educational arm I think there's a lot of opportunity in this work
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,703	| IOT048 |	Write 2
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:27,519	| IOT048 |	What is the one thing that you're hoping to install in your home
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:29,823	| IOT048 |	Like this month this year I don't know
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,103	| IOT048 |	I'm
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,383	| IOT048 |	Really
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:34,175	| IOT048 |	Very interested in voice
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:38,783	| IOT048 |	Ina what that's going to mean for our home and so we don't have an echo in our home
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:43,135	| IOT048 |	We are looking with Josh 8.8 eyes doing over
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:43,903	| IOT048 |	J-star
