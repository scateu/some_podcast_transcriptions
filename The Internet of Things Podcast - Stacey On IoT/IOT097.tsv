EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,520	| IOT097 |	All right back to the show Kevin
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,568	| IOT097 |	Should we get started with
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,080	| IOT097 |	Google thing
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,664	| IOT097 |	Sure wish I could start with Google things and it's
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:54,944	| IOT097 |	As long as we
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:02:00,320	| IOT097 |	Ride it my normal disclosure out that I do work full-time for Google as a consultant
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:04,672	| IOT097 |	I do not work in any way shape or form on their iot stuff so my opinion
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,440	| IOT097 |	Your pigeons
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,512	| IOT097 |	That's true I never give them away
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,840	| IOT097 |	So actually you do
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,608	| IOT097 |	You give your
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,632	| IOT097 |	If you give them away for
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,912	| IOT097 |	Free
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:21,568	| IOT097 |	That's right that's right this this actually surprised me this news so we talked about Google things a couple weeks ago which
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,944	| IOT097 |	Ryzen android-based iot platform from Google
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,480	| IOT097 |	Essentially take the place of
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,808	| IOT097 |	Cortical project brillo and all that
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,624	| IOT097 |	Yeah it's actually Google
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,136	| IOT097 |	Android
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:37,952	| IOT097 |	Just been named
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:46,656	| IOT097 |	Google thinks this is one of the many Google things but it's actually called Android thinks you're right
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:48,448	| IOT097 |	This is their platform
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,472	| IOT097 |	You said every place is Brillo
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:55,616	| IOT097 |	It's actually kind of platform it is connected device requires actually
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,640	| IOT097 |	Significant
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,480	| IOT097 |	SPAC shame the platform
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,552	| IOT097 |	Sorry
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,832	| IOT097 |	I had to say it
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,600	| IOT097 |	If it's okay
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,624	| IOT097 |	This is
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:11,744	| IOT097 |	This requires a lot of memory and isn't really for sensors it's more for things that will be
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,512	| IOT097 |	Controlling the Senate
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,608	| IOT097 |	I'm not fat shaming anybody
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:20,448	| IOT097 |	Just coming to
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:21,984	| IOT097 |	Jewel
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,008	| IOT097 |	Five seven
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| IOT097 |	Which is
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,592	| IOT097 |	Call it it's a fact
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,128	| IOT097 |	Computer board it's a big computer
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,920	| IOT097 |	And I'm not touching it
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,528	| IOT097 |	Computing be like fat pigs especially if we wanted to make stuff with it
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,856	| IOT097 |	The jewel 570 is capable of doing
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,648	| IOT097 |	4K video
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:45,024	| IOT097 |	Ram it's got 16 gigabytes of storage and WiFi
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,328	| IOT097 |	And it's a big board
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:47,840	| IOT097 |	What is this
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:53,216	| IOT097 |	It surprises me because of the existing supported Android things boards Witcher
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,240	| IOT097 |	Lower power
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,264	| IOT097 |	Slimmer
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:04:01,664	| IOT097 |	If we go down that thing like the Raspberry Pi in Intel's Edison chip and XPS Pico board
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,456	| IOT097 |	This is using
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,808	| IOT097 |	A revamped Intel Atom Processor and again for Giga as you said
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:13,440	| IOT097 |	It supports even with the realsense 3D depth camera so it's adding a lot more power
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,000	| IOT097 |	I was just surprised because the other existing
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| IOT097 |	Supported boards are
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:20,095	| IOT097 |	Not the Lesser boards but less are capable
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,167	| IOT097 |	Yes well I think this is actually really good because
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT097 |	This looks like a
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,215	| IOT097 |	Great board
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,007	| IOT097 |	Play with robotics
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,287	| IOT097 |	Because of the recent
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:28,799	| IOT097 |	3D depth
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:30,847	| IOT097 |	Capacity
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,943	| IOT097 |	So I think it's a really forward-looking move for Android
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,223	| IOT097 |	Just because
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,271	| IOT097 |	This is actually really interesting platform
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,807	| IOT097 |	For it robotics
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,671	| IOT097 |	Out of the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| IOT097 |	Crazy iot
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| IOT097 |	We haven't even really
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,583	| IOT097 |	Experience
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:58,495	| IOT097 |	Right at night I agree with your baby when I think of the traditional stuff that's supported you know you don't need all that power
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,031	| IOT097 |	But it's a good point
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:03,103	| IOT097 |	Looking had that things that move around
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| IOT097 |	Things that
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,271	| IOT097 |	Need more power this does make sense it's going to be interesting to see what developers do with it cuz it I assume it'll be one of those
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:15,135	| IOT097 |	Developer cats on the Android things website soon cuz I don't see it there just yet
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,463	| IOT097 |	This could be good for like Industrial
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,999	| IOT097 |	Oreck commercial settings
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,119	| IOT097 |	They shouldn't miss out on
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,399	| IOT097 |	They should totally
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,703	| IOT097 |	If they can
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,751	| IOT097 |	And also who else should not
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,799	| IOT097 |	Miss out on the space and I didn't tell
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:36,639	| IOT097 |	Which because the spaces really been driven by a arm architecture type
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,919	| IOT097 |	Processing power
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:42,783	| IOT097 |	And yes Intel Edison is supported but I don't see many people Billy stuff on the Edison
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,087	| IOT097 |	By comparison to what they're building a Raspberry Pi's
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:51,487	| IOT097 |	And such a later in the show on a different arm board that you're going to be using for openhab2 nope so
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,511	| IOT097 |	Prevalently
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,815	| IOT097 |	This industry has been built on arm so
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,351	| IOT097 |	Again until can't miss out on that
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:58,911	| IOT097 |	All right
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,935	| IOT097 |	So let's
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,447	| IOT097 |	YouTube app
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| IOT097 |	Because we can
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| IOT097 |	Because we
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,919	| IOT097 |	Last week I promised to get started doing open house
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,455	| IOT097 |	Because there is now a new version of oppa
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,015	| IOT097 |	Have in this is a smart home
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,599	| IOT097 |	Hub Software System is open source
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,647	| IOT097 |	On the eclipse Foundation
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:22,207	| IOT097 |	Basically it is like the most powerful
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,999	| IOT097 |	Inflexible system out there
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,047	| IOT097 |	It requires a lot of technical
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,351	| IOT097 |	Or maybe not a lot that's what I mean
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:28,863	| IOT097 |	Discover
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:33,215	| IOT097 |	As an update on the project I went out and bought a
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,751	| IOT097 |	Ein
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:37,567	| IOT097 |	A 64 board Kevin already has one Kevin
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT097 |	Help me out with this
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,895	| IOT097 |	I went out and bought the 2GB combo set
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:44,223	| IOT097 |	Which has the board itself a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| IOT097 |	Sheet module
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,783	| IOT097 |	A microSD card
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,319	| IOT097 |	With the software I'm going to need to run it all though
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,111	| IOT097 |	That's actually not the software on
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,135	| IOT097 |	Use
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,159	| IOT097 |	I'm going to use an opa
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,183	| IOT097 |	Have card
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,463	| IOT097 |	And
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| IOT097 |	Power supply in a
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,071	| IOT097 |	And then I also bought
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| IOT097 |	Easy way for
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,887	| IOT097 |	And so the total for these two things
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,935	| IOT097 |	90 bucks space
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,239	| IOT097 |	And that may sound like a lot
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:12,639	| IOT097 |	Now I got my pine64 I got the same board that you got I also bought it early right now you can buy that board for about
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT097 |	30 bucks
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,479	| IOT097 |	And that's just giving you all the processing power in your ports but
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:21,343	| IOT097 |	It's another $10 for example to add the Bluetooth Wi-Fi so that's in your starter kit
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:25,183	| IOT097 |	You're getting an acrylic case I don't have a case or mine actually took an old
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,743	| IOT097 |	Raspberry Pi case like I'm kind of covered in that regard
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:34,655	| IOT097 |	Power supply power supply is super important with pine64 anybody
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:38,239	| IOT097 |	He's buying app on 64 I highly recommend you get the power supply
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,263	| IOT097 |	When you buy the board
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:42,591	| IOT097 |	Even though it's a micro USB power supply
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,871	| IOT097 |	You like
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:47,967	| IOT097 |	Plenty of these must have a hundred things in my closet from other phones I bought
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,479	| IOT097 |	10 years
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:54,623	| IOT097 |	It's very very specific on the voltage on there's very little tolerance for error here
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| IOT097 |	And I tried about 4
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:08:02,815	| IOT097 |	Micro USB phone charger with micro USB and I could not get the pine64 to
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT097 |	Boot up
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:07,935	| IOT097 |	And after we're going to the pine64 wiki which is fantastic and great resource
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,519	| IOT097 |	I found out all this information on the power supply and the
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,055	| IOT097 |	The voltage that is needed
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:16,127	| IOT097 |	And luckily I found one that has exact voltage
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:23,039	| IOT097 |	And booted up like a charm so you're getting old the one that you know is going to work and that's going to take a lot of their frustration
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,319	| IOT097 |	Out of it that I had
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,087	| IOT097 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:28,415	| IOT097 |	Because there is nothing more than I hate the digging through my bag
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,695	| IOT097 |	Words in trying to
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,999	| IOT097 |	What and what makes it
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:38,399	| IOT097 |	More frustrating is a non-supportive power supply will actually light up the little LED On the Border like
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,191	| IOT097 |	It's getting power
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,775	| IOT097 |	I can't be the issue and you end up troubleshooting all these other issues
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,335	| IOT097 |	That aren't really issues it's actually the voltage
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| IOT097 |	All right
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:53,247	| IOT097 |	So that is the update there now we should move on too exciting other things such as
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,551	| IOT097 |	Freezies
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,831	| IOT097 |	Surety and
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,855	| IOT097 |	Personal privacy issue
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,391	| IOT097 |	I think we should start dinner
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:05,791	| IOT097 |	Let's talk about this dude who basically self incriminated himself in our Sky because
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,095	| IOT097 |	This story has pretty much everything
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,143	| IOT097 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,959	| IOT097 |	The interesting thing is there's nothing
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:19,359	| IOT097 |	IRT assure smart homie about this it but obviously it does get to the privacy issues that are related to these device
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,943	| IOT097 |	I suspect this was a standard pacemaker that is the focus of the story correct
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| IOT097 |	Yes
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,503	| IOT097 |	So this guy
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,295	| IOT097 |	Apparently was committing insurance fraud
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:31,135	| IOT097 |	And he decided to burn down his house
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:34,719	| IOT097 |	So this man his name is Ross Compton this was back in September 26
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,791	| IOT097 |	He's being charged with setting his house on fire
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:41,631	| IOT097 |	Police when I talked to him he admitted that he had a
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| IOT097 |	Artificial heart
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:47,007	| IOT097 |	So the investigators use data from his
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,287	| IOT097 |	Peacemaker
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,615	| IOT097 |	To show his cardiac date right before the
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,407	| IOT097 |	Fire started to show that
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,943	| IOT097 |	She was able to
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:57,503	| IOT097 |	Move all of the stuff and do all of this stuff
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,575	| IOT097 |	Because the data from his pacemaker didn't correspond with
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT097 |	His version
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,111	| IOT097 |	Stop the story
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,135	| IOT097 |	Right
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:06,719	| IOT097 |	If you say you woke up in your house is on fire and you ran out
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:09,535	| IOT097 |	Which the pacemaker would show that you were
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,047	| IOT097 |	I'm sleeping
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,095	| IOT097 |	Then you ran out but
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:15,935	| IOT097 |	It looks like the date of the Pacemakers allegedly showing that
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,471	| IOT097 |	He was pretty active before the fire
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| IOT097 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,519	| IOT097 |	Now what's
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:23,103	| IOT097 |	Also worth noting that he had gasoline on his
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| IOT097 |	Including as well
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:28,479	| IOT097 |	So depressed
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,319	| IOT097 |	PowerPoint switches
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,087	| IOT097 |	Usual infires
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,111	| IOT097 |	Not arson
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,183	| IOT097 |	There's a couple questions here
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,487	| IOT097 |	When is did they have to go for the pacemaker
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| IOT097 |	Is the pacemaker data
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,607	| IOT097 |	You don't just that there's there's a
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| IOT097 |	5th Amendment
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,655	| IOT097 |	Closet
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,471	| IOT097 |	Constitution of I'm trying to decide what the right words here this is hard for
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| IOT097 |	The Fifth Amendment
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,055	| IOT097 |	Says you don't have to incriminate yourself
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,103	| IOT097 |	Allstate when you plead the 5th which we see all the time
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,127	| IOT097 |	Congressional
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,015	| IOT097 |	So the question is is your pacemaker did yours so this is like incriminating
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,319	| IOT097 |	Yourself or does it belong to someone else
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,647	| IOT097 |	Police can get it and
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,439	| IOT097 |	It is not selfish
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,743	| IOT097 |	So that's actually really
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| IOT097 |	Interesting legal question
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,351	| IOT097 |	And neither of us are lawyers so
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,423	| IOT097 |	All we have are in a just outside opinions on
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:19,935	| IOT097 |	I'm assuming
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,727	| IOT097 |	My personal opinion is
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:28,895	| IOT097 |	That pacemaker data is his data it's not going to a third party or anything like that
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:34,271	| IOT097 |	As a way to transmit it to his doctor and so on so forth and then there's
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,831	| IOT097 |	What kind of policies do they have for privacy and so on
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,135	| IOT097 |	It's not like he's
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,695	| IOT097 |	Uploading a stuff to a server every day I presume
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:44,767	| IOT097 |	So if those details are not
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,047	| IOT097 |	Correct
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,631	| IOT097 |	And this is not a voluntary device I mean
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| IOT097 |	Pacemaker
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:51,679	| IOT097 |	Is
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,639	| IOT097 |	That is so kind of crazy
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:07,295	| IOT097 |	Is it really interesting case it actually I'm going to have a lawyer come on the show in a few weeks time
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,343	| IOT097 |	And I sent this case off to her S1
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,647	| IOT097 |	Point to talk about so
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,183	| IOT097 |	For that because
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| IOT097 |	Scary
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,023	| IOT097 |	It seems like with the case about the
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,047	| IOT097 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,935	| IOT097 |	Police are looking at this data and they're saying hey
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:26,239	| IOT097 |	This is a treasure Trove of information
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| IOT097 |	So this next story is
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,615	| IOT097 |	Also about scary things with
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| IOT097 |	This
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:38,783	| IOT097 |	Involves a hotel getting hacked its door lock system getting hacked
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,343	| IOT097 |	Held for ransom
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:41,855	| IOT097 |	Basically
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,927	| IOT097 |	So this is the
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,695	| IOT097 |	Kevin
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,743	| IOT097 |	The Romantic sea Hotel
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,583	| IOT097 |	Cigarette Alpine Lakes Lakeside Alpine hotel in
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,655	| IOT097 |	Australia minutes by car from Salt
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,447	| IOT097 |	So what happened
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:03,359	| IOT097 |	Hackers basically got into the system no one was locked in their rooms known as locked out of their rooms but
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| IOT097 |	B Hotel couldn't
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,407	| IOT097 |	Program
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,943	| IOT097 |	The key cards for the door
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,735	| IOT097 |	For new people yeah
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:15,135	| IOT097 |	And I thought this was really interesting because basically this is a ransomware attack there like you enter access controls this
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,415	| IOT097 |	Custom back pay us in bit
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,207	| IOT097 |	2 Bitcoins
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,255	| IOT097 |	Which I don't know
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,839	| IOT097 |	Know about 1850 ish
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,119	| IOT097 |	$1,850
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:34,335	| IOT097 |	That's a matter of perspective I suppose but considering that if you couldn't take any new guests
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:36,383	| IOT097 |	So you could lose a lot more money than
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,407	| IOT097 |	The not so yes
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,687	| IOT097 |	True
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,271	| IOT097 |	So this is the sort of thing that I actually think we should be
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:46,111	| IOT097 |	Worried about ransomware is going to be a huge
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,183	| IOT097 |	Easy topic for hackers right now with the iot
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,743	| IOT097 |	And I think it's going to come in the
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:57,119	| IOT097 |	The Forum has maybe it's hotels later on we're going to talk about it with our guests actually because apartment
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,143	| IOT097 |	Dwellings art
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,167	| IOT097 |	Great Target
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:02,751	| IOT097 |	Because they're so many people I think maybe like a company like nest
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,775	| IOT097 |	Might be
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:07,871	| IOT097 |	Kobe cars I mean you want to start your car today you need to pay me a hundred bucks
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:10,431	| IOT097 |	Yeah so I don't know if it's going to go towards
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,247	| IOT097 |	The individual level I think eventually if it's really easy it could
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,599	| IOT097 |	You want to control your thermostat
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,367	| IOT097 |	Haney half a bit
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,207	| IOT097 |	Yak
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:24,767	| IOT097 |	After the centralized
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,791	| IOT097 |	Administrative
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:32,191	| IOT097 |	Consoles where they get the maximum effects and then and then they also have a company
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,495	| IOT097 |	It has a lot more money collectively then
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,311	| IOT097 |	Although this is a relatively small amount of money
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:40,639	| IOT097 |	For a hat
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,711	| IOT097 |	40000 or even a hundred thousand.
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:46,015	| IOT097 |	I obviously don't condone this
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,575	| IOT097 |	But if I was one of these hackers
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:54,975	| IOT097 |	This actually makes sense this type of lower amount if you make it too much it's it just becomes a it's a lot easier
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:59,327	| IOT097 |	Easier for a company to pay $1,800 and get rid of the problem example of 1850
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| IOT097 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,887	| IOT097 |	I want a million dollars how many
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,591	| IOT097 |	So yes
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,359	| IOT097 |	This is
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,407	| IOT097 |	You're worth noting for
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:14,943	| IOT097 |	And
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT097 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:19,039	| IOT097 |	It Feels Like A Brave New World here and hopefully
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,319	| IOT097 |	Hopefully we're
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:28,511	| IOT097 |	We comes down to one of the key things we discussed on a weekly basis not security
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,791	| IOT097 |	And then companies
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,839	| IOT097 |	Iot companies and service providers
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:34,911	| IOT097 |	If you're not making security one of your top
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,263	| IOT097 |	Pillars of your product or service you're just asking for trouble
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:43,103	| IOT097 |	And it's not just part of the product or service though it's also things like
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,407	| IOT097 |	Access to your database in
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,431	| IOT097 |	In the cloud
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,455	| IOT097 |	It's got to be secure
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| IOT097 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,527	| IOT097 |	From beginning to end
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:55,903	| IOT097 |	With that in mind the Boston Consulting Group issued a report this month saying that
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:02,303	| IOT097 |	Companies are expected to spend 250 billion euros by 2020 on the in
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:02,815	| IOT097 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,911	| IOT097 |	That translates into 260
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:07,935	| IOT097 |	9
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,471	| IOT097 |	Billion
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| IOT097 |	US dollars
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| IOT097 |	Switches
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,543	| IOT097 |	Quite a considerable sum
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:19,455	| IOT097 |	And this report which will link to into in the show notes because it's got so much good data
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,247	| IOT097 |	Talks about basically how to pray
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,831	| IOT097 |	Prepare for the Internet of Things companies really need to have
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:29,439	| IOT097 |	Good business processes so they should start with use cases first
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:33,023	| IOT097 |	They should understand what they're doing and he hears those words
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,071	| IOT097 |	And they should develop into in solution
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:43,263	| IOT097 |	The report goes into a lot of death about how all this is going to come about and they also focus on
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,055	| IOT097 |	10 use cases that will drive iot
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:49,151	| IOT097 |	Those include things that we heard and talked about sex to predictive maintenance
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:52,223	| IOT097 |	This one's really interesting self optimizing
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| IOT097 |	Production
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,295	| IOT097 |	Which is kind of corollary to
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| IOT097 |	Predictive
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,575	| IOT097 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:01,439	| IOT097 |	Ideas connect to factories can use iot to monitor
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,975	| IOT097 |	Their production processes
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,487	| IOT097 |	And then
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:07,583	| IOT097 |	Make automated adjustments to improve quality or
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,351	| IOT097 |	Efficiency and
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,703	| IOT097 |	Inventory management is another
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,239	| IOT097 |	Remote patient monitoring
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,287	| IOT097 |	Zack and we're bringing back the pacemaker
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:20,127	| IOT097 |	Smart meters which we talked about for like a decade
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,175	| IOT097 |	And is actually a real thing
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,223	| IOT097 |	It's just going to get better
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,759	| IOT097 |	Fleet Management
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,039	| IOT097 |	Connected cars
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,319	| IOT097 |	Distributed generation
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,599	| IOT097 |	And Storage
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,903	| IOT097 |	This is for energy again
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,439	| IOT097 |	It's actually something that
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,719	| IOT097 |	People are really excited about
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:39,071	| IOT097 |	Things like Tesla's powerwall technology which utility in California just
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| IOT097 |	Open data to the grid
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,471	| IOT097 |	Things like that we're going to be seeing those things really
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,263	| IOT097 |	I guess start to come online soon
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:54,687	| IOT097 |	It's it's interesting in the BCG report that they have a time frame for maturity for Ollie's
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,223	| IOT097 |	Topics that you just mention and
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:03,135	| IOT097 |	I'm not surprised to see remote patient monitoring being the farthest out for maturity and the reason being is
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,951	| IOT097 |	Is all the privacy laws and some we're still figuring all that out
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:09,023	| IOT097 |	We're going to get there because we have
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,583	| IOT097 |	We are hitting a demographic
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,095	| IOT097 |	Crisis in
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,399	| IOT097 |	Actually everywhere
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,447	| IOT097 |	Where there not enough doctors to see people
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:19,263	| IOT097 |	And the doctors aren't necessarily in the right place
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,799	| IOT097 |	As a patient so
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| IOT097 |	This is going to become really
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,639	| IOT097 |	YouTube people ask your Echo
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,455	| IOT097 |	Here are my symptoms what should I do
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,759	| IOT097 |	By the way
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,831	| IOT097 |	Let's talk about new skills for your personal assistant
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| IOT097 |	Because holy cow
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,135	| IOT097 |	There's some really cool stuff
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,159	| IOT097 |	Morris County
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,719	| IOT097 |	So this is a Google home tips
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,999	| IOT097 |	This Is Us in it
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,559	| IOT097 |	Brought this up and I had no idea this
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:45,631	| IOT097 |	Could happen but you can actually tell your Google home
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,911	| IOT097 |	To remember
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,959	| IOT097 |	Where you put things
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,471	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,263	| IOT097 |	You say hey G
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,823	| IOT097 |	Remember that my passport is in
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,383	| IOT097 |	My dresser drawer
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,175	| IOT097 |	And then
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,711	| IOT097 |	Later on you can be like
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,503	| IOT097 |	He where is my password
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,295	| IOT097 |	And it will tell you
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:04,575	| IOT097 |	Which is crazy
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,879	| IOT097 |	It's actually it's a really slick
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,159	| IOT097 |	Tips and tricks
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:12,255	| IOT097 |	To use because when we think of tracking we always thinking of
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,279	| IOT097 |	Devices
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,815	| IOT097 |	It was slap a Bluetooth
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,399	| IOT097 |	Tag on something you know and that way you just go to your app and you go find it
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,935	| IOT097 |	But this is using
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:22,239	| IOT097 |	I mean this is like writing down a notepad
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,775	| IOT097 |	My password is in the dresser
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:27,103	| IOT097 |	And then putting that note somewhere hoping that you don't lose that too
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,663	| IOT097 |	So it's it's a way to voice tag
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,687	| IOT097 |	Where things are
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,479	| IOT097 |	Now the key is
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,527	| IOT097 |	To keep it simple because
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,599	| IOT097 |	This is probably not like I put my keys on the counter
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,367	| IOT097 |	Tennis standings
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,903	| IOT097 |	This is probably more for
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,439	| IOT097 |	Like esoteric things like
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:43,999	| IOT097 |	Your voter registration card to send this file
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:46,303	| IOT097 |	You're going to have to remember
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,839	| IOT097 |	What you told it
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,887	| IOT097 |	So you're going to have to say hey
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,703	| IOT097 |	LG where is my voter registration
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| IOT097 |	And
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,775	| IOT097 |	Too many of those
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,799	| IOT097 |	I forgot what you told it
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:02,687	| IOT097 |	Yes you do need to be very specific in what you call things but
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,711	| IOT097 |	If you
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,247	| IOT097 |	Set up a reminder
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,271	| IOT097 |	In the most
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,623	| IOT097 |	First thing that comes to your mind most common sense thing and you're describing an object
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,903	| IOT097 |	What time you'll be okay
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:16,767	| IOT097 |	Totally see myself setting all kinds of things
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,887	| IOT097 |	I don't know let's ask
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,079	| IOT097 |	What did I tell you Google
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:35,711	| IOT097 |	I wonder also you can actually live going down the path that you can't remember what you called something
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:38,783	| IOT097 |	I'm pretty sure don't call me and we can check this
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,111	| IOT097 |	Pretty sure there are many ways to see what
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:48,511	| IOT097 |	Data Google has are you provided to Google because I know you can export that dated someone so worth it would not surprise me if they
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,071	| IOT097 |	List of all those things are available to you online
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,839	| IOT097 |	Getting to it
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,143	| IOT097 |	I will say the Google home
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,935	| IOT097 |	App drives me nuts
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,703	| IOT097 |	Because
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,983	| IOT097 |	It defaults to like
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:58,751	| IOT097 |	Play Store
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,031	| IOT097 |	Not the play store YouTube
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,055	| IOT097 |	Google
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,335	| IOT097 |	Whatever store
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,127	| IOT097 |	As opposed to like cards that
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,639	| IOT097 |	Inform you of
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,479	| IOT097 |	But you're probably right I don't have my phone right now
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:08,991	| IOT097 |	Text me so I can't
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,551	| IOT097 |	Here is the other skill that I was like
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:14,367	| IOT097 |	We got to talk about this which is Starbucks
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,647	| IOT097 |	Is now taking orders
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:16,928	| IOT097 |	Echo
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,976	| IOT097 |	And through its iOS
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| IOT097 |	And he's our voice orders
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,072	| IOT097 |	Because obviously Starbucks has had an app for a while
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,120	| IOT097 |	You have to have the Starbucks app
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,960	| IOT097 |	Once you enable that skill on your Echo you can say
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,776	| IOT097 |	Hey she who shall not be named
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,800	| IOT097 |	Order me
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,336	| IOT097 |	A Starbucks latte
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,128	| IOT097 |	It's even apparently
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:38,176	| IOT097 |	Half-caf soy milk
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,712	| IOT097 |	Grande latte you problem
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,760	| IOT097 |	Probably will have to say Grande in
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,296	| IOT097 |	Inventi and all of the words
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:43,808	| IOT097 |	What's that
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:47,904	| IOT097 |	I thought that was released
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:53,536	| IOT097 |	Yeah it's I wish I'd known about yesterday was in New York City and it was cold and I stopped in at Starbucks
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:57,376	| IOT097 |	Just use the applicant only went to pay I didn't know about that sort of tried it
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:05,056	| IOT097 |	Order order me a grande white mocha I'll be there in
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:11,456	| IOT097 |	3 hours cuz that's how long it takes me to get to New York City
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:13,504	| IOT097 |	Graham called Lexia on my phone
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,624	| IOT097 |	Right so you could theoretically just use the Lexi app to
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:21,696	| IOT097 |	Be a proxy to your Echo and do it that way
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,024	| IOT097 |	Skills
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,840	| IOT097 |	Let's see what else should we talk about
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| IOT097 |	We got to talk about
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,448	| IOT097 |	Question
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:32,960	| IOT097 |	From
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,264	| IOT097 |	Which is
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:37,824	| IOT097 |	We got a question about how to start
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:41,408	| IOT097 |	I don't mean like how to turn it on or nothing like that I mean
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,944	| IOT097 |	If you're going to build a smart home
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:45,248	| IOT097 |	What is start and it's actually
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,552	| IOT097 |	It's not a simple answer to that and the reason being
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,856	| IOT097 |	In my mind is like to your pic
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:53,952	| IOT097 |	A hug first and then you're locked into the certain devices that work that up
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:58,048	| IOT097 |	Do you pick what devices you want first and then go find a hub that works with those devices
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| IOT097 |	Do
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,376	| IOT097 |	Pick a voice control unit for speed
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,936	| IOT097 |	Echo Google home or some other solution
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:09,312	| IOT097 |	I don't there's no right answer here but I'd be curious to what your thoughts are Stacy mine are
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,848	| IOT097 |	I would probably pick
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:17,248	| IOT097 |	What devices I want first and then see what Hub is going to support most or all of those cuz
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,040	| IOT097 |	There is some difference between
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:21,344	| IOT097 |	What is a wink hub
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:24,672	| IOT097 |	Support Services with a SmartThings Hub supports and so on
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:28,768	| IOT097 |	And then face on that then you can pick your voice control unit who works with those hubs
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:29,792	| IOT097 |	Yes
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,864	| IOT097 |	There are two things that I always ask
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,168	| IOT097 |	When they cuz I get this
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,216	| IOT097 |	Question all the time all the time
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,008	| IOT097 |	So I asked him
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,032	| IOT097 |	1
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,568	| IOT097 |	What do you want to do
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,872	| IOT097 |	Because your use case is by far the most in
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,664	| IOT097 |	Agreed
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:48,992	| IOT097 |	But if you don't know cuz some people are now with the echo they're like
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| IOT097 |	I just want to
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,808	| IOT097 |	Turn my lights on
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,832	| IOT097 |	Wait that's what you want
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,232	| IOT097 |	The second question for them
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,536	| IOT097 |	Is what kind of phones do
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,864	| IOT097 |	Use or what kind of existing Digital Services
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,912	| IOT097 |	And I asked them that because
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,728	| IOT097 |	There's the homekit question
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,240	| IOT097 |	Which
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,056	| IOT097 |	Honestly I don't recommend people cuz it
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,384	| IOT097 |	Apple
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:19,200	| IOT097 |	And so many people don't have
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,992	| IOT097 |	I felt so many people do
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,016	| IOT097 |	Right
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,808	| IOT097 |	It's very bifurcate
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,368	| IOT097 |	So I always ask them.
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,928	| IOT097 |	And from there I basically go down the path of
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,952	| IOT097 |	Like the best products in
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:34,304	| IOT097 |	Those things now it's someone's just like I want to make my home smart I'm like you know what start
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| IOT097 |	Lights because
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,120	| IOT097 |	It's such a great
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,912	| IOT097 |	Easy use case
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:46,848	| IOT097 |	Is ice tear them to Voice Control because that's going to be the best way to control lights
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,408	| IOT097 |	And so I steer them to an echo or a hoe
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| IOT097 |	I steer them to
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,016	| IOT097 |	Either the Hue bulbs
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,808	| IOT097 |	Cuz they're easy
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:58,368	| IOT097 |	Although they're expensive and I tell them
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:24:58,880	| IOT097 |	Toyota Center
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,672	| IOT097 |	Or I steer them to
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,952	| IOT097 |	The WeMo
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| IOT097 |	Because
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:06,304	| IOT097 |	It's a it's an easy to implement outlet that works with Google home
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,376	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,656	| IOT097 |	Those are the kind of 2
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,448	| IOT097 |	To use cases
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| IOT097 |	Able to
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,568	| IOT097 |	If they want to get really excited and delights
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:22,944	| IOT097 |	Because I really recommend switches and then that gets into Lake scary things
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,224	| IOT097 |	Like electricity
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:26,016	| IOT097 |	And then people are like I don't
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:33,184	| IOT097 |	I steer away from switches for the same reason I mean you do installation for some people it's just overwhelming so be it and it's fine
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:39,328	| IOT097 |	I kind of prefer going with the bulb route over switches because I often find it cheaper
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,120	| IOT097 |	Really
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:48,032	| IOT097 |	Yeah I mean what's it what's a to swap out a light switch these days how much does it cost to a tablet connected light switch
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:50,080	| IOT097 |	5265 2
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,104	| IOT097 |	Depending on the switch
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,152	| IOT097 |	But then you can usually
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:02,368	| IOT097 |	Since you're going to get a hub anyway I don't feel like wiring I'm like you know what you spend fifteen $20 per bulb
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,976	| IOT097 |	It just seems
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:11,328	| IOT097 |	Cheaper and it's a lot easier to switch a ball that is to switch a switch
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,120	| IOT097 |	The switch turns off
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,888	| IOT097 |	Yep
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:20,288	| IOT097 |	No question about it and that's that's where duct tape is your friend just duct tape it up now hitting a kid
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:23,360	| IOT097 |	Play right that's that's the first thing people say what
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,896	| IOT097 |	Yeah you're right you're absolutely right
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:25,920	| IOT097 |	Can't argue with that
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:29,248	| IOT097 |	So those are like The Big Heist
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,784	| IOT097 |	I would say
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:31,808	| IOT097 |	2 somewhere
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,856	| IOT097 |	Looking at the space
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,648	| IOT097 |	Is a MyQ garage door
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,440	| IOT097 |	I see that
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:40,256	| IOT097 |	Because it is such a wonderful
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,280	| IOT097 |	Use case for like
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,816	| IOT097 |	90% of the world
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,352	| IOT097 |	Which is
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,144	| IOT097 |	You can see if your garage door is open
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:48,960	| IOT097 |	Switch a lot of people are really like
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:49,728	| IOT097 |	Concerned about
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,240	| IOT097 |	Who did
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| IOT097 |	And so I think
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:55,360	| IOT097 |	It doesn't work with anything else because the Chamberlain
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,432	| IOT097 |	They don't want you to be able to say
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,712	| IOT097 |	You know hey Echo
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,016	| IOT097 |	Open someone's garage door because they
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,296	| IOT097 |	Security issue
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,088	| IOT097 |	But
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:05,856	| IOT097 |	It's freaking
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,624	| IOT097 |	Awesome
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,416	| IOT097 |	To have it on your phone to be able to check it
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,952	| IOT097 |	Condor Avenue
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,232	| IOT097 |	Application when it's been open
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:13,280	| IOT097 |	And for too long so I actually
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,304	| IOT097 |	I gave that to my
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,584	| IOT097 |	My in-laws and they love it
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:21,216	| IOT097 |	Degree does another your two benefits that come to mind I mean one I've left
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,496	| IOT097 |	The house
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,824	| IOT097 |	Thinking of rajouri close behind me but maybe got jammed in
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:30,944	| IOT097 |	For safety reasons went back up and I did not see that since I'm leaving my garage door open all day unbeknownst to me
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,992	| IOT097 |	And to get a lot of packages
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:36,320	| IOT097 |	It's kind of Handy to be able to remotely
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:40,928	| IOT097 |	Open the garage door for somebody to drop a package off inside and close it behind them so
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,720	| IOT097 |	Benefits to those devices
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:51,424	| IOT097 |	One thing leads to another
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,216	| IOT097 |	Cameras
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,520	| IOT097 |	Just to get started you don't need to go Hog Wild
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,592	| IOT097 |	So yes if you're getting started I say pickle
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:02,688	| IOT097 |	Queso with its I'm worried about my garage being open maybe it's I'm worried about
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,736	| IOT097 |	Like I want to control my sprinkler remotely
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:08,320	| IOT097 |	Or maybe it's just I want to play with the smartphone
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,368	| IOT097 |	Sand
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| IOT097 |	Personal assistant
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,928	| IOT097 |	Ways to go
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,744	| IOT097 |	So that is hard advice there
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:16,768	| IOT097 |	Take it
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,304	| IOT097 |	And run with it
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:18,816	| IOT097 |	Because
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,352	| IOT097 |	It's so funny
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,376	| IOT097 |	You guys it really is
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,680	| IOT097 |	Superstar
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,472	| IOT097 |	Let's get to the news item
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,752	| IOT097 |	Before we
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,032	| IOT097 |	Move on to our guest
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,544	| IOT097 |	Hey Kevin
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,616	| IOT097 |	Profound
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,664	| IOT097 |	Yeah I just found out about something called
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:39,552	| IOT097 |	Ping and we talked about trackers earlier in the show saying it on Bluetooth
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,624	| IOT097 |	Slapping on a device or product and you can track it with Bluetooth
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:45,696	| IOT097 |	What happens with a Bluetooth tracker when you move out of range
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,256	| IOT097 |	Bluetooth trackers
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:53,632	| IOT097 |	So these folks at ping and it's a ping gps.com
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,192	| IOT097 |	How to get away what's inside
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,008	| IOT097 |	Have a Bluetooth tracker that also
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,288	| IOT097 |	Has GPS
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:05,664	| IOT097 |	But wait there's more it actually has a 3G cellular radio as well
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,456	| IOT097 |	So you pretty much have
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:12,320	| IOT097 |	Ubiquitous ranches pretty much anywhere within reason obviously
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:14,880	| IOT097 |	You can get a cell phone signal
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:18,208	| IOT097 |	See where this thing is because it's got all the radios inside
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:23,328	| IOT097 |	It reminded me of the the tile which is a Bluetooth tracker we talked about in the past
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:29,728	| IOT097 |	Because it's it's similarly shaped and it's not that big 1.34 in
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| IOT097 |	Chi-square
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:36,128	| IOT097 |	So not much bigger than a quarter or a face of a Smartwatch for example
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,920	| IOT097 |	And it's got all these radios inside now
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:42,016	| IOT097 |	Early birds can get this for stability of $79
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:47,392	| IOT097 |	It's going to be quite a bit more expensive if you don't get in on the early bird I think it's a hundred
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:53,792	| IOT097 |	$30 but interesting thing is the cellular service so that you can go
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,584	| IOT097 |	Stop and find this thing pretty much anywhere
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:59,424	| IOT097 |	And then what happens after that year was my question so I dug around
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,472	| IOT097 |	$36 for
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:04,800	| IOT097 |	Cellular coverage for this Tim tracker
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:08,384	| IOT097 |	For each additional year and that's not bad $3 a month
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:12,736	| IOT097 |	To be able to track something pretty much anywhere well beyond the the
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:19,136	| IOT097 |	Range of Bluetooth so interesting to me I'm thinking about getting one not sure where I'd use it yet but you could you can put it on a pet
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,208	| IOT097 |	You can give it to a kid put in a backpack I mean there's a lot of
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:27,840	| IOT097 |	Yeah just look around the house and he's sleeping so
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,400	| IOT097 |	Interesting because it does put in
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:33,728	| IOT097 |	Far more radios in caused and is not
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,752	| IOT097 |	Terribly expensive
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:42,176	| IOT097 |	Roughly three months they say before need to recharge
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,992	| IOT097 |	That's great
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:52,160	| IOT097 |	It is rechargeable so it has a panic button built into so if you are out and about and something tear
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:52,928	| IOT097 |	Terrible happens
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:57,792	| IOT097 |	You just click the panic button and contacts through the GPS and cellular radio will get notified
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:01,632	| IOT097 |	Nice all right
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| IOT097 |	Other news is
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:11,616	| IOT097 |	We talked about them actually after CES because they were going to watch the App Store and one of the reasons we said that might make sense his
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:14,176	| IOT097 |	Because it's really hard to just sell devices
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:16,736	| IOT097 |	And make money and low and behold
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,784	| IOT097 |	There is a Slowdown in
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:21,344	| IOT097 |	Market Smartwatch kind of market and Fitbit
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:24,928	| IOT097 |	Laid off 6% of its staff which is about 100 in
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,696	| IOT097 |	Handjobs
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,232	| IOT097 |	And
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:31,072	| IOT097 |	They only sold 6.5 million
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:33,376	| IOT097 |	Devices in the fourth quarter of last year
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:36,704	| IOT097 |	And that was actually a good quarter for them cuz it includes the holidays and
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,032	| IOT097 |	App Store
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:43,104	| IOT097 |	So that's not great news
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,896	| IOT097 |	Fitbit CEO James Park
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,688	| IOT097 |	Says that they're actually
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:50,272	| IOT097 |	Making some Acquisitions I'm going to do some interesting cool things
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,576	| IOT097 |	They did bipedal they actually bought
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,856	| IOT097 |	Better watch
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,880	| IOT097 |	Some assets from
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:55,904	| IOT097 |	Coin
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,952	| IOT097 |	Which one you talk about next
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:59,232	| IOT097 |	So we could see
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:03,328	| IOT097 |	Payments and some other interesting things come here to make it a more compelling
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:03,840	| IOT097 |	Auction
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,960	| IOT097 |	Yeah I'm as far as coin a Fitbit bought coin
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:12,800	| IOT097 |	Back in May of last year and that is the programmable
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:13,824	| IOT097 |	Looks like a
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:18,944	| IOT097 |	It a smart credit card I guess you could say you can load it up with your credit card information and it looks like a credit card and
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:21,248	| IOT097 |	And companies can swipe it for
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:25,856	| IOT097 |	Payments but you don't need your credit cards there cuz I leave formation is stored in the card and
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:28,416	| IOT097 |	Then the magnetic strip is reprogrammed
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:32,512	| IOT097 |	Coinstar
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,536	| IOT097 |	Because some
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,072	| IOT097 |	Cardiff
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:43,520	| IOT097 |	Correct correction Fitbit botcoin last year they actually did say they're going to shut down the coin developer Pro
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:50,944	| IOT097 |	And they did that and now they're saying that the product services for coin will be shut down at the
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,712	| IOT097 |	The end of February
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:52,992	| IOT097 |	The cards
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:55,296	| IOT097 |	If you have a coin you can still use it
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,832	| IOT097 |	As long as the battery lasts
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,880	| IOT097 |	Because you can't replace the battery
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:02,208	| IOT097 |	But once the batteries God it's useless at that point
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,024	| IOT097 |	Sad
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,376	| IOT097 |	Grimm
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,424	| IOT097 |	Use the sad news bets for the day
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:15,520	| IOT097 |	Let us move on to our guests
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,288	| IOT097 |	Goodbye Kevin

EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:26,272	| IOT097 |	For Felicity Mormon who is going to talk about smart Apartments
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:32,672	| IOT097 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the end
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:38,048	| IOT097 |	Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Felicity Mormon
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,328	| IOT097 |	Who is the CEO of Stratus
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:40,864	| IOT097 |	Hi Felicity
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,400	| IOT097 |	Hi Stacy how you doing
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,680	| IOT097 |	So well
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,448	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:46,240	| IOT097 |	First off we should talk about
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:48,032	| IOT097 |	What Stratus does so people get a sin
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,080	| IOT097 |	So what we're going to talk about so
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:50,848	| IOT097 |	Tell us about Stratus
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:54,176	| IOT097 |	Perfect status provides access
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:57,760	| IOT097 |	Energy and automation for multifamily
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:00,064	| IOT097 |	Which is commercial residential or apartments
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:07,232	| IOT097 |	So anybody who is renting an apartment right now and is still listening to the show despite our crazy focused on
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:07,744	| IOT097 |	Single family
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,048	| IOT097 |	This is your
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:10,816	| IOT097 |	Show
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:15,424	| IOT097 |	Those are you guys are in over a hundred and fifty thousand
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:16,960	| IOT097 |	Apartment
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,984	| IOT097 |	Peanuts right now
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:21,824	| IOT097 |	You guys door locks you do energy control little bit of automation
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,360	| IOT097 |	You do it all
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,920	| IOT097 |	From the perspective of the land
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:29,248	| IOT097 |	The right that's cracked we really focus
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:32,832	| IOT097 |	On a return on investment for your property owner or manager
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:36,928	| IOT097 |	We find but they're the ones who are purchasing the technology
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:37,952	| IOT097 |	To put into the building
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,280	| IOT097 |	So our focus is on making sure if he's been by
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:43,584	| IOT097 |	Why would a property manager
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:44,864	| IOT097 |	Put
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| IOT097 |	Connected
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,144	| IOT097 |	Devices
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,704	| IOT097 |	There's a ton of reason
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:52,544	| IOT097 |	The most frequent reason we see like I said his return on investment
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,616	| IOT097 |	So if you have an access manager
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:56,896	| IOT097 |	Control platform
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:57,920	| IOT097 |	That French
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,224	| IOT097 |	Bluetooth as ours is
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:03,808	| IOT097 |	Suddenly you don't rekey door locks anymore
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:06,624	| IOT097 |	You don't replace credentials with hard cheese
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,160	| IOT097 |	Now you're at
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:08,928	| IOT097 |	Troy just
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,208	| IOT097 |	Sending a credential
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:10,720	| IOT097 |	To the phone
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:13,280	| IOT097 |	Or even a smart card or fob
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,096	| IOT097 |	But you're no longer creating
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:16,864	| IOT097 |	Those hearts
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,656	| IOT097 |	And if you think about hospitality
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:21,984	| IOT097 |	Princeton when was the last time you used the heart
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,008	| IOT097 |	Christian hospitality
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:26,848	| IOT097 |	We don't do it anymore for me as well
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,384	| IOT097 |	Jackie
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,920	| IOT097 |	And frankly the same thing for energy
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,992	| IOT097 |	Martyr control of your buildings energy usage
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:35,552	| IOT097 |	The residents when they leave
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,624	| IOT097 |	There's a real return
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,160	| IOT097 |	On managing. Unit
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| IOT097 |	For you
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,256	| IOT097 |	And not the maintenance person whose painting it
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:47,072	| IOT097 |	So we're seeing real return on investment
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,864	| IOT097 |	But that's not the only reason
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,912	| IOT097 |	Multifamily the hot Market
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:54,496	| IOT097 |	There's a lot of buying and selling the wing on a building
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:58,080	| IOT097 |	And it's a great way to differentiate your property
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:00,640	| IOT097 |	When there is a super sexy Tower going up across
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,712	| IOT097 |	So you throw in some Bluetooth door locks
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,504	| IOT097 |	Smart thermostat
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:07,552	| IOT097 |	And you can actually LeapFrog
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,576	| IOT097 |	The new construction
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,344	| IOT097 |	If they're not careful
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,136	| IOT097 |	Got it
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:11,904	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:14,208	| IOT097 |	Most people who live in apartments are like
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,256	| IOT097 |	My landlord won't let me put in a nest
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,304	| IOT097 |	My landlord won't let me
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,584	| IOT097 |	You know put the August lock on
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:23,168	| IOT097 |	Can you talk about some of the Practical reasons why
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:28,544	| IOT097 |	Yeah absolutely so that door lock is a big deal
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:32,384	| IOT097 |	You don't want as a property owner or manager
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:33,920	| IOT097 |	To be locked out of that unit
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,456	| IOT097 |	For maintenance
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,736	| IOT097 |	For emergency
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,272	| IOT097 |	From a fire marshal
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:41,344	| IOT097 |	Perspective you have to have control of all of the credentials
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,136	| IOT097 |	In your building
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,416	| IOT097 |	You're legally liable
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:50,816	| IOT097 |	So if you switch that out without your property owner or manager knowing and there is a maintenance issue or a management animal
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,584	| IOT097 |	Emergency
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,864	| IOT097 |	Are you now
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,168	| IOT097 |	Chicken that liability onto yourself
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,448	| IOT097 |	Adventure
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,240	| IOT097 |	The owner still liable
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:02,080	| IOT097 |	So there are some serious ramifications
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,872	| IOT097 |	Can switching out the door lock party
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,176	| IOT097 |	Not from an energy standpoint
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,224	| IOT097 |	It's a little looser
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:09,504	| IOT097 |	But at the same time
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:15,136	| IOT097 |	A lot of these building management systems or energy management systems that exist today
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:15,904	| IOT097 |	Around 9
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,672	| IOT097 |	HVAC system
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:19,744	| IOT097 |	Won't interact well with a brand-new thermostat
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:23,328	| IOT097 |	These were installed 20-30 years ago
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,096	| IOT097 |	Sometime
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,632	| IOT097 |	So we're seeing a lot of conflict
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:29,728	| IOT097 |	Emma technology when renters try to put in something smart
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:30,752	| IOT097 |	Or something
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,264	| IOT097 |	Knox
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:34,336	| IOT097 |	I was going to say old and dumb let's say it
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:37,664	| IOT097 |	Boiler systems
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,944	| IOT097 |	Sometimes decades-old
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| IOT097 |	Yes cuz you guys are based out in the North
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,576	| IOT097 |	Exactly
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:47,392	| IOT097 |	And despite the fact that we're installed in 45
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,928	| IOT097 |	State every single
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,208	| IOT097 |	State has its own
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:51,488	| IOT097 |	Boss
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,512	| IOT097 |	Around access
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,048	| IOT097 |	They have their own laws around energy
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:57,376	| IOT097 |	Around what the landlord is liable for
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:58,912	| IOT097 |	If there's no heat
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,680	| IOT097 |	Princeton
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,728	| IOT097 |	So these are pretty tremendous
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:06,080	| IOT097 |	Really obstacles to overcome in the space
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:08,128	| IOT097 |	Lived in apartment actually for
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| IOT097 |	Fairly recently
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,200	| IOT097 |	Why you guys renovate at your house
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:11,968	| IOT097 |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,736	| IOT097 |	I think it was a nightmare
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,832	| IOT097 |	Just for the visual it's
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,344	| IOT097 |	3 kids
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,880	| IOT097 |	Two dogs
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,160	| IOT097 |	Myself and my husband
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,208	| IOT097 |	And an occasional nanny
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,488	| IOT097 |	In a three-bedroom apartment
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,024	| IOT097 |	Which is 18
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,352	| IOT097 |	Which is a huge apartment
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:31,936	| IOT097 |	But we were talking teenagers
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:32,704	| IOT097 |	So we have a
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:37,056	| IOT097 |	Ended beyond that in some pretty much the way from these are not small dog
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,336	| IOT097 |	30 pounders
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,104	| IOT097 |	This was
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,640	| IOT097 |	A learning curve for me
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:41,920	| IOT097 |	All over again
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,712	| IOT097 |	So during that
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,248	| IOT097 |	You actually said she came up with the
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:47,808	| IOT097 |	It sounds like about a dozen ideas for
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,088	| IOT097 |	Connected things
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,856	| IOT097 |	Was in the apartment
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,904	| IOT097 |	So I'd love to hear some of your ideas
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| IOT097 |	And see what
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:58,816	| IOT097 |	People who rent can actually do in their Apartments even if their landlords aren't
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,328	| IOT097 |	Connecting thing
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,888	| IOT097 |	And he's maybe two.
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,680	| IOT097 |	No that's
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,704	| IOT097 |	A great question
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,472	| IOT097 |	Just
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:07,264	| IOT097 |	The ability of a cell
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,312	| IOT097 |	This is somewhat embarrassing but
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:10,592	| IOT097 |	I lost my
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:12,896	| IOT097 |	To the door the second day
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,688	| IOT097 |	We're moving in
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,456	| IOT097 |	Hectic
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,480	| IOT097 |	Life is crazy
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,784	| IOT097 |	I never lost my phone though
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,064	| IOT097 |	Somebody call me
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:24,672	| IOT097 |	Google find my phone within 2 days
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:31,072	| IOT097 |	Lego Back to the leasing office at the Saturday there's maintenance person they're going to charge me $175
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,096	| IOT097 |	Painful
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:35,936	| IOT097 |	How old is Bruno $175
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:41,056	| IOT097 |	A nice apartment like I said it was a big one the only place we could all fit so there was
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,848	| IOT097 |	The ramifications
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,384	| IOT097 |	Really painful
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,944	| IOT097 |	And I thought you know
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,712	| IOT097 |	On my home
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:52,320	| IOT097 |	Just my phone why can't I do that and apartments and then I started thinking about the
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,088	| IOT097 |	Comparison
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:54,112	| IOT097 |	Paula Deen I thought
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,392	| IOT097 |	Starwood
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,928	| IOT097 |	Is moving towards best
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,696	| IOT097 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:58,976	| IOT097 |	Prudential
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,792	| IOT097 |	Why can't we do that so it's really what started me thinking
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,864	| IOT097 |	You're the next thing I know
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:07,936	| IOT097 |	The washing machine and dryer inside the apartment break
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:11,776	| IOT097 |	And I have to go and use the community
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:12,544	| IOT097 |	Washer and dryer
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:15,872	| IOT097 |	No I'm washing clothes for 5 people
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:18,432	| IOT097 |	This is no small task if I did everyday
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,224	| IOT097 |	I would have multiple loads
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,248	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:26,880	| IOT097 |	I don't know that a lot of people outside of Apartments were called this even but I'm trying to
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:30,208	| IOT097 |	Watch my laundry in between
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:32,768	| IOT097 |	A dozen other people using that washer and dryer
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:34,560	| IOT097 |	There were multiple
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:36,352	| IOT097 |	But there was never a Time
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:40,192	| IOT097 |	When it was obviously and easily free and accessible
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:42,752	| IOT097 |	That's another thing that we can see with our app
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,544	| IOT097 |	When is the laundry open
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,592	| IOT097 |	How many people are in
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:47,360	| IOT097 |	Space
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:51,456	| IOT097 |	Beacon Technologies tremendous how many people are in the community center
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,760	| IOT097 |	Is this something I want to participate in
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:54,784	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,832	| IOT097 |	One thing led to another
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:41:00,160	| IOT097 |	And it became so obvious that an app
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,696	| IOT097 |	Four arrested
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,976	| IOT097 |	Living in the community
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,280	| IOT097 |	Could give me more information
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,560	| IOT097 |	10 even
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,584	| IOT097 |	A single-family home app
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:08,864	| IOT097 |	Do I have a package
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:12,704	| IOT097 |	Do I have a free washer and free dryer
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,520	| IOT097 |	Do I need to give access to an Airbnb guest
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,568	| IOT097 |	I mean things.
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,848	| IOT097 |	Go even Beyond
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:21,920	| IOT097 |	What's happening in single-family today I was surprised
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,992	| IOT097 |	And sometimes unfortunately so
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,784	| IOT097 |	To determine that there were a dozen
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,832	| IOT097 |	Additional use cases
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:29,600	| IOT097 |	For multifamily
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,136	| IOT097 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,416	| IOT097 |	Just makes your app
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,696	| IOT097 |	An offering soap
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,464	| IOT097 |	Hopefully better
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,232	| IOT097 |	About certain time
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,280	| IOT097 |	So what about
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,816	| IOT097 |	People who live in
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,584	| IOT097 |	Prince today
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:44,192	| IOT097 |	I get emails every week from people who like I can
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,728	| IOT097 |	I guess I could do some light bulbs
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:49,312	| IOT097 |	Are there any other things
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,592	| IOT097 |	You know iot that
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:53,663	| IOT097 |	B on the go that can make apartment life a little less painful
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:56,223	| IOT097 |	Yeah so we love light bulbs
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:59,807	| IOT097 |	For this reason it's something you can take with you so you don't mind investing in it
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,879	| IOT097 |	We don't recommend investing in anything that becomes a fixture
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:06,719	| IOT097 |	In that apartment obviously so that includes the door locks and thermostats to your point
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:07,743	| IOT097 |	We are having a
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:08,767	| IOT097 |	Re-time
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:10,047	| IOT097 |	With
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:10,559	| IOT097 |	Google
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,351	| IOT097 |	And with Amazon
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,631	| IOT097 |	With their AI
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,935	| IOT097 |	Both home and Echo
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,471	| IOT097 |	Are tremendous devices
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,263	| IOT097 |	That will connect
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,031	| IOT097 |	Any device
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:22,335	| IOT097 |	What's the cost of a practical in disagree
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,103	| IOT097 |	Timer
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,127	| IOT097 |	Priority
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,431	| IOT097 |	If my 8 year old can use it
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,711	| IOT097 |	By all means give it a shot
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:32,319	| IOT097 |	Sounds good okay
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,135	| IOT097 |	But you guys
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:39,999	| IOT097 |	So with Z-Wave you can actually like make
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:42,047	| IOT097 |	You could I could bring in like a SmartThings
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:48,447	| IOT097 |	Controller for example in make my Apartments existing sensor system a secondary part of the earth SmartThings
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:49,983	| IOT097 |	How the secondary controller for those things
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,543	| IOT097 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,823	| IOT097 |	Is that something that
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,359	| IOT097 |	You think is a
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,895	| IOT097 |	Bible Way Forward for people who aren't
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:58,431	| IOT097 |	Nothing crazy like that
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:42:59,967	| IOT097 |	I think it is
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:02,527	| IOT097 |	And one of the things that I've enjoyed playing with
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:05,343	| IOT097 |	Since I got into this space is the lamp module
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,903	| IOT097 |	It seems obvious
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,927	| IOT097 |	As a
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:12,511	| IOT097 |	Tremendous part of what we're doing but you can plug anything into that
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:14,047	| IOT097 |	Lights on off
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:18,911	| IOT097 |	Since my curling iron because I am the person who's guilty of leaving it on
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:19,935	| IOT097 |	I make sure it's off
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:23,775	| IOT097 |	Simple easy iot play
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:26,591	| IOT097 |	But anybody can do and you can plug in lamp
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,127	| IOT097 |	You could plug in your radio
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,431	| IOT097 |	I know who has the radio but you get my point
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,991	| IOT097 |	You can plug in any device
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:38,623	| IOT097 |	That can carry that load electrically so you want to plug your refrigerator into them obviously
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:44,255	| IOT097 |	But that's a great opportunity to play with home automation in ways that are meaningful to the individual
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:47,583	| IOT097 |	Write in an apartment you're going to lose out and take them with you when you move
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,119	| IOT097 |	So.
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:49,631	| IOT097 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,911	| IOT097 |	It's a great one
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:54,239	| IOT097 |	Anything you can plug in or screw in
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:54,751	| IOT097 |	Go for it
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,287	| IOT097 |	Got it
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:57,567	| IOT097 |	Alright so
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:01,919	| IOT097 |	What is the future for Seymour smart Apartments is this something that's
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:04,223	| IOT097 |	People kind of
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:08,063	| IOT097 |	Are apartment companies waiting to see what standards I don't know
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:10,367	| IOT097 |	Yeah there's a lot of wait and see
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:14,463	| IOT097 |	But with nearly a hundred and fifty thousand units installed
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,255	| IOT097 |	If you can
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:18,303	| IOT097 |	Count a real return on
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,583	| IOT097 |	Much of the property owner
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,863	| IOT097 |	The person who's paying for that
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:22,911	| IOT097 |	Then they will buy
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:25,727	| IOT097 |	Still looking for a return on investment
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:26,495	| IOT097 |	Around
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:27,007	| IOT097 |	2 years
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:32,639	| IOT097 |	Anything longer than that and there's a lot of ambiguity in the future just like any real estate
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:36,735	| IOT097 |	But if you can talk about it to your return on investment or exit
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:37,503	| IOT097 |	Or energy
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,807	| IOT097 |	And you're going for a smart building play
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:41,343	| IOT097 |	That includes smart residence
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,623	| IOT097 |	Then your integration
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,927	| IOT097 |	If you're looking at the resident
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:47,487	| IOT097 |	Then you're going to rely on Revenue list
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:48,767	| IOT097 |	And that's a much harder sell
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:51,327	| IOT097 |	Okay yes cuz I was wondering like
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:57,215	| IOT097 |	Do you think people are willing to pay like 30 bucks extra a month or 40 bucks extra month for
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,751	| IOT097 |	Automation in Access
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,311	| IOT097 |	We are seeing Revenue list
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:05,151	| IOT097 |	In Houston but which is a super-hot multifamily market
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:09,247	| IOT097 |	We've left around it completely smart automated
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,039	| IOT097 |	So this is access
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:16,159	| IOT097 |	Is energy and this is at least one automation play which is typically a light switch
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:17,951	| IOT097 |	Andorra bulk
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:25,631	| IOT097 |	Fairly simple for you and me who have spent so much time and single-family but for
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:27,167	| IOT097 |	Multifamily that's a serious play
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:29,215	| IOT097 |	And so we are seeing
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,751	| IOT097 |	You know 3540
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,031	| IOT097 |	As much as
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,055	| IOT097 |	60 on the West Coast
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,079	| IOT097 |	Dollars a month
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:38,431	| IOT097 |	No I don't rely on that because Market shift
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,479	| IOT097 |	And certainly real estate market
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,039	| IOT097 |	I'm sure today smart
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:43,551	| IOT097 |	Tomorrow's news
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:45,599	| IOT097 |	Exactly
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:47,647	| IOT097 |	Something worth seeing
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:51,231	| IOT097 |	In this industry and I anticipate it will continue today
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:54,815	| IOT097 |	Differentiator you know this is a competitive differentiator
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,863	| IOT097 |	Tomorrow it will be a competitive advantage
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,399	| IOT097 |	Cars that are reliable
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:45:59,679	| IOT097 |	2xist
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,471	| IOT097 |	Pretty soon it'll be industry standard
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:04,543	| IOT097 |	It will be the way that it is much for hospitality
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:07,359	| IOT097 |	So
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:11,711	| IOT097 |	What are the concerns around security and what do you have to do to harden
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:14,015	| IOT097 |	Kind of especially for something like access
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,039	| IOT097 |	The heart in that
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:16,063	| IOT097 |	4
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,879	| IOT097 |	Multi-family units because I can totally
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:21,951	| IOT097 |	I have Bluetooth door locks
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:24,511	| IOT097 |	Cisco shopping
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:28,607	| IOT097 |	Yeah absolutely. Is something that is our primary focus
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:32,191	| IOT097 |	So we have former googlers on our team focus on security
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:34,495	| IOT097 |	People who have done this before careers
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:37,823	| IOT097 |	Emma and I try to stress this with the most space especially
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,359	| IOT097 |	Now you're not dealing with the
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:41,407	| IOT097 |	Single-family home you're dealing with 300 home
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:42,687	| IOT097 |	In one whack
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:46,783	| IOT097 |	You have to be more cognizant and more careful
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:48,831	| IOT097 |	Encryption is that much stronger
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:53,183	| IOT097 |	And with that much more focused on the handshakes between devices
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:58,047	| IOT097 |	It's what we spend most of our time on I had somebody on a panel the other day say
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:02,143	| IOT097 |	You know what are they going to do you know hockey thermostat into what temperature it is
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:03,679	| IOT097 |	But they see you and I know
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:05,471	| IOT097 |	That's what happened at Target
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,543	| IOT097 |	And they were on the hook for billions of dollars
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:12,895	| IOT097 |	We can't be lackadaisical. Security it has to be foremost Focus
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:14,687	| IOT097 |	Focus
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,455	| IOT097 |	Anybody
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:18,271	| IOT097 |	Trying to enter iot But specifically this space
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:19,551	| IOT097 |	Where you have
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,367	| IOT097 |	300 units under your control at a time
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,391	| IOT097 |	It's that much more important
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,183	| IOT097 |	Sure that's like
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:27,231	| IOT097 |	300 potential MacBooks are television
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,023	| IOT097 |	Exactly
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:30,559	| IOT097 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:31,583	| IOT097 |	Single family
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:33,119	| IOT097 |	Barely it
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:35,679	| IOT097 |	Barely Main Street it's not mainstream
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:36,191	| IOT097 |	It's like
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,983	| IOT097 |	It's less than 10%
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,263	| IOT097 |	Adoption rate so far
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:41,567	| IOT097 |	So when I think about apartments
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:45,151	| IOT097 |	Maybe the people are younger but do people come into this
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:49,759	| IOT097 |	These apartments and they're like where's my keys so I'm going to use my what no
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,295	| IOT097 |	So how is that process of
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,599	| IOT097 |	Acclimating residents to
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,111	| IOT097 |	Smarttech
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:56,927	| IOT097 |	Yeah
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:48:02,815	| IOT097 |	So there's definitely a learning curve bear as well sometimes I hear away already have a smart
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:04,095	| IOT097 |	Apartment because I have
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,119	| IOT097 |	Amazon's Echo
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:07,423	| IOT097 |	What are you connecting not to
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:09,215	| IOT097 |	Well I know the temperature outside
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:12,287	| IOT097 |	Okay great but can you control your lighting
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:14,079	| IOT097 |	Or do you know that your door is locked
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:16,127	| IOT097 |	Or can you adjust your thermostat
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:19,199	| IOT097 |	So there is an equivalent education happening
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,479	| IOT097 |	In
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:21,759	| IOT097 |	The multifamily space
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:24,575	| IOT097 |	But it's happening 300
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,111	| IOT097 |	Home to the time
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:28,159	| IOT097 |	And that's a really significantly different
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:29,951	| IOT097 |	Funny
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:31,999	| IOT097 |	People are very accepting
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:33,791	| IOT097 |	Smart access
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:38,911	| IOT097 |	And Smart Energy in multifamily because they too can make that connection between
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:40,959	| IOT097 |	Multifamily in hospitality
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:44,287	| IOT097 |	Oh I use the smart potential at the hotel all the time
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,591	| IOT097 |	Oh I use my phone
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,615	| IOT097 |	Open my door at my hotel
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:49,407	| IOT097 |	So there's
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,175	| IOT097 |	I think
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:51,455	| IOT097 |	I'm easier
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,223	| IOT097 |	Time
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:52,991	| IOT097 |	Poor education
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:54,271	| IOT097 |	With multifamily
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:55,807	| IOT097 |	Then an even single panel
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:58,111	| IOT097 |	How do you have that conversation with
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:58,879	| IOT097 |	Single-family home owner
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:01,695	| IOT097 |	Is that on the floor of a retail establishment
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:06,303	| IOT097 |	No our property owners and managers are having two conversations on our behalf
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:07,583	| IOT097 |	I'm excited about
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:09,631	| IOT097 |	Again because we focused. Return
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,935	| IOT097 |	Vitamat owner
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:14,239	| IOT097 |	So they're happy to tell you about your smartphone
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:16,031	| IOT097 |	As a credential
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:18,847	| IOT097 |	Or even a card you don't have to have a smartphone
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,895	| IOT097 |	To have a smart apartment
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:24,991	| IOT097 |	Oh that's good cuz I was just thinking of all those and I'm sure there's not that many
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:25,759	| IOT097 |	But there are people who
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:30,623	| IOT097 |	Aren't you know when my dad got a smartphone
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:35,231	| IOT097 |	I kind of shifted my own thought I would like with my dad can use a smartphone
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,535	| IOT097 |	He just doesn't love tok the way I do
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:40,095	| IOT097 |	But when you got one
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:41,119	| IOT097 |	I thought okay the
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:41,887	| IOT097 |	Types of really
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:46,751	| IOT097 |	We're really moving into a safe space for expectation
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:48,287	| IOT097 |	Abusive
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:53,151	| IOT097 |	So I'm not running too many people who don't have a smart device as a matter of fact
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:54,431	| IOT097 |	Alyssa
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:54,943	| IOT097 |	Surprise me
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:57,247	| IOT097 |	We're finding Boomers
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:49:59,551	| IOT097 |	Who are downsizing
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:01,599	| IOT097 |	I'm moving into apartment
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:03,391	| IOT097 |	And manage condo type
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:03,903	| IOT097 |	Spaces
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:05,695	| IOT097 |	To be equally
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,231	| IOT097 |	Excited about this
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:07,999	| IOT097 |	Is technology
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:10,047	| IOT097 |	There's often times
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:10,815	| IOT097 |	Fixed income
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:12,863	| IOT097 |	And they're really cognizant
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:15,679	| IOT097 |	Who they love
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:16,959	| IOT097 |	To use their phone
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:18,495	| IOT097 |	To adjust the thermostat
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:19,519	| IOT097 |	They check up on each other
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:25,151	| IOT097 |	Honey did you you know turn the thermostat down or we're going on vacation
EDL	00:50:25,663	00:50:28,479	| IOT097 |	So wishing Boomers is excited about this technology
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:31,807	| IOT097 |	MLB family and even Assisted Living
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:32,831	| IOT097 |	As we are millennial
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,623	| IOT097 |	That's really surprising
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:37,439	| IOT097 |	That's pretty cool
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:38,975	| IOT097 |	Awesome
