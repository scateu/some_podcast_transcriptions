EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,176	| IOT134 |	If you want to be closing
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:26,688	| IOT134 |	Check it out
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:27,968	| IOT134 |	Enough
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,040	| IOT134 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,064	| IOT134 |	Iraq
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,880	| IOT134 |	The show is on crack
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,184	| IOT134 |	All right
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:43,072	| IOT134 |	So the two a vulnerability discovered
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,352	| IOT134 |	Wifi
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,632	| IOT134 |	Just
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| IOT134 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:46,912	| IOT134 |	All of it
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,496	| IOT134 |	All of life I-80
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,264	| IOT134 |	Major
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,544	| IOT134 |	Protocol breach
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| IOT134 |	4
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,616	| IOT134 |	WPA2
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| IOT134 |	Yes which is a security standard
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,688	| IOT134 |	802. 11n
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,016	| IOT134 |	The problem is
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,528	| IOT134 |	In the
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,088	| IOT134 |	Handshake so what happens is during
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,112	| IOT134 |	Handshake
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,392	| IOT134 |	Someone who
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,160	| IOT134 |	Who wants to
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| IOT134 |	You can basically
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:09,952	| IOT134 |	Reset
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| IOT134 |	So they can go
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,048	| IOT134 |	And there's lots of
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| IOT134 |	Technical stuff here in a
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,352	| IOT134 |	If you really want that working
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| IOT134 |	Link to that mashona
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,656	| IOT134 |	But the bottom line
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,216	| IOT134 |	Is basically anything that uses
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,728	| IOT134 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,032	| IOT134 |	And follows the Wi-Fi protocol
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,080	| IOT134 |	There traffic can now be
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:31,968	| IOT134 |	Bright and granted we're talk about Wi-Fi so this is any potential attacks or X
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:36,064	| IOT134 |	Exploits would have to happen within range of your wireless network so it's not a remote type
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,624	| IOT134 |	Attack
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,136	| IOT134 |	Russian
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,416	| IOT134 |	But
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:42,208	| IOT134 |	For any of us who remember
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| IOT134 |	Are the birth of Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| IOT134 |	We're driving and driving around
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| IOT134 |	Checking out
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,864	| IOT134 |	So I remember
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,680	| IOT134 |	Having someone I've had someone try to attack my
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| IOT134 |	Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| IOT134 |	My house
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,752	| IOT134 |	Registering a Brute Force attack
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,544	| IOT134 |	After they get the handshake
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,104	| IOT134 |	And they managed to get that data by sitting
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,664	| IOT134 |	Actually on the street behind my house
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,456	| IOT134 |	And using a
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,248	| IOT134 |	Antenna
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT134 |	So
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,064	| IOT134 |	Is this
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,344	| IOT134 |	A great attack
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:14,208	| IOT134 |	Back from a scalability perspective but if you have a creepy technically Savvy neighbor who wants to get naked
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,256	| IOT134 |	Get pictures from your webcam
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:16,768	| IOT134 |	Might happen
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,327	| IOT134 |	I can't believe I thought of that
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,119	| IOT134 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,679	| IOT134 |	So for all of you guys were like Oh Stacy that's awful
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,959	| IOT134 |	What do we do
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,287	| IOT134 |	I need it really bad
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:32,127	| IOT134 |	You actually have to update both your router and the client side of eye
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,687	| IOT134 |	Paises earlier on it look like maybe wouldn't have to
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT134 |	Update
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| IOT134 |	But Kevin and I
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,039	| IOT134 |	Octopus
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| IOT134 |	And we talked to some security
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| IOT134 |	To err on the side of safety
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:51,839	| IOT134 |	Yeah yeah I'm always hoping I could just update my router I have a Google Wi-Fi router I'm thinking okay we'll
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,631	| IOT134 |	No Google is one of the many companies
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,703	| IOT134 |	That was notified about this back in August and they're working on a patch
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,495	| IOT134 |	But that's not going to cut it it
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:04,127	| IOT134 |	It's going to have to be client-side devices to so when Google does its patch the routers
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| IOT134 |	Best Android phones
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:10,271	| IOT134 |	And that's going to be a tough update to get to every single phone for them because
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:16,671	| IOT134 |	It may depend on if they can push it directly or they have to go through carriers around the world and so on so forth but that's just one particular
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,439	| IOT134 |	Instance
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,231	| IOT134 |	I'm more concerned about and I think
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,791	| IOT134 |	Our listeners are probably more concerned about
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:26,399	| IOT134 |	All of the other connected devices it typically don't get updated that often
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,447	| IOT134 |	Wangjing routers typically don't
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,263	| IOT134 |	What about your webcams
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,335	| IOT134 |	What about your locks what about any Wi-Fi
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,359	| IOT134 |	Iot device you have
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,431	| IOT134 |	This is actually a one-time run like
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:42,015	| IOT134 |	I'm kind of glad not that many of my devices use Wi-Fi but
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,319	| IOT134 |	Darca market so this is a concern
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,855	| IOT134 |	So I will just say
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| IOT134 |	Comcast said
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,975	| IOT134 |	Probably about a year ago that their average
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,255	| IOT134 |	Number of Wi-Fi devices in the
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,535	| IOT134 |	Is 11
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:54,559	| IOT134 |	On their Network
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,095	| IOT134 |	Most of those are
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,399	| IOT134 |	Computers Kindles phones
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT134 |	Printers
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,959	| IOT134 |	My printer is never sent me a
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,103	| IOT134 |	Right
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:10,687	| IOT134 |	But you probably have to do that manually by the way printers are known for their automatic updates
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| IOT134 |	So I just looked
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,551	| IOT134 |	My Eero wi-fi system
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,855	| IOT134 |	Which by the way Euro has a fix
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,135	| IOT134 |	That is coming out soon
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,415	| IOT134 |	But is not out
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| IOT134 |	It will update automatically
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:25,791	| IOT134 |	I got 31 devices that are currently on my network
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,351	| IOT134 |	And they're about five or six that were
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,119	| IOT134 |	We recently on my network
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,959	| IOT134 |	Including
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| IOT134 |	Somebody's MacBook
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,543	| IOT134 |	That's my job
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,079	| IOT134 |	My daughters
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,991	| IOT134 |	So here's the rundown of popular things because
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| IOT134 |	Cuz we found it
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT134 |	Lovely List
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,807	| IOT134 |	That we will also
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT134 |	Link to it
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,343	| IOT134 |	Update
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| IOT134 |	So I talked to linksys Linksys
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT134 |	Is aware of the issue
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,255	| IOT134 |	Tp-link says they don't know what they're affected
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,279	| IOT134 |	Which
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,559	| IOT134 |	Terrafin
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| IOT134 |	This why I'm actually very
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,143	| IOT134 |	Concerned with t
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,935	| IOT134 |	Tp-link stuff even though I have their switches
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,751	| IOT134 |	My house I don't like their Casa stuff
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:10,079	| IOT134 |	Not because it's bad but because I worry about their ability to
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,847	| IOT134 |	Updating
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,639	| IOT134 |	They have so many things and they're not great
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:20,063	| IOT134 |	I should note only because I mentioned it earlier the original Google onhub there's tp-link made one of those two versions
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,367	| IOT134 |	So that's concerning to me
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,695	| IOT134 |	I feel like
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| IOT134 |	I regret
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,023	| IOT134 |	Amazon is in the process of reviewing
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| IOT134 |	Nest
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,655	| IOT134 |	Has told me that it is in the process
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:38,751	| IOT134 |	Of updating its devices and those updates will roll out automatically
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:41,823	| IOT134 |	Knickers where the problem
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,895	| IOT134 |	Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,663	| IOT134 |	Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,199	| IOT134 |	Is
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,991	| IOT134 |	Fixed Jesse and the stretch
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,271	| IOT134 |	Squeezy and others
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,343	| IOT134 |	Barbusa system is good.
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,623	| IOT134 |	Our Voice Mail system
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,695	| IOT134 |	He will be
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,511	| IOT134 |	Intel has released firmware updates for
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,559	| IOT134 |	For all of its chipset so a lot of the ones in your
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,327	| IOT134 |	Computers
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,351	| IOT134 |	That'll be good
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,119	| IOT134 |	Windows
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| IOT134 |	Good
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:06,911	| IOT134 |	Linux
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,703	| IOT134 |	Mac OS
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| IOT134 |	It's the
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT134 |	Mac OS
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| IOT134 |	1011.
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,311	| IOT134 |	Beta
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,383	| IOT134 |	They're still working on that that's correct
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,431	| IOT134 |	Let's see what other ones do we
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:23,295	| IOT134 |	I can tell you what I care about cuz I'm looking through the list of devices in my Google Wi-Fi app
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,087	| IOT134 |	My wink hub
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| IOT134 |	And I would think people have Samsung SmartThings hubs
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,671	| IOT134 |	Don't know yet
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| IOT134 |	Samsung is not doing so
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,999	| IOT134 |	Skin Samsung
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,327	| IOT134 |	How about my Roku TV
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,703	| IOT134 |	It's actually built into the TV so I need to get a software update
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| IOT134 |	Roku via
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,519	| IOT134 |	The app
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| IOT134 |	On the TV maker
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,103	| IOT134 |	Worried about Ray
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,895	| IOT134 |	Kevin arjune
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,967	| IOT134 |	I was just going to say the dirtiest thing in my list
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,247	| IOT134 |	Your Nevins exactly
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,527	| IOT134 |	My ecobee thermostat
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,319	| IOT134 |	My Amazon Kindle
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:03,999	| IOT134 |	Everything pretty much pretty much so that's a list of things that I sent out a bunch of emails I'm still sending out
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,839	| IOT134 |	Maybe next week we'll have a wonderful update for you
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,607	| IOT134 |	With everything that
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,887	| IOT134 |	We talked about this
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| IOT134 |	Patched
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,191	| IOT134 |	I'm not holding my breath but
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| IOT134 |	That's cracked
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:20,895	| IOT134 |	And to be fair with me we're not getting to the low-level technical details of this because there are so many details to understand
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:24,479	| IOT134 |	So definitely you click the link that we're going to have in the show notes
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,295	| IOT134 |	I mean I just went to crack a tax.com which is spelled it all out
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,111	| IOT134 |	You better make a couple cups of coffee to read through all this
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT134 |	It's a lot
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,159	| IOT134 |	We did read through it
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT134 |	If you want to know what
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,815	| IOT134 |	I did not know what announces now I know
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,583	| IOT134 |	Nonces are
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,911	| IOT134 |	So I spent the whole time
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,775	| IOT134 |	Is a number that is not necessarily
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,359	| IOT134 |	What is meant only to be used once and never repeated
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,407	| IOT134 |	So the key is the flaw in WP
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,199	| IOT134 |	Pa2 allows that knots
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,223	| IOT134 |	To be repeated
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,271	| IOT134 |	So then you can
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,295	| IOT134 |	Use that session key
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,855	| IOT134 |	Now you know what an answer
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,695	| IOT134 |	I wonder if it stands for number once knots
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,815	| IOT134 |	Until the caffeine stick it in can I say
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,607	| IOT134 |	You be like heaven you're exactly right
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,727	| IOT134 |	But now it makes sense but no don't go in Jeopardy without
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,239	| IOT134 |	Not true
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:19,775	| IOT134 |	All right
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,543	| IOT134 |	So
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT134 |	Let's move on from
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| IOT134 |	Cracked beak
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,663	| IOT134 |	I am not disabled
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,175	| IOT134 |	My Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,455	| IOT134 |	I am not
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,247	| IOT134 |	Taking devices offline
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,039	| IOT134 |	Mostly because they don't have cameras facing
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:31,807	| IOT134 |	Inside if I did
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,343	| IOT134 |	Take those offline
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,671	| IOT134 |	So can we talk about another Downer story
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,695	| IOT134 |	How I spent my Monday
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,743	| IOT134 |	I spent mine researching crack Kevin
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:46,399	| IOT134 |	Driving 230 miles round-trip unexpectedly to this is just background for the next news item so
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,679	| IOT134 |	Spare me
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:51,519	| IOT134 |	One minute here to tell little personal story on Sunday night when my son returned
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,799	| IOT134 |	From home to college
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,591	| IOT134 |	She goes to Bloomsburg University
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:57,663	| IOT134 |	Which is about 110 miles away from where we live
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:01,759	| IOT134 |	He got there at 10 at night on Sunday night and I don't have my apartment key
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,551	| IOT134 |	It was at his girlfriend's near my house
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,623	| IOT134 |	What is good to build a Do
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,183	| IOT134 |	The key and drives it all the way up there on Monday
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,975	| IOT134 |	Drives all the way back home
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,303	| IOT134 |	And I said guess what you're getting an early Christmas gift
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:17,887	| IOT134 |	My friend you were getting a Bluetooth tracker for your apartment keys
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:22,495	| IOT134 |	And that leads us to our news item related to this that Samsung
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:26,335	| IOT134 |	Actually just announced and will be showing off this week or deliver next week
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,871	| IOT134 |	A GPS tracker
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:32,479	| IOT134 |	That uses nb-iot cat M so basically it's
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,503	| IOT134 |	On the IRT
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:37,343	| IOT134 |	And Cat and that is correct I had a slash in the show notes
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| IOT134 |	My bad I did not say
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| IOT134 |	You are correct
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:42,975	| IOT134 |	They're going to showing that off this weekend
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| IOT134 |	Samsung developer
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:50,399	| IOT134 |	Protect actually going on today they say it's small It's relatively small and smaller track
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| IOT134 |	Widen one point
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,703	| IOT134 |	2 centimeters thick
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:56,799	| IOT134 |	Is waterproof and dustproof you have to recharge it
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,335	| IOT134 |	The battery inside last for
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,383	| IOT134 |	7 Days on a single charge
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,199	| IOT134 |	You can certainly attach it to anything you like just like
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| IOT134 |	Traditional
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,247	| IOT134 |	Tracking device
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:09,599	| IOT134 |	Martha GPS as I said wifi-based positioning and cellular ID so
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:16,255	| IOT134 |	It's got a lot of ways to be found I don't know what it's going to cost or anything like that but I'm kind of interested in this especially because
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,559	| IOT134 |	It can be use pretty much anywhere there's a
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,583	| IOT134 |	Narrowband Network
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:23,423	| IOT134 |	And that's in more and more places especially in Europe although the cat enemas going to help
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,263	| IOT134 |	Other than T-Mobile most of the carriers
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| IOT134 |	More focused
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,567	| IOT134 |	Uncat am
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,591	| IOT134 |	As opposed to NBA
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,615	| IOT134 |	Although
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,919	| IOT134 |	I'm going to say I think
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,943	| IOT134 |	Your AT&T to Verizon
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,039	| IOT134 |	AT&T is doing cat am I know that
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,391	| IOT134 |	Okay so let's talk about why you chose
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,719	| IOT134 |	I thank you because
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:51,071	| IOT134 |	I may have missed it in my research but I know that you've looked at these I'm sure some of our listeners have looking
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,631	| IOT134 |	The tiles the
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,935	| IOT134 |	Trackers there's various ones out there
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,495	| IOT134 |	I was looking for a very specific function
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:04,127	| IOT134 |	And I only found one device that could do it and that function is a walk away or separation
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,431	| IOT134 |	An alert and it seems to me again
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,199	| IOT134 |	My research
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,479	| IOT134 |	Maybe baby is lacking
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,015	| IOT134 |	Only the older
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,783	| IOT134 |	Tracker
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,295	| IOT134 |	Bravo
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,087	| IOT134 |	Nothing new trackr pixel
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,903	| IOT134 |	Can do separation alerts meaning
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,207	| IOT134 |	If my son has one attached to his keys
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,743	| IOT134 |	Any walks out of Bluetooth range
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:24,863	| IOT134 |	From those keys when you left them behind 30 feet away or whatever it is is phone will get an alert at 9
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,423	| IOT134 |	I dummy you left your keys in
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,959	| IOT134 |	So I ended up
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,007	| IOT134 |	He's getting today from Amazon he's getting a tree
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| IOT134 |	Bravo
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,615	| IOT134 |	I couldn't find any other trackers that do that and I don't understand why that is
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,895	| IOT134 |	And you had some thoughts
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,919	| IOT134 |	Before the show witch
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,223	| IOT134 |	Are valid thoughts would you want to share them cuz I'm not
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,759	| IOT134 |	Sure so 1 is
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,039	| IOT134 |	There's also a battery
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:46,623	| IOT134 |	They're not always
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,159	| IOT134 |	2 is
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,951	| IOT134 |	Not everybody wants like
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,231	| IOT134 |	I walk out of Bluetooth
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| IOT134 |	Stranger in my house all the time
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,047	| IOT134 |	Nikes for exam
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,095	| IOT134 |	And I would hate for it to beep every time
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,655	| IOT134 |	Absolutely not
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,471	| IOT134 |	Sure and I would have the same problem
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,775	| IOT134 |	Yeah I would have the same problem in my home if I used
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| IOT134 |	I totally get that
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,407	| IOT134 |	Okay so what so what
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,175	| IOT134 |	I countered
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:16,319	| IOT134 |	I see your I don't want this feature within I'll raise you that a that feature should be optional it is
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,855	| IOT134 |	You have to enable it
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,623	| IOT134 |	In the tracker app
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,439	| IOT134 |	In this particular instance number one or number two
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,975	| IOT134 |	Why aren't these things smarter
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,279	| IOT134 |	And I mean that because we already have
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:31,679	| IOT134 |	Sensors that they can leverage it on her phone they work with a phone with a companion to your phone so why not have a
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| IOT134 |	GPS geofence
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,239	| IOT134 |	That says hey
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,287	| IOT134 |	Disable this feature when I'm at home
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,823	| IOT134 |	And I've walked away without my
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,871	| IOT134 |	Mikey's cuz granted if I walk out of the house without me
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,895	| IOT134 |	My car keys
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:43,455	| IOT134 |	I kicked my car obviously I know I have left
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,479	| IOT134 |	My keys at the house
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,783	| IOT134 |	I don't need to know that when I'm at home
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:49,343	| IOT134 |	When I'm out and about the GPS from the
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| IOT134 |	Hey let's start
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| IOT134 |	Doing separation
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,487	| IOT134 |	Because now you're out and about
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| IOT134 |	I just
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,559	| IOT134 |	Why we not leveraging that wire at maker
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| IOT134 |	There's not do not the app makers book
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,887	| IOT134 |	Device makers with their apps not doing that
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:08,543	| IOT134 |	Well and that's a good question because we've talked actually you talked about this with your airpods so we'll bring the same cuz this is kind of a
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,847	| IOT134 |	Bluetooth means
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| IOT134 |	I don't know what to do
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,151	| IOT134 |	The Bluetooth aspect that needs
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,919	| IOT134 |	To be smarter
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:19,039	| IOT134 |	Or if it's at makers need to adapt their apps to Bluetooth being on
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,807	| IOT134 |	Thinx
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:23,647	| IOT134 |	And talking to the phone more often and what that will do for
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,439	| IOT134 |	Core power consumption
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,463	| IOT134 |	Your airpod
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,487	| IOT134 |	Sample is actually really
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,023	| IOT134 |	It's the other side of the same
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,887	| IOT134 |	Well I think you're letting to my Apple watch with LTE
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:39,007	| IOT134 |	Because one of the points that I had made again continuing on the app makers need to
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| IOT134 |	Add more smart
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,847	| IOT134 |	A nest cam use just your phone at the home away feature
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:47,455	| IOT134 |	Right so you can set it up to not record when you're at home and it uses the GPS new phone to say
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| IOT134 |	Your home check the cameras don't need it
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,831	| IOT134 |	The issue I have with nest and probably with other apps is
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| IOT134 |	When I leave the phone at home and go for
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,391	| IOT134 |	Run
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:57,183	| IOT134 |	I have my Apple watch LTE
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:03,327	| IOT134 |	Add and find my friends my wife can see where I am find my friends are smart enough to know a his phone is at home he's out and about
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,607	| IOT134 |	With the watch
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,143	| IOT134 |	He was where he is on the roads right now
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| IOT134 |	But Nest does not know
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,215	| IOT134 |	Has any other device that uses my
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,983	| IOT134 |	IPhone as
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| IOT134 |	The primary
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,775	| IOT134 |	Point of presence
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| IOT134 |	So
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:16,383	| IOT134 |	Third party app makers and device makers are going to have to start thinking as you just said
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:22,527	| IOT134 |	For more Bluetooth devices more devices that let you still be connected away from the phone that's something that I would love to see
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,063	| IOT134 |	Happen very soon
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,111	| IOT134 |	OC and I was talking about your airpod
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:29,183	| IOT134 |	Challenges of if you're listening to TV
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,487	| IOT134 |	Your TV on them and then you look off in Iraq
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:32,767	| IOT134 |	Your phone is
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:39,167	| IOT134 |	And that is a guy that's a little aggressive it automatically switches me to the phone if it sent as a video I might want to listen to
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,447	| IOT134 |	On the browser on the phone
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,239	| IOT134 |	Disconnect from the TV
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,007	| IOT134 |	What I didn't want to be
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,871	| IOT134 |	Heaven is that because we thought
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,663	| IOT134 |	Mini Bluetooth devices acting is
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,991	| IOT134 |	But we also have many different
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,759	| IOT134 |	Computer sources
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:57,855	| IOT134 |	Soda used to be only our phone right that these devices talk to
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,415	| IOT134 |	But now it could be your watch or
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| IOT134 |	Your
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| IOT134 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,999	| IOT134 |	Or your television
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:08,863	| IOT134 |	Suddenly both the Computing device in the apps running on them to be smarter about what
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,399	| IOT134 |	Computer to use
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,423	| IOT134 |	But also
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:15,263	| IOT134 |	The Bluetooth devices need to be smarter about when to switch to these diff
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,543	| IOT134 |	Different devices it's
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,055	| IOT134 |	Kind of a night
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,103	| IOT134 |	I would think it's hard
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,383	| IOT134 |	Contacts
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,151	| IOT134 |	Of
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| IOT134 |	Device usage is hard
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:27,807	| IOT134 |	When you're switching between multiple connected devices so I'm not trying to rag on these companies
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,855	| IOT134 |	Too much because I get the challenge I do
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:34,207	| IOT134 |	I hope they recognize the challenge and they start to do something about it is really my point
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,975	| IOT134 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| IOT134 |	All right
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,511	| IOT134 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,535	| IOT134 |	Some devices
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:38,559	| IOT134 |	Sonos
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,583	| IOT134 |	You
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,607	| IOT134 |	Did a review
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:48,031	| IOT134 |	I did I did I so I spent a week with the new Sonos one and wrote up a review
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:52,639	| IOT134 |	Over at Stacey on iot. Calm so you can read the whole thing if you'd like but the
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,431	| IOT134 |	Too long didn't read version is
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,711	| IOT134 |	I haven't never use a sauna
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,503	| IOT134 |	And having
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:01,087	| IOT134 |	Purchase for Echo devices and one Google home device
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,903	| IOT134 |	I'm pretty much sold on replacing some Echoes with
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,207	| IOT134 |	Bassano's once I'm going to send the review unit back
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| IOT134 |	I'm going to buy
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,767	| IOT134 |	Possibly one or two
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,839	| IOT134 |	Sonos one devices to replace them because
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,887	| IOT134 |	The sound quality is outstanding
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,191	| IOT134 |	Edit does work really well as a
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,727	| IOT134 |	Digital assistant
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,751	| IOT134 |	With a few limitation
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,287	| IOT134 |	Remember this is not an a
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:26,687	| IOT134 |	Echo device is a Sonos device using Alexa voice Services which is done through this Sonos
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,991	| IOT134 |	Alexa skill and by limitations I mean
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,807	| IOT134 |	You can't use the drop-in feature
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:36,159	| IOT134 |	For example on a Sonos you can do voice calls on it
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,439	| IOT134 |	Echo with matter baby
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,487	| IOT134 |	Cannot do it on the Sonos at least not yet
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:42,047	| IOT134 |	And I questioned you ever will be able to I think Amazon
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:46,655	| IOT134 |	Hold on to those and have some product differentiation as they allow voice services to expand.
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,423	| IOT134 |	Other devices
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,215	| IOT134 |	I couldn't group Bassano's with
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| IOT134 |	Echo is for speakers
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:54,335	| IOT134 |	Mix and match groups here she come out and we'll have to go all in if you want
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| IOT134 |	Multi-room audio
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:19:00,479	| IOT134 |	So it works really well as a personal digital assistant with a few limitations I should say
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:03,807	| IOT134 |	And it is 199 and the cool feature that is coming
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,599	| IOT134 |	Don't know
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,623	| IOT134 |	You obviously didn't ask
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,647	| IOT134 |	It's not out there yet
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| IOT134 |	Is
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,951	| IOT134 |	It will have Google Assistant
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| IOT134 |	Also
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,231	| IOT134 |	In addition to madam
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,023	| IOT134 |	628
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,327	| IOT134 |	That's correct and that's a big
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:20,191	| IOT134 |	Piece of my decision making process because Sonos is smartly being
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:23,263	| IOT134 |	Assistant agnostic are there also adding air place
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:25,311	| IOT134 |	Support next year as well which
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,591	| IOT134 |	I presume will allow you to
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,639	| IOT134 |	Voice control Apple music and other things
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,663	| IOT134 |	So that
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,455	| IOT134 |	Choice of assistant
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,759	| IOT134 |	Is really appealing to me personally
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,783	| IOT134 |	I switch between
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:40,671	| IOT134 |	I don't want to have to be locked in a sense to an assistant ecosystem as it were
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,719	| IOT134 |	All right
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| IOT134 |	Now let's see
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,303	| IOT134 |	Some fun Halloween
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,583	| IOT134 |	Here we go
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:52,447	| IOT134 |	Smart home devices have reached 15% of households that's up from 10%
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| IOT134 |	Last eight
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,495	| IOT134 |	Last April being able to
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,543	| IOT134 |	So this is from the MPD
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:57,823	| IOT134 |	So
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,103	| IOT134 |	Yay
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,383	| IOT134 |	Progress
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,431	| IOT134 |	Honeywell Honeywell last week
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| IOT134 |	Best investor that way
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,271	| IOT134 |	Was saying hey get rid of your Aerospace
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,319	| IOT134 |	Division in Honeywell turned around and said no
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,855	| IOT134 |	Instead we're going to get rid of her
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,367	| IOT134 |	Car parts
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:13,951	| IOT134 |	Diagnostics of and our home security business
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,231	| IOT134 |	Which includes
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,999	| IOT134 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:16,767	| IOT134 |	Home stuff
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,791	| IOT134 |	So this is
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:22,399	| IOT134 |	Dollars worth of Revenue on the home security business that's going to include
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,935	| IOT134 |	You know the lyrics
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:28,543	| IOT134 |	Home cameras the formal home security Honeywell does have a home security business much like
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,335	| IOT134 |	80 +
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT134 |	They also
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,639	| IOT134 |	This week
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:37,247	| IOT134 |	Actually announced that they are going to go on Indiegogo to sell a all-in-one sink
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,575	| IOT134 |	Security device that has a camera and some sensors kind of like the
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT134 |	Piper are the
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,111	| IOT134 |	Canary
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:42,879	| IOT134 |	Dictionary
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,903	| IOT134 |	Which is kind of struggling and
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,183	| IOT134 |	So
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,463	| IOT134 |	Before that that should
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:46,975	| IOT134 |	To be out in
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT134 |	On Indiegogo
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:54,911	| IOT134 |	Also wanted to talk about ADT Pulse briefly because a couple weeks ago we did a thing on security and ADT
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:21:01,055	| IOT134 |	Hey pulse is still around Stacy we actually have over 2 million installs and in
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,335	| IOT134 |	April we integrated with
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,103	| IOT134 |	Amazon
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,871	| IOT134 |	Echo
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,175	| IOT134 |	So for all of you who are wondering ATT
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,455	| IOT134 |	The pulse is the
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,991	| IOT134 |	ATT home automation
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,551	| IOT134 |	It still exist
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,343	| IOT134 |	And now they also have their
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:13,855	| IOT134 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,184	| IOT134 |	A meeting with ADT.
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,464	| IOT134 |	How those two things
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:18,976	| IOT134 |	Things are actually
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:24,352	| IOT134 |	So it's not often we talk about Apple and Industrial iot but just today
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:28,704	| IOT134 |	The company announced via press release that they are ruining with General Electric
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,264	| IOT134 |	GE to offer a
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,032	| IOT134 |	Predix
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,568	| IOT134 |	SDK 4
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:37,408	| IOT134 |	IOS apps that will be downloadable next week
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:43,808	| IOT134 |	Basically it will help developers build apps for iPhones and iPads using predicts data collection analysis and
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,600	| IOT134 |	And I was wondering why they're doing this
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,136	| IOT134 |	I kind of think
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:49,696	| IOT134 |	Minato wants to certainly make industrial and
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,720	| IOT134 |	Enterprise apps
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:57,120	| IOT134 |	For the mobile devices I get that but I also think that GE decided hey if we standardize on iOS devices
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,888	| IOT134 |	And Max
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:04,288	| IOT134 |	You know maybe we can get a little bit of a break here so let's do a little deal and as a result GE is going to do just that
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,080	| IOT134 |	Guys on iPhones iPads at Max
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,360	| IOT134 |	330
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,384	| IOT134 |	Thousand
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:14,784	| IOT134 |	Employees so that's a big device win for Apple overtime and then all those users will get
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:19,648	| IOT134 |	To use apps with geez products on their iOS devices
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:25,280	| IOT134 |	So that was their first big partnership I believe
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:25,792	| IOT134 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT134 |	All right
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:31,168	| IOT134 |	Also this week we should probably have done this earlier on in the show but that's okay
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,192	| IOT134 |	Can't we got some fun test
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:36,032	| IOT134 |	So Amazon Echo added voice recognition
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,568	| IOT134 |	To its devices
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,616	| IOT134 |	Who You Are
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,152	| IOT134 |	Or
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:41,920	| IOT134 |	Dashie
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| IOT134 |	Where does
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,736	| IOT134 |	Google home
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,504	| IOT134 |	A while back
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:49,088	| IOT134 |	Couple months ago they released it so six different users
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:51,648	| IOT134 |	It would recognize us 264
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,720	| IOT134 |	User voice profiles
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,744	| IOT134 |	Hey, Mama
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,024	| IOT134 |	My mom
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,584	| IOT134 |	A my husband when he says, I'm
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,608	| IOT134 |	It's going to call his mom
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:04,448	| IOT134 |	So we tested this at my house in
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,216	| IOT134 |	This is what we
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,008	| IOT134 |	1
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,800	| IOT134 |	It is not consistent so here we go
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:11,616	| IOT134 |	Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,408	| IOT134 |	Yay live TV
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,688	| IOT134 |	Oar radio
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,200	| IOT134 |	Alexa
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,224	| IOT134 |	Who am I
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,504	| IOT134 |	I'm not sure who
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:24,672	| IOT134 |	Not sure who's speaking but your instincts is account I'm actually I tested
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,720	| IOT134 |	And I had the same problem although I was not in Europe
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,232	| IOT134 |	I was in mine
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:30,816	| IOT134 |	Like
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,864	| IOT134 |	There's a lot of Pies going out on this
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,888	| IOT134 |	What's happening
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,424	| IOT134 |	We tested this
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:41,056	| IOT134 |	It's a little iffy and it worked for my husband sometimes
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,616	| IOT134 |	And it didn't work for him when he fakely
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,152	| IOT134 |	Mages voice deeper
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,968	| IOT134 |	It doesn't work for me it only works for me
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,272	| IOT134 |	So I'm not sure what's going
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,064	| IOT134 |	What you do is you go into
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,344	| IOT134 |	To your settings
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,624	| IOT134 |	What's on your bottom
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,928	| IOT134 |	And you go into
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,696	| IOT134 |	Voice
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,464	| IOT134 |	And you're going to
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:59,744	| IOT134 |	Basically say
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,024	| IOT134 |	I'm me
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,816	| IOT134 |	Or maybe you're someone else if you're not you
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,608	| IOT134 |	And you're in someone else's account
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT134 |	The matinee
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:08,448	| IOT134 |	And then you just say 10 phrases and
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,984	| IOT134 |	Principally that
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:16,896	| IOT134 |	The challenge I had was with my daughter who doesn't actually have a handset
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,688	| IOT134 |	That right now because I'm using her phone
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,968	| IOT134 |	For my own
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:20,992	| IOT134 |	While I wait for my pixel
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,552	| IOT134 |	And so to get her
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,320	| IOT134 |	On the thing
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| IOT134 |	I would have to
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,392	| IOT134 |	Find a third device in my
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,672	| IOT134 |	A household that she could use
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:29,952	| IOT134 |	Golang
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,512	| IOT134 |	And she would also need an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,792	| IOT134 |	So and she doesn't have
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:34,816	| IOT134 |	Because she's 11
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,608	| IOT134 |	What was a little wacky for
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,448	| IOT134 |	And I also think
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,728	| IOT134 |	Kids
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| IOT134 |	Their voices
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,008	| IOT134 |	Change
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:49,920	| IOT134 |	So if you're going to use this in a family setting keep that in mind because as the kids get older they may need to retrain the voice right
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,944	| IOT134 |	Definition for their
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,456	| IOT134 |	Profile
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,736	| IOT134 |	Final
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,528	| IOT134 |	Super fun you guys
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| IOT134 |	So if
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,184	| IOT134 |	Was inspired
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,464	| IOT134 |	Possibly buy
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:02,976	| IOT134 |	They say it was
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,048	| IOT134 |	So it was inspired
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,328	| IOT134 |	Buy a video idea
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,864	| IOT134 |	Madame turn on Christmas
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,144	| IOT134 |	And they
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:10,912	| IOT134 |	Have done it
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,192	| IOT134 |	Turn on Halloween
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,472	| IOT134 |	And so
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,752	| IOT134 |	We actually abused
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT134 |	If
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,288	| IOT134 |	To create Apple
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:17,568	| IOT134 |	4
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,592	| IOT134 |	Halloween stuff
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,616	| IOT134 |	And now
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:23,200	| IOT134 |	If this done this formally so we're going to like to a blog post that has all of the
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| IOT134 |	But
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,504	| IOT134 |	Some of them include like
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,808	| IOT134 |	Changing your Hue Lights to Orange
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:28,832	| IOT134 |	On Halloween
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,672	| IOT134 |	You can do it so it pulses your lights
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,512	| IOT134 |	When your skybell doorbell detects motion so as those trick-or-treaters come up
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,304	| IOT134 |	Strobe effect
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,376	| IOT134 |	Scare the kids that's good
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,424	| IOT134 |	Don't
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,520	| IOT134 |	You can also set up a motion
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,056	| IOT134 |	And
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,848	| IOT134 |	Haven't
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,616	| IOT134 |	You know that someone's
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,384	| IOT134 |	I'm coming up to your door
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,968	| IOT134 |	We've been the past actually used it to set up a motion sensor
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,736	| IOT134 |	And then had
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,016	| IOT134 |	Blow dryer
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| IOT134 |	Plugged in
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,552	| IOT134 |	On a ghost
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,624	| IOT134 |	We made and so it would turn on the blow dryer in the
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,584	| IOT134 |	I can picture that I can see it in my head
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,400	| IOT134 |	There's a bunch of
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,936	| IOT134 |	Seas including
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:18,496	| IOT134 |	Automate some scare so if you press a button
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,032	| IOT134 |	Here.
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,056	| IOT134 |	Start cleaning
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,336	| IOT134 |	Which I guess if you stuck something
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,640	| IOT134 |	Great
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,968	| IOT134 |	Those are basically kind of
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,528	| IOT134 |	Some fun
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,296	| IOT134 |	Set up
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,856	| IOT134 |	It set up a motion sensor and have it trigger your tongue
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:38,464	| IOT134 |	Lots of fun
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,000	| IOT134 |	And check these recipes out
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:42,560	| IOT134 |	Adapt them for your products and
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:44,352	| IOT134 |	Level of scariness you want to
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,144	| IOT134 |	Create and
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,912	| IOT134 |	Happy happy
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,592	| IOT134 |	No she's not

EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,448	| IOT134 |	Answering your
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,008	| IOT134 |	So
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,032	| IOT134 |	I think that instead
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,568	| IOT134 |	News portion of the show Anne
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,640	| IOT134 |	Stay tuned for a message from our sponsor Qualcomm
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:29,920	| IOT134 |	And
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:32,480	| IOT134 |	An awesome interview with John Murray
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,272	| IOT134 |	About environmental sensing
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:36,064	| IOT134 |	And what it takes to actually key
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,088	| IOT134 |	Flood sensor
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:38,624	| IOT134 |	And what it actually takes
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:44,000	| IOT134 |	Keep flood sensors online during an actual play it's harder than you think
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:47,840	| IOT134 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:51,424	| IOT134 |	From our sponsor this week sponsor is Qualcomm
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:53,216	| IOT134 |	And I have Anthony Murray
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,520	| IOT134 |	Who is SVP and GM
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,800	| IOT134 |	A voice in music
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,824	| IOT134 |	At Qualcomm technology
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:04,480	| IOT134 |	Alright so it seems like there's a lot going on around voice interfaces speakers headphones
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,528	| IOT134 |	What are the big underlying trend
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:11,904	| IOT134 |	Yeah it's amazing, no industry and in all the years of being in the spice
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,440	| IOT134 |	I haven't seen this many major
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,464	| IOT134 |	Changes oil
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,488	| IOT134 |	Come together at one time
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,792	| IOT134 |	Uses release
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:18,816	| IOT134 |	Streaming the Odeon
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,120	| IOT134 |	The contents rather than downloading it as they use
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| IOT134 |	Doing this is really driving the
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:23,936	| IOT134 |	Requirements
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,960	| IOT134 |	Very robust
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:25,984	| IOT134 |	Wireless communication
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:30,080	| IOT134 |	Then we see some of the handset manufacturers not removing the
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:32,640	| IOT134 |	Traditional three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,688	| IOT134 |	And that's really feeling the mark
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,480	| IOT134 |	Looking for wireless speakers and head
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:39,552	| IOT134 |	And then the number of the Odyssey
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,576	| IOT134 |	Assistant devices
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,856	| IOT134 |	Ominously
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,880	| IOT134 |	Plexus is damaged
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,184	| IOT134 |	Is an ex-felon Google home in this is really
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:48,256	| IOT134 |	Educating consumers and the Mons
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:52,352	| IOT134 |	Full voice interaction and voice control of their products within the Hein
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,632	| IOT134 |	We'll see this
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,168	| IOT134 |	Trend we're really
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| IOT134 |	People of China
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,728	| IOT134 |	Enterprise a new category which has been
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:03,616	| IOT134 |	Old Spice and this is taking a headset which Disney did it say music
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,384	| IOT134 |	Voice
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,920	| IOT134 |	A step further in adding
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,432	| IOT134 |	Functions
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,456	| IOT134 |	Hearing assist
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,272	| IOT134 |	Potential even biometric monitor
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,320	| IOT134 |	Activities except
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,112	| IOT134 |	That is a lot of computing
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,648	| IOT134 |	Empower patent
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,208	| IOT134 |	This seems like a really hard
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:18,976	| IOT134 |	Thing to build
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,280	| IOT134 |	How is Qualcomm supporting these
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:25,120	| IOT134 |	This category represent some big technical challenges
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,424	| IOT134 |	You've got a separate left and right earbuds
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,448	| IOT134 |	What is a lot of interact
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:31,520	| IOT134 |	Between the two and how do you do that and then
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,800	| IOT134 |	Pics of RF Mana
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:33,568	| IOT134 |	Guilin China
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:36,896	| IOT134 |	Cancel the ambient noise cancellation in your environment
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,456	| IOT134 |	Wilson need to make sure that there's absolutely
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,248	| IOT134 |	Audio quality
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,552	| IOT134 |	Holcomb's aptx
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,088	| IOT134 |	HD Kodak
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:50,464	| IOT134 |	And then the device has to be always listening to use us that you can access your favorite child service
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:52,768	| IOT134 |	So this functionality has so many Act
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,328	| IOT134 |	Components that need to run all day
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,120	| IOT134 |	And miniature to the point that occur
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,960	| IOT134 |	Powers absolutely of Paramount
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:05,056	| IOT134 |	Houghton Holcomb does this really brings it all together and
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:05,824	| IOT134 |	Xiaomi package
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:11,456	| IOT134 |	And efficient enough to be able to run all day Alpena
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,480	| IOT134 |	Customers realize the vision
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,016	| IOT134 |	I'll be here about
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:14,528	| IOT134 |	Goldie
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:20,160	| IOT134 |	Awesome so we're can listeners learn more and get started using qualcomm's Technologies for hearable
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,232	| IOT134 |	Let him go to Qualcomm. Calm and search
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,256	| IOT134 |	Search for voice and music
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:27,840	| IOT134 |	Then I'll find lots of information on our platform offerings
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,912	| IOT134 |	As well as some consumer research that we've done
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:34,496	| IOT134 |	And as well as various products that leverage our kokum technology
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:38,336	| IOT134 |	That's qualcomm.com and search for voice and music
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:51,648	| IOT134 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,184	| IOT134 |	And today's guest is
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,232	| IOT134 |	Mary who is the chief
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,512	| IOT134 |	Administrative officer
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,864	| IOT134 |	Hi John how are you doing today
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:03,680	| IOT134 |	I'm great Stacy thanks I'm glad to be with you
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:06,240	| IOT134 |	Man I am super excited because
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,264	| IOT134 |	You guys
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:12,384	| IOT134 |	So we should first start off by letting everybody know what the LCRA is
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,408	| IOT134 |	So I'll let you do.
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:17,504	| IOT134 |	Sure sue the LCRA was started 80 years ago
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,040	| IOT134 |	By the Texas legislature
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:22,368	| IOT134 |	And it stands for the lower Colorado River Authority which just
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:26,464	| IOT134 |	These are National and international listeners is based in Austin Texas
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,024	| IOT134 |	So there's actually another Colorado River that's into
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,840	| IOT134 |	Texas was created in 1935 in the middle of the
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:34,912	| IOT134 |	The Great Depression with a very important public mission
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,448	| IOT134 |	Provide
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:38,240	| IOT134 |	Water to Central Texas
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:42,080	| IOT134 |	Do flood control and tell people from a watershed
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:44,896	| IOT134 |	Supplying water safety standpoint but it was done at a time
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,664	| IOT134 |	When
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,944	| IOT134 |	The state didn't have any money
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:51,040	| IOT134 |	So the way they created on Sirius has a selfie
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:57,440	| IOT134 |	Supporting government entity so they gave us the ability to sell this newfangled thing called electricity on which turned out pretty
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:01,280	| IOT134 |	Also we also are a wholesale electricity provider
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,560	| IOT134 |	And the second largest
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,864	| IOT134 |	Electric transmission provider in the state of Texas
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,656	| IOT134 |	Awesome so
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:11,264	| IOT134 |	The reason I actually asked you on the show is because I was looking during Hurricane
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,800	| IOT134 |	Because I was checking
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,360	| IOT134 |	Is this River going to Crest
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,640	| IOT134 |	So I thought
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,200	| IOT134 |	Hey let's get John on the show.
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:19,712	| IOT134 |	Talk about
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,040	| IOT134 |	Things are happening
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,880	| IOT134 |	Definitely crazy
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,160	| IOT134 |	How should we think about
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,928	| IOT134 |	Offering
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,976	| IOT134 |	Real time
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:31,488	| IOT134 |	Citizens
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,584	| IOT134 |	You guys have been doing this for years so let's talk about
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,864	| IOT134 |	How you guys monitor
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,632	| IOT134 |	Two Rivers
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:43,776	| IOT134 |	Started his mission like I said from 80 years ago has started with
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:48,384	| IOT134 |	Troll Austin is a beautiful city but it's a great representative City in the sand
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:51,200	| IOT134 |	In what meteorologists call flash flood alley
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:56,576	| IOT134 |	Play so there are a lot of rivers that converge into Austin and then the number of cities along
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:33:00,672	| IOT134 |	The river all the way out to the coast that had before this very persistent problem
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,976	| IOT134 |	Ysleta gun to flood control
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:07,072	| IOT134 |	Keeping people safe from floods with something that else Siri is always been in the business
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,096	| IOT134 |	The end
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:10,912	| IOT134 |	Results I think the way we've tried
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:13,728	| IOT134 |	To live out that mission has changed as technology
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:19,360	| IOT134 |	It literally started with people who live along the river with log books
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:22,176	| IOT134 |	Who would come in a hurry down to LCRA and
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:26,016	| IOT134 |	Tell us their data and then it turned into people who would call LCRA on
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,808	| IOT134 |	Newfangled Stone Mountain's Intelius
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:32,672	| IOT134 |	What was going on with the river and we've progressed and how we do that overtime to try to keep pace
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:35,232	| IOT134 |	With you using the technology that's out there
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:41,632	| IOT134 |	Can meet at Mission to understand where the water is now and where we think it's going to be and so LCRA has
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:43,680	| IOT134 |	Is a system now that's called hydromat
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,960	| IOT134 |	That was designed
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:50,848	| IOT134 |	2 years ago and it is a that's the kind of digital version of what we used to do in that very analog
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:54,688	| IOT134 |	Manual way so we have a network is 270
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:34:01,088	| IOT134 |	What sensors that are placed in strategic locations along more than eight hundred miles of the river we collect data from
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,624	| IOT134 |	Those that data gets
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,648	| IOT134 |	Processed
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,416	| IOT134 |	And
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:08,768	| IOT134 |	Provided back out to the public First Responders and the media
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,304	| IOT134 |	Via an internet website
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,608	| IOT134 |	Hydromet. Lcra.org
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,888	| IOT134 |	And that provides
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,960	| IOT134 |	What are the county judges in our area called at the great truther
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:20,288	| IOT134 |	It's being able to provide a common data set
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,056	| IOT134 |	Reading this
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:24,384	| IOT134 |	In a real-time digital format that everybody can use across
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:25,920	| IOT134 |	Cities counties
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,968	| IOT134 |	National Weather Service
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:28,736	| IOT134 |	You name it
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,808	| IOT134 |	That's kind of where l-series not right now is to
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,344	| IOT134 |	Maintain and provide that data
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT134 |	Back under this kind of
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:38,464	| IOT134 |	Platform looks like ourselves will use for flood
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:42,048	| IOT134 |	Okay so what's the internet Network for
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,584	| IOT134 |	Because
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| IOT134 |	How much do these cost
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:48,448	| IOT134 |	How real time is the real time
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,240	| IOT134 |	LCRA
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,008	| IOT134 |	Estimate
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:52,800	| IOT134 |	Step by this point we've spent
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:56,384	| IOT134 |	Seek on the order of about 20 million dollars building
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,688	| IOT134 |	System so it's been a pretty significant in bus
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:02,016	| IOT134 |	A lot of the investment is actually in
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:02,784	| IOT134 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,808	| IOT134 |	Sending data collection
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,600	| IOT134 |	So we built
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:07,136	| IOT134 |	A 900 megahertz
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,416	| IOT134 |	Radio Network
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,720	| IOT134 |	Work that is designed to get they deduct from Oliver
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,512	| IOT134 |	Including transmission
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,304	| IOT134 |	Electric generation and water
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:18,912	| IOT134 |	But that's one of the hardest points as you need a way to get you know over 800 miles
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:22,240	| IOT134 |	Class of river you need a way to get the data back from the sensor
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:29,152	| IOT134 |	So that's where a lot of that cost is gone isn't it building radio towers in the infrastructure to connect to the sensors
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,968	| IOT134 |	With l-series Homebase the sensors themselves
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:35,040	| IOT134 |	Are great their top-of-the-line that's really the
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:39,904	| IOT134 |	Jewel of the Nile is what National Weather Service USGS others use
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:45,280	| IOT134 |	The cheapest and best flood sensors you can use these days cost between 25
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:47,840	| IOT134 |	50000 CM * $75,000
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:50,144	| IOT134 |	Santa have a lot of
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:53,472	| IOT134 |	Yeah that's pretty expensive they tend to have a lot of maintenance
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,008	| IOT134 |	So typically a technician
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| IOT134 |	Lisa glancy the Mary
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,056	| IOT134 |	12 weeks
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:36:01,664	| IOT134 |	And when you spread them out over 800 miles that that's a pretty labor-intensive crop
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,688	| IOT134 |	Possession Sarah
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:05,760	| IOT134 |	It's a great system but I think it's a system that we're trying to
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:10,624	| IOT134 |	Find ways to drive that cost down so that we could scale it to provide
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,416	| IOT134 |	In a better data from a larger
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:13,184	| IOT134 |	Region
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:15,488	| IOT134 |	Why didn't you guys choose a cellular network
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,792	| IOT134 |	4
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,840	| IOT134 |	Network or is it because
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,632	| IOT134 |	Spread across power generation
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:26,496	| IOT134 |	We're doing a good chunk of research now on
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:31,872	| IOT134 |	Cellular as a possible alternatives to at or either as an alternative or to augment
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,152	| IOT134 |	The radio coverage
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:39,552	| IOT134 |	It was timing though so at the time that the system was built to the cellular provider is didn't have enough coverage
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:45,952	| IOT134 |	And they didn't have enough data rates to be able to get this type of information back not that radio is it pretty
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,768	| IOT134 |	Piccadilly high-bandwidth mechanism but we really just
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:52,096	| IOT134 |	Fundamentally doesn't have the coverage we needed to be able to get
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:55,168	| IOT134 |	The data any other way now the cellular Networks
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:58,496	| IOT134 |	Are advancing so much and have increased their coverage so much
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:03,104	| IOT134 |	And with these new standards around what they called LTE - M
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:06,688	| IOT134 |	There's more cellular carriers that are trying to make their Networks
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:09,248	| IOT134 |	Play well with devices as opposed to West voice
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:16,416	| IOT134 |	My phone so I think it's promising that there is some potential that cellular could end up to be a good now
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:19,744	| IOT134 |	I work for us but at the time we just really couldn't get the coverage
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:26,144	| IOT134 |	And the bad wreck that we needed we also need for this type of Aspen application do we need Public Safety level reliability soap
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:28,448	| IOT134 |	If we operate our radios on that same network
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:35,360	| IOT134 |	A lot of police departments a lot of we have actually 10,000 devices connected to radio not working only 18 of them
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,128	| IOT134 |	RLC replay song
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:39,968	| IOT134 |	The rest are either devices sensors or
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:41,760	| IOT134 |	First Responders in communities
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,320	| IOT134 |	So you need kind of
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:46,624	| IOT134 |	Lots of coverage good data rates
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:51,232	| IOT134 |	Very very high Public Safety level reliability
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,280	| IOT134 |	Cellular really wasn't there
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:54,816	| IOT134 |	When we built it but I think
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:56,096	| IOT134 |	It may be there now
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:59,936	| IOT134 |	So we're really looking pretty intensely to see whether that's something we can transition
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:02,752	| IOT134 |	Alright so let's go back to the mission
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,288	| IOT134 |	Because I sit there
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,824	| IOT134 |	Look at this stuff
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,664	| IOT134 |	Is it flooding
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:10,432	| IOT134 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:12,480	| IOT134 |	It's really sad State of Affairs for me
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:16,320	| IOT134 |	How quickly is this date coming in
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:20,672	| IOT134 |	The website is to talk about what happened
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:23,488	| IOT134 |	You're a freak rainstorm
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,512	| IOT134 |	During a flood
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,792	| IOT134 |	What happens in your operations
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,352	| IOT134 |	The typical refresh rate
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:30,144	| IOT134 |	For the sensors that we have an hour about
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:35,264	| IOT134 |	Every 15 minutes for a lot of folks I think we would consider that to be fairly close to real time
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,800	| IOT134 |	That being said
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:43,200	| IOT134 |	We are doing a pretty extensive research project now to see if we can increase that or have the ability to
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:47,552	| IOT134 |	First to the sampling rate to be much faster during kind of peak conditions
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:51,136	| IOT134 |	So you know can we take readings every minute or multiple times a minute
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:55,232	| IOT134 |	But it's still you know that's still see really close to real-time but in its last flood
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:56,000	| IOT134 |	Situation
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:58,304	| IOT134 |	Specialist First Responders we really want to be able
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:00,096	| IOT134 |	Multi gather data at a higher
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,864	| IOT134 |	Playwright
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:07,264	| IOT134 |	The travel time it takes to get the data process from the sensors out onto the website is actually
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:10,336	| IOT134 |	Are they close to real time and we like to tell folks that
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:16,736	| IOT134 |	One of the nice principles about these types of systems is that the peak speed at The Inferno
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,272	| IOT134 |	Formation can travel under Network
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:22,112	| IOT134 |	Is fairly close to the speed of light which is a lot faster than water moves
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:26,208	| IOT134 |	So we should be able to get the information before the water gets there
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:32,352	| IOT134 |	In the real physical world so the processing side of its pretty near-instantaneous the sampling rate about every 15 minutes
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,400	| IOT134 |	Approved
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,448	| IOT134 |	Okay and so
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:39,008	| IOT134 |	If there's a hurricane or a massive
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:45,152	| IOT134 |	What do guys like
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:48,480	| IOT134 |	Yeah so that's another reason
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:49,760	| IOT134 |	That the radio network comes in
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,552	| IOT134 |	In a flood event
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:55,904	| IOT134 |	It typically you'll see a lot more activity around that hydroment
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:40:01,280	| IOT134 |	So the first thing we'll do in anticipation of a flooded start a fire Emergency Operations
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:06,144	| IOT134 |	We have a river operations center that stopped 24/7 all the time
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:10,240	| IOT134 |	But in an emergency will kind of kick that up to a higher response level
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,800	| IOT134 |	So additional groups will come in
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:19,200	| IOT134 |	Are Public Safety team which is one of the groups in my organization comes in and coordinates and run the unified incident command
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| IOT134 |	Structure
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:23,296	| IOT134 |	And then that can be stuffed up to 24 hours a day as well
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:25,856	| IOT134 |	Also the whole company kind of shift
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,880	| IOT134 |	So wavy
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,648	| IOT134 |	From what it's
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,464	| IOT134 |	Normally doing and kind of moves them
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:35,328	| IOT134 |	Just over to this Emergency Operations fitting so what happens in the field then
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,352	| IOT134 |	Is it becomes
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:38,912	| IOT134 |	Absolutely essential to make sure those kids are up at
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:43,520	| IOT134 |	So will have filled Cruz that'll be dispatched all over if there's any
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:49,920	| IOT134 |	Songs with either radio conductivity the gauges themselves and you can't imagine you in a flood that gauges sometimes need
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| IOT134 |	Need to be moved
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:57,088	| IOT134 |	Is it possible for them to be impacted by debris or washed away Telecom Towers can lose power which means
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,112	| IOT134 |	We have to go get
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:41:00,416	| IOT134 |	Fuel out to them to keep them up and running
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,952	| IOT134 |	So we'll have us a
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,720	| IOT134 |	Siri
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:06,816	| IOT134 |	High degree of operational focus on maintaining that Network
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,608	| IOT134 |	Keeping it running during the
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:11,168	| IOT134 |	Slides and all of our Emergency Operations
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:11,936	| IOT134 |	Calls
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,984	| IOT134 |	During a flood start with Hydro
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:20,384	| IOT134 |	So the first thing we do is look at the weather forecast and Hydromet to see where the water is going and it's really the backbone
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:21,920	| IOT134 |	As everything else that happen
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:25,248	| IOT134 |	It's beyond that to make decisions about opening and closing dams
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:29,856	| IOT134 |	Send dispatching First Responders everything is based off of that data that comes
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,904	| IOT134 |	Turn up system so one of the highest
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,928	| IOT134 |	Priorities
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:37,536	| IOT134 |	System running it is not uncommon that we have multiple Crews headed out
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,096	| IOT134 |	Go either protector gauge or move it or
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:42,144	| IOT134 |	In augmented to make sure that that system
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:42,912	| IOT134 |	Stays up and running
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:43,936	| IOT134 |	Emergency
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,472	| IOT134 |	So what you have this day
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,008	| IOT134 |	What then
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:50,080	| IOT134 |	You have obviously update the website you got the public safety camp
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:50,592	| IOT134 |	How does that
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:51,616	| IOT134 |	Going to play
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:55,199	| IOT134 |	His role is really in a
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:58,015	| IOT134 |	As a data provider so generally that's the
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,295	| IOT134 |	Part of the equation
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:03,903	| IOT134 |	Network doing ourselves but one of the things were spending a lot of time working on is
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,671	| IOT134 |	Figuring out
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:06,207	| IOT134 |	How local Jurassic
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:08,255	| IOT134 |	Cities and counties in
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:13,887	| IOT134 |	Particular can do more things with the data and so we've got some real active research in a program
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:15,679	| IOT134 |	Calling smart alert switches
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,703	| IOT134 |	How do you take
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,983	| IOT134 |	Real-time sensor data
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:20,799	| IOT134 |	And apply rules and
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,335	| IOT134 |	Models to it
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:26,687	| IOT134 |	So that in a real evacuation a real emergency
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,991	| IOT134 |	Those First Responders are
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:33,343	| IOT134 |	Empowered with much more micro targeted capabilities for alerting
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:37,183	| IOT134 |	What are the challenges that First Responders have now without that
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:39,743	| IOT134 |	Is many times evacuating a city for ants
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:44,863	| IOT134 |	Is an all-or-nothing proposition I live in the city of Cedar Park if you're there emergency manager there
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:49,471	| IOT134 |	You either evacuate 70000 people or you don't it's kind of All or Nothing
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:55,103	| IOT134 |	What would you like to do is be able to use these types of sensors to provide a platform
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:43:01,503	| IOT134 |	That those types of First Responders can use to say you know what what if I could micro-target this information figure out exactly which house
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:07,391	| IOT134 |	Exactly which neighborhoods are in Tanger and get targeted messages out to them and not alarm the entire rest
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:10,463	| IOT134 |	Maybe maybe 65
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:13,023	| IOT134 |	Housing people in Cedar Park are fine
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:19,423	| IOT134 |	And it's just 5,000 that need to get an immediate message we want to try to improve the granularity and
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,215	| IOT134 |	Does quality of those alerts
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:24,799	| IOT134 |	So that First Responders who use our data have a better
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:26,591	| IOT134 |	Experience and better outcomes
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,895	| IOT134 |	Meeting people out of the way or out of Harm's Way
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:33,247	| IOT134 |	LCRA would never see ourselves as the ones to actually generate the other
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:39,647	| IOT134 |	Because we're kind of the backend service provider but we're trying to do is to make it easier for those who actually have that Authority on the
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,415	| IOT134 |	Underground
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:44,767	| IOT134 |	To be able to have a signer green control has hounded activation happens
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:47,327	| IOT134 |	How their response to a s*** happen
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:53,471	| IOT134 |	Okay and actually tied to that would be better information not just from maybe hydromat data
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:57,311	| IOT134 |	But also date actual flooding
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:59,103	| IOT134 |	And things that I don't even know if we
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,127	| IOT134 |	Calculator
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:04,223	| IOT134 |	A lot of people were told to evacuate
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:06,015	| IOT134 |	Probably
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:08,319	| IOT134 |	I can't evacuate cuz I don't know where to
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:11,391	| IOT134 |	Those city managers
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:12,927	| IOT134 |	And First Responders are actually going to need
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,719	| IOT134 |	Not just your day. But
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:15,231	| IOT134 |	Other data
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:19,583	| IOT134 |	So that's also right and we would like to try to help them
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:22,399	| IOT134 |	Find a way to combine our data
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,935	| IOT134 |	With other data they have
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:29,567	| IOT134 |	Or either didn't know they can acquire as a city more effectively and I'll give you a great example that
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:32,127	| IOT134 |	One of the great science fiction authors William Gibson
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:36,223	| IOT134 |	Said something to the effect of the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:38,527	| IOT134 |	So I'm trying to drive to work this morning
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:39,551	| IOT134 |	Coming from a wreck
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:45,439	| IOT134 |	Using Google GPS with amazing data knows to route me around the Austin City Limits music
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:48,255	| IOT134 |	I didn't know it started Friday I thought it started
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:54,655	| IOT134 |	Saturday but I didn't need to worry about it because now that's some revelers and some folks are in the way no worries Google can rob me right around
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,191	| IOT134 |	We haven't caught up to that
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,215	| IOT134 |	Safety
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,775	| IOT134 |	So there are a lot of dangers
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:03,359	| IOT134 |	That a city would love to Route their folks around
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:09,759	| IOT134 |	But the data is not managed and combined with the same ease that Apple and Google can do
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:10,783	| IOT134 |	Do with traffic data
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:15,391	| IOT134 |	That's a huge gap and I think we'd love to try to bring
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,695	| IOT134 |	The sophistication that's already there
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:21,023	| IOT134 |	In other places with these GPS companies with OnStar
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:25,887	| IOT134 |	Others and somehow give First Responders a way to combine that with a type of data that got from folks
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:29,983	| IOT134 |	To be able to have any more effective
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:30,751	| IOT134 |	Smarter
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:32,031	| IOT134 |	Basement outside
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:35,359	| IOT134 |	Evacuation because there's so many of those things like you say that just don't
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:38,175	| IOT134 |	Makes sense in one of the challenges that First Responders have
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,967	| IOT134 |	Cuz we also don't realize quite how difficult
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:46,367	| IOT134 |	Their job is most of the time they have to develop I mean it's standard best practice if they develop all their evacuation plan
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:48,927	| IOT134 |	Years in advance of an actual situation
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:55,327	| IOT134 |	How do you ever get that right cuz every situation is different in every situation requires these kind of real-time chain
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:46:00,959	| IOT134 |	Angels and many times those things that looks too silly to us in retrospect comes from the fact that they had to build their plans
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:02,751	| IOT134 |	So far ahead of the axles
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:04,799	| IOT134 |	Situation that they can't really solve
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:06,335	| IOT134 |	Problem with great level
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,383	| IOT134 |	Awesome
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,151	| IOT134 |	And scary
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:12,223	| IOT134 |	All right now I'd like in theaters
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:15,807	| IOT134 |	So we'll look for an API to get your data in through Google
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,343	| IOT134 |	Maybe I'll keep talking to Google
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:18,111	| IOT134 |	During life
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:19,391	| IOT134 |	Crises
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,671	| IOT134 |	So what did I do
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:22,975	| IOT134 |	Would you like that you don't have
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:24,255	| IOT134 |	I think there's
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:26,303	| IOT134 |	Two main things that I
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,071	| IOT134 |	Want
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:27,583	| IOT134 |	If we don't have a
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:32,703	| IOT134 |	I think one is just more of the type of day that we have and the cost
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,239	| IOT134 |	Actor comes into
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:40,639	| IOT134 |	Play there right so keyed up budgets are limited Sea-Doo dust you can write and we can put as many gauges out there as we can visit
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,919	| IOT134 |	A lot of smaller communities is
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:45,503	| IOT134 |	To extend coverage to that the problem is
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:47,039	| IOT134 |	The cost is
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:47,551	| IOT134 |	Primitive
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:54,463	| IOT134 |	So you want to put five more gauges in now the capital Investments 250,000 500,000
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:58,815	| IOT134 |	Dollars you got to train up new workers to go maintain them that gets expensive very fast
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,863	| IOT134 |	So we're really trying hard to find
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:04,447	| IOT134 |	Cheaper and better ways to just drive the cost of those
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:10,847	| IOT134 |	The data collection down it would be great to just have more data points of the same type
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:12,639	| IOT134 |	Hypo spino water level water flosser
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,407	| IOT134 |	Be kind of info
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,967	| IOT134 |	But I think you know the other part of your question about
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:18,271	| IOT134 |	What data do you want but you don't
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:21,087	| IOT134 |	Is other types of data other categories of
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:26,463	| IOT134 |	Water levels and water velocity and then we have weather data
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:32,351	| IOT134 |	And that's pretty much it weather radar that's that's typically all week have would like to expand to have
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:38,751	| IOT134 |	Other types of sensors on the network so you know water quality sensors to measuring I mean in this is just kind of blue
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:42,335	| IOT134 |	This guy type Vision but if we could measure Environmental Quality
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,359	| IOT134 |	Of the water
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:44,127	| IOT134 |	You know are there any
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:45,151	| IOT134 |	Clinton said that things
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,967	| IOT134 |	Like that happen in soil moisture is
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:50,783	| IOT134 |	I need a really really useful for flood modeling
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:51,807	| IOT134 |	Very difficult
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,575	| IOT134 |	Information
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:55,135	| IOT134 |	Other types of
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:58,463	| IOT134 |	Ambien information data sets would be really helpful
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:00,767	| IOT134 |	The final question
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:01,535	| IOT134 |	For you
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:05,119	| IOT134 |	As we add sensors to everything it feels like we can do
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,399	| IOT134 |	Much higher resolution
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:07,935	| IOT134 |	Pictures of the world around us
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:09,471	| IOT134 |	When it comes to
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,007	| IOT134 |	Environmental monitoring
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:12,799	| IOT134 |	Public Safety
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,871	| IOT134 |	You stink
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:20,223	| IOT134 |	Guess I guess I feel like we have this idea that we could get perfect information
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:25,087	| IOT134 |	Know the near future
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:29,439	| IOT134 |	How realistic do you think that is
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,463	| IOT134 |	On the ground with
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:31,743	| IOT134 |	Information
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:32,511	| IOT134 |	Trying to react
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:35,071	| IOT134 |	I think it's at the dream
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,351	| IOT134 |	And the vision
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:42,495	| IOT134 |	There I mean especially when you think about it to you in general I think the dream in the vision is right I think that people are
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:46,847	| IOT134 |	Potentially under estimating the difficulty of getting there
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:47,615	| IOT134 |	And
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:53,503	| IOT134 |	It is pretty hard work because I think when you think about you know we like to say another teach Community oh great we just
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:55,039	| IOT134 |	Weirdest magic wand is this
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:58,367	| IOT134 |	Every device that's connected everywhere suddenly smart and connect
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:49:01,183	| IOT134 |	With the internet and the reality is that is easier
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,719	| IOT134 |	Said than done I mean
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:08,095	| IOT134 |	The power consumption of adding microprocessors to every device is not insignificant
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:11,679	| IOT134 |	Getting the number of devices out there is
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:15,263	| IOT134 |	Actor and when you look at the electric consumption
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:17,823	| IOT134 |	Adjustive running things you never so used to having
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:23,455	| IOT134 |	The internet you know how to fingertips and being able to connect with any device and any website you know globally but
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:25,759	| IOT134 |	I saw stop the other day that's just
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:30,367	| IOT134 |	Is the internet itself was a country it would be the fifth largest consumer of
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:36,767	| IOT134 |	Electricity to the actual tactical difficulty of getting a huge number of sensors and
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:38,303	| IOT134 |	Movie theater around 3
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,583	| IOT134 |	Weekly and processing it in real
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:43,935	| IOT134 |	To get that kind of real high you know how most sort of
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:46,495	| IOT134 |	Hey I like you know intelligence in the network
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:47,519	| IOT134 |	I think is
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:49,823	| IOT134 |	The great concept that we should shoot for
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:51,615	| IOT134 |	But I think a lot of practitioners are just
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,639	| IOT134 |	Under estimating
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:54,943	| IOT134 |	How much elbow grease and hard work and cost
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:56,735	| IOT134 |	Dress together
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:50:03,391	| IOT134 |	Definition of iot in general is a little bit more like putting an astronaut on Mars that it is like putting a
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:07,487	| IOT134 |	We should go there but it's an orders of magnitude harder than
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:17,983	| IOT134 |	Alright thank you so much for
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:18,495	| IOT134 |	For coming on the show
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:19,775	| IOT134 |	Really appreciate
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:21,567	| IOT134 |	My pleasure glad to be here
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:24,639	| IOT134 |	That's all for this week's Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:30,783	| IOT134 |	Remember if you want more iot news please sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:34,879	| IOT134 |	Tom thanks for listening and we'll see you next week
