EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:34,560	| IOT035 |	Your favorite connected devices
EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:37,376	| IOT035 |	You should probably consider buying for yourself
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:39,424	| IOT035 |	Or a loved one for this holiday
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:42,240	| IOT035 |	Something like that or if you don't like someone
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:43,008	| IOT035 |	We
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:45,312	| IOT035 |	She might recommend our favorite holiday
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:47,104	| IOT035 |	Homekit products or a hug
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:51,456	| IOT035 |	In case you really want to give them hours of fun troubleshooting devices
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:54,016	| IOT035 |	Fun for the whole family setting up a
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:54,784	| IOT035 |	Smart home hub
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:56,064	| IOT035 |	They've gotten a lot better
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:56,832	| IOT035 |	Anyways
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:58,624	| IOT035 |	So we'll get started with the most
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,928	| IOT035 |	I don't know the most common
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:02,208	| IOT035 |	Products out there that
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:03,488	| IOT035 |	Pretty much everyone
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,768	| IOT035 |	Can I join witches
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,560	| IOT035 |	Activity trackers and
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,072	| IOT035 |	Watches
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:10,400	| IOT035 |	Kevin this is your neck of the woods tour
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:11,680	| IOT035 |	Wrist of the Woods
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,960	| IOT035 |	Terrible why do I even do that
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:16,032	| IOT035 |	What's your recommendation for the best smartwatch out there
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:18,592	| IOT035 |	Yeah that's it that's a toughie because
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:21,152	| IOT035 |	I typically wear my Apple watch but it's
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,688	| IOT035 |	Only work with Apple devices
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:24,480	| IOT035 |	So it's really hard to recommend that
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:28,832	| IOT035 |	There are obviously some Android Wear watches that do work with Apple and Android phones
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,368	| IOT035 |	But you know what
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:33,184	| IOT035 |	If I want to just a basic smartwatch
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,976	| IOT035 |	I didn't want to run a ton of apps
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:37,792	| IOT035 |	On my wrist which I actually am not doing these days
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,608	| IOT035 |	Probably would take a look at the pebble because it's
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:42,144	| IOT035 |	Cross platform support
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,192	| IOT035 |	The good battery life and relatively low cost
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,056	| IOT035 |	Yeah I think the most
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:51,872	| IOT035 |	Recent version which is the round one
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,896	| IOT035 |	Which is an interesting look
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,968	| IOT035 |	Is 249 at last I checked
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,504	| IOT035 |	You're buying for one of the
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| IOT035 |	Fair Lady
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,040	| IOT035 |	And your life
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,320	| IOT035 |	This is probably a good
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:00,832	| IOT035 |	Good option
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:04,160	| IOT035 |	Yeah folks who are not familiar with the pebble though I think most
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| IOT035 |	People probably are
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:07,744	| IOT035 |	This is the one with the epaper display
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,024	| IOT035 |	Color now the first
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,584	| IOT035 |	Addition with only a grayscale or black and white
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:15,168	| IOT035 |	But now their color and Pebble has its new interface called
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:21,312	| IOT035 |	Where the timeline I think they call it timeline where you can see past present and future events and activities and data so
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:23,104	| IOT035 |	It's really intuitive to use I think and
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:27,200	| IOT035 |	Even though I said you know if you don't want to run out on your watch this is a good one
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,992	| IOT035 |	Pebble still does have an app stores just
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:31,808	| IOT035 |	It's a relatively Limited in terms of functionality and choice
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,112	| IOT035 |	Yeah I love it I love my puppy
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,672	| IOT035 |	The first gen Pebble that I got for like
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:40,000	| IOT035 |	Man this was last year around Christmas so I got it for likes
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,536	| IOT035 |	65 bucks
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,864	| IOT035 |	It runs actually I use it mostly to get my text
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:45,888	| IOT035 |	And
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,424	| IOT035 |	You can get it for
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,264	| IOT035 |	Actually you can set it up for even emails but I get it mostly protects and taken in
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| IOT035 |	Finding out of my phone's ringing while it's in my back
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,104	| IOT035 |	It's great
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:03:01,504	| IOT035 |	And bonus for you or well for Pebble on his but not you because you're not on AT&T just today Pebble added the ability
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,552	| IOT035 |	Do you speak back text replies
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,392	| IOT035 |	But it only works with AT&T phones that's very interesting how they been Limited
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,464	| IOT035 |	You can actually
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,744	| IOT035 |	Reply back
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,024	| IOT035 |	With certain predetermined
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,560	| IOT035 |	Like yes no okay
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,072	| IOT035 |	Animojis
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,864	| IOT035 |	I can't tell you how I feel
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,376	| IOT035 |	Some people are like
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,400	| IOT035 |	Stacy
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,448	| IOT035 |	Would you like to go you know
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:22,752	| IOT035 |	Out for happy hour tonight and I respond back with like
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,544	| IOT035 |	Little wacky emojis
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,312	| IOT035 |	Some people are like
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,360	| IOT035 |	I don't understand why you sent me a baseball glove
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,688	| IOT035 |	It was the closest Emoji to my
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| IOT035 |	Finger
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,760	| IOT035 |	All right so that's that's our smartwatch
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,576	| IOT035 |	Woke up with the dihybrid catalog
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,136	| IOT035 |	Smartwatch activity tracker
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,416	| IOT035 |	Because this is
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,440	| IOT035 |	Both
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,488	| IOT035 |	Actually we'll just going to activity track
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,816	| IOT035 |	Best activity tracker on the cheap
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,352	| IOT035 |	This is for someone who's like
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,680	| IOT035 |	No not really sold on the concept or maybe they're just like me
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,496	| IOT035 |	I'm going to go with the Jawbone move
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,288	| IOT035 |	Which is about 50 bucks
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:56,800	| IOT035 |	The zip
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,872	| IOT035 |	Would be the equivalent in the Fitbit category
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,712	| IOT035 |	I picked the job on simply because I like the software I think the
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,248	| IOT035 |	The Jawbone software is
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,552	| IOT035 |	Darren good and
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,344	| IOT035 |	I think around for the price I don't think
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,880	| IOT035 |	No I mean this this thing is
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,160	| IOT035 |	End
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:17,024	| IOT035 |	I've used a Fitbit I need his jaw bone I use the white things
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| IOT035 |	I can't think of the white things hacked
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,607	| IOT035 |	Chevy Tracker thing that they called it
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| IOT035 |	Andrea Lee
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,679	| IOT035 |	They all do basically the same thing
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,495	| IOT035 |	I just like the job on software it's
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,775	| IOT035 |	Nice
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| IOT035 |	And
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,431	| IOT035 |	The nice thing is is you go up Market in Jawbone if you go up the next level to the Bluetooth equipped up
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| IOT035 |	In
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,735	| IOT035 |	3
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:40,575	| IOT035 |	Whatever ap24 up up
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:47,487	| IOT035 |	You can actually start using your jaw bone to talk to your house so it'll work with your nest and your SmartThings
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:52,607	| IOT035 |	And you can actually once it sees your moving around in the mornings for example
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,983	| IOT035 |	Let's that awesome let's use as a trigger and
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,263	| IOT035 |	And start doing some cool stuff
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,055	| IOT035 |	Like center Coffee to go
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,591	| IOT035 |	Maplewood
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,359	| IOT035 |	Turn up her desk
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,639	| IOT035 |	Do other things
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,711	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,247	| IOT035 |	I think that for
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| IOT035 |	Bang for the buck
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,295	| IOT035 |	My bad
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,575	| IOT035 |	Competence.
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,343	| IOT035 |	All right
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,111	| IOT035 |	And
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,903	| IOT035 |	The intermediate category of
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,183	| IOT035 |	Hey
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,975	| IOT035 |	Smartwatch it's an activity tracker
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:19,999	| IOT035 |	It's
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:23,839	| IOT035 |	Did you actually go or dementia at the Y things activity pop
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:24,863	| IOT035 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT035 |	150 bucks
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,703	| IOT035 |	I like this device
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,983	| IOT035 |	Vici really do I kind of
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,775	| IOT035 |	There's a Black Friday deal that widens
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,311	| IOT035 |	Has tweeted out
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:36,895	| IOT035 |	This week actually and it's 45% off the activity pop
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,431	| IOT035 |	And I am looking at it and I'm thinking
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:45,855	| IOT035 |	Well you know this is a perfect device for people who want to watch that looks like a watch cuz really that that's what they
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,183	| IOT035 |	That's just has some some smarts inside it and
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,719	| IOT035 |	A a little
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,743	| IOT035 |	Counter
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,279	| IOT035 |	Hand to show you
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,815	| IOT035 |	You know steps and such
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:58,143	| IOT035 |	I don't know how else to describe it
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:01,471	| IOT035 |	Circular it's got hands and it's not digital at all it's
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,495	| IOT035 |	It's analog
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,567	| IOT035 |	It's got the hell tracking stuff in there
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,871	| IOT035 |	It has it has walking running
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,919	| IOT035 |	It's water-resistant so you can
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:13,247	| IOT035 |	Women and I believe
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,527	| IOT035 |	Vibration alarm
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,831	| IOT035 |	It's got sleep tracking if you want to sleep in your watch
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:20,159	| IOT035 |	And it's got a 8-month battery life in his cup
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,695	| IOT035 |	Bluetooth Bluetooth
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:25,791	| IOT035 |	Satellite sent the data to the app and you know that's great MI
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,327	| IOT035 |	Haven't actually checked
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,143	| IOT035 |	To see but I presume it works with both Android and iOS
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,935	| IOT035 |	I believe so my other wedding stuff
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,983	| IOT035 |	Pass so I assume this out.
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:38,079	| IOT035 |	So if you're hardcore this isn't going to be for you cuz it doesn't have a heart
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,663	| IOT035 |	So Kevin you want to share your
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,991	| IOT035 |	Your thoughts on for the hardcore Fitness activity tracker guy
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:51,391	| IOT035 |	You could go nuts here on so you can spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars like five six hundred or more I'm actually going to throw a curve
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:53,439	| IOT035 |	Purple out here that may surprise people
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,463	| IOT035 |	And say
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:58,303	| IOT035 |	I would consider the Microsoft Band 2 for $250
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:04,191	| IOT035 |	Now that I own the first one I do not have the second one and the first one was fantastic for me
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,727	| IOT035 |	Acceptance
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,495	| IOT035 |	Fit
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:11,359	| IOT035 |	Comfortably the new one is more rounded and looks a lot nicer to wear
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| IOT035 |	What it has inside those
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,479	| IOT035 |	Actually pretty amazing for such a small band type device
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:22,111	| IOT035 |	It has an optical heart-rate sensor gotten accelerometer gyroscope GPS which is nice
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:26,719	| IOT035 |	I go out and run I don't have to carry a phone I can have everything track speed distance route and so on
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:33,631	| IOT035 |	Has an ambient light sensor a skin temperature sensor and a UV Central actually tell you hey you've been out in the sun a little too low
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,399	| IOT035 |	Today
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,215	| IOT035 |	It has a capacitive sensor to passive touch screen
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,239	| IOT035 |	Galvanic
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,031	| IOT035 |	Skin response
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| IOT035 |	Switch I really never used
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,127	| IOT035 |	Microphone for control and also a barometer
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:48,991	| IOT035 |	Also has Bluetooth 4.0 so I can wirelessly send or get data
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,015	| IOT035 |	To and from
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:55,135	| IOT035 |	Not just a Windows phone but also an iPhone or any Android 4.4 better device
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,207	| IOT035 |	2 and fifty bucks 8.8 does a heck of a lot
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,743	| IOT035 |	What is the galvanic
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:05,631	| IOT035 |	I guess you know like if I get over radiated by an x-ray or I don't know
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,191	| IOT035 |	I kidding
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:12,543	| IOT035 |	It might be sweating to be quite honest I don't I don't recall
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,079	| IOT035 |	Oci just usually
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,383	| IOT035 |	I'm sweating
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,431	| IOT035 |	Yep galvanic
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,991	| IOT035 |	Skin response is skin conductance
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,807	| IOT035 |	Interesting thank you Wikipedia
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,903	| IOT035 |	Alright well maybe someone will let us know what that means
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,207	| IOT035 |	Let me actually be something about seizures
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,487	| IOT035 |	I'll have to I'll have to
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:35,839	| IOT035 |	Keep looking that up I know that their skin bands are bands out there to measure
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,143	| IOT035 |	Like if someone is having a seizure
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,423	| IOT035 |	Or not
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| IOT035 |	Feel like I read those words
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,519	| IOT035 |	Near the word seizure
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| IOT035 |	But
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,311	| IOT035 |	Again
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,079	| IOT035 |	Google will tell me
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,639	| IOT035 |	Okay this is why
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,663	| IOT035 |	We should have a medical
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,479	| IOT035 |	We're not we're not doctors we don't play
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| IOT035 |	It is true
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,319	| IOT035 |	Okay so that is
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,647	| IOT035 |	Those are our picks for wearables activity trackers
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,183	| IOT035 |	And you can argue with us
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,463	| IOT035 |	About those later
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,255	| IOT035 |	Feel free and now will move into
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,071	| IOT035 |	But let's look at the cameras cuz this year
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,399	| IOT035 |	I have gone like a total 180 on the camera front
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,167	| IOT035 |	We got a lot of
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:16,543	| IOT035 |	Like smart home devices in like a good half of the things we recommend have cameras in them this
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,311	| IOT035 |	This year
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,335	| IOT035 |	There's no hot
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,407	| IOT035 |	No hiding this year for me
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,271	| IOT035 |	All about the security on the outside so
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,319	| IOT035 |	I've got two doorbell cameras
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,111	| IOT035 |	Because this was the year of the
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,879	| IOT035 |	Connected door
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,671	| IOT035 |	Connected doorbell
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:37,279	| IOT035 |	I decided I went into I was in San Francisco last week and I tried out
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| IOT035 |	Two new
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:42,143	| IOT035 |	Connect two doorbells one is the August doorbell cam
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:47,007	| IOT035 |	I might be the one of the first people who got to see that in their office so
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:50,079	| IOT035 |	Both of these next devices I have not tried out on my house
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,663	| IOT035 |	Important know that I've only tried them out in their office but I did make them
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| IOT035 |	Taking out the Wi-Fi not working
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| IOT035 |	Do some test
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,271	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,063	| IOT035 |	The August doorbell cam
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,623	| IOT035 |	Works with the August Smart Lock hundred $99
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,671	| IOT035 |	Of all the doorbell cams
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,999	| IOT035 |	This might be my favorite because it is square in my house is
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:11,583	| IOT035 |	Rectangular high like the angles on it it's very nice
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,631	| IOT035 |	It works with your doorbell chime
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,399	| IOT035 |	It
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:17,727	| IOT035 |	As actually kind of the most interesting field of view it's actually
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,799	| IOT035 |	Taller than all of the other doorbell cams out on them
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT035 |	Market
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,359	| IOT035 |	And it takes about
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:26,943	| IOT035 |	Two to three seconds to get a doorbell feed like the feed going
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,503	| IOT035 |	XM the second you get your notification you pull it up
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,343	| IOT035 |	A little bit faster on your in-home Wi-Fi versus your
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,879	| IOT035 |	Kind of Lte experience
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:37,183	| IOT035 |	Good IOS and Android
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,207	| IOT035 |	And
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,511	| IOT035 |	I deal with August is if you
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,351	| IOT035 |	See someone in your doorbell cam you can be like oh hey UPS man
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| IOT035 |	What up
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:51,519	| IOT035 |	Please leave that package inside on the door and you open your August lock and then boom the UPS man comes inside your house
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,823	| IOT035 |	That's why I need one of these
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,615	| IOT035 |	There you go
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,407	| IOT035 |	So two hundred bucks
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| IOT035 |	Sketchy one
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,711	| IOT035 |	Cool thing about it is
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,991	| IOT035 |	The entire there's like a
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,271	| IOT035 |	How to say it's about
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,831	| IOT035 |	Two and a half inch diameter
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| IOT035 |	Is that the whole part of the circle
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,415	| IOT035 |	Is the diameter
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,951	| IOT035 |	That would be the diameter yet
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,767	| IOT035 |	We are we are not geographers either but
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,279	| IOT035 |	Giai Tri
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,071	| IOT035 |	Geometry
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,351	| IOT035 |	That's not a word
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| IOT035 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,399	| IOT035 |	Math majors
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,191	| IOT035 |	Who started our holiday drinking
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:24,287	| IOT035 |	Early on gravity podcast
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,103	| IOT035 |	Well that's good you got that one
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,687	| IOT035 |	Radius is the half
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,479	| IOT035 |	Diameters
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| IOT035 |	It's a big button
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,551	| IOT035 |	Big button on this thing the hold
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,087	| IOT035 |	Two and a half
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,903	| IOT035 |	Circle part of the doorbell is the button so
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,183	| IOT035 |	There is no wrong way to press this
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,207	| IOT035 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,255	| IOT035 |	Very nice
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,023	| IOT035 |	Is the camera quality
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,791	| IOT035 |	He is very good
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| IOT035 |	Pretty good mode
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,351	| IOT035 |	So that's August
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,119	| IOT035 |	And
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,143	| IOT035 |	I like that because
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,911	| IOT035 |	Because of the design of
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,423	| IOT035 |	Set for my house
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,447	| IOT035 |	Now
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,239	| IOT035 |	The other doorbell
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| IOT035 |	That we have
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,799	| IOT035 |	Connected video doorbell cam
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,567	| IOT035 |	Is
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,103	| IOT035 |	The skybell HD
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,407	| IOT035 |	Now this isn't going to go on sale
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:08,319	| IOT035 |	Until December 16th on the skybell website so right now it's sold out do not be fooled by the Skype
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,623	| IOT035 |	Adele version to that's on the website right now
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,183	| IOT035 |	Wait for the skybell HD
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,231	| IOT035 |	As you can imagine this is HD
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,535	| IOT035 |	And this thing is really nice
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,839	| IOT035 |	It is a round doorbell
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,607	| IOT035 |	It has
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,167	| IOT035 |	Couple really interesting features
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:26,495	| IOT035 |	It's got LEDs that are customizable on the outside
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:29,567	| IOT035 |	So you can change like the little lights on the outside of the doorbell
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,359	| IOT035 |	To be like whatever color you want
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:35,711	| IOT035 |	You can like your Hue bulbs exactly like your Hue bulbs actually
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:42,623	| IOT035 |	So for Christmas you can have them be red and white or red and green knows I'm probably only only one color one color only
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| IOT035 |	Red grid
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:46,463	| IOT035 |	You can actually turn off the chime if you'd like to
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:50,047	| IOT035 |	And then it will just send you notifications to your phone
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,351	| IOT035 |	This is nice if you have you know
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,911	| IOT035 |	A baby or dog like mine that's just like
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,727	| IOT035 |	Oh my God the door I got a burnt my fool head off
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,239	| IOT035 |	And
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,311	| IOT035 |	It has a really nice
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,847	| IOT035 |	Wide angle of view
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,615	| IOT035 |	And it has
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,151	| IOT035 |	Full color night vision
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,199	| IOT035 |	Those LEDs I was talking about
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,991	| IOT035 |	Yeah they let off enough
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,551	| IOT035 |	Light at night even when it's pitch-black
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:16,415	| IOT035 |	Owl camera can actually see you in full color really well it's
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,207	| IOT035 |	Pretty slick
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:22,303	| IOT035 |	That's impressive I have a couple webcams that use like i r type lighting to
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,839	| IOT035 |	Can I do that
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,863	| IOT035 |	But they're not great
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:29,215	| IOT035 |	And it's interesting to me they're using regular LEDs and what not that's that's impressive
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,239	| IOT035 |	This is I mean
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:30,751	| IOT035 |	If book
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,311	| IOT035 |	So those two
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,639	| IOT035 |	Each of them or both of them or 199
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,407	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,943	| IOT035 |	That's $200 not $2
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:44,319	| IOT035 |	Probably not going to be on sale since they're both so new
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,855	| IOT035 |	I'm guessing they're going to be pretty hot
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| IOT035 |	Pretty hot items
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,951	| IOT035 |	So go doorbells
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:54,815	| IOT035 |	Alright Kevin I feel like I've been talking a long time why don't I send it back to you and you can talk about
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:55,839	| IOT035 |	Arlo
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:59,679	| IOT035 |	Arlo Arlo Auto that's a wireless
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:03,775	| IOT035 |	Camera security system you can get in multiple configurations so if you just want to like
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,567	| IOT035 |	One doorbell cam like I want
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,335	| IOT035 |	You can do that
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:11,199	| IOT035 |	Or you can get multiple cameras that come in the kids all up like five cameras included
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,503	| IOT035 |	And then there's add-on cameras if you want even
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,063	| IOT035 |	Keep it running in a really that got your home
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:19,391	| IOT035 |	But the kid actually comes to the base station as well as a camera
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:25,535	| IOT035 |	And the lowest price one if you buy it direct is 17999 for the base station
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,839	| IOT035 |	And 1 wireless camera with an HD camera
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:31,423	| IOT035 |	I does have night vision it's an indoor outdoor cameras weatherproof
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,471	| IOT035 |	It's completely wireless menu.
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,495	| IOT035 |	Plug it in either
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,055	| IOT035 |	The base station is plugged in obviously but the camera
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,079	| IOT035 |	Has batteries in it
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,127	| IOT035 |	Comes with batteries so
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,431	| IOT035 |	You can mount it outside and not worry about it till the batteries
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| IOT035 |	Are dead
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:47,807	| IOT035 |	If you do go on to Amazon right now you can get this for a hundred fifty bucks
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,599	| IOT035 |	And that's
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,415	| IOT035 |	Probably a much better deal or save yourself $30 there
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:57,791	| IOT035 |	So the base station would obviously be in your house somewhere connected to your network and then you have your camera outdoor so
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:04,447	| IOT035 |	I don't know in terms of functionality if it's as robust as maybe some of the other ones that you were talking about prior like enough about notifications inside
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,519	| IOT035 |	So you can get notifications on this thing
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,823	| IOT035 |	Arlo
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| IOT035 |	Is Netgear
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,919	| IOT035 |	This isn't the camera itself doesn't
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,199	| IOT035 |	Talk to anything yet
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:21,343	| IOT035 |	I talked to the SmartThings guys and their kind of ion the stuff they're like oh that's that's a nice-looking camera
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,135	| IOT035 |	All right now Arlo doesn't
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT035 |	The Netgear guys
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,439	| IOT035 |	They've told me that
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:26,975	| IOT035 |	For now are those
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| IOT035 |	Is closed system
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,535	| IOT035 |	So my hope
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,863	| IOT035 |	Because you know how much I hate things that don't talk to other things
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:36,191	| IOT035 |	Is it our love will open itself out cuz man
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,495	| IOT035 |	I would love to be able to pull
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,543	| IOT035 |	There's not a lot of great quality
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,335	| IOT035 |	Outdoor IP
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| IOT035 |	He cameras
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,615	| IOT035 |	You know
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| IOT035 |	Out there
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,687	| IOT035 |	I would love to be able to pull this
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| IOT035 |	Into
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,527	| IOT035 |	Some of my other kind of home hub systems
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,087	| IOT035 |	Cuz I
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,135	| IOT035 |	You know I got a rooftop deck and I would love to be able to
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| IOT035 |	See who's up there
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:58,719	| IOT035 |	1
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,767	| IOT035 |	Safety but to
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,071	| IOT035 |	If you like leave something up there
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,375	| IOT035 |	It is really a panda
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,911	| IOT035 |	The climb up all those stairs
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,935	| IOT035 |	To go like
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:10,239	| IOT035 |	Just check the roof so you could be like hey dude
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| IOT035 |	Do I need anything up there no
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:17,151	| IOT035 |	That's just me being lazy again which is the primary reason to install Smart Home
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:17,919	| IOT035 |	X-ray
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,967	| IOT035 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,271	| IOT035 |	That concludes the
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:25,343	| IOT035 |	The spying on people portion of the crisp
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:28,159	| IOT035 |	Gift guide of the holiday gift guide
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,695	| IOT035 |	Let's go to
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,463	| IOT035 |	Light bulbs
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| IOT035 |	What's your favorite light bulb
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,023	| IOT035 |	Doesn't have to be the same as
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:36,607	| IOT035 |	Kevin Ware back to you so I don't have a light bill this year
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,631	| IOT035 |	Because
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,935	| IOT035 |	I frankly I'm not really
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:42,239	| IOT035 |	Super stoked about any of the ones that I've tried
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:47,871	| IOT035 |	There's there's some new lightbulbs coming down the pike but they're not here yet so until they get here
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,943	| IOT035 |	I haven't found anything the only thing I really like
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:55,295	| IOT035 |	Enjoyous / are the Hue wireless light bulbs
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:01,439	| IOT035 |	Right and those were $99
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,023	| IOT035 |	They don't really actually tie and any of the other systems
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:05,791	| IOT035 |	Right now
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,351	| IOT035 |	And they're just fun
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,375	| IOT035 |	I'm kind of too expensive
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:12,191	| IOT035 |	Pics of a great gift I guess but
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,751	| IOT035 |	Sit there handy cuz you can put them anywhere in the house
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,055	| IOT035 |	Scannow anywhere you need to let you just put this bowl and
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:17,823	| IOT035 |	Flip the switch and
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:18,847	| IOT035 |	You good
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,663	| IOT035 |	Yep
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,943	| IOT035 |	Which I know is your thing
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,455	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:27,551	| IOT035 |	I'm less of a changing color kind of guy so that's why my favorite
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,343	| IOT035 |	Bald this year
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,903	| IOT035 |	Is the osram lightify bulbs
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,695	| IOT035 |	See I've got a couple of them in here I have
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,487	| IOT035 |	Also the Hues I got the
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,279	| IOT035 |	A couple trees and some other dogs
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:40,863	| IOT035 |	I like the Oz rooms they're a little more expensive than a typical white
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,887	| IOT035 |	LED bulb
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,911	| IOT035 |	But there's a reason for that
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:49,823	| IOT035 |	It's because they can be tuned to any color temperature from 2800 kelvins all the way up to will over 65
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,615	| IOT035 |	Hunter Calvin so what that means is
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,407	| IOT035 |	If you want a soft white
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,431	| IOT035 |	Yellowish light
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,991	| IOT035 |	You can do that with his balls you can tune the color down
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:01,087	| IOT035 |	If you want to bright white you can tune the color up a little bit more
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,367	| IOT035 |	You want daylight
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,439	| IOT035 |	Crank It Up you got full daylight
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| IOT035 |	You can also dim this
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:09,279	| IOT035 |	You just can't change the color itself
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,047	| IOT035 |	White
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:10,815	| IOT035 |	Or
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,327	| IOT035 |	White
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,375	| IOT035 |	But how much are they
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:17,727	| IOT035 |	Well they go for about $30 and that's a lot for a white LED bulb
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,519	| IOT035 |	You know it's the heuiser
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,847	| IOT035 |	Probably little bit more but you can have any color practically up in the Spectrum
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:27,967	| IOT035 |	70 * 30 bucks they work with SmartThings with the wink hub
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:30,527	| IOT035 |	And if you have either of those who actually work
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| IOT035 |	Through an Amazon Echo as well
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:35,135	| IOT035 |	And do they come and BR30 S&A 19th
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:39,231	| IOT035 |	I have the a 19th I think they come in for your 30s
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:42,303	| IOT035 |	All right maybe maybe I'll go
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,327	| IOT035 |	Usher
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:48,703	| IOT035 |	BR30 Obsession BR30 is are the big flat lights that you stick in Tennessee
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,495	| IOT035 |	The cans in a 19 with a tip
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| IOT035 |	Typical
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,031	| IOT035 |	Light bulb shapes
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,103	| IOT035 |	Just for the people out there who
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,663	| IOT035 |	Like myself a few years ago did not
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| IOT035 |	Speak fluent light bulb
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,783	| IOT035 |	Razorsync zigbee by the way so they work
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,551	| IOT035 |	With the Beast
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,087	| IOT035 |	Excellent
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:08,415	| IOT035 |	All right so that's are those are a lightbulb
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,439	| IOT035 |	Recommendations
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:12,255	| IOT035 |	And let us go now to
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,303	| IOT035 |	Hold let's go to my favorite room in the house
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,839	| IOT035 |	The kitchen
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,631	| IOT035 |	Which is where I keep my
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,655	| IOT035 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:24,031	| IOT035 |	Yeah so we've already talked about the Amazon Echo there's really no more to say
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:24,799	| IOT035 |	Except for
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,335	| IOT035 |	This last week
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:29,919	| IOT035 |	If you didn't have enough reasons to spend a hundred and seventy-nine
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:33,503	| IOT035 |	99 on the Amazon Echo to give it to someone you love this week
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:37,087	| IOT035 |	They announced and if this then that integration that's a little bit more complete
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:42,207	| IOT035 |	And so now you can actually connect the echo to your nest and you can actually tell it
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:47,839	| IOT035 |	Turn your desk tan without resorting to some sort of janky hack where you inside like
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,887	| IOT035 |	Your shopping list to your nest
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,935	| IOT035 |	Stinnett will turn it to 72 degrees
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,447	| IOT035 |	When you say
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,495	| IOT035 |	Add something to my shopping list
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,031	| IOT035 |	And that will make that
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,567	| IOT035 |	One thing happen
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:00,127	| IOT035 |	Now you can just tell it to turn your nest to 70
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,151	| IOT035 |	Degrees in
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,431	| IOT035 |	Boom
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:05,503	| IOT035 |	I've been using that new functionality ever since it came out
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,783	| IOT035 |	The past couple days
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,807	| IOT035 |	Love it absolutely love it
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:08,831	| IOT035 |	What's your favorite
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:13,439	| IOT035 |	Are the nice one that's the only one I'm using so far I haven't gotten
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,487	| IOT035 |	Around like making more triggers and whatnot but
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,559	| IOT035 |	You can do so many more things now because of this new trigger command
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:21,375	| IOT035 |	That was the one thing I was like missing from my my echo
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,911	| IOT035 |	I really wanted
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,423	| IOT035 |	Turn on the nest
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,727	| IOT035 |	And so now do you
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:28,287	| IOT035 |	I guess cuz you got an iPhone now that you're using
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,335	| IOT035 |	So you don't use the OK Google
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT035 |	Command anymore
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| IOT035 |	No
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,711	| IOT035 |	At mostly is in my iPhone these days
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:38,015	| IOT035 |	Yeah I mean I could try the OK Google stuff too
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,551	| IOT035 |	National very easily but no
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:43,647	| IOT035 |	It's I'd rather I mostly my office and that's where the echo is
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,439	| IOT035 |	So boom
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:49,279	| IOT035 |	Every time we have the right we talked about the echo so many times in the past year
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,071	| IOT035 |	I think there's a good reason for it
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,631	| IOT035 |	It's a very compelling product for the price
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| IOT035 |	And it keeps getting better
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,471	| IOT035 |	It does just go buy one already my goodness
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,263	| IOT035 |	We're just not going to let you
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,031	| IOT035 |	Put it down if you don't
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:03,103	| IOT035 |	So one thing I will tell you
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,639	| IOT035 |	To not purchase
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,431	| IOT035 |	For people you love this holiday season
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:09,247	| IOT035 |	I'm going to recommend you don't go
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,527	| IOT035 |	In on homekit stuff
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,039	| IOT035 |	Just yet
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,599	| IOT035 |	If you want to update your
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,879	| IOT035 |	Philips Hue Bridge
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,696	| IOT035 |	You've only got a couple more weeks before that discount
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:18,976	| IOT035 |	Runs Out
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,000	| IOT035 |	Remember
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:23,584	| IOT035 |	How to upgrade your Philips Hue how have you better go to the Philips Hue website
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:26,400	| IOT035 |	Cogat basically the Philips Hue upgraded
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,448	| IOT035 |	Hub for $40
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:30,496	| IOT035 |	Instead of $60 on that
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,264	| IOT035 |	Device
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,824	| IOT035 |	You got to do it before like the end of this month
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,640	| IOT035 |	Or while supplies last
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:40,480	| IOT035 |	I'm probably going to do it on a Feeling on the fence about it cuz the phone
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,552	| IOT035 |	The last time I tried out the review Persian
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,112	| IOT035 |	Bro, Integrations and I hated it
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,392	| IOT035 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:47,904	| IOT035 |	I got to do it
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,696	| IOT035 |	What's my job
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:51,232	| IOT035 |	For normal people
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,000	| IOT035 |	If you're not
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,048	| IOT035 |	You know if you're kind of on the fence about the Hub
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| IOT035 |	You know
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,400	| IOT035 |	If you're basically like I wish I could go buy some more homekit stuff
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,448	| IOT035 |	Wait just wait
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:05,824	| IOT035 |	We've been waiting and I agree with you I think people should probably keep waiting
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,640	| IOT035 |	So if you don't have to move on it don't move on it
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:12,992	| IOT035 |	You're sitting on the fence on the Hub and you can afford waiting for 20 more dollars
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,784	| IOT035 |	You might as well
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,344	| IOT035 |	But if you're like $20 that's like
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,136	| IOT035 |	A fifth of a gadget
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,696	| IOT035 |	That's big money for me Stacy
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,208	| IOT035 |	Well
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| IOT035 |	All right that's almost a light bulb
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,560	| IOT035 |	It is almost over how sad are we
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,352	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,144	| IOT035 |	And you know
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,936	| IOT035 |	If you're sitting there looking for
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| IOT035 |	Toys
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,752	| IOT035 |	I'm going to recommend to microduino

EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| IOT035 |	The work with Legos

EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,728	| IOT035 |	Still haven't heard the end of it
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,008	| IOT035 |	This was in August
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:10,080	| IOT035 |	My bad and drop did add cocktails to their mix
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,360	| IOT035 |	So
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,712	| IOT035 |	I can now make cocktails on the scale and
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,480	| IOT035 |	I think
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,504	| IOT035 |	Let's see
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,272	| IOT035 |	Hennything

EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,728	| IOT035 |	Things coming down the pike that are like
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,008	| IOT035 |	A lot smarter
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:43,360	| IOT035 |	Algorithms going nuts here we're going to see like next year
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:46,176	| IOT035 |	Doing the show like in 3 months
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,248	| IOT035 |	I would have a whole new class of devices
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:49,760	| IOT035 |	Is that I'd be like
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| IOT035 |	Wow
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| IOT035 |	They just cost a lot more
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,136	| IOT035 |	Where can I hold off
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,904	| IOT035 |	And

EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:09,728	| IOT035 |	That's probably the most mature class of devices we have out there
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,496	| IOT035 |	And
