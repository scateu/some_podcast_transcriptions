EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,632	| IOT202 |	Hey Kevin
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:16,704	| IOT202 |	Before we get started on the show I should tell everybody
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,728	| IOT202 |	I've had a couple
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,264	| IOT202 |	Emails lately at people trying to
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,848	| IOT202 |	Play or show on their Google assistants or the
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,360	| IOT202 |	Echo device
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,408	| IOT202 |	The reason you can't get it
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,224	| IOT202 |	Because we are actually the internet
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,992	| IOT202 |	Of things podcast
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,272	| IOT202 |	So if
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:34,368	| IOT202 |	If you would like to hear it you just have to say Madam a play The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,392	| IOT202 |	And I will a
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,184	| IOT202 |	China what's the step
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,208	| IOT202 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,000	| IOT202 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,512	| IOT202 |	Lowe's
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:41,792	| IOT202 |	Shut
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,560	| IOT202 |	Sing Down
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:45,888	| IOT202 |	Kevin this makes me so sad I remember all the way back in the
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,424	| IOT202 |	Mike 2012
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,496	| IOT202 |	Getting excited about Lowe's Iris and getting my own and
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,288	| IOT202 |	Setting it up and being
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| IOT202 |	Kind of missed
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:56,128	| IOT202 |	Because it had a subscription fee to do a lot of the really cool stuff
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,432	| IOT202 |	This was in the era of Staples connect
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,504	| IOT202 |	And SmartThings launching
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,272	| IOT202 |	And
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,320	| IOT202 |	I can't remember if wink was on the scene yet or not
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,904	| IOT202 |	The good news is there's no subscription fee anymore
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,184	| IOT202 |	Cast
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| IOT202 |	There's no Iris
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,232	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:14,304	| IOT202 |	At the end of last year they said that they were looking for a buyer
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,608	| IOT202 |	The time I really doubted that they
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,376	| IOT202 |	They could find one
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,912	| IOT202 |	Because it's a weird platformer
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,704	| IOT202 |	You'd have to support all the users
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,520	| IOT202 |	It's a dedicated system so it's not
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| IOT202 |	It didn't seem like something
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,104	| IOT202 |	Anyone else would be excited
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| IOT202 |	Basically
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,152	| IOT202 |	Right
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,968	| IOT202 |	Got to be a challenge to make money if you're a buyer of this
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,992	| IOT202 |	Do you know
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:39,392	| IOT202 |	Like you said support people turn a profit and so on so forth and yeah it's not like we didn't know this was coming cuz you
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:45,792	| IOT202 |	And we sat on the show couple months ago they're looking for a buyer we got a lot of questions about Lowe's Iris you always it's
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,840	| IOT202 |	Still going to be viable and so on and so forth
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,608	| IOT202 |	At this point
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:52,960	| IOT202 |	March 31st it is shutting down the platform
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,728	| IOT202 |	But
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,032	| IOT202 |	We see this happen all the time
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,104	| IOT202 |	Probably less now as the market is maturing
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:04,736	| IOT202 |	But this is probably the best possible way something like this could shut down for its customers because
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| IOT202 |	Cause
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,088	| IOT202 |	People can continue to use the service through March 31st
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,624	| IOT202 |	You're not going to be charged
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,648	| IOT202 |	After
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:18,047	| IOT202 |	January 31st can I still get like two free months and you never prorated refunds actually going out to come
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:18,815	| IOT202 |	Customer switch
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,095	| IOT202 |	I'm very surprised by
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,143	| IOT202 |	Yeah you're going to get
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,167	| IOT202 |	If you're registered Iris
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,727	| IOT202 |	You'll get this email and if you
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:28,287	| IOT202 |	Click through in the link to the email you can actually
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,591	| IOT202 |	Register for a prepaid Visa card
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,359	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| IOT202 |	You're going to get a Visa card
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,407	| IOT202 |	4 in
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:39,807	| IOT202 |	I guess in one of the Articles someone who had Iris said that they got about a hundred bucks for their Hub and 140 for their feet
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| IOT202 |	Video camera
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,855	| IOT202 |	Which was about what he paid for it
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT202 |	Damso
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,647	| IOT202 |	That's
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:48,511	| IOT202 |	Has been shut down school it's a pretty rapid shutdown usually you
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,071	| IOT202 |	Get a little longer lead-time sometimes
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| IOT202 |	You don't get rebates
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,887	| IOT202 |	Remember when Nest bought
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,167	| IOT202 |	Resolved and they were just like
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,703	| IOT202 |	We're going to shut this down in 6
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:00,031	| IOT202 |	Whatever was like what I paid $300 for this thing
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,567	| IOT202 |	And then finally nested
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,103	| IOT202 |	Come back and offer some rebates
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:04,639	| IOT202 |	Sad
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,711	| IOT202 |	It's doing well by its users by doing this
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,503	| IOT202 |	It's a bigger picture
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,063	| IOT202 |	Let's talk about what this means for the Smart Home
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,111	| IOT202 |	Because while Lowe's is doing this
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,647	| IOT202 |	Ikea is actually
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,671	| IOT202 |	Doubling down
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,695	| IOT202 |	With more products
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| IOT202 |	Text and their CEO
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,279	| IOT202 |	Getting up on stage and talking about
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,839	| IOT202 |	Like launching have a kitchen as a service worker
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,863	| IOT202 |	Going to have you know
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,143	| IOT202 |	Furniture as a service
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| IOT202 |	In this kind of
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,703	| IOT202 |	Rent not to own just
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,727	| IOT202 |	Rent to rent
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,519	| IOT202 |	Concept in
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,567	| IOT202 |	Products because of the connectivity
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,359	| IOT202 |	Being able to enable it so
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,407	| IOT202 |	I find it interesting that Lowe's is like
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,175	| IOT202 |	No
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,199	| IOT202 |	Ikea's like
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,967	| IOT202 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,503	| IOT202 |	I'm surprised that
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:46,879	| IOT202 |	Ikea in a sentence going after this space but they are different from those because
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| IOT202 |	They are selling
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,927	| IOT202 |	Furniture
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:51,743	| IOT202 |	They are selling the insides of your home where is
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,511	| IOT202 |	Louis
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:58,911	| IOT202 |	Who sells the components for the inside of your home building materials and so on yes they do sell appliances and other things but
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:02,239	| IOT202 |	It is a different type of store so I see this as a better
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,335	| IOT202 |	It for Ikea I'm not saying they're going to be successful I certainly hope AR
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,103	| IOT202 |	But
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:13,503	| IOT202 |	I mean based on the data that they have it must assume make it be successful here and I could see why they may think that we'll have to see
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,039	| IOT202 |	If that's actual reality though
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:21,951	| IOT202 |	Yes and I will also say I talked to some of the people who participated in those Iris over the years
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,999	| IOT202 |	In one of the complaints they had was
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,279	| IOT202 |	The companies would
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:31,679	| IOT202 |	Add connectivity to their products for the Lowe's Iris system but they wouldn't do it in a thoughtful way and what happened was they were
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,959	| IOT202 |	Doing it primarily to get
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,983	| IOT202 |	Promotion at Lowe's
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT202 |	The Branding so
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:40,127	| IOT202 |	Customers didn't always have an awesome experience or sometimes
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,175	| IOT202 |	Connectivity didn't enable anything that
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| IOT202 |	Made sense
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,479	| IOT202 |	That's important
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT202 |	It is
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,295	| IOT202 |	We'll see
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,831	| IOT202 |	Yeah I still go to
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,159	| IOT202 |	You know my Hardware I was at Lowe's the other day about anymore
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,439	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:59,583	| IOT202 |	Yeah they'll continue to sell smart home devices it's just you know the iris
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:05,983	| IOT202 |	Brand and service is going away if you do want to get that Redemption don't go to your store for that it's all done
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:10,079	| IOT202 |	Online however Lowe's does say in the letter that they sent out to people
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:14,431	| IOT202 |	That you can return any Irish items purchased within the last 90 days
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:19,807	| IOT202 |	That are not connected to the Irish platform via the normal return policy so you may be able to get
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,087	| IOT202 |	Money back that way as well
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:24,927	| IOT202 |	Happy thought by this now and then maybe later I'll put it on the platform
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| IOT202 |	Alright so
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| IOT202 |	Said who's there
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,791	| IOT202 |	But maybe not unexpected
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,559	| IOT202 |	This feels like
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:35,935	| IOT202 |	As the markets mature and we're seeing a closing down of kind of the early days and speaking of that
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:36,959	| IOT202 |	Took a bunch of
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,519	| IOT202 |	So let's start with lifx
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,335	| IOT202 |	Lifx was just acquired
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,127	| IOT202 |	Bye buddy home
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,663	| IOT202 |	Which is based in Australia
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| IOT202 |	Lifx was actually
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,735	| IOT202 |	Create an in Australia
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,271	| IOT202 |	We have the founders on the podcast like
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| IOT202 |	2014 or so
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,087	| IOT202 |	Crazy thing
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:53,855	| IOT202 |	And
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,623	| IOT202 |	Ghetto
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,671	| IOT202 |	Typical thing on a colored light bulbs
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:59,231	| IOT202 |	Come along way they did a deal with Qualcomm
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,511	| IOT202 |	Licensing IP thing
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,279	| IOT202 |	Free wifi
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,815	| IOT202 |	Chips for light bulbs basic
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,095	| IOT202 |	And now
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,375	| IOT202 |	About my buddy
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:11,775	| IOT202 |	Which is an iot platform in Australia that does energy monitoring and management which is not something I
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,799	| IOT202 |	I actually associate
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,823	| IOT202 |	Lifx at all
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:19,967	| IOT202 |	And neither do I and that's the funny thing the intent is to use the lifx products to gain more
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,271	| IOT202 |	Energy monitoring data
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| IOT202 |	But
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:25,855	| IOT202 |	Did you have to buy lifx for that kind of
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,879	| IOT202 |	Scratch my head over that
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,415	| IOT202 |	This may be a four stack
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| IOT202 |	Position
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| IOT202 |	I mean
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,743	| IOT202 |	If you look at where we are in the bar
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,047	| IOT202 |	Market we're seeing a lot of companies there like oh it's time
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,583	| IOT202 |	You got to reach scale
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,375	| IOT202 |	True
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT202 |	True
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:38,911	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,471	| IOT202 |	The purchase price is 51 million
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| IOT202 |	Dollars
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,567	| IOT202 |	I feel like lifx probably if they were
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:49,407	| IOT202 |	Amazing what do better than that but they actually are the number two
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,687	| IOT202 |	Tender in the
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:56,319	| IOT202 |	Is it the colored smart light bulbs space in smart bulbs that's what they say behind
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,879	| IOT202 |	Philips which is no longer really Phillips
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,671	| IOT202 |	What is Philips Hue but
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,999	| IOT202 |	Company that actually owns the Philips hue light bulbs is
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,511	| IOT202 |	Childe signify
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,047	| IOT202 |	Just in case you guys were
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| IOT202 |	Not confused
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:10,143	| IOT202 |	So now do we know if we're going to see
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:14,495	| IOT202 |	You know life X products continuing to be for sale here in the states
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,287	| IOT202 |	I would expect so
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,079	| IOT202 |	Even though nobody is
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,871	| IOT202 |	Mainly in Australia
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,407	| IOT202 |	Base platform
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:24,991	| IOT202 |	I mean I think that would be kind of silly to spend turkey 1 million and then
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,271	| IOT202 |	Really limit your sales
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| IOT202 |	I haven't really said but
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,111	| IOT202 |	I
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,183	| IOT202 |	Can imagine that lifx goes away from everywhere but Australia
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,487	| IOT202 |	Wechat another acquisition
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,279	| IOT202 |	And things will go away
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:37,791	| IOT202 |	Wig wag
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT202 |	Which
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,119	| IOT202 |	Is a sensor company based in Austin
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:46,239	| IOT202 |	They started out making a very generic sensor and then pivoted to making an industrial
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:50,335	| IOT202 |	Or an Enterprise iot platform they have been acquired by our
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| IOT202 |	The chip design firm
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| IOT202 |	This looks like
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| IOT202 |	A straight-up
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:59,295	| IOT202 |	It feels like cuz arm has such a big presence in Austin it feels like somebody's friend was like yeah sure
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,343	| IOT202 |	I'm sure they're slicks
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,647	| IOT202 |	Already happening here but wigwag
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:04,671	| IOT202 |	Their platform
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,231	| IOT202 |	Will be closing on May
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,743	| IOT202 |	6
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| IOT202 |	2019
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,839	| IOT202 |	And arm did send some refunds to
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,351	| IOT202 |	To the backers
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,887	| IOT202 |	Wig wag
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,167	| IOT202 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,191	| IOT202 |	Wayback
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,007	| IOT202 |	I miss that Kickstarter
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,311	| IOT202 |	You did so I remember really well be
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,335	| IOT202 |	Because we were
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,871	| IOT202 |	Oh man we were in the middle of a cloud
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,175	| IOT202 |	Prince in when they launched
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| IOT202 |	There
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,223	| IOT202 |	Kickstarter it was
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,551	| IOT202 |	Awesome it was like this generic sensor that was going to do
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,599	| IOT202 |	Everything and I mean
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,367	| IOT202 |	I wanted it
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,415	| IOT202 |	Like right then and there and it wasn't like
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,695	| IOT202 |	2013 that have
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:41,279	| IOT202 |	It was the sort of thing that I guess when we thought the
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,815	| IOT202 |	Home automation Market
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,351	| IOT202 |	Would be more creative and fun
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| IOT202 |	You could actually like
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,191	| IOT202 |	Create all these cool rules and I thought people would want to buy
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,727	| IOT202 |	It was
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| IOT202 |	It had humidity vibration
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,823	| IOT202 |	Temperature all the stuff and I
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,615	| IOT202 |	I thought you know it's a great thing that you
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:58,175	| IOT202 |	Put a lock on your washing machine when it stopped moving
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,711	| IOT202 |	It'd be like oh you're watching stunts
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,735	| IOT202 |	It was basically
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:05,343	| IOT202 |	And then later on they pivoted to be more enterprise-focused
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,903	| IOT202 |	And critic 8-way device and then sensors there but
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,719	| IOT202 |	So goodbye
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,487	| IOT202 |	Wee bag
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:15,583	| IOT202 |	Hopefully arm is taking maybe some of your interface I don't know really
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,375	| IOT202 |	What are there getting you
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,399	| IOT202 |	Maybe it's okay
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,191	| IOT202 |	There was no
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| IOT202 |	Pricing associate
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| IOT202 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| IOT202 |	And then finally
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,079	| IOT202 |	Control4 which is a
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,615	| IOT202 |	Professional home automation
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,383	| IOT202 |	Can system
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,663	| IOT202 |	Everly Candles Company
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| IOT202 |	Yes Charlie Candles there is
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,711	| IOT202 |	His company but
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,039	| IOT202 |	Head of
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,319	| IOT202 |	Amazon smart home stuff
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,599	| IOT202 |	Castform anime
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,879	| IOT202 |	She went over there last year
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,439	| IOT202 |	So they bought a company called Neo
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,975	| IOT202 |	Animatrix
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,487	| IOT202 |	Nothing
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:46,815	| IOT202 |	Device that
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,607	| IOT202 |	Control your television
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,887	| IOT202 |	Controlled
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,703	| IOT202 |	Your lace it worked and it was a really beautiful life
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,727	| IOT202 |	Ticket launch to the city of
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,287	| IOT202 |	Maybe it was CES I've seen it for the last
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| IOT202 |	A couple years ago
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,823	| IOT202 |	Those shows
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| IOT202 |	In
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:02,687	| IOT202 |	It's fancy it's nice it's pretty I mean it's kind of like a
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,759	| IOT202 |	Display on it and very simple buttons
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,575	| IOT202 |	Tapped into their database of like a gazillion product
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,367	| IOT202 |	60000 devices
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,903	| IOT202 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,463	| IOT202 |	And basically when I talked to Charlie briefly about
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,487	| IOT202 |	Bastille this is
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,023	| IOT202 |	Their whole thing is at
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,071	| IOT202 |	At the Smart Home is too complex for
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,631	| IOT202 |	DIY hours most people are not going to want to
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| IOT202 |	Integrate all this
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,447	| IOT202 |	Weather so they're trying to bring in
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:26,239	| IOT202 |	Pieces that they think are attractive
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,543	| IOT202 |	And useful and easy-to-use so
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,079	| IOT202 |	Their dealer Network
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,895	| IOT202 |	Can come in and do it for people and then people still have
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,175	| IOT202 |	Like more options to
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,967	| IOT202 |	. so that's
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,527	| IOT202 |	Video hear you book The interesting thing
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,831	| IOT202 |	Current Neo customers they're going to get support
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,599	| IOT202 |	For all services
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,671	| IOT202 |	For another 24 months
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,207	| IOT202 |	They're not going to sell the Neo anymore
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:47,999	| IOT202 |	2
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:54,911	| IOT202 |	They're not buying it for the remote with Avaya I guess for the smarts the SDK the database
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,519	| IOT202 |	Okay so
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,055	| IOT202 |	All of these acquisitions
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:05,663	| IOT202 |	Big picture you guys we talked about this we've talked about this for the last year-and-a-half
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:09,759	| IOT202 |	There are a lot of iot platform place I got funded in 2013
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,783	| IOT202 |	2014
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,063	| IOT202 |	They're all going away
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,855	| IOT202 |	They couldn't
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,135	| IOT202 |	Reach scale
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,647	| IOT202 |	And bus
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:21,023	| IOT202 |	Yeah I'm getting some soon I mean it's not like they had bad technology cetera but
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,327	| IOT202 |	They can't do it alone obviously
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,095	| IOT202 |	Right
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:26,143	| IOT202 |	And I mean that's not surprising
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:31,007	| IOT202 |	A lot of these companies got a lot of their money and started right after Google paid 3 point
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,799	| IOT202 |	2 billion dollars for nest
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,615	| IOT202 |	Crazy rate in everyone's like
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,895	| IOT202 |	Oh my God I got to get it
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,407	| IOT202 |	Smart Homes
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,687	| IOT202 |	End
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,479	| IOT202 |	That was the high right there
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:45,087	| IOT202 |	And it was way high I still don't think it was the best
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,623	| IOT202 |	Purchase price value
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,927	| IOT202 |	But you know
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:53,791	| IOT202 |	Nest is still around still doing well they're integrating it better into things
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,583	| IOT202 |	I think they're making
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,607	| IOT202 |	Lemonade out of their lives
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,471	| IOT202 |	Okay let's talk about
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,263	| IOT202 |	Let's talk about privacy in
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,543	| IOT202 |	Data security and all that
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,311	| IOT202 |	Get stuffed
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,335	| IOT202 |	That we love so much
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:10,431	| IOT202 |	Here at the show this weekend the New York Times did an article on
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:10,943	| IOT202 |	Send
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:11,967	| IOT202 |	And
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,295	| IOT202 |	Practice of doing these Longview Les and you basically say
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,063	| IOT202 |	Yeah yeah I agree
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,855	| IOT202 |	And thinking NASA
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,927	| IOT202 |	Reasonable way to do a contract between a user in
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| IOT202 |	Adidas
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:28,095	| IOT202 |	And they're longer than I thought I always thought that you was were long but it was interesting to see you right in the beginning of the story
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:32,959	| IOT202 |	Reading Amazon's terms and conditions alone out loud takes approximately 9 hours
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,471	| IOT202 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:34,751	| IOT202 |	Yeah what's up
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| IOT202 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,823	| IOT202 |	Maybe if you read it
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,151	| IOT202 |	To yourself it takes less but it is a long time and I'll tell you I read
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:45,247	| IOT202 |	Read all of these like a whole day's worth of effort
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,015	| IOT202 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:46,783	| IOT202 |	In
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,807	| IOT202 |	It mean when you read them
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,831	| IOT202 |	You're also
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,367	| IOT202 |	There's only one option
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,903	| IOT202 |	You click yes if you want to use it
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,439	| IOT202 |	If you have to
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,975	| IOT202 |	Suzuki
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,743	| IOT202 |	Close to you
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,279	| IOT202 |	It feels like
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,071	| IOT202 |	It is like
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,607	| IOT202 |	It is a very uneven Exchange
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,143	| IOT202 |	Especially
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,167	| IOT202 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,703	| IOT202 |	I already paid you money
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,263	| IOT202 |	To buy this device
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,031	| IOT202 |	And the functionality
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:12,639	| IOT202 |	And you're paying that money before you even know what the terms of service are
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:16,991	| IOT202 |	So there's been some ideas here we talk to people in the show who
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,807	| IOT202 |	Suggested like when you put a device in your Amazon cart
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,087	| IOT202 |	You get a
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,111	| IOT202 |	Little
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,623	| IOT202 |	How to play
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,927	| IOT202 |	Do you know Apple or Google does with their
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,975	| IOT202 |	Permissions when you download an app
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,767	| IOT202 |	You can something like that
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,303	| IOT202 |	It says this shares data with 3rd power
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,119	| IOT202 |	You consent to that
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,655	| IOT202 |	And then you have to read those
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,679	| IOT202 |	Before you can actually
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| IOT202 |	Buy the product
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,471	| IOT202 |	Which I think is
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,007	| IOT202 |	Not a bad idea
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,567	| IOT202 |	It's a very good start
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| IOT202 |	I don't know if we're ever going
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| IOT202 |	See that but
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,895	| IOT202 |	So that's one way to do that
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,199	| IOT202 |	So the New York Times essay
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,759	| IOT202 |	I bring this up because this is something we've talked
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:54,111	| IOT202 |	Talked about for like two or three years we we've talked about the lack of any meaningful
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| IOT202 |	Concentra
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,647	| IOT202 |	Can you sign these things
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,695	| IOT202 |	And the lack of recourse for
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,767	| IOT202 |	Consumers when they realize what they've given up
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,839	| IOT202 |	You can always bring things back without paying lyca restocking
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,351	| IOT202 |	Eeyore
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| IOT202 |	You know
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| IOT202 |	Sometimes you just
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| IOT202 |	Can bring it back at all and
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,215	| IOT202 |	That feels unfair
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:13,311	| IOT202 |	And I'm glad the New York Times has talked about this cuz the New York Times is
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:16,383	| IOT202 |	As it were the paper of record so when they start talking about things
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,407	| IOT202 |	Things actually happen
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:17,919	| IOT202 |	Which
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| IOT202 |	I wish we had that power Kevin
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:26,367	| IOT202 |	We do not but they did point out some of the things we have talked about before obviously gdpr
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| IOT202 |	Over in
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:30,207	| IOT202 |	The Hue enemy California
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,975	| IOT202 |	Law
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,743	| IOT202 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,279	| IOT202 |	This is definitely something that
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,559	| IOT202 |	People are thinking more about with
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| IOT202 |	The Wider ass face
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:36,863	| IOT202 |	Books candles
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:41,215	| IOT202 |	Some of the Privacy conversations with apples trying to bring up and of course
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:41,983	| IOT202 |	CPR
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,519	| IOT202 |	So the solution here
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,079	| IOT202 |	I don't know there's efforts by
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,663	| IOT202 |	I told you about that particular idea about looking at data
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,175	| IOT202 |	Before
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:56,319	| IOT202 |	You put something in your cart there's also public knowledge released a paper last week about creating assets
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,087	| IOT202 |	Security Shield
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:17:00,159	| IOT202 |	This is more about security and not as much about privacy
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:03,487	| IOT202 |	But the idea is there encouraging the government to
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,511	| IOT202 |	Create a program call
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,815	| IOT202 |	Call the security Shield that is kind of like
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,095	| IOT202 |	The epa's
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| IOT202 |	Energy star
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:12,703	| IOT202 |	And so if you're not familiar with that the energy star program
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:14,751	| IOT202 |	Is federally there's a law written
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,311	| IOT202 |	It talks about what standards things need to meet
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,591	| IOT202 |	Achieve this stick
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:19,871	| IOT202 |	Basically
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| IOT202 |	And
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,663	| IOT202 |	Public knowledge is power
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:25,759	| IOT202 |	Paper is all about how to create such a program for iot device secure
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,319	| IOT202 |	So that would be useful right
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| IOT202 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,367	| IOT202 |	So yes
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| IOT202 |	Maybe that way
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,415	| IOT202 |	Will happen I'm sure.
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,975	| IOT202 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,791	| IOT202 |	Let's talk about another security
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,095	| IOT202 |	Challenge this is actually in the EU
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:46,239	| IOT202 |	How much GDP are so there is a recall of children's smart watches that are leaking location data which
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| IOT202 |	Nobody wants
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,823	| IOT202 |	Now this is the safe
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:54,175	| IOT202 |	Kid one made by a German company called Enochs group
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:57,759	| IOT202 |	It is not for sale in the UK or the us but
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,551	| IOT202 |	Apparently in Iceland
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:03,391	| IOT202 |	They found out that the mobile app
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,927	| IOT202 |	That works with the watch
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:11,327	| IOT202 |	Has unencrypted Communications to the server so there is unauthenticated access to the data so you can get
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:16,191	| IOT202 |	My location history of a child wearing a Swatch phone number serial number Etc
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:23,103	| IOT202 |	Yeah so it was basically I think they call it a wrap it alert as part of the rules and laws over there too
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,407	| IOT202 |	Recall this thing and that's exactly what's happening
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,687	| IOT202 |	It's pretty power
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,735	| IOT202 |	Forcing a product recall is
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,759	| IOT202 |	That's not a thing to be taken
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,063	| IOT202 |	Yeah I totally agree
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:36,671	| IOT202 |	I don't want to see this is overkill this is okay this is a problem that needs to be resolved but even if
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,463	| IOT202 |	It's just the mobile app that
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:42,815	| IOT202 |	Has the unencrypted data why couldn't they just put an app update out that
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,839	| IOT202 |	Encrypted data
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:48,191	| IOT202 |	Probably because they couldn't Insure One because it's the EU
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:50,751	| IOT202 |	But to maybe they couldn't insure people
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,031	| IOT202 |	Downloaded the patch
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:56,895	| IOT202 |	Maybe the watch was too small that Hardware on the inside was too small to like
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| IOT202 |	Take the patch and then
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,223	| IOT202 |	Reboot I don't know
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:06,623	| IOT202 |	From a technical standpoint if it's connecting to a back-end server and it's the data go into that server they could shut the service off until people
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| IOT202 |	Updated
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,463	| IOT202 |	Not the watch that it's updated Sac City app
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:15,583	| IOT202 |	According to this story so it may be just a send a message I don't know like we're not going to
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,607	| IOT202 |	Tolerate this kind of
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,423	| IOT202 |	We're Not Gonna Take It
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,447	| IOT202 |	No
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,263	| IOT202 |	Oh I'm singing it must be a good day
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,311	| IOT202 |	Speaking of encryption
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:28,639	| IOT202 |	And let's take a moment to say here's the basic rule you should encrypt
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,687	| IOT202 |	Your data on your servers
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| IOT202 |	You should encrypt your data
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,759	| IOT202 |	Find the app
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,783	| IOT202 |	And you should encrypt
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,319	| IOT202 |	The data on the device
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:36,831	| IOT202 |	And then
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,879	| IOT202 |	Whenever that data is
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,391	| IOT202 |	Traveling
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,927	| IOT202 |	Play the app and then
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,439	| IOT202 |	Device between
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,231	| IOT202 |	Cloud
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| IOT202 |	The phone in the cloud
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| IOT202 |	You should also encrypt
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:49,631	| IOT202 |	There that should just be the way it is in yes encryption is a
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,447	| IOT202 |	Pain there's a little bit of overhead there some costs associated with
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,263	| IOT202 |	But if you want to secure iot
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,543	| IOT202 |	It's not Job 1
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,079	| IOT202 |	Not having hard-coded password
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,871	| IOT202 |	Unsurprisingly child
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:00,895	| IOT202 |	But
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,479	| IOT202 |	Sparkle table Stakes it still tablesteaks absolutely
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,759	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,271	| IOT202 |	This reason
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,551	| IOT202 |	To a report about
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:10,111	| IOT202 |	Unlocking encryption on some popular iot devices
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:16,511	| IOT202 |	Yeah this is a test data from researchers at Brazil's Federal University of
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,071	| IOT202 |	Pernambuco which I may have
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| IOT202 |	Totally
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:23,679	| IOT202 |	That up but that's okay and University of Michigan which I got that right
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,727	| IOT202 |	They took it.
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,007	| IOT202 |	The Wolverines
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| IOT202 |	Alcohol during sex
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,079	| IOT202 |	Tom Brady
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,103	| IOT202 |	Whatever
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:36,223	| IOT202 |	The report took a look at 32 smartphone apps used to configure
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,271	| IOT202 |	Incontrol 96 Audi
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:42,367	| IOT202 |	Top selling WiFi Bluetooth devices sold on Amazon so that's a pretty good
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,647	| IOT202 |	Testbed async
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,671	| IOT202 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,695	| IOT202 |	Lee found out
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:48,767	| IOT202 |	31% of the apps have no encryption at all
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:53,119	| IOT202 |	And another 19% had hard-coded encryption keys so you could
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:59,007	| IOT202 |	Perhaps reverse-engineer the encryption bad bad bad
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:02,079	| IOT202 |	Kind of jumped out of me because of the companies and products named here
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,103	| IOT202 |	They
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:06,687	| IOT202 |	Created some proof-of-concept attacks based on their findings
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:09,247	| IOT202 |	Anime basically break
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,271	| IOT202 |	To hack around with
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,039	| IOT202 |	Tp-link
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,831	| IOT202 |	The lifx app
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:16,928	| IOT202 |	Belkin WeMo and broadlink e-control app
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:23,328	| IOT202 |	So granted a lot of these tax you have to be on the same Wi-Fi network and so on that's kind of a given
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,864	| IOT202 |	In cases but that doesn't make it
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,424	| IOT202 |	Acceptable so well
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,216	| IOT202 |	They also shared that
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| IOT202 |	Tp-link
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:34,592	| IOT202 |	They have the same hard-coded encryption key for all of the devices of a given product
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:40,992	| IOT202 |	Yeah yeah they even showed the code I mean I can see the Java code and I actually can understand it thanks my Java class
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:44,320	| IOT202 |	I have the seating number for the hashing and encryption and
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,344	| IOT202 |	I could
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:50,720	| IOT202 |	Probably figure out what the encryption key is based on that but actually so could probably anybody was the time at 4
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,024	| IOT202 |	Yeah and Kevin hasn't spent that much time and effort
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:54,816	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,120	| IOT202 |	Not on that note this is not yet
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:01,216	| IOT202 |	So this is not that hard so what is this mean for you guys
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:01,984	| IOT202 |	People who have these
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,264	| IOT202 |	Cuz I have to pee
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,568	| IOT202 |	Dlink switches in my house I have WeMo
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:06,592	| IOT202 |	Are you stopping
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:07,872	| IOT202 |	Actually
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,432	| IOT202 |	This month we're giving away a WeMo dimmer switch
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,736	| IOT202 |	Encryption not included
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,040	| IOT202 |	So in some cases it's a design
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,576	| IOT202 |	So WeMo doesn't
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:23,488	| IOT202 |	Encryption they don't do encryption between the device in the app is part of making it easier for users
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,000	| IOT202 |	They say
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,536	| IOT202 |	Now I know
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,560	| IOT202 |	One of their former
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,072	| IOT202 |	Security folks
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,864	| IOT202 |	The leftover
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,400	| IOT202 |	For this so this is something that
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:33,216	| IOT202 |	Did they've chosen to do even though they know
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,056	| IOT202 |	You might say okay
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,592	| IOT202 |	We talked about risk profiles and
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:44,736	| IOT202 |	Previous podcast but you might say hey do I have a high enough risk profile that I should really worried about this or are the devices that are
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,272	| IOT202 |	Into these Outlets
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,296	| IOT202 |	Could I really cause
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| IOT202 |	Problems
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,576	| IOT202 |	You know what is it
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,136	| IOT202 |	Is an air purifier or is it a
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,416	| IOT202 |	Curling iron
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,696	| IOT202 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:58,304	| IOT202 |	I mean I don't know why you wouldn't talk it in obviously but I'm just thinking
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:03,424	| IOT202 |	Portable heater
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:07,776	| IOT202 |	So you don't think about what you got plugged into these device
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,056	| IOT202 |	Two might want to hack
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,848	| IOT202 |	How easy it is
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:12,896	| IOT202 |	Getting on your Wi-Fi network is not
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,688	| IOT202 |	Super trivial unless you
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,200	| IOT202 |	And out your
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,248	| IOT202 |	Wi-Fi network like candy
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,272	| IOT202 |	Which some people do
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:20,320	| IOT202 |	I always recommend guest Network for everybody
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,856	| IOT202 |	Especially your kids friend
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,160	| IOT202 |	Man today is chock-full of
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:24,672	| IOT202 |	Security tips for
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,232	| IOT202 |	Yeah I would also recommend
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,792	| IOT202 |	Choosing devices Worthy
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:32,864	| IOT202 |	Apps have two-factor Authentication
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,888	| IOT202 |	To log into those app
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,704	| IOT202 |	That way people cannot log into an app
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,984	| IOT202 |	As you
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,752	| IOT202 |	Easley anyway
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,824	| IOT202 |	And control your devices if they were to gain access to mosto
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:45,408	| IOT202 |	Yeah for example if I was on Kevin's Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,432	| IOT202 |	Etihad WeMo devices
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,504	| IOT202 |	Because I have WeMo devices in my house and I'm running the Apple
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:54,624	| IOT202 |	I just open my WeMo app in his house if I'm on his Network and start controlling
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,136	| IOT202 |	His devices
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,672	| IOT202 |	Yeah I'll be back
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,440	| IOT202 |	And we Moto's
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,768	| IOT202 |	That's not a choice if I understand
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,840	| IOT202 |	7 on the flip side the report did it's not all doom and gloom
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:09,728	| IOT202 |	Reported point out that Google's Nest thermostat app is a good example of how to do security right
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:16,128	| IOT202 |	Which I know that also supports two-factor authentication and all the configuration is secure with SLT
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:19,456	| IOT202 |	Last of the cloud or via Wi-Fi with wpso
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:22,528	| IOT202 |	There are right ways to do that are examples of this
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:27,136	| IOT202 |	Kind of should be a standard but that's a whole another issue that we sort of touched upon earlier
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:32,768	| IOT202 |	Yeah in Google I will say Google does a lot of stuff behind the scenes on the security
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,840	| IOT202 |	Not allowed to talk about some of the things I hate
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,120	| IOT202 |	I do but they're very good
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,168	| IOT202 |	The Nest devices are
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| IOT202 |	Are very good
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,752	| IOT202 |	So very comfortable when they see flaws or when
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,776	| IOT202 |	People bring things up
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,800	| IOT202 |	They actually took
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,568	| IOT202 |	Communicate with
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:50,432	| IOT202 |	Users they update tp-link has had a couple hacks and they have not updated a lot of stuff
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,480	| IOT202 |	So they're cheap though
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,248	| IOT202 |	And that's what
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,272	| IOT202 |	People seem to be buying
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,808	| IOT202 |	So it's not the downside of
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:00,416	| IOT202 |	This is that security does cost money and it costs convenience and
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| IOT202 |	People
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:06,048	| IOT202 |	I don't know I don't actually have to factor enabled on my Nest even though I think it's a great thing to have
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,888	| IOT202 |	Know any chance I can't I do and then I have a
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,936	| IOT202 |	Google Titan security key for
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:17,824	| IOT202 |	All those accounts you can use a benefit Decatur app there's lots of ways. You can use SMS messaging
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:21,664	| IOT202 |	Would be my least favorite option at that's not as secure as other options
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,224	| IOT202 |	Alright will see you now we know that I am terrible at
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,528	| IOT202 |	And I wish that the MyQ
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:28,064	| IOT202 |	The Chamberlain MyQ also
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:28,576	| IOT202 |	So has 2Pac
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,904	| IOT202 |	Application which this is the year of us calling
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT202 |	42 Factor
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,952	| IOT202 |	On all iot device
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,232	| IOT202 |	So get used to it
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:40,864	| IOT202 |	You're not using it maybe I should come to your house and try and control your nest
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT202 |	Read on that
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,424	| IOT202 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,472	| IOT202 |	Speaking of Google
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,264	| IOT202 |	We got some news on assistant
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,056	| IOT202 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,568	| IOT202 |	Chanel
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT202 |	Figure into
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:53,664	| IOT202 |	Interpreter which announced at CES
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,944	| IOT202 |	I was super excited about it
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:59,808	| IOT202 |	And then I had like right when I got home from CVS I had a foreign exchange student my house from Spain
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,344	| IOT202 |	We totally could have used it
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| IOT202 |	But it wasn't out yet
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,416	| IOT202 |	So what
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:09,024	| IOT202 |	Yeah there's always at the CES demo that Google gave and it works
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:15,424	| IOT202 |	Flawlessly in that demo and it wasn't kander staged it was just a regular Google home device and they had a
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,984	| IOT202 |	Conversation in English and French
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:24,384	| IOT202 |	Because obviously multiple languages but they showed it off it was cool it's one of those cool features that are unfortunate I'll never use
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:30,528	| IOT202 |	Cuz I don't really have foreign exchange students here but it is rolling out now so if you have need of it
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,296	| IOT202 |	You should see it
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,856	| IOT202 |	Anytime soon I would say
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,368	| IOT202 |	And what do you say
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,696	| IOT202 |	If you want to have a conversation in a language essay Spanish
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,744	| IOT202 |	Do you say be my Spanish interpreter or
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:45,376	| IOT202 |	Help me speak Spanish and it becomes a basically it is almost a port of the Google translate mobile app
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,168	| IOT202 |	Right on
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:50,752	| IOT202 |	We have a smart home display it'll show with both sides of the conversation
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,568	| IOT202 |	In the two languages so you can read it as well as hear it
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,360	| IOT202 |	But if you don't it would just
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,384	| IOT202 |	If you have a Google home
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,432	| IOT202 |	You just hear the translation
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,456	| IOT202 |	See it but
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,736	| IOT202 |	I can't seem to work very well
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,296	| IOT202 |	Yay and I actually
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,064	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,600	| IOT202 |	Not in person
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,648	| IOT202 |	But in communicating via
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,416	| IOT202 |	Email in
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,440	| IOT202 |	Text with
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,208	| IOT202 |	B
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,976	| IOT202 |	Parents of Exchange
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,000	| IOT202 |	Didn't I would actually
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,792	| IOT202 |	Translate function on
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| IOT202 |	Google assist
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,328	| IOT202 |	Can I be like
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:17,888	| IOT202 |	I typed my thing in English no translated to Spanish.
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:21,984	| IOT202 |	And apparently they got the gist so we're good
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:25,568	| IOT202 |	He didn't use those Google pixel buds so you can probably return those things
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,592	| IOT202 |	II
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,688	| IOT202 |	Yeah those are those really Nifty
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,968	| IOT202 |	At least in theory
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:38,368	| IOT202 |	Headphones that you would connect to your phone and it would use the Google Translate app kind of been real time so you can hear the Translate
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,416	| IOT202 |	Someone but didn't seem to work very well
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,464	| IOT202 |	At the headsets they were.
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,256	| IOT202 |	Other Google News
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,584	| IOT202 |	Making life a little easier now you can get
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,888	| IOT202 |	Google assistant on your nest guard
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:55,520	| IOT202 |	And if you're like what is my Nest guard it is part of the nest security system it is bbrainz of that it's a little
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:56,800	| IOT202 |	Thing that you
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,336	| IOT202 |	I can wave your tag over to
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,616	| IOT202 |	Turn your alarm on and off
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,688	| IOT202 |	Basically now you can ask it things like oh
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,480	| IOT202 |	Haji do I need an umbrella today
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,016	| IOT202 |	And it will
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| IOT202 |	It will help you
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:12,416	| IOT202 |	Yeah this is rather sneaky because I don't know that everybody knew there was a microphone in
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,208	| IOT202 |	Yashow it's an option
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,512	| IOT202 |	Temperature and it's often because
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,072	| IOT202 |	NASCAR does have an on device microphone
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,096	| IOT202 |	If you've got one
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,424	| IOT202 |	It's not enabled by default
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,704	| IOT202 |	So that's why you've got to opt-in
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,544	| IOT202 |	But it's not an always listening device if you don't want it to be
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,360	| IOT202 |	What I would love and I don't know if it works this way but
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,664	| IOT202 |	Because you're doing this as you rush out the
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:36,992	| IOT202 |	The door it would be awesome to set reminders for your nest guard
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,272	| IOT202 |	To be like
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:41,088	| IOT202 |	Do you have your gym clothes it's Thursday right
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,136	| IOT202 |	Or whatever is like reminders you need
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,160	| IOT202 |	As you walk out
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,696	| IOT202 |	Cuz I'm always walking out the door
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,256	| IOT202 |	Thanks right so
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,024	| IOT202 |	When you
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,304	| IOT202 |	Swipe that tag
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,328	| IOT202 |	And it knows you're there
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,864	| IOT202 |	Be awesome if it just shout it out
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,376	| IOT202 |	Proactively
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,680	| IOT202 |	Don't forget your gym clothes
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,984	| IOT202 |	Yeah I don't think it does that
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:04,384	| IOT202 |	Which it would be really cool I wonder if there's a routine available for that or someone which one
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:06,176	| IOT202 |	Pulling up well and maybe
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,456	| IOT202 |	I mean it software
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,224	| IOT202 |	We can always make it better
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,016	| IOT202 |	Yep so
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,296	| IOT202 |	Instead of just always ask
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:13,088	| IOT202 |	Asking I'd have it proactively remind me
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,856	| IOT202 |	Me about things that aren't pork
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,160	| IOT202 |	Cool alright
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,696	| IOT202 |	So that
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| IOT202 |	Doesn't quite
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,488	| IOT202 |	Make for the
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:22,560	| IOT202 |	It's a very expensive security system but it might be worth it eventually
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:27,424	| IOT202 |	That is it for the new section of the show let's go to the iot podcast

EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:41,664	| IOT202 |	Yay
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,456	| IOT202 |	Hey Stacy this is ad
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,224	| IOT202 |	From a little Kentucky
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,504	| IOT202 |	My iot question
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,040	| IOT202 |	Involves lighting
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,808	| IOT202 |	I have
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,576	| IOT202 |	Currently have
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,344	| IOT202 |	Plum lightpad
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,392	| IOT202 |	I was part of their Kickstarter
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:55,232	| IOT202 |	Purchase those seams if those are not viable any
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,768	| IOT202 |	At least what I can gather
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,816	| IOT202 |	To my internet search and
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,096	| IOT202 |	Not working as well there
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:00,864	| IOT202 |	The timing
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,168	| IOT202 |	Json outside lights actually is now
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:03,936	| IOT202 |	Working
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,472	| IOT202 |	Enough for me and some
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:08,032	| IOT202 |	Looking for a smart light switch to
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,056	| IOT202 |	Implement
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,336	| IOT202 |	In its place
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,872	| IOT202 |	I love the color ring around the
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,640	| IOT202 |	Plum lightpad
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:13,920	| IOT202 |	You know it's not a necessity
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,712	| IOT202 |	What's at the noon
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,248	| IOT202 |	Light switches as well but
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,296	| IOT202 |	Looking for other options out there maybe
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,832	| IOT202 |	CES 2019 will have to
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:23,136	| IOT202 |	On that front as well
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:23,904	| IOT202 |	Oanda
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:26,976	| IOT202 |	This is sad news this is another one of those companies that
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,768	| IOT202 |	We thought might get bought but didn't
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,048	| IOT202 |	Plum is
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,584	| IOT202 |	Actually in Austin company it was
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,632	| IOT202 |	Founded by the former head of Cydia
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:36,960	| IOT202 |	Way back in 2012 and idea was to make
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,752	| IOT202 |	An awesome light switch that controlled
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,520	| IOT202 |	Everything
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,800	| IOT202 |	I mean truly it was
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,848	| IOT202 |	Is way ahead of its time nose very pretty
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,384	| IOT202 |	But
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,920	| IOT202 |	They are no longer
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,456	| IOT202 |	It doesn't seem that they're operating
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:49,760	| IOT202 |	Anymore I have not gotten any emails back
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,528	| IOT202 |	Back from them
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,296	| IOT202 |	About my questions
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,320	| IOT202 |	Feels pretty grim
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:53,600	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,624	| IOT202 |	Plum light pads
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:58,720	| IOT202 |	They're actually ahead of their time but now we've got tons of options
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,488	| IOT202 |	Choose from
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,024	| IOT202 |	You mentioned energy monitor
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:04,096	| IOT202 |	And so that's throwing us for a little bit of a loop
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,400	| IOT202 |	Cuz the only energy monitoring light switch that we
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| IOT202 |	Find an actual switch
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,984	| IOT202 |	Was a zigbee based 1/4
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:10,496	| IOT202 |	Mge
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,544	| IOT202 |	If energy monitoring is
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,056	| IOT202 |	Important to you
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:17,152	| IOT202 |	And that's probably what you should go with but then you've got hugs and all this other
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,176	| IOT202 |	But
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:21,504	| IOT202 |	You just want to really highly functional Advanced light
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,552	| IOT202 |	Then we got lots of options
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:27,904	| IOT202 |	You mentioned the noon those are cool because they do these pre-designed lighting things
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT202 |	Very pretty
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,720	| IOT202 |	I would also make a plug
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,488	| IOT202 |	For brilliance
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,560	| IOT202 |	Those do a lot of home automation
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:38,400	| IOT202 |	Control and they don't have a pretty LED but you can put your own
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,168	| IOT202 |	Photos on there
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:42,496	| IOT202 |	And that's kind of neat if you like to see pictures of
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| IOT202 |	Your family are
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,032	| IOT202 |	Your favorite
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,800	| IOT202 |	Vacation spot
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:48,896	| IOT202 |	Lightpad they do have timer functionalities alarms Electric
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:49,920	| IOT202 |	Control your Sonos your nests
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,456	| IOT202 |	All kinds of stuff
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:53,248	| IOT202 |	A little complicated to set up
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,016	| IOT202 |	I would recommend
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,296	| IOT202 |	Professional installer
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,320	| IOT202 |	And they're expensive
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,088	| IOT202 |	But
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,600	| IOT202 |	I do a lot
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:58,880	| IOT202 |	If your
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,160	| IOT202 |	Less
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,952	| IOT202 |	Like your like that is too much
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,232	| IOT202 |	Idevices make
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,512	| IOT202 |	A dimmer switch
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,048	| IOT202 |	Or a on off switch
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,584	| IOT202 |	Switch usually you need to double-check
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,120	| IOT202 |	Which is which
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:13,984	| IOT202 |	It only works with iOS so only Apple but it is Wi-Fi so you don't need any sort of hubby
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,264	| IOT202 |	Take things
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:18,592	| IOT202 |	And they have that led have an LED on the device that
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,616	| IOT202 |	Might be exciting
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:20,896	| IOT202 |	Or you can wait
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:23,968	| IOT202 |	Because you are entered to win our WeMo dimmer and you
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| IOT202 |	You can see how you feel about that
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,528	| IOT202 |	Yeah we look
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:29,344	| IOT202 |	High and low for something very similar to
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,112	| IOT202 |	The plum
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:34,976	| IOT202 |	Which is unique because it has an LED light ring around the switch so Shore minutes
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:39,584	| IOT202 |	In the dark it's really easy to find but nobody else has done that that we could see
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:43,680	| IOT202 |	There plenty of switches had like a little LED indicator making LED strip
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:45,216	| IOT202 |	But nothing around the entire
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,032	| IOT202 |	Paddle switch itself unfortunately
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,312	| IOT202 |	But there are lots
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,848	| IOT202 |	Lots of light switches so if you want to
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,640	| IOT202 |	Like I said brilliant switch
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,408	| IOT202 |	I just read about a company
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:57,760	| IOT202 |	Oreo Oreo switch looks really interesting I haven't tested it out
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,528	| IOT202 |	It feels like something
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,040	| IOT202 |	Do you want to test
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:03,392	| IOT202 |	That's all about like wellness and circadian rhythms and dimming lights in
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,440	| IOT202 |	Automation actually automatic car
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:07,488	| IOT202 |	Libation where it learns about the sensors in that one
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,280	| IOT202 |	Tons of sensors in there
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,816	| IOT202 |	It doesn't do the energy monitoring
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:12,096	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:12,864	| IOT202 |	I hate to
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:15,168	| IOT202 |	That leaving you empty-handed I'm almost leaving you with
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:15,680	| IOT202 |	Too many things
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:18,496	| IOT202 |	But maybe you can call us back and
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,776	| IOT202 |	Let us know what your most
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:21,824	| IOT202 |	Features are cuz it's a little unclear
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:24,384	| IOT202 |	And I think headlining today you're going to have to decide
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:26,944	| IOT202 |	Your top two features it's kind of like buying a new car
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,480	| IOT202 |	I must have this in this
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:31,040	| IOT202 |	Can I help you choose
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,808	| IOT202 |	Which car is the
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,368	| IOT202 |	All right
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,136	| IOT202 |	That is it

EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:46,976	| IOT202 |	Ability but really the future of the brand is going to extend more deeply into other areas
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,024	| IOT202 |	Including lifestyle components
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:52,864	| IOT202 |	And so when you think about the evolution in the automotive

EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,152	| IOT202 |	Where most of Minis
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,176	| IOT202 |	These customers are
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,712	| IOT202 |	And people who are
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:09,248	| IOT202 |	Smelly looking for new Solutions
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,784	| IOT202 |	Even when they're not

EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:33,984	| IOT202 |	Is there willing to go out a little little bit of a lemon talk about things sometimes lawyers they don't like to do that
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,544	| IOT202 |	Well I'll do my best
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,848	| IOT202 |	There we go I will make you say anything too crazy
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:44,992	| IOT202 |	Times of legal issues associated with The Internet of Things most of which
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,296	| IOT202 |	We're just going to have to find out by a lake
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:51,648	| IOT202 |	Doing people and watching the court so we're going to tackle it first with
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,184	| IOT202 |	What everybody is
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,464	| IOT202 |	Talking about which is
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:55,232	| IOT202 |	Privacy
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:58,304	| IOT202 |	Data protection and privacy and
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:00,864	| IOT202 |	I feel like we're going to get some sort of law
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:04,192	| IOT202 |	This year at a federal level California to pass the law
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,728	| IOT202 |	Last year that goes into effect
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,240	| IOT202 |	20/20
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:09,568	| IOT202 |	What do you see ahead for privacy regulation
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,640	| IOT202 |	I think I'm less optimist
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:18,016	| IOT202 |	Then you are that we're going to get something at the federal level this year I feel like our federal law
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:18,784	| IOT202 |	Tigers have
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:21,088	| IOT202 |	Lots and lots on their mind they've had a bill
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,624	| IOT202 |	That they could have got
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:26,208	| IOT202 |	That's been sitting in committee for a while that regulated
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:26,720	| IOT202 |	Internet
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:30,560	| IOT202 |	Devices that are sold to the federal government
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,328	| IOT202 |	That hasn't
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:31,840	| IOT202 |	Passed yet
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,120	| IOT202 |	And sitting around
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:33,888	| IOT202 |	For a bit
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,680	| IOT202 |	That was kind of a landlord
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,472	| IOT202 |	That was I read that long I was
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,240	| IOT202 |	Wow that is like
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:41,568	| IOT202 |	Brightwell
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,592	| IOT202 |	Hello government
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:45,920	| IOT202 |	I think you put your finger on the other problem right they don't
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:47,200	| IOT202 |	Necessarily
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:52,064	| IOT202 |	Know or have their arms around what they need to do to do more than the bare minimum
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,088	| IOT202 |	So4
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,392	| IOT202 |	This issue to be legislated on it
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,928	| IOT202 |	National level I do think that will
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:57,952	| IOT202 |	Actually happened
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:01,024	| IOT202 |	But I think what we will probably see
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,816	| IOT202 |	On the Internet of Things front is wet
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,352	| IOT202 |	I think we'll also see on
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,376	| IOT202 |	Privacy front
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,144	| IOT202 |	Is the state
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,168	| IOT202 |	Start to enact
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:08,704	| IOT202 |	Their own laws
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,472	| IOT202 |	Is there
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,240	| IOT202 |	Citizens are fed up
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:13,056	| IOT202 |	Pressuring their local lawmakers
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,848	| IOT202 |	To put something in place
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:18,432	| IOT202 |	At the state level and we start to get this Patchwork of
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:21,504	| IOT202 |	Different rags in different places that
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,784	| IOT202 |	As a practical matter everyone
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:26,880	| IOT202 |	One house to comply with if they're doing business in all of the states of the United States
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,184	| IOT202 |	So most of the LIE
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:32,768	| IOT202 |	So far have dealt with the physical security of devices
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:34,560	| IOT202 |	We're talking about things like
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,328	| IOT202 |	Hey
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,376	| IOT202 |	Let's not have hardcoded passwords
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:39,168	| IOT202 |	Let's make sure you force people to change
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:41,984	| IOT202 |	Passwords it's very much kind of good behavior
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,264	| IOT202 |	In a device-level
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,288	| IOT202 |	In contrast
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:48,128	| IOT202 |	That's what happened with Europe with gdpr as they actually did legislation
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:49,152	| IOT202 |	Protected
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:51,200	| IOT202 |	Data and I think those are kind of
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:52,480	| IOT202 |	Worth breaking apart
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,248	| IOT202 |	Just a little bit
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:55,040	| IOT202 |	Because obviously one is about
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:58,880	| IOT202 |	Security
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:02,464	| IOT202 |	Picture day like crazy how do you say legislators should
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:04,000	| IOT202 |	Define the problem
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:04,768	| IOT202 |	Privacy fence
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:06,048	| IOT202 |	Security with iot devices
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:12,704	| IOT202 |	Well I think The Regulators in the EU have swept iot devices in Ride Along
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:13,984	| IOT202 |	Anything else
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:17,056	| IOT202 |	Just they haven't made their gdpr law device-specific
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:18,592	| IOT202 |	So if you're
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,616	| IOT202 |	Reaching
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:22,176	| IOT202 |	If there
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,992	| IOT202 |	Tenants with any of your devices
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,016	| IOT202 |	Citizen how your hand
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:27,296	| IOT202 |	Data
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:30,624	| IOT202 |	Can be brought before one of their tribunals and
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,904	| IOT202 |	Find quite a bit
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,696	| IOT202 |	Approach that
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,744	| IOT202 |	Could see us lawmaker
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,560	| IOT202 |	First take Internet of Things has its own
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:41,120	| IOT202 |	Specific problems that I think as you
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:46,752	| IOT202 |	Alluded to States like California and others are trying to make sure that glaring problems like her
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:47,776	| IOT202 |	Coded passwords
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,312	| IOT202 |	The Tetra are dealt with
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,336	| IOT202 |	But just
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,104	| IOT202 |	Because
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:55,711	| IOT202 |	There are specific laws directed at the internet of things doesn't mean that those devices
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,735	| IOT202 |	Also have
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:42:00,575	| IOT202 |	To comply with data laws or the people putting those devices
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:03,135	| IOT202 |	Out there and then managing the data that they collect with
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:06,207	| IOT202 |	Okay so we probably should see
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:12,351	| IOT202 |	Data privacy laws and then specifically
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,911	| IOT202 |	Secure your devices lock them down
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,423	| IOT202 |	Yes
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,215	| IOT202 |	I think that's very likely
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,239	| IOT202 |	The makers of
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:18,751	| IOT202 |	These devices
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,031	| IOT202 |	Have to deal with both kinds
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:23,615	| IOT202 |	So you're not as optimistic as I am about a federal
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:28,223	| IOT202 |	I feel like the industry the tech industry is actually calling for this now
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,807	| IOT202 |	We're going to have so many different laws
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,415	| IOT202 |	Microsoft was talking at Davos
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:37,951	| IOT202 |	Last month about having
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,719	| IOT202 |	Some sort of
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:39,487	| IOT202 |	Global
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,279	| IOT202 |	Privacy and data regulation law
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,815	| IOT202 |	Do you think that's crazy
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,119	| IOT202 |	I don't think it's crazy at all
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,143	| IOT202 |	I'd love to see us
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:47,423	| IOT202 |	Move in that
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,447	| IOT202 |	Direction
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:51,007	| IOT202 |	Logistically difficult to get a cord
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,799	| IOT202 |	That leads to a lot
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,335	| IOT202 |	People can actually
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,615	| IOT202 |	Enforce and understand
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| IOT202 |	Just like it's better to have
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,991	| IOT202 |	A federal law that
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:01,503	| IOT202 |	People can
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:03,551	| IOT202 |	Comply with and understand and
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,831	| IOT202 |	Not have to worry about
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:08,927	| IOT202 |	Weather things are different in Arkansas than they are in Missouri it would be
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,951	| IOT202 |	Nice rock
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:11,487	| IOT202 |	Concerned to have
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:12,511	| IOT202 |	Adequate
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:13,791	| IOT202 |	Consumer protection
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:15,327	| IOT202 |	Privacy and data protection
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:21,983	| IOT202 |	Rules that are easy to interpret and follow for the manufacturers of these
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:23,007	| IOT202 |	Spices on the other
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:24,799	| IOT202 |	I think that
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:30,687	| IOT202 |	If you can get people talking about how to bring the logistics of it about this
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:31,967	| IOT202 |	What's the positive staff
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:34,271	| IOT202 |	Talk about consumer rights with
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:35,295	| IOT202 |	Gadget
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:38,623	| IOT202 |	So right now we're just kind of figuring things out
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:42,463	| IOT202 |	And a lot of times what happens is I might buy a gadget or a device
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:43,743	| IOT202 |	Or car
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,791	| IOT202 |	Or in some cases even
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,583	| IOT202 |	House
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:52,959	| IOT202 |	It will come with a lot of home automation or smart stuff built in the challenges
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:59,103	| IOT202 |	A lot of times you don't have the chance to read the terms of service until you're actually making this purchase or until your actual
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:03,711	| IOT202 |	You downloaded the app and now you're agreeing to everything
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:05,503	| IOT202 |	So to me this seems like
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:08,319	| IOT202 |	A terrible way to do things especially when you're pulling so much
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:09,343	| IOT202 |	How much data out of it
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,367	| IOT202 |	How might we
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:10,879	| IOT202 |	Change that
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:14,463	| IOT202 |	It is a terrible way to do things
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,767	| IOT202 |	Set the gdpr tries to address
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:19,327	| IOT202 |	That instead of just assuming that
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,095	| IOT202 |	People
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:22,143	| IOT202 |	I have read and understood things
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:22,911	| IOT202 |	At each
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:24,959	| IOT202 |	Interaction where data is going to be
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,751	| IOT202 |	Be collected a separate consent is
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:29,567	| IOT202 |	Is required
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,615	| IOT202 |	Fine print that then
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:34,687	| IOT202 |	Is assumed to be applied as binding
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:36,479	| IOT202 |	That's sort of the place where we would
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,247	| IOT202 |	Want to get to
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,015	| IOT202 |	We're not there
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,343	| IOT202 |	As you point out
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:45,183	| IOT202 |	As far as the smart home devices go it is the Wild Wild West
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,487	| IOT202 |	And we're going to see a lot of
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,279	| IOT202 |	Litigation we're going to see
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:51,071	| IOT202 |	Other laws that haven't been
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:53,119	| IOT202 |	Enacted specifically.
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:55,423	| IOT202 |	Deal with these problems being brought in
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:56,191	| IOT202 |	Play
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:56,703	| IOT202 |	WYD
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,495	| IOT202 |	And in some cases
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:02,591	| IOT202 |	We have a legal framework in place you know we have tort law which is
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:04,895	| IOT202 |	If you recklessly
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:06,175	| IOT202 |	Harm somebody
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:10,271	| IOT202 |	In a way that is protected under the law
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:11,039	| IOT202 |	Then you can
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:13,599	| IOT202 |	Can be sued so it's a big broad Body of Lies
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:17,439	| IOT202 |	Deals with personal injuries it also deals with
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,207	| IOT202 |	Things like
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:19,999	| IOT202 |	Less tangible heart
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:22,047	| IOT202 |	So you can harm someone's economic
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:24,351	| IOT202 |	Pinterest you can harm someone's privacy
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,375	| IOT202 |	Can harm them
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,655	| IOT202 |	Emotionally
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:27,935	| IOT202 |	That's so
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:29,215	| IOT202 |	There are all kinds
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,751	| IOT202 |	Is of torts out there that
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:32,031	| IOT202 |	Could be brought to bear
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,055	| IOT202 |	On the internet
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,591	| IOT202 |	Thanks and I expect
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,359	| IOT202 |	If
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,639	| IOT202 |	Companies are reckless in
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:38,175	| IOT202 |	Misusing data
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:40,479	| IOT202 |	Find themselves in a PR
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:41,247	| IOT202 |	Boiling
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,271	| IOT202 |	Kettle of fish
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:44,319	| IOT202 |	Going to see a lot of
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,343	| IOT202 |	Already
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:46,623	| IOT202 |	Existing principles
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:48,159	| IOT202 |	Tort law thrown at that
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:49,951	| IOT202 |	And may start to rain
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,231	| IOT202 |	Some of the saint
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:57,375	| IOT202 |	And a lot of times these aren't terrible like one of the things I think is really difficult is it very hard to prove the harm
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,447	| IOT202 |	Having your data stolen for exam
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:02,751	| IOT202 |	I guess I could say
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:03,775	| IOT202 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:05,823	| IOT202 |	Someone broke into my security camera
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,871	| IOT202 |	And took naked pictures of me all over the internet
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,175	| IOT202 |	That feels like
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:11,455	| IOT202 |	I can prove harm there
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:15,551	| IOT202 |	I'm hoping because isn't that one of the core tenets of these sorts of lawsuits
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:18,623	| IOT202 |	Sure we have a right of privacy and this
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,159	| IOT202 |	Country and
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:22,975	| IOT202 |	If you've enabled someone to
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,535	| IOT202 |	Be held accountable
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,583	| IOT202 |	Under those kinds of principles
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:29,375	| IOT202 |	On the date of front I think
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:31,679	| IOT202 |	Proving harm comes down to
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,471	| IOT202 |	You know if someone has
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,007	| IOT202 |	Stolen your identity stolen
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:35,775	| IOT202 |	Money
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:38,847	| IOT202 |	Damage your reputation there are all kinds of ways
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:40,895	| IOT202 |	Demonstrating
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,175	| IOT202 |	Legal
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:44,223	| IOT202 |	Work someplace that prevent
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:48,319	| IOT202 |	People willy-nilly being able to carry out those arms against you
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:51,135	| IOT202 |	So I think that the legal system and the laws
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:53,183	| IOT202 |	We have on the books to some extent
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:54,207	| IOT202 |	Handle
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,999	| IOT202 |	This explosion of devices
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,583	| IOT202 |	It sure would be nice
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:00,095	| IOT202 |	To have
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:02,399	| IOT202 |	Thought given
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,167	| IOT202 |	And Analysis given
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:06,239	| IOT202 |	That actually address
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:09,567	| IOT202 |	Squirrely in head on the problems that these devices
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:10,335	| IOT202 |	This present
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:10,847	| IOT202 |	That might not
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:13,407	| IOT202 |	Easily dealt with under the laws we already have
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:18,527	| IOT202 |	Sure I'm thinking of things like have a corporate wellness program and
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:21,087	| IOT202 |	My manager somehow gets data about
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:21,855	| IOT202 |	My sleep pattern
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,135	| IOT202 |	What's under this this is not have
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,159	| IOT202 |	Today
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:26,463	| IOT202 |	We're not too far off given house
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:29,535	| IOT202 |	Some of the insurance companies are treating data from
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:31,839	| IOT202 |	Other medical devices
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:38,239	| IOT202 |	They start to make decisions about like oh hey maybe you should handle this account cuz you know it looks like you didn't
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:40,799	| IOT202 |	Sleep well last night was pretty easy let's
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:43,359	| IOT202 |	Dennis Diane for this presentation he's looking
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:45,919	| IOT202 |	Capable at the moment
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,711	| IOT202 |	Those kind of things feel more
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:49,247	| IOT202 |	Insidious that maybe just
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,295	| IOT202 |	Crashing your car into something
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:52,831	| IOT202 |	And that's where I think
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:58,207	| IOT202 |	If it comes really challenging because these are also harms that could follow you throughout your life in a way that
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:59,231	| IOT202 |	You may not even be aware of
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:01,023	| IOT202 |	Write that I love your exam
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:04,095	| IOT202 |	That's exactly the kind of situation where
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:07,935	| IOT202 |	You may not even know that decisions are being made about
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,471	| IOT202 |	Based on
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,007	| IOT202 |	Date of the people shouldn't
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:14,591	| IOT202 |	Maybe accidentally you would find that out
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,103	| IOT202 |	But then
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:16,895	| IOT202 |	How could you address it
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:18,431	| IOT202 |	That's a really tough one.
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:21,759	| IOT202 |	Some gray area that we're getting into
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,807	| IOT202 |	Okay and
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,343	| IOT202 |	This idea of
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:26,623	| IOT202 |	Maybe
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:27,647	| IOT202 |	Unknown Harms
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,671	| IOT202 |	There's also
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:29,951	| IOT202 |	Some very clear heart
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:30,719	| IOT202 |	I said I don't think
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:35,583	| IOT202 |	We think about when we buy these connected devices which is that they could be used against
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:37,631	| IOT202 |	In a court of law
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:39,679	| IOT202 |	A civil court or
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:45,823	| IOT202 |	Murdering anyone
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:49,151	| IOT202 |	Microphones I have all of this data in my house that
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:52,479	| IOT202 |	It's been collected and I'm very curious how do you think that situation
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:57,343	| IOT202 |	What's already evolving we've seen instances already
EDL	00:48:57,343	00:48:59,903	| IOT202 |	Where prosecutors in Murder
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:02,719	| IOT202 |	Actions and investigations have
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:04,511	| IOT202 |	Obtain data from
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:05,279	| IOT202 |	Relevant
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,303	| IOT202 |	Peoples
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:08,863	| IOT202 |	Fitbit's and Echoes and
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:10,399	| IOT202 |	There was a case we talked about it
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:14,751	| IOT202 |	A few times on this week in law that involved a murderer in
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:16,031	| IOT202 |	Arkansas
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:16,799	| IOT202 |	Where
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:18,079	| IOT202 |	It was actually a
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:22,687	| IOT202 |	Connected device on the water heater for the wall
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:24,479	| IOT202 |	Get the hot tub murders
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:25,247	| IOT202 |	Yes
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:27,039	| IOT202 |	And they actually track
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:30,623	| IOT202 |	2 a.m.
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:32,927	| IOT202 |	And decided that meant this person was cleaning up
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:34,207	| IOT202 |	Right
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:37,279	| IOT202 |	Strange strange things already going on
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:38,559	| IOT202 |	As far as
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:42,655	| IOT202 |	Prosecutors getting creative how they're going to build their case
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,191	| IOT202 |	Of course
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:47,519	| IOT202 |	That's a boon for law enforcement that they have all this
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:48,031	| IOT202 |	Data
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:49,055	| IOT202 |	2
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,871	| IOT202 |	Pick and choose from in trying to
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:52,895	| IOT202 |	Prove a case
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,431	| IOT202 |	It's not necessarily
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,991	| IOT202 |	A boon for all the litigants because
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:50:00,575	| IOT202 |	Although you're not planning to commit murder maybe you still wouldn't
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:02,879	| IOT202 |	Be planning to commit murder when one was
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,647	| IOT202 |	Committed
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:06,207	| IOT202 |	And somehow you wind up in the crosshairs
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,231	| IOT202 |	Sever prosecution
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:07,999	| IOT202 |	Because
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:09,535	| IOT202 |	Of the data that seems
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,815	| IOT202 |	To you
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:15,935	| IOT202 |	I might get the wrong place at the wrong time
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:19,263	| IOT202 |	Exactly so
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:20,543	| IOT202 |	We're definitely seeing
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:26,431	| IOT202 |	It will only get worse I mean I imagine
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:28,991	| IOT202 |	People running their hands in this way and
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:29,759	| IOT202 |	Speculated
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:30,271	| IOT202 |	In this way
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:31,551	| IOT202 |	When
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:32,575	| IOT202 |	Everyone be
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:33,343	| IOT202 |	Began to have
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:35,903	| IOT202 |	Computer where they were storing a lot of it
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:40,255	| IOT202 |	Information and certainly smartphones have been a huge part of the data
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:41,023	| IOT202 |	Environment
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:47,423	| IOT202 |	For what at least 15 years out right Supreme Court just actually it was it last year
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:48,959	| IOT202 |	Decided on a
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:51,007	| IOT202 |	Smartphone GPS case
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:51,775	| IOT202 |	It was
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,335	| IOT202 |	Fishing expeditions
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:56,127	| IOT202 |	Yeah in the Supreme Court actually seems
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:57,407	| IOT202 |	Issuing some very
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:58,943	| IOT202 |	Smart decisions about
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:50:59,967	| IOT202 |	What smart devices
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:02,015	| IOT202 |	So we can keep our fingers crossed that that
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:03,295	| IOT202 |	Trend
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:04,319	| IOT202 |	Continues
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:10,463	| IOT202 |	But the other thing you mentioned civil cases are I'm sure that people
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:13,279	| IOT202 |	Wondered about all the data on
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:16,095	| IOT202 |	Devices before there were things like smart light bulbs
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:16,863	| IOT202 |	Smart locks
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,143	| IOT202 |	Smart watches
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:20,447	| IOT202 |	Smart sleep apnea devices
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:21,471	| IOT202 |	So it's just
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:23,007	| IOT202 |	Throwing a whole lot
EDL	00:51:23,007	00:51:23,775	| IOT202 |	More data
EDL	00:51:24,287	00:51:25,567	| IOT202 |	To the ecosystem
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:26,847	| IOT202 |	And
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:29,407	| IOT202 |	The way the legal system handles that
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:31,199	| IOT202 |	Again this is a question of
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:36,063	| IOT202 |	Principles that are hundreds of years old being applied to the
EDL	00:51:36,063	00:51:37,599	| IOT202 |	Conundrums that we're facing
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:38,367	| IOT202 |	Today
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,903	| IOT202 |	And those principles actually
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:41,951	| IOT202 |	Do a pretty good job of
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:43,487	| IOT202 |	Trying to make sure that
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:44,511	| IOT202 |	We're having
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:45,791	| IOT202 |	Fair trials
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:46,559	| IOT202 |	Evidence has
EDL	00:51:47,071	00:51:47,839	| IOT202 |	To be
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:48,607	| IOT202 |	Credible
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:50,143	| IOT202 |	It has to be
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:51,423	| IOT202 |	Legitimate and legitimize
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:53,471	| IOT202 |	So if you're going to introduce something
EDL	00:51:54,751	00:51:55,775	| IOT202 |	You have to
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:57,567	| IOT202 |	Be able to have an expert
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:51:58,335	| IOT202 |	Come in and
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:51:59,871	| IOT202 |	Say why
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:02,175	| IOT202 |	The jury or the other Trier of fact
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:03,199	| IOT202 |	If it's just a judge
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:04,223	| IOT202 |	Entrust
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:06,015	| IOT202 |	The conclusions that are being drawn
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:07,551	| IOT202 |	The date of the
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:09,087	| IOT202 |	Put forth in court
EDL	00:52:09,599	00:52:13,951	| IOT202 |	So that's going to be true and Civil Trial or a criminal trial in order to trust
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:14,719	| IOT202 |	The state at its
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:16,767	| IOT202 |	Going to have to clear some hurdles
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:18,815	| IOT202 |	Being
EDL	00:52:18,815	00:52:20,607	| IOT202 |	Evidentially
EDL	00:52:20,607	00:52:21,631	| IOT202 |	Credible
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:22,399	| IOT202 |	Unacceptable
EDL	00:52:22,399	00:52:24,191	| IOT202 |	Before it can
EDL	00:52:24,191	00:52:24,959	| IOT202 |	Do the job and
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:27,263	| IOT202 |	Show somebody
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:28,799	| IOT202 |	Illegal act
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:30,591	| IOT202 |	So while I am
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:33,151	| IOT202 |	Concerned about being at the wrong place at the wrong time
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:35,711	| IOT202 |	And less concerned about you know Murder is getting
EDL	00:52:36,223	00:52:36,991	| IOT202 |	Caught up by their device
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:38,271	| IOT202 |	That's right that
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:40,831	| IOT202 |	The last concerning but when I think about civil
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:41,599	| IOT202 |	Trials
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:47,231	| IOT202 |	Nervous about like who can subpoena my Fitbit data
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:48,767	| IOT202 |	Like if there is
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,815	| IOT202 |	And that's just a random
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:52,863	| IOT202 |	In case I don't know why it would be in a lawsuit with someone
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:54,143	| IOT202 |	My Fitbit data
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:55,679	| IOT202 |	What are the basic
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:57,471	| IOT202 |	Rules that we should be aware of
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:53:01,055	| IOT202 |	Apps like how is that data access to has a say in
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:02,335	| IOT202 |	Yay or nay to it
EDL	00:53:03,103	00:53:05,151	| IOT202 |	Right so if you're a party
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:06,175	| IOT202 |	2
EDL	00:53:06,175	00:53:06,687	| IOT202 |	A lhasa
EDL	00:53:07,199	00:53:09,759	| IOT202 |	A civil lawsuit and that data is relevant
EDL	00:53:09,759	00:53:12,319	| IOT202 |	The same dispute in the last shooting that something that might have
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:14,623	| IOT202 |	What the judge whether it's relevant
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:17,439	| IOT202 |	But if you're a party and it's relevant
EDL	00:53:18,463	00:53:21,279	| IOT202 |	If it's under your control then you have to Fork it over
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:23,071	| IOT202 |	Often times with these
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:25,119	| IOT202 |	Internet of Things devices it might not be under
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:27,167	| IOT202 |	Control
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:31,007	| IOT202 |	Repository
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:33,055	| IOT202 |	And subpoenaed from there
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:35,359	| IOT202 |	And again just as if that party hat
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:35,871	| IOT202 |	Document
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:37,151	| IOT202 |	Just the fact that it's
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:39,455	| IOT202 |	Hard coded data doesn't
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:40,991	| IOT202 |	Mean that they don't have to
EDL	00:53:40,991	00:53:42,527	| IOT202 |	Turn it over if there's
EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:45,343	| IOT202 |	A subpoena or a court order that says that they should
EDL	00:53:45,855	00:53:47,135	| IOT202 |	To help resolve this dispute
EDL	00:53:47,647	00:53:49,439	| IOT202 |	So a good question
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:54,815	| IOT202 |	Would be what is the data retention policy going to be for these devices
EDL	00:53:54,815	00:53:57,375	| IOT202 |	How much of the stuff is going to live on for
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:53:59,679	| IOT202 |	Perpetuity is it going to be
EDL	00:53:59,679	00:54:01,471	| IOT202 |	Various Emeril so that
EDL	00:54:01,471	00:54:02,239	| IOT202 |	Can't be
EDL	00:54:02,751	00:54:05,311	| IOT202 |	Subpoenaed in used
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:07,615	| IOT202 |	Company by company what they decide their policies are
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:09,919	| IOT202 |	Obviously
EDL	00:54:09,919	00:54:12,223	| IOT202 |	The date is very lucrative so they have some
EDL	00:54:13,759	00:54:14,783	| IOT202 |	Hold on to it
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:15,295	| IOT202 |	But at the
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:18,111	| IOT202 |	Same time do they really want to be in the business of
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:21,695	| IOT202 |	Having to Fork over data to feel people's
EDL	00:54:21,695	00:54:23,231	| IOT202 |	Lawsuits another dispute
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:23,999	| IOT202 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:25,791	| IOT202 |	People, knock on the door
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:27,583	| IOT202 |	Company and say Hey you know we'd like to see
EDL	00:54:27,583	00:54:29,375	| IOT202 |	Information they don't have a court order
EDL	00:54:29,375	00:54:30,655	| IOT202 |	They don't
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:36,799	| IOT202 |	Have a subpoena I would hope that most companies policies would be walk right away
EDL	00:54:37,311	00:54:38,591	| IOT202 |	People's data event
EDL	00:54:38,591	00:54:40,127	| IOT202 |	A kind and less were
EDL	00:54:40,127	00:54:41,407	| IOT202 |	Ordered two
EDL	00:54:41,407	00:54:42,175	| IOT202 |	Bye
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:43,455	| IOT202 |	Due legal process
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:46,271	| IOT202 |	But you never know unless they're under various
EDL	00:54:46,783	00:54:48,063	| IOT202 |	Data protection regulation
EDL	00:54:48,575	00:54:50,111	| IOT202 |	To decide how they're going to respond to those
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:55,999	| IOT202 |	Got it well in there's also an interesting wrinkle there in that there are lots of products out there in the market
EDL	00:54:56,511	00:54:58,815	| IOT202 |	Scription plans for cloud storage of data
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:04,959	| IOT202 |	And the consumer in some cases may not if they don't pay for that plan have access to the data
EDL	00:55:05,471	00:55:07,263	| IOT202 |	The company might still retain it
EDL	00:55:07,263	00:55:07,775	| IOT202 |	Which
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:10,079	| IOT202 |	I don't even want to think about that
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:14,431	| IOT202 |	There's one other issue that your question raised and that is I talked about it
EDL	00:55:14,431	00:55:15,711	| IOT202 |	If you're a party to lawsuit
EDL	00:55:15,711	00:55:16,479	| IOT202 |	Irrelevant
EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:17,759	| IOT202 |	Under your control
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:19,551	| IOT202 |	You have to turn it over but
EDL	00:55:20,063	00:55:22,111	| IOT202 |	We talked about one way in which third parties can
EDL	00:55:22,111	00:55:22,879	| IOT202 |	Can be brought in
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:23,647	| IOT202 |	If the data
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:24,415	| IOT202 |	Resides with
EDL	00:55:24,415	00:55:25,183	| IOT202 |	The third party
EDL	00:55:25,183	00:55:29,279	| IOT202 |	What if your let's go back to your running by the murder scene with your Fitbit on
EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:30,559	| IOT202 |	Example
EDL	00:55:30,559	00:55:31,327	| IOT202 |	What is
EDL	00:55:31,327	00:55:33,375	| IOT202 |	The prosecutors there wanted
EDL	00:55:34,399	00:55:35,679	| IOT202 |	Have the data from
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:37,215	| IOT202 |	Your Fitbit
EDL	00:55:37,215	00:55:39,007	| IOT202 |	Because you were a witness
EDL	00:55:39,007	00:55:41,311	| IOT202 |	And they wanted to see how it impacted you
EDL	00:55:41,311	00:55:42,847	| IOT202 |	If you saw a
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:44,127	| IOT202 |	A mess
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:45,407	| IOT202 |	And if your heart rate
EDL	00:55:45,407	00:55:46,431	| IOT202 |	Spite
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:47,967	| IOT202 |	Your normal running heart rate
EDL	00:55:48,479	00:55:50,015	| IOT202 |	You saw some terrible
EDL	00:55:50,015	00:55:51,551	| IOT202 |	Event take place or not maybe
EDL	00:55:52,063	00:55:54,367	| IOT202 |	Chancellors would want to say
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:55,903	| IOT202 |	Is witness Ram by their heart rate
EDL	00:55:56,415	00:55:57,439	| IOT202 |	Stayed the same
EDL	00:55:57,439	00:55:58,207	| IOT202 |	So
EDL	00:55:58,719	00:56:00,767	| IOT202 |	I could see how you could be brought into a dispute
EDL	00:56:00,767	00:56:03,583	| IOT202 |	Or your device could even if you have
EDL	00:56:03,583	00:56:04,863	| IOT202 |	Very little to do with it
EDL	00:56:04,863	00:56:07,423	| IOT202 |	Just happened to be that you sent in the wrong place in the
EDL	00:56:07,423	00:56:08,191	| IOT202 |	Wrong time
EDL	00:56:08,191	00:56:11,519	| IOT202 |	Yes I'm going to hope I never run by a murderer as it's happening
EDL	00:56:11,519	00:56:12,543	| IOT202 |	For so many reasons
EDL	00:56:13,311	00:56:13,823	| IOT202 |	All right
EDL	00:56:19,199	00:56:22,015	| IOT202 |	They say the Internet of Things is today
EDL	00:56:22,015	00:56:24,319	| IOT202 |	I think it's this fact that
EDL	00:56:24,319	00:56:26,623	| IOT202 |	Security researchers think that these devices
EDL	00:56:26,623	00:56:27,903	| IOT202 |	In particularly like a sieve
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:29,951	| IOT202 |	And again analogizing back
EDL	00:56:29,951	00:56:31,743	| IOT202 |	Early days of
EDL	00:56:31,743	00:56:32,767	| IOT202 |	Other
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:33,535	| IOT202 |	Devices
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:34,303	| IOT202 |	Tibet
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:35,583	| IOT202 |	Are important in our lives
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:36,607	| IOT202 |	The early days of
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:37,631	| IOT202 |	Computers
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:39,167	| IOT202 |	Operating systems
EDL	00:56:39,167	00:56:40,703	| IOT202 |	Windows operating systems
EDL	00:56:41,215	00:56:47,103	| IOT202 |	Also according to security researchers and demonstrably according to events that happened
EDL	00:56:47,103	00:56:49,407	| IOT202 |	Leaks like a sieve ultimately
EDL	00:56:49,407	00:56:50,431	| IOT202 |	The
EDL	00:56:50,431	00:56:53,247	| IOT202 |	Operating system manufacturers got on top of
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:54,783	| IOT202 |	Is that issue and
EDL	00:56:54,783	00:56:55,551	| IOT202 |	Got
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:57,855	| IOT202 |	Somewhat ahead of the cat and mouse game
EDL	00:56:58,367	00:56:59,647	| IOT202 |	People trying to compromise
EDL	00:56:59,647	00:57:00,415	| IOT202 |	Advice
EDL	00:57:00,415	00:57:01,183	| IOT202 |	And
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:02,207	| IOT202 |	Attached devices
EDL	00:57:02,719	00:57:04,255	| IOT202 |	And took care of
EDL	00:57:04,767	00:57:08,351	| IOT202 |	The public using their tools and I think that that's the
EDL	00:57:08,351	00:57:08,863	| IOT202 |	The problem that we
EDL	00:57:10,143	00:57:11,679	| IOT202 |	With the Internet of Things
EDL	00:57:11,679	00:57:12,447	| IOT202 |	Sort of
EDL	00:57:12,447	00:57:15,263	| IOT202 |	Idot phase in development where it's still
EDL	00:57:15,263	00:57:16,799	| IOT202 |	Kind of wide open
EDL	00:57:16,799	00:57:18,335	| IOT202 |	Things aren't being passed
EDL	00:57:18,335	00:57:19,871	| IOT202 |	Not only are they not being
EDL	00:57:21,407	00:57:24,479	| IOT202 |	Released in an insecure way to begin with
EDL	00:57:26,015	00:57:28,063	| IOT202 |	Even just without even being hacked
EDL	00:57:28,575	00:57:31,135	| IOT202 |	There just something that leaks data and
EDL	00:57:31,647	00:57:33,183	| IOT202 |	Sense data around in
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:33,951	| IOT202 |	Wasted
EDL	00:57:33,951	00:57:34,719	| IOT202 |	They shouldn't
EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:35,999	| IOT202 |	Expect
EDL	00:57:36,511	00:57:38,559	| IOT202 |	Is unreasonable so that I think is
EDL	00:57:39,071	00:57:42,143	| IOT202 |	This problem that we're facing right now and I think it will take awhile and
