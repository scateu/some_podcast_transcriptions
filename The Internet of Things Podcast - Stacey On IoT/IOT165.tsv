EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:55,712	| IOT165 |	Are you ready I am super hyped because I am in California
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,760	| IOT165 |	It's very early in the morning but
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:01,856	| IOT165 |	I believe it of the show it's only been going on for half a day and I've already gotten
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,160	| IOT165 |	That's a great information and data
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:04,928	| IOT165 |	And
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,720	| IOT165 |	I am really angry angry
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,000	| IOT165 |	Pyside
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,536	| IOT165 |	So far
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,328	| IOT165 |	Big topic is
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| IOT165 |	Hey
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:15,424	| IOT165 |	We're kind of not going as fast as we thought because
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,192	| IOT165 |	People are
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,216	| IOT165 |	Flying into this in
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,264	| IOT165 |	Hidden among this is
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:23,360	| IOT165 |	Value proposition for users expense
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,896	| IOT165 |	The big thing is
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,432	| IOT165 |	Probability
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,200	| IOT165 |	Nothing
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:29,248	| IOT165 |	It's hard for them to figure out
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:29,760	| IOT165 |	Works with what
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT165 |	They're talking
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,088	| IOT165 |	About this at the show
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| IOT165 |	It's this mystery force
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:39,232	| IOT165 |	Like not every single one of them has had
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,536	| IOT165 |	A goal of creating their own platform
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,328	| IOT165 |	You're ready to give that up
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,864	| IOT165 |	Actually work for Sammy's
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,888	| IOT165 |	Spell standards
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:49,216	| IOT165 |	That's the thing aren't these the people that are creating this industry
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:54,080	| IOT165 |	And they have created this mess themselves by trying to do it all internally
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,360	| IOT165 |	In their own brands
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:55,872	| IOT165 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,920	| IOT165 |	Yes that is true
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,432	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:03,552	| IOT165 |	I will not harp on this too much because we all know it's frustrating that are devices don't
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,648	| IOT165 |	Work together in
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:08,928	| IOT165 |	But
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,488	| IOT165 |	The first panel of the event officially
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,792	| IOT165 |	What is a bunch of guys who
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:15,840	| IOT165 |	Came up from Cox from ATT
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,144	| IOT165 |	There's someone from Vivint the result
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,680	| IOT165 |	August and someone from the beta store
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,984	| IOT165 |	Basically talked about
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,008	| IOT165 |	Interoperability
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,288	| IOT165 |	Yeah like it's hard
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| IOT165 |	And it is hot
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,336	| IOT165 |	But it doesn't
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| IOT165 |	I have to be hard
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:33,504	| IOT165 |	You know this is something obviously we've been harping on for a long long time and I don't see it getting any better soon
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,040	| IOT165 |	Partially because
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,576	| IOT165 |	This industry has
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| IOT165 |	Gained momentum
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:41,440	| IOT165 |	Without the interoperability and yes interoperability would certainly
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:47,584	| IOT165 |	Pellet further faster but that may mean that people might have to replace devices hubs switches
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,656	| IOT165 |	So here's my
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,936	| IOT165 |	Does Hawaii have
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,264	| IOT165 |	In this is something I don't know if it's actually going to happen but
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,824	| IOT165 |	I've actually talked to two companies recently that are
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,920	| IOT165 |	In trying to implement OCS standards
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| IOT165 |	These are data schema score
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,832	| IOT165 |	Different devices so basically think of a data scheme
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| IOT165 |	You can
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,416	| IOT165 |	Automatically generate that
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,976	| IOT165 |	From their stuff and this is the open connectivity
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,744	| IOT165 |	Foundation this is
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,791	| IOT165 |	You should be Intel's group and then
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,631	| IOT165 |	Maybe that's going to happen
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,703	| IOT165 |	I thought that was going to happen in 2016 but they didn't come out with
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,751	| IOT165 |	Good reference back but now that's
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,519	| IOT165 |	Stout
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:31,359	| IOT165 |	I don't know that's really kind of my only hope invoice is not my only
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,151	| IOT165 |	I'm sorry people who feel like
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,967	| IOT165 |	Chernobyl
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,015	| IOT165 |	Yeah they do it all the time
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:45,183	| IOT165 |	Your voice voices of user interface it's not the back and that's the thing and people kind of confused
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| IOT165 |	Potoo
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:52,351	| IOT165 |	I mean voice is just a way to interact with your devices but it doesn't help necessarily the devices interact together need back answer
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,423	| IOT165 |	Nervous system made that happen standards Etc so
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,495	| IOT165 |	I'm glad people are realizing my voice is not the answer
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:05,407	| IOT165 |	Interesting label two points coming out a little bit and the challenges of it
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,687	| IOT165 |	Voicemail
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:12,575	| IOT165 |	Listen to voicemail this week later in the show so they just highlights the challenge right there and also
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,855	| IOT165 |	This is almost like
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,207	| IOT165 |	We can talk about using matches well but this almost reminds me of the whole ezmatch thing we talked about last week
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:24,095	| IOT165 |	So what is the incentive for these companies to work with other products it makes more sense
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:28,447	| IOT165 |	With a device as opposed to the router guys because the router people have their own
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,263	| IOT165 |	Things that work their routers work today
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,287	| IOT165 |	Interbrand
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,335	| IOT165 |	They don't want or need
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:37,407	| IOT165 |	To work with other brands even though consumers would benefit from that
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,455	| IOT165 |	The device side again
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:43,551	| IOT165 |	So much of this is already rolled out so this should have been done already
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,463	| IOT165 |	Now I will say and I'm going to write something up about this
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,231	| IOT165 |	Spell so happy
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,999	| IOT165 |	Mark Spitz who
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,279	| IOT165 |	In charge of Google
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,887	| IOT165 |	Did Speaker business and that means Google home in the Google Max speaker
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,191	| IOT165 |	He was talking about AI
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,519	| IOT165 |	Products in what was really kind of
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,055	| IOT165 |	Compelling and interesting is he
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,335	| IOT165 |	What about the levels of
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:10,431	| IOT165 |	Since you needed to deliver certain AI experiences and can we talk about this
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,479	| IOT165 |	Be more intuitive
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| IOT165 |	So he was saying
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,551	| IOT165 |	If you want a curated experience
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,111	| IOT165 |	You have like a 70%
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,623	| IOT165 |	Confidence interval
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:23,231	| IOT165 |	Hey this person seems to like this type of music
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,743	| IOT165 |	Let me just play
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,791	| IOT165 |	It's highly likely that that's going to
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,583	| IOT165 |	Right
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:28,863	| IOT165 |	Do you want a corrective mod
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,655	| IOT165 |	So something where they
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,447	| IOT165 |	Think of a motion sensor
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,495	| IOT165 |	Sitting to Silver
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,311	| IOT165 |	It's okay when that have
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:41,663	| IOT165 |	Just a little irritating you got to wave your arms around but it's not the consequences
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,431	| IOT165 |	Not too huge
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:44,223	| IOT165 |	For that you need to be 85
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:45,759	| IOT165 |	That you're going to get
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:50,879	| IOT165 |	And then predicted which is where we kind of want to go is you have to have a
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:55,231	| IOT165 |	Confidence level of like five 9 to be able to deliver this experience
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,815	| IOT165 |	Because otherwise you're going to get clippy their real-world consequences for
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| IOT165 |	Like money make change hands
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,167	| IOT165 |	Smart assistant
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| IOT165 |	Hey I think
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:07,263	| IOT165 |	These signals all result in Stacy going to
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:07,775	| IOT165 |	The airport
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,823	| IOT165 |	What she always does
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,847	| IOT165 |	Let me just send that
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,895	| IOT165 |	How to do those kind of things
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,175	| IOT165 |	Probably need to be
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:14,687	| IOT165 |	User
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:15,967	| IOT165 |	Supposed to add
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT165 |	Quite some time
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:23,135	| IOT165 |	I thought that was really interesting it's good food for thought for you guys as you starting to build you know
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,671	| IOT165 |	AI products in
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,231	| IOT165 |	I'd be curious to hear what y'all
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,279	| IOT165 |	And that is all
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,815	| IOT165 |	All I've done so far
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,583	| IOT165 |	Fox Home Center
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:35,167	| IOT165 |	I'm sure I'll talk about it next weekend I'm sure you'll see more in this week's newsletter
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| IOT165 |	So now onto
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,263	| IOT165 |	Anime which is what we call
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:43,103	| IOT165 |	Amazon's personal assistant Just So to avoid setting off all of your devices
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,639	| IOT165 |	So she's got some new
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:52,575	| IOT165 |	Cheetahs and this is a talent that Google Assistant doesn't have is beyond me and you'll understand
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,343	| IOT165 |	Second Sole
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:58,975	| IOT165 |	What happened this week is Amazon announced their Madam a smart scheduling assistant
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:05,887	| IOT165 |	And what you can do now is ask Madame a to schedule a meeting with one of your contacts and she will actually check
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,911	| IOT165 |	Check and see
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:10,495	| IOT165 |	When you to have time available which is awesome
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:15,871	| IOT165 |	So I could say Madam a schedule a meeting with Stacy and matinee would say you would say Siri available from
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,919	| IOT165 |	3 p.m. today
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:24,063	| IOT165 |	5 to 7 p.m. on Friday what day and time should I schedule social actually check and then ask you
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| IOT165 |	You didn't respond the time
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:30,463	| IOT165 |	You can give her the name of the event and she will schedule it and she'll send an invite
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,767	| IOT165 |	Email invoice to
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,791	| IOT165 |	The other party
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:38,655	| IOT165 |	If you already know the time you can just schedule the meeting with that person at a set time
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| IOT165 |	And she will still check
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,007	| IOT165 |	To see if there's availability and
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,799	| IOT165 |	Will say if there's a
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,567	| IOT165 |	Conflict or something
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| IOT165 |	So that's kind of nice
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:51,711	| IOT165 |	This is already out there for Amazon's madhumeh for business accounts
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:55,039	| IOT165 |	But it also is available for consumers as well
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| IOT165 |	And it works with links
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:00,159	| IOT165 |	Calendars from a mixture have it right Gmail
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| IOT165 |	G Suite
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:07,327	| IOT165 |	Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Office exchange 2013 or better so
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:12,703	| IOT165 |	Again this is one of those things that I'm like this with my Google Calendar but it doesn't work with my Google home
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,031	| IOT165 |	Either way I think it's an awesome use of voice
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,799	| IOT165 |	Assistance
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:19,359	| IOT165 |	Both parties have to have their calendars huh
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:19,871	| IOT165 |	Hooked up to
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:27,295	| IOT165 |	That is correct you actually have to add either your work or your personal contacts to the matinee app
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,599	| IOT165 |	And some of mine are already in there like you are
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,135	| IOT165 |	Because
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,159	| IOT165 |	Talked
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT165 |	The drop in
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,023	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,303	| IOT165 |	This is awesome
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,583	| IOT165 |	This is Mike this could
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,399	| IOT165 |	So much relief
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,191	| IOT165 |	Cuz half of my life is scheduling
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:44,959	| IOT165 |	Meetings I swear
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,287	| IOT165 |	So now everybody who wants to be with me
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| IOT165 |	Man put your calendar on
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,127	| IOT165 |	Yeah please
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:57,247	| IOT165 |	You know what's really nice because managing these events also can be a time-consuming thing
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:02,367	| IOT165 |	You can actually say Madam a move my 9 a.m. meeting and change the time
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,743	| IOT165 |	It's like magic
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,047	| IOT165 |	Okay this is where we're going
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:10,815	| IOT165 |	So exciting
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,839	| IOT165 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| IOT165 |	Is
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,167	| IOT165 |	Amazon the ACLU
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:18,751	| IOT165 |	Put out some data that Amazon is selling facial recognition.
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| IOT165 |	Technology to police depart
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT165 |	Which
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,871	| IOT165 |	Is upsetting because
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,407	| IOT165 |	Give me clear signal to the world
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:30,527	| IOT165 |	Hey we have all this camera dude is picking up our faces we have the ability to recognize
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,551	| IOT165 |	In
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,087	| IOT165 |	Now we can sell it to a lot of horse
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,879	| IOT165 |	I feel like the story
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,671	| IOT165 |	It's not overblown
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,999	| IOT165 |	Exactly it's a great example of everything that Kevin and I
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,303	| IOT165 |	Talk about in the abstract so I think it's important
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:42,815	| IOT165 |	Forgot birthday
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:47,167	| IOT165 |	But it's also important to know that what Amazon is selling is
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,959	| IOT165 |	The recognition and that's a recognition
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| IOT165 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,287	| IOT165 |	Facial recognition
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| IOT165 |	This is not taking
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:58,687	| IOT165 |	Verdi. This is applying their recognition to
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| IOT165 |	Cool to
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,479	| IOT165 |	Cops
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,015	| IOT165 |	Data
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,319	| IOT165 |	I say this because a lot of us are freaking out
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,111	| IOT165 |	Because Amazon sells
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,647	| IOT165 |	Because of the blank acquisition
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,415	| IOT165 |	Cameras
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,183	| IOT165 |	And they have her
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,999	| IOT165 |	They still sell this but the Amazon Echo look
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,559	| IOT165 |	Which takes images of yuan
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,839	| IOT165 |	Cool outfits
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,375	| IOT165 |	Person tells you how to be more stylish
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,143	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,935	| IOT165 |	Big data Amazon
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,983	| IOT165 |	Reply it's facial Ricky
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,263	| IOT165 |	You should stop to that
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,799	| IOT165 |	For all I know it does
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,591	| IOT165 |	Question to ask
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,615	| IOT165 |	But they're not selling your
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,199	| IOT165 |	Which I think is in a
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:38,623	| IOT165 |	It's a huge distinction as a consumer I'm not overly concerned that my cameras are using facial recognition
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:44,511	| IOT165 |	Mission sending out that data to third parties this is dated at the law enforcement agencies I think
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:50,911	| IOT165 |	Particularly sperm ACLU standpoint Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon is using it that mean
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:53,215	| IOT165 |	Had a database of mugshots and other
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:58,079	| IOT165 |	Things to cross-reference faces so they were using facial recognition on the day that they have
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,895	| IOT165 |	Not scanning webcams for
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,687	| IOT165 |	People which is very different you're right
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,199	| IOT165 |	Aunt
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,479	| IOT165 |	Now
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| IOT165 |	Just two
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,551	| IOT165 |	Put this into like hey the future is coming
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,599	| IOT165 |	Apply this with ring
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,623	| IOT165 |	The ring doorbell
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,903	| IOT165 |	The neighbors app
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,183	| IOT165 |	So Amazon now
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,975	| IOT165 |	They've got the neighbors out
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,535	| IOT165 |	This is actually your ring doorbell data
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,303	| IOT165 |	Going
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:18,815	| IOT165 |	2
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,631	| IOT165 |	The police if there is an open
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| IOT165 |	Case File
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,679	| IOT165 |	So the police
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,727	| IOT165 |	File to get some data from
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:30,335	| IOT165 |	They have a case they can actually get dataforma neighborhoods ring doorbells
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| IOT165 |	And from there they have
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,663	| IOT165 |	Facial data
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,455	| IOT165 |	From your smart home stuff
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,247	| IOT165 |	Which then the police if they
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,319	| IOT165 |	We had recognition any number of services that are similar
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,343	| IOT165 |	Other vendors
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,391	| IOT165 |	They could actually
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:46,207	| IOT165 |	Find a perpetrator or maybe find someone who's innocent
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,255	| IOT165 |	Just is in the wrong place
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:49,791	| IOT165 |	So that is something to say
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:55,935	| IOT165 |	Stop being a little paranoid and then we have to think about the ramifications of putting
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,727	| IOT165 |	Cameras everywhere
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:00,799	| IOT165 |	When we also have access to really good facial
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,567	| IOT165 |	Recognition
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,127	| IOT165 |	And I don't think we've actually talked about that
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,943	| IOT165 |	Societal level noretta regulatory
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| IOT165 |	Maybe we should
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,015	| IOT165 |	I think we should
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| IOT165 |	All right
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| IOT165 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| IOT165 |	Easy mesh
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| IOT165 |	The cracks are already showing
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:23,327	| IOT165 |	PS so we talked about using match last week and just to recap this is the Wi-Fi Alliance standard
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,095	| IOT165 |	That
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:27,167	| IOT165 |	Will allow interoperability there's that word again
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| IOT165 |	Of mesh
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,519	| IOT165 |	Networking routers and access points from different
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:37,919	| IOT165 |	Bender so instead of today you can buy all Orbeez are all those are all Google I-5 whatever maybe
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,479	| IOT165 |	In the future you may be able to mix and match
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,527	| IOT165 |	And I had said
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:47,647	| IOT165 |	I don't see any incentive for these router makers to really adopt this and packets disincentive
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| IOT165 |	But that was my thoughts
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:52,511	| IOT165 |	Sure nuff Fast Company reached out to several router makers
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:55,071	| IOT165 |	At some of these are Wi-Fi on its members
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,911	| IOT165 |	They say they are not rushing on interoperability
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:05,311	| IOT165 |	And in fact an executive at Qualcomm which makes the chips inside these router as an access point Express skepticism
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| IOT165 |	Non-coding now
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:08,639	| IOT165 |	But the current standard will bring down prices or aloud
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:13,759	| IOT165 |	Competing systems to work together so even the folks who helped devise the standard
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,063	| IOT165 |	I'm in the alliance are like
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,831	| IOT165 |	I don't really think so
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,623	| IOT165 |	I just got to
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,135	| IOT165 |	Too fast
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:22,207	| IOT165 |	Yes I need the Wi-Fi Alliance was behind the ball on this
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,279	| IOT165 |	Finishing the hat and now they have
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| IOT165 |	No reason
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,071	| IOT165 |	The standard
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,583	| IOT165 |	So maybe
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| IOT165 |	All right
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,447	| IOT165 |	Titus Comcast
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:36,031	| IOT165 |	It's part of their xfinitywifi
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,359	| IOT165 |	These are not the actual pods manufactured by
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:45,503	| IOT165 |	There going to be a 6 pack of these
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,295	| IOT165 |	Hi switch basically you plug in
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,391	| IOT165 |	Apartment
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,927	| IOT165 |	Where you have poor connectivity
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,999	| IOT165 |	Six-pack Acosta
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:59,583	| IOT165 |	199 which is cheaper than the plural version
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,631	| IOT165 |	Comcast is ginormous
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,655	| IOT165 |	And
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:06,495	| IOT165 |	I try these out I thought they were good they did suffer
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,263	| IOT165 |	Prince of the sea
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,031	| IOT165 |	Speed test

EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,615	| IOT165 |	And that's because
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| IOT165 |	Their focus is on
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,407	| IOT165 |	Average
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,687	| IOT165 |	Fixing
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,967	| IOT165 |	Issues
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,759	| IOT165 |	I think we're going to be moving for me
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,039	| IOT165 |	Hefei
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,855	| IOT165 |	Lasted in a small radius kind of
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,135	| IOT165 |	Check the speed
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,415	| IOT165 |	World 2
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,183	| IOT165 |	Hey
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,231	| IOT165 |	Can I get decent coverage everywhere.
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,559	| IOT165 |	My house doesn't have to be the fastest because how many people are really
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:33,119	| IOT165 |	How many devices are really going to use a Kegerator 300
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,143	| IOT165 |	4 seconds
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| IOT165 |	Really probably just
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,543	| IOT165 |	And you should really hardwired
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| IOT165 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| IOT165 |	So that's the
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,151	| IOT165 |	Cast news
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,175	| IOT165 |	All part of Comcast
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,967	| IOT165 |	Wi-Fi is super in
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:49,759	| IOT165 |	Our plans
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,271	| IOT165 |	As a broadband
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:53,599	| IOT165 |	And without good WiFi you can't do anything
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,647	| IOT165 |	They can't sell their Smart Homes
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,159	| IOT165 |	Services
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,975	| IOT165 |	Chandelure good Internet Explorer
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:05,119	| IOT165 |	These are really smart because they don't have to send a tech out they just send out this tiny little device that you plug into an outlet
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,679	| IOT165 |	Your wife I magically gets better
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,239	| IOT165 |	Stop assuming that you were using your car
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:10,751	| IOT165 |	Comcast Supply
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| IOT165 |	Modem

EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,615	| IOT165 |	$11
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,663	| IOT165 |	Craziness
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,431	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,223	| IOT165 |	This is giving you value for that
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,831	| IOT165 |	Can you be
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,879	| IOT165 |	Nope sorry you can't tell me I'm using their router
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,159	| IOT165 |	That's okay
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,671	| IOT165 |	I'm not trying
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:32,767	| IOT165 |	That's all that
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:40,447	| IOT165 |	Yeah little bit of iot maker news now in the Maker Faire Bay Area event
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:43,775	| IOT165 |	The Arduino folks announce to new iot boards
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,847	| IOT165 |	Stacy you're a chip girl you're going to love the first
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:50,175	| IOT165 |	Is the mkr Vidor 4000
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:56,319	| IOT165 |	And it just the first Arduino board based on an fpga chip or field programmable gate array chip
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,599	| IOT165 |	You're excited aren't you
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,647	| IOT165 |	That
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,671	| IOT165 |	Is amazing
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| IOT165 |	And we want to say why it's so amazing
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:06,047	| IOT165 |	I really love to hear you I would love to hear you say why
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,863	| IOT165 |	Oh my gosh this is time it is something that I actually want to write about
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,887	| IOT165 |	Which is
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:13,215	| IOT165 |	We're entering the Sarah ship customization
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,263	| IOT165 |	And it could be through fpga
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| IOT165 |	Architecture
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,895	| IOT165 |	But what's happening is Ashley at
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,663	| IOT165 |	Computing to everything
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,967	| IOT165 |	We no longer have these
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,503	| IOT165 |	Call Nautilus
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT165 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:27,551	| IOT165 |	PC
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,087	| IOT165 |	Server
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,855	| IOT165 |	It will still happen
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,159	| IOT165 |	So we have this additional
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,671	| IOT165 |	Market
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,207	| IOT165 |	Or chips that
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,767	| IOT165 |	Optimized to do something very specific
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:40,351	| IOT165 |	So maybe it is to be very good
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:40,863	| IOT165 |	Empowering
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,399	| IOT165 |	Water sensor
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,167	| IOT165 |	Or
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,447	| IOT165 |	To be powering
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,983	| IOT165 |	Camera
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,751	| IOT165 |	Recognition
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,263	| IOT165 |	Retail store
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,079	| IOT165 |	So you're going to get a lot of these more
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:50,591	| IOT165 |	Customize
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,407	| IOT165 |	Scale-out
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,175	| IOT165 |	The production of
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,991	| IOT165 |	Alien ships that you
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:57,759	| IOT165 |	We need to do it
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,039	| IOT165 |	Traditional chip pan
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| IOT165 |	Manufacturing
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,599	| IOT165 |	Process
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,111	| IOT165 |	Programmable
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,647	| IOT165 |	Or adaptive
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,927	| IOT165 |	Economic
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| IOT165 |	So that's what the fpgas are
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:08,767	| IOT165 |	That's right
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,095	| IOT165 |	Yeah he's awesome a lot of what you describe is
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:15,935	| IOT165 |	What I would call like an Asic or an application-specific integrated circuit
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,703	| IOT165 |	Annette
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:23,103	| IOT165 |	Just like a Bitcoin miner uses an Asic it's at that chipped as one thing and one thing only in it mines Bitcoin
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:26,687	| IOT165 |	You should say yes these are changeable on the fly in the
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,711	| IOT165 |	Reason for that
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,479	| IOT165 |	I was like
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,527	| IOT165 |	I didn't talk about an AI
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:36,671	| IOT165 |	The reason for that is because the jobs are going to be doing the AI job search
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,279	| IOT165 |	Spot on
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,071	| IOT165 |	So I thought you would like this board
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,351	| IOT165 |	This looks
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:50,751	| IOT165 |	A lot like a Raspberry Pi board like if you're familiar with the large Arduino boards and it's got Wi-Fi built in and different ports and so
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:54,335	| IOT165 |	Salon I don't have a price on that I think it's going to be available next month
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,127	| IOT165 |	So we'll see what happens
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,431	| IOT165 |	And then if you need a really small
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:04,831	| IOT165 |	New Arduino board Wi-Fi revision to which I mean it looks like she's half a board almost looks like
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,903	| IOT165 |	Memory module inside a computer for crying out has a really small
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:13,023	| IOT165 |	And that has like just a miniscule amount like 6K of ram 48k of Flash
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| IOT165 |	And that's what microchip
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,143	| IOT165 |	Yeah this is really freezing
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,423	| IOT165 |	Cloud-based
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:24,287	| IOT165 |	Iot devices that they say it will work with AWS and Google Cloud for example so
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,847	| IOT165 |	That also comes out next month so we'll see on pricing
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,895	| IOT165 |	Okay I'm going to let you guys know that I'm
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,663	| IOT165 |	Hotel
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,967	| IOT165 |	And it's starting to get a little noisy
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,039	| IOT165 |	703 distance
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:35,551	| IOT165 |	Ignore the background
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,415	| IOT165 |	Yay do Arduino
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT165 |	A company called eco
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,279	| IOT165 |	Million dollars
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:51,423	| IOT165 |	And Nico is a really interesting company to me because they make a light switch but they've optimize their sales
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| IOT165 |	The builders
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,775	| IOT165 |	So what happens is it's for new construction
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:59,103	| IOT165 |	You go in and you say hey this is exactly how many light switches
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,943	| IOT165 |	And you say what rooms are and everything like that is
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,711	| IOT165 |	Builder
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,991	| IOT165 |	You send it to decal
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,759	| IOT165 |	And they said
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,295	| IOT165 |	Send you a package that is like
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,575	| IOT165 |	No brainer install
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,111	| IOT165 |	Disguise
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,647	| IOT165 |	He put it in the right room
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,671	| IOT165 |	It's got the right
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,207	| IOT165 |	Intelligence associated with
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,743	| IOT165 |	Nothing has to be
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,255	| IOT165 |	Programmed
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| IOT165 |	Without
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:21,887	| IOT165 |	Any work
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| IOT165 |	I do all the work on the
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:29,311	| IOT165 |	So there's no configuration by the consumer which is nice to one aspect because they don't have to mess around with it
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:32,639	| IOT165 |	So it's going to come with different scenes and so on pre-configured
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,943	| IOT165 |	Does that mean you can't change them in the future
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,271	| IOT165 |	Okay that's good
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,295	| IOT165 |	Guy ideas to make
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:39,807	| IOT165 |	Make it as easy as pie
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,087	| IOT165 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,879	| IOT165 |	So it's kind of like the new lights
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,183	| IOT165 |	Except those are a retrofit option
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,999	| IOT165 |	Channel established
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,791	| IOT165 |	So with the new lights
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,583	| IOT165 |	You can buy them you install them
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,655	| IOT165 |	They have these programs being so you should never have to do it
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,775	| IOT165 |	Right if I recall correctly the decode lighting system
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:05,407	| IOT165 |	Is capable matamata on Google home already
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,175	| IOT165 |	And Google assist
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,223	| IOT165 |	You can add those
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,247	| IOT165 |	Don't worry
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,271	| IOT165 |	All right
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,575	| IOT165 |	Let's go to next
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:15,391	| IOT165 |	Next little bit of news ala who is in iot
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:20,512	| IOT165 |	So companies like Hunter Fans I feel like there's some Appliance manufacturers in there
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,072	| IOT165 |	When they want to build a Knex product
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,352	| IOT165 |	Famous cloud
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:28,448	| IOT165 |	Play pop it in and all their data goes to Eli Eli manages the device data
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,728	| IOT165 |	It managed everything for them
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:36,128	| IOT165 |	So they now have a dad
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,408	| IOT165 |	Google
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,688	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:43,552	| IOT165 |	Yeah and this is actually worth noting because Google doesn't have a great device management
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:49,952	| IOT165 |	They've got lovely insides and pitiful but they don't actually
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,976	| IOT165 |	Deal with
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,768	| IOT165 |	Telemetry data as it is
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,072	| IOT165 |	So this is actually Win 4
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:55,584	| IOT165 |	Both
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:59,936	| IOT165 |	Because they said their customers
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,960	| IOT165 |	We want to know.
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,752	| IOT165 |	Stinger stuck on AWS
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,032	| IOT165 |	They don't have to
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,616	| IOT165 |	And speaking of Google Cloud
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:11,712	| IOT165 |	Evan is going to tell you about our latest iot project
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:13,248	| IOT165 |	Which is moving our voicemail platform
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,600	| IOT165 |	Yeah so we
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:24,000	| IOT165 |	Guilty party voicemail hotline using Python and twilio last year and we talked about
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:27,840	| IOT165 |	Put it on the cloud back then but me being a very very
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,888	| IOT165 |	Amateur developer
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:32,192	| IOT165 |	Work for so we put on a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,728	| IOT165 |	And that's worth
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:38,848	| IOT165 |	Mostly pretty well any issues after having been with a pie with a code it's been with
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:44,224	| IOT165 |	My dog pulling the power cord on the local Internet outages things like that
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,016	| IOT165 |	Outside of Genoa my control
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:52,672	| IOT165 |	So I started digging around and looking at different Cloud Solutions we could have gone AWS Google Cloud Azure whatever
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,256	| IOT165 |	But I already have a free account with
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,816	| IOT165 |	Google Cloud platform along with
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:04,704	| IOT165 |	$300 in credit and all that was good for a year and I highly recommend if you want to play with
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,984	| IOT165 |	Using the cloud
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:11,616	| IOT165 |	This is a great way to do it you can sign up for the free trial account and not paying anything
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,152	| IOT165 |	A year which is awesome
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:16,224	| IOT165 |	My years almost up but we still not going to pay anything because
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,504	| IOT165 |	AR
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:23,904	| IOT165 |	Voice mail server just barely uses any CPU cycles and not too much Network bandwidth it's only when you guys call in so
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,952	| IOT165 |	I mean calling you know anytime
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:32,352	| IOT165 |	We certainly got the van with the handle it decided to Google cloud and a post
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:34,144	| IOT165 |	Marty Explains It All
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:40,544	| IOT165 |	Basically I didn't have to change my single line of the Python code I just had to get it up on Google Cloud using there
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:45,664	| IOT165 |	Cloud console which is very easy to do and just add two other little files for configuration purposes
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,968	| IOT165 |	I also had to create a virtual machine
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:54,368	| IOT165 |	And you can choose the all really small virtual machine which is obvious that we did I mean it's literally 600 Meg of memory and
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,416	| IOT165 |	Just like one CPU core
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:01,280	| IOT165 |	But mean if you're on Netflix or somebody you obviously have hundreds and hundreds of cores
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:07,424	| IOT165 |	Tons of bandwidth that you needn't sound so the cloud makes a scalable that applies obviously to Google Cloud azure
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:10,752	| IOT165 |	AWS etcetera we probably won't ever have to scale this but it's good to know
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,336	| IOT165 |	In any case once I got all the files up there
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,128	| IOT165 |	Literally I just spun up the
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,176	| IOT165 |	Virtual machine and toilet to deploy
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,456	| IOT165 |	My app
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:25,856	| IOT165 |	And that was it and all I had to do after that because we use twilio and twilio needs to know when you guys call in on the
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,880	| IOT165 |	Trulia phone number
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:33,024	| IOT165 |	Where do I find code to do something with this information
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,072	| IOT165 |	URL
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:39,680	| IOT165 |	Configure Trulia wetsand naturally appoints to not the pie anymore but to Google Cloud
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:44,544	| IOT165 |	And that's it that whole thing was seamless you guys didn't even notice any transition because it just
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,312	| IOT165 |	Happened
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,104	| IOT165 |	And so far it's been working great
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,128	| IOT165 |	Yay
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,712	| IOT165 |	Thanks Kevin and he said we in there but it's really
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,552	| IOT165 |	I like to Tinker
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,576	| IOT165 |	I love it
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,600	| IOT165 |	Would you like to Tinker
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:58,624	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:24:59,904	| IOT165 |	Speaking

EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,600	| IOT165 |	And this week we have a voicemail from
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,368	| IOT165 |	White
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,672	| IOT165 |	Perfectly illustrates
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,976	| IOT165 |	All points that we have discussed so far
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,328	| IOT165 |	Hey Stacy and Kevin this is Dwight from Atlanta
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,888	| IOT165 |	Actually calling with a question
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:47,008	| IOT165 |	I want to know if there is a way that if there's a device that I
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,776	| IOT165 |	Use
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:54,176	| IOT165 |	Physically cut on my light bulbs I have a mixture of Hue Lights and
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:56,992	| IOT165 |	And I know that Hugh makes a product
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,528	| IOT165 |	That can allow you
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| IOT165 |	Toggle light switch off
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:03,392	| IOT165 |	But I was wondering if there was a device that works
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,976	| IOT165 |	Both lights anyways you can make that
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:11,584	| IOT165 |	If you know of a device that might be useful I would appreciate that thank you
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:14,656	| IOT165 |	This is a wonderful question
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,448	| IOT165 |	The state of the
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,496	| IOT165 |	You should
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:21,568	| IOT165 |	It's hard to answer your question exactly because we don't
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,336	| IOT165 |	Actually know what you
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,384	| IOT165 |	So we're going to run through a
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,152	| IOT165 |	Apple scenarios
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,224	| IOT165 |	The basic architecture is you're going to have
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:32,320	| IOT165 |	To run each of your lighting things through some kind of software
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,600	| IOT165 |	Hug
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| IOT165 |	And then run a button
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| IOT165 |	True that
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:39,232	| IOT165 |	So there's a couple ways you can do this first way
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,280	| IOT165 |	Is probably in the best ways probably
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,096	| IOT165 |	Kevin can tell you a little bit about that
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,888	| IOT165 |	Right so
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:52,288	| IOT165 |	If you have homekit the lifx all the lifx bulbs actually support homekit so you're good there and Phillips
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:58,688	| IOT165 |	She was only have the second generation Bridge you're good there what you could do that and maybe is look at one of the homekit button such as the new
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:00,736	| IOT165 |	Button from fibaro and you'll be all set
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:06,624	| IOT165 |	My lifx bulb is the only thing I have on homekit so I can type tested this but this should work
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,648	| IOT165 |	Again if you have Home Care
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,208	| IOT165 |	What if he doesn't have Home Care Stacy
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:14,304	| IOT165 |	So if your home can implementation doesn't work what you're going to have to do
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,352	| IOT165 |	Use smart
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,656	| IOT165 |	Don't have SmartThings
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,936	| IOT165 |	Proposition
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,728	| IOT165 |	Because you're going to have to buy the Hub
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:24,544	| IOT165 |	And her to probably going to have to buy something to act as your butt
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,080	| IOT165 |	And there are wide
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,848	| IOT165 |	Range
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,944	| IOT165 |	$30 buttons
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,736	| IOT165 |	Button to
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,016	| IOT165 |	Take these tiny little Z-Wave
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:37,344	| IOT165 |	So you'll hook up your lifx bulbs
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:39,136	| IOT165 |	3 SmartThings you hook up your
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,696	| IOT165 |	Free SmartThings
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| IOT165 |	Create
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,488	| IOT165 |	Recipe receipt
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,792	| IOT165 |	Little button press contact
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,840	| IOT165 |	And that
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,120	| IOT165 |	Is how you're going to be able to do that
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,448	| IOT165 |	Tennessee
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:59,360	| IOT165 |	The only thing I can think of on the wink Hub site even though it's not natively supported
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,896	| IOT165 |	The lifx bulbs I mean
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:07,040	| IOT165 |	Maybe using a third-party system like if this then that or you know me could work with wink at it should work with
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,344	| IOT165 |	As long as you have a button that would work with wink
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:18,560	| IOT165 |	Center operability issues
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,584	| IOT165 |	But that's how it work
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:25,216	| IOT165 |	Thank you to answer your question and everybody remember you can call five one two
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,240	| IOT165 |	6 to 3

EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:12,832	| IOT165 |	Awesome so last week we talked about how customers will
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:16,160	| IOT165 |	Use machineq to start measuring some aspect of their operations
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,696	| IOT165 |	But then they quickly
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,976	| IOT165 |	People try to add more
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,744	| IOT165 |	Can you offer an exam
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,304	| IOT165 |	For singing The Marketplace

EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:47,904	| IOT165 |	That's what they sell for that they might want to do predictive maintenance all the refrigerators as well
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:53,280	| IOT165 |	They come back machineq and say is another solution provider in your ecosystem they can sell for predictive maintenance
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,072	| IOT165 |	Portland only see you there
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:30:00,192	| IOT165 |	Terms of private Enterprises but an example of beat for what we did a Comcast cares day
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:02,240	| IOT165 |	We went to a local Garden Philadelphia
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:05,056	| IOT165 |	And they asked us for swelling monitor sensors
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,104	| IOT165 |	Freezing a partner bars called sensoterra
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:13,504	| IOT165 |	After they realize that we had network coverage in that area and they were able to monitor their soil monitor with that device to ask this with anything else
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:18,112	| IOT165 |	Air quality that might be used there which of course we happen to have decent labs
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:21,696	| IOT165 |	Another one of our solution providers and they installed a decent labs are monitored
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:25,024	| IOT165 |	They said for the indoor Greenhouse
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:28,352	| IOT165 |	Use cases we're also trying to measure temperature humidity as well
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:31,168	| IOT165 |	There something that can be used there we said yes we actually have
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,448	| IOT165 |	Our own device called the answer
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,984	| IOT165 |	Q Flex that can do that for you
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:40,384	| IOT165 |	In the market is while many users have a particular need for one iot solution that quickly come back once
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:46,784	| IOT165 |	Recognize what that's done for them and they're seeking additional services at scale quickly but having to go and do an RFP
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,832	| IOT165 |	Where to go down as particular Pilots
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:53,440	| IOT165 |	We talked about this picture customers interested in working with machineq worry

EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,160	| IOT165 |	I imagine so
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:31,488	| IOT165 |	This is a business that's tailor-made for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,280	| IOT165 |	I can think of my gosh predictive maintenance
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,048	| IOT165 |	Cats understanding
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:37,376	| IOT165 |	From a connected Appliance what's wrong see if the right parts on the truck
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,936	| IOT165 |	There's probably a million other things but can you talk about what
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,496	| IOT165 |	What you guys are doing here today
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,032	| IOT165 |	Will go into what you
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,056	| IOT165 |	Are thinking about doing
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:48,640	| IOT165 |	Yeah I mean you hit on some of the things that are happening today
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:51,200	| IOT165 |	Are Kenmore appliances that we sell our
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,736	| IOT165 |	Working web connected their smart Appliance
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,296	| IOT165 |	A lot of the appliances we work on for
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:59,904	| IOT165 |	Some other brands are also smart appliances so we're faced with those are we
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,184	| IOT165 |	See those everyday
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:04,000	| IOT165 |	We're able to use those Diagnostics to
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,536	| IOT165 |	Help solve the problem faster
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,304	| IOT165 |	For consumer
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:07,584	| IOT165 |	We also
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:10,144	| IOT165 |	Use technology to help our technicians
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,448	| IOT165 |	Turn the home solve problems faster
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:18,848	| IOT165 |	We do that by connecting that technician to an application to our effectively a tear to where they
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,128	| IOT165 |	They can call if they have a really tough
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:21,920	| IOT165 |	Situation in the field
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,968	| IOT165 |	Where they can send them live video then
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,504	| IOT165 |	Shenzhen pictures
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,576	| IOT165 |	We can send them back schematics to a product so
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,600	| IOT165 |	We're seeing
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,880	| IOT165 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:34,208	| IOT165 |	We're working with those were also using technology to be
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,488	| IOT165 |	Faster smarter
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,768	| IOT165 |	And help our customers
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,536	| IOT165 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:43,936	| IOT165 |	It's actually something I talked about was Sears at CES you guys were actually bringing this concept of using video to help repair
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:47,776	| IOT165 |	Turn appliance that your texts are using today in to hopefully
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:50,080	| IOT165 |	The consumer home so like someone like me
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:53,152	| IOT165 |	Steals fairly confident and mucking about with the stuff my
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:53,920	| IOT165 |	Also have to chance
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:57,504	| IOT165 |	Yeah we're working on that we have a lot of customer
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:01,088	| IOT165 |	Merced do DIY which is great we serve those as well
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,624	| IOT165 |	And as you said
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,648	| IOT165 |	We use the technology
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,672	| IOT165 |	Today 4 Hour
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,208	| IOT165 |	Technicians it's it's sort of our
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,232	| IOT165 |	Proving Grounds For That
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,536	| IOT165 |	Technology but we absolutely right
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,304	| IOT165 |	In the process
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,584	| IOT165 |	The ruling that out
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:13,120	| IOT165 |	We've tested that
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,144	| IOT165 |	We're making some change
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,424	| IOT165 |	Just to wear that what we want to be able
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,192	| IOT165 |	Things to do is
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,984	| IOT165 |	Give that DIY customer
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:21,568	| IOT165 |	Are the ability to call us if they just need a little bit of help troubleshooting
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,080	| IOT165 |	Where they can
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,128	| IOT165 |	Using their phone which
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,664	| IOT165 |	Practically everyone has a smartphone
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,968	| IOT165 |	And show us
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,016	| IOT165 |	Exactly what they are seeing
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:30,528	| IOT165 |	And we can help them
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,808	| IOT165 |	I think that is so cool
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,344	| IOT165 |	I cannot wait for this to become
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,392	| IOT165 |	Actually do you think this would become
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,928	| IOT165 |	Standard in
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:37,952	| IOT165 |	The service world
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:41,280	| IOT165 |	I think it's possible that it can work very
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,560	| IOT165 |	Excited about it the cusp
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,328	| IOT165 |	Feedback
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,888	| IOT165 |	Been very positive you know in this day and age is everything
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:49,216	| IOT165 |	Comes more and more automated smart device
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,240	| IOT165 |	Applicable
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:50,752	| IOT165 |	I think
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,032	| IOT165 |	If it's
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:53,056	| IOT165 |	I think it's almost
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,360	| IOT165 |	Impossible for it not to be very common
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,128	| IOT165 |	Play sand
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:56,896	| IOT165 |	Future
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,432	| IOT165 |	In other areas where I am
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,040	| IOT165 |	Well you mentioned predictive
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,808	| IOT165 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,344	| IOT165 |	That's something that
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,624	| IOT165 |	You know the industry
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,904	| IOT165 |	Sears included
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,416	| IOT165 |	Is working
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,440	| IOT165 |	Whether it's
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:13,024	| IOT165 |	My group from a service perspective or are Kenmore
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:18,400	| IOT165 |	Team from a building those products and other competitors as well but that is the future I think of
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,960	| IOT165 |	Appliances for sure and more things in the
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:24,544	| IOT165 |	Many things in the home as you know are becoming smarter every day
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:27,104	| IOT165 |	We want to be able to get to a point
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:27,872	| IOT165 |	Where
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:31,200	| IOT165 |	I'll just use an example your refrigerator can tell us
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,224	| IOT165 |	In a proactive
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:35,040	| IOT165 |	Give way whether it needs a water filter change
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,576	| IOT165 |	Origin
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:42,976	| IOT165 |	Maybe it has a part that's going bad or is using more energy than it should that's an indication is that something is
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:48,096	| IOT165 |	Wrong with that client so that's what you know the industry's working toward their real working examples of that
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:52,192	| IOT165 |	Today where that information goes to a consumer app on their smartphone
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:55,264	| IOT165 |	But what we're working toward is where we can
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,288	| IOT165 |	Look at that from
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,312	| IOT165 |	Service perspective
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,336	| IOT165 |	Proactively
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,104	| IOT165 |	Contact the cost
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:00,896	| IOT165 |	And solve a problem before it
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:04,224	| IOT165 |	That means that their inconvenience level drops
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,272	| IOT165 |	Refrigerator
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,040	| IOT165 |	Cuz
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| IOT165 |	You know you have now you have
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,368	| IOT165 |	Food that can spoil and
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,392	| IOT165 |	That's not good for anyone
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:13,952	| IOT165 |	This is such a cool and compelling vision
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:16,768	| IOT165 |	As someone who's you know how to dryer breakdown
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,840	| IOT165 |	Right as I'm transferring my white clothes to it for example
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,656	| IOT165 |	Yes I lost refrigerator
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:27,008	| IOT165 |	How do you convince customers that you're doing this for their own good
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,800	| IOT165 |	And build trust because
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,848	| IOT165 |	There's also this sense of like
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,920	| IOT165 |	This is about to break down are you sure you just don't want to sell me another part
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,016	| IOT165 |	I think consumers today actually
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:41,600	| IOT165 |	Past that and understand that predictive maintenance
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,136	| IOT165 |	Part of life
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:45,952	| IOT165 |	As I mentioned before there are other
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:49,792	| IOT165 |	Devices in our lives today that are trying to be predicted
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,328	| IOT165 |	Some cars are trying
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:51,840	| IOT165 |	To be predicted
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,912	| IOT165 |	I mean if you think about it the check engine light from
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:57,216	| IOT165 |	50 years ago
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,240	| IOT165 |	Is an indicator that
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:01,312	| IOT165 |	Nothing is wrong with taking the check engine light to
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,616	| IOT165 |	A whole new level in this digital age
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:07,968	| IOT165 |	So I think consumers understand that it actually gives them an opportunity
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,248	| IOT165 |	Key to save money
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,296	| IOT165 |	From early detection
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:11,808	| IOT165 |	Versus
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:14,368	| IOT165 |	In a waiting and waiting when they may not know something
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,184	| IOT165 |	Problem creates additional costs
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:20,768	| IOT165 |	I think it's a positive for consumers I think it allows
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:27,168	| IOT165 |	Them to do things on their schedule versus the schedule of their Appliance if it breaks which it needs to be repaired
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:27,936	| IOT165 |	Now
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,984	| IOT165 |	Preventive maintenance they're going to have a window that they can
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,032	| IOT165 |	That's okay I think it's
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:32,800	| IOT165 |	Going to be
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,568	| IOT165 |	Very positive
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,616	| IOT165 |	Consumers when this becomes
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:36,896	| IOT165 |	Commonplace again
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:38,176	| IOT165 |	We and others have
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:38,944	| IOT165 |	These devices
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,736	| IOT165 |	Appliances in the marketplace now
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:43,296	| IOT165 |	It's making them the norm
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:45,088	| IOT165 |	And you know it'll take awhile but
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,624	| IOT165 |	Is there a lot of Legacy applying
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,648	| IOT165 |	Out there in Appliance last
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,208	| IOT165 |	But the changes everyday and
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,976	| IOT165 |	Percentage of
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,512	| IOT165 |	Smart appliances goes up
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,536	| IOT165 |	Literally every day
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,560	| IOT165 |	So it's
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,352	| IOT165 |	The future is exciting
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:59,424	| IOT165 |	You mentioned that you guys are working on this
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:01,472	| IOT165 |	What needs to happen for this to
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,240	| IOT165 |	Become
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:04,032	| IOT165 |	I guess common place or
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:04,800	| IOT165 |	Real
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,568	| IOT165 |	Well
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,360	| IOT165 |	Smart appliances are real today
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,384	| IOT165 |	They are
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,432	| IOT165 |	In consumer homes today
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,968	| IOT165 |	Connected to
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,992	| IOT165 |	The web
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,552	| IOT165 |	Connect to the cloud by a better way to say it
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,856	| IOT165 |	And customers are getting info
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,624	| IOT165 |	Information on there
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:21,184	| IOT165 |	Where I think there's a real opportunity is
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:23,744	| IOT165 |	Moving that to a proactive state
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:26,560	| IOT165 |	With a Service Company like ours
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,096	| IOT165 |	Where we can proactive
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,376	| IOT165 |	Contact
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:31,424	| IOT165 |	Customer maybe they missed the alert on the
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,192	| IOT165 |	Their phone
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:34,752	| IOT165 |	You know maybe they didn't Lodi Athena's there could be reason
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,288	| IOT165 |	They don't see that where we could help
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:37,824	| IOT165 |	Buy proactive
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:40,384	| IOT165 |	If we contacted them and I think what gets us there
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:41,920	| IOT165 |	It's time
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,736	| IOT165 |	Because we need more Ubiquiti
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,528	| IOT165 |	When I say we the industry
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,088	| IOT165 |	Needs more ubiquity of smart
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:49,600	| IOT165 |	Appliances
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,136	| IOT165 |	And that's happening
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,416	| IOT165 |	Just the way you know
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:55,488	| IOT165 |	Color TVs eventually overtook black and white teeth
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,768	| IOT165 |	It takes time for those
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:59,072	| IOT165 |	Things to be replaced
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,608	| IOT165 |	But that's part of
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,888	| IOT165 |	The evolution of
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:02,400	| IOT165 |	Smart Appliance
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,216	| IOT165 |	All right and let's go to one of my
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:08,288	| IOT165 |	What are the topics I've been most eager to hear about which is
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:10,592	| IOT165 |	Wally home Sears bought this a while back
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:11,616	| IOT165 |	And
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,920	| IOT165 |	It kind of went under the radar so
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:15,200	| IOT165 |	What are you guys doing with Wally
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:17,504	| IOT165 |	So yeah well he's a very exciting
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,296	| IOT165 |	Product anyone I came onboard
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,088	| IOT165 |	Sears giving my
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:22,368	| IOT165 |	Comcast background check
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,160	| IOT165 |	You know you're very smelly wet
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:27,488	| IOT165 |	We move that business into Sears Home Services
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:28,768	| IOT165 |	I've spent
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,584	| IOT165 |	Years of my life in the iot space
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,400	| IOT165 |	But it's a very exciting product
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:36,448	| IOT165 |	See all the product itself I believe
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,728	| IOT165 |	What's the best in the industry
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:39,264	| IOT165 |	Between the water sensors
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,288	| IOT165 |	Are hogs
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,080	| IOT165 |	The water valve itself
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,872	| IOT165 |	You know I have all of this in my house and
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,896	| IOT165 |	I feel protected
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,200	| IOT165 |	From a water leak
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:49,760	| IOT165 |	Water damage is one of the highest
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:51,040	| IOT165 |	Repair door
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:52,576	| IOT165 |	I guess damage claims
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,600	| IOT165 |	Industry
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:40:01,280	| IOT165 |	Because usually when those things happen it's hours before you know if you're at work
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:05,376	| IOT165 |	It's pumping water all day so we protect Palms from that
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,424	| IOT165 |	Again I feel very protective
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,960	| IOT165 |	Could I have that product soap
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:10,496	| IOT165 |	What we need to do is continue
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,520	| IOT165 |	Expand that so
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:13,056	| IOT165 |	We are working with
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,080	| IOT165 |	Several
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:14,848	| IOT165 |	Insurance companies
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,896	| IOT165 |	The same way we work
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,200	| IOT165 |	You know I work with insurance companies when I was
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| IOT165 |	Comcast
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,736	| IOT165 |	4
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,272	| IOT165 |	Security in home automation
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:22,784	| IOT165 |	Devices
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:25,344	| IOT165 |	Where we were able to
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,624	| IOT165 |	Help consumer save money
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,440	| IOT165 |	We haven't
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:32,512	| IOT165 |	Are solved anything at this point but we're in great conversation
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,304	| IOT165 |	We're also
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,608	| IOT165 |	You know in that idea of water damage
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| IOT165 |	If you think about it
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:38,912	| IOT165 |	As a
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:40,704	| IOT165 |	Individual homeowner
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,472	| IOT165 |	It's bad
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:44,800	| IOT165 |	But sink imagine you are in a high-rise where is
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,592	| IOT165 |	Apartment on the top floor has a
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,640	| IOT165 |	Malik well everybody Bulova
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,408	| IOT165 |	Then probably has a
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,456	| IOT165 |	2 because of water flows downhill
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,248	| IOT165 |	We talked to a lot of property owner
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:55,808	| IOT165 |	And or property managers that
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,088	| IOT165 |	If that's one of their biggest
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,112	| IOT165 |	Concerned soap
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,880	| IOT165 |	We're in
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:40:59,904	| IOT165 |	Several trials
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:06,048	| IOT165 |	Those with multi-tenant high-rise buildings today they're seeing the value of the products so we're excited about a real future there too
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,840	| IOT165 |	Not only provide
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:08,864	| IOT165 |	Vistana
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,144	| IOT165 |	Consumer basis but also on
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,656	| IOT165 |	B2B basis
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,448	| IOT165 |	And in addition
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,472	| IOT165 |	We have recently
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:15,776	| IOT165 |	Started using our Sears home service
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,312	| IOT165 |	Appliance technician
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,104	| IOT165 |	There now
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,640	| IOT165 |	Selling the product in a trial base
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:26,272	| IOT165 |	Selling the Wally product when they go into homes especially to go into a second home for a consumer
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:28,576	| IOT165 |	It's a perfect product for a second home because
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:29,856	| IOT165 |	You're not there
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:32,416	| IOT165 |	That experience that you had and others had of
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,184	| IOT165 |	Water
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:35,744	| IOT165 |	Pumping out all day imagiknit pumping out for
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:39,584	| IOT165 |	Multiple days or a week or a month who knows especially if it's an
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,352	| IOT165 |	Winter Wear
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,400	| IOT165 |	Freeze software testing that now
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,192	| IOT165 |	We just roll that out to
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:51,104	| IOT165 |	Another three hundred of our technicians to sell so it's something we're moving across the company and trying to help consume
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:51,616	| IOT165 |	Numbers in different ways
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,943	| IOT165 |	So with the Wally product this is a zigbee
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:55,967	| IOT165 |	And
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,247	| IOT165 |	Play face Enterprise
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:59,551	| IOT165 |	Search for anyone who's in in can you buy this
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,063	| IOT165 |	Somewhere else
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,855	| IOT165 |	PS on Amazon
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:04,671	| IOT165 |	You can go to Wally home.com it is zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:07,487	| IOT165 |	Both are Hub zigbee and Z-Wave so our devices
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:11,327	| IOT165 |	It really made up of a hub water sensors and the water valve it
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,375	| IOT165 |	And zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:15,423	| IOT165 |	They're so and we can kind of
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:21,823	| IOT165 |	Operate both ways it also sets us up to be interoperable with more platforms which we're in conversations
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:24,895	| IOT165 |	For that as well
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:25,663	| IOT165 |	My goodness
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,943	| IOT165 |	You also
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:28,223	| IOT165 |	Are in charge of
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:29,247	| IOT165 |	Service
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:30,527	| IOT165 |	Live business
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:31,295	| IOT165 |	Switch

EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,911	| IOT165 |	Very very few
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,191	| IOT165 |	People would have ever knew
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:54,239	| IOT165 |	Needed an electric charging station

EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:14,207	| IOT165 |	DIY charging station isn't
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:14,975	| IOT165 |	Problem it's a no
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,743	| IOT165 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:19,839	| IOT165 |	It could be something as simple as you need someone to come out and hang your
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:21,119	| IOT165 |	Lights the holidays
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:21,631	| IOT165 |	A seasoning

EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,703	| IOT165 |	So it's not
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:25,983	| IOT165 |	Doesn't have to be all hi tech
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:27,775	| IOT165 |	Servicelive is

EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:32,383	| IOT165 |	Excited about
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:32,895	| IOT165 |	What can happen
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:34,943	| IOT165 |	Because
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:37,503	| IOT165 |	I think everyone would agree iot is a
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,551	| IOT165 |	Exciting but a lot of people don't understand
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,087	| IOT165 |	Homeowners
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,391	| IOT165 |	They kind of know they want it but
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,671	| IOT165 |	How do you put it together
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,183	| IOT165 |	So
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:48,767	| IOT165 |	On both service live as well as our
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:49,791	| IOT165 |	Home Appliance Tech
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:54,143	| IOT165 |	Conditions are vision for that is that we could be think of it as a trusted advisor
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:54,655	| IOT165 |	For this model
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:59,519	| IOT165 |	When we could go into someone's home which were in millions of times a year and
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:01,567	| IOT165 |	Help guide them through do I need
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:05,151	| IOT165 |	3 cameras where would I put them do I need a door lock
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,431	| IOT165 |	Do I need a door
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,199	| IOT165 |	Bell
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:07,967	| IOT165 |	Do I need a Wali
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,527	| IOT165 |	In my home of course you do
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:12,063	| IOT165 |	And that type of
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,879	| IOT165 |	Are trusted advisor type of
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:17,951	| IOT165 |	Assistance is where I want to take us we're not there today
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:21,023	| IOT165 |	But we have to have that Vision to go forward and that's where we're headed
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:24,607	| IOT165 |	Okay let's talk about some of the opportunities that you're seeing
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,399	| IOT165 |	So right now
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:28,703	| IOT165 |	What are the most common installs that you
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,983	| IOT165 |	You get for smartphone
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:30,751	| IOT165 |	Devices
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:31,519	| IOT165 |	See if thermostat
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:33,567	| IOT165 |	Thermostats
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,591	| IOT165 |	Very common
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:36,383	| IOT165 |	And now the doorbells are bad
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:36,895	| IOT165 |	Becoming very calm
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:39,455	| IOT165 |	And how much training do you need me this
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:41,759	| IOT165 |	As someone who is installed a lot of this stuff
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:43,039	| IOT165 |	And tried to get it all to work together
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,831	| IOT165 |	Impossible soul
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:46,367	| IOT165 |	How do you train these people
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,391	| IOT165 |	This feels like
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:48,671	| IOT165 |	Just a huge area of
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:51,231	| IOT165 |	Previous angst so I don't know what it is for
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:54,815	| IOT165 |	World Service live We Are
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:55,839	| IOT165 |	Creating relation
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,607	| IOT165 |	Recruiting
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:58,143	| IOT165 |	Third-party provider
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:00,703	| IOT165 |	So we'd intentionally go out in
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:01,983	| IOT165 |	Chic
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:03,263	| IOT165 |	Providers that
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,287	| IOT165 |	Have these skills are
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,591	| IOT165 |	And what we are is a connection with
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:09,407	| IOT165 |	Consumer that need something need something
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:09,919	| IOT165 |	Installed
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:12,991	| IOT165 |	And the provider that is there a resource so will you create
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:14,271	| IOT165 |	The connection between
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:14,783	| IOT165 |	Supplying them
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,087	| IOT165 |	So we're not doing that
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:19,391	| IOT165 |	We go find people to have that tree
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:21,183	| IOT165 |	You can connect them with
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:22,207	| IOT165 |	Either our cost
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:26,303	| IOT165 |	Timer for service live also has a a white-label aspect to it where
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,327	| IOT165 |	We have Partnerships with
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,863	| IOT165 |	Companies that have these
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:29,375	| IOT165 |	Devices
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,423	| IOT165 |	More than just iot device
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,959	| IOT165 |	Anything that can be installed
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,727	| IOT165 |	Several things
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,751	| IOT165 |	Looks to be installed at home
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,543	| IOT165 |	And we create the connection
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,847	| IOT165 |	Queen that company in providing
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,639	| IOT165 |	A resource for their custom
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,151	| IOT165 |	Burnett case
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:42,687	| IOT165 |	When you go inside
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:44,991	| IOT165 |	What are they at
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:50,367	| IOT165 |	I feel like I get bombarded by a crazy use cases all the time
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,135	| IOT165 |	But it's
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:53,695	| IOT165 |	So far the consumers are not like oh yeah
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,207	| IOT165 |	I totally won
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:58,303	| IOT165 |	Well yeah I think
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:00,351	| IOT165 |	You know every day that education
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:01,375	| IOT165 |	Improves by
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:06,751	| IOT165 |	The smart home space is still a little bit of a mystery to a lot of homeowners so a lot of the questions we get our
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,543	| IOT165 |	What connects with what
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,311	| IOT165 |	Because
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:14,431	| IOT165 |	Does my camera connect with my thermostat which connects with my
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,223	| IOT165 |	Wally let's use that
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:19,295	| IOT165 |	And I think that's a mystery for a lot of people I think bull
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:22,367	| IOT165 |	Moving that direction we're not there yet
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:25,439	| IOT165 |	To be able to be that trusted provider but that's the vision that I have
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,719	| IOT165 |	And that's a big question
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:29,535	| IOT165 |	You know people that I know just in my personal life
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:32,095	| IOT165 |	As you know I've had a connected home
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:33,887	| IOT165 |	Home for a long long time now
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:37,215	| IOT165 |	A lot of people that I know don't and that's one of the reasons
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:38,239	| IOT165 |	Stay it's
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:41,567	| IOT165 |	A little confusing so we want to be sort of an educator and
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:45,151	| IOT165 |	Trusted advisors what I usually call that but
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:47,199	| IOT165 |	Where we can educate consumer
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:47,711	| IOT165 |	Rumors of
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:48,735	| IOT165 |	How it all fits
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,295	| IOT165 |	Cuz once you understand
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:56,159	| IOT165 |	It's more than just having a camera is what the camera can do for you it's more than having a thermostat is what
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:56,927	| IOT165 |	Thermostat can do 4
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:59,231	| IOT165 |	Thermostat can save you
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:00,767	| IOT165 |	Money on your energy bill
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:01,791	| IOT165 |	If you have it
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:03,583	| IOT165 |	Install properly and setup
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:07,679	| IOT165 |	But if you don't have those other two pieces it's just a therm
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:10,751	| IOT165 |	We want to help people get the most out of
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,519	| IOT165 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:13,311	| IOT165 |	As well as
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:13,823	| IOT165 |	Understand
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,359	| IOT165 |	How to put them all together
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:16,639	| IOT165 |	Okay
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:18,943	| IOT165 |	Well I feel like I've learned quite a bit
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:20,223	| IOT165 |	Today thank you so much
