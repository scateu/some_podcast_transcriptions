EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:46,752	| IOT169 |	Okay Kevin let us get started first up AT&T
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,264	| IOT169 |	Has launched
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,288	| IOT169 |	Or says it
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:49,312	| IOT169 |	Launch a
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,360	| IOT169 |	NB iot Network
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:54,432	| IOT169 |	For those of you guys who are like what what what what what
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:56,736	| IOT169 |	Nb-iot is a real
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,016	| IOT169 |	Low-bandwidth
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,552	| IOT169 |	Low data rate
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| IOT169 |	Relatively cheap
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,880	| IOT169 |	Cellular-based
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| IOT169 |	Low-power wide are
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,696	| IOT169 |	So it's
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:07,488	| IOT169 |	Blake sick Fox's Network
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| IOT169 |	Kind of like ingenue
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,328	| IOT169 |	It's on par with Laura
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,352	| IOT169 |	So very small
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,632	| IOT169 |	Dancer theater
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,936	| IOT169 |	Little very small
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,448	| IOT169 |	Bits of data
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:18,496	| IOT169 |	And presumably very cheap
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:22,336	| IOT169 |	Nb-iot has what I call crazy low data rate
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:25,408	| IOT169 |	It's like you can only send 250 kilobits per second
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| IOT169 |	Compared to
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,736	| IOT169 |	1 megabit per second
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,016	| IOT169 |	LTE cat in
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:30,784	| IOT169 |	Network
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,576	| IOT169 |	And gosh I don't even know where we're at
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:36,416	| IOT169 |	It's the dial-up modem for iot
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| IOT169 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,464	| IOT169 |	There you go
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,512	| IOT169 |	But it's supposed to be super cheap
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,560	| IOT169 |	The challenge with NB iot
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,352	| IOT169 |	He is you do have to buy
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,912	| IOT169 |	Modules in right now the industry is aiming
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| IOT169 |	For $5
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,216	| IOT169 |	For a module
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,008	| IOT169 |	That's still super expensive
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,544	| IOT169 |	Compare light cost
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,824	| IOT169 |	Wifi chips with Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| IOT169 |	Chips with your liking me
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:55,872	| IOT169 |	Dollar
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,152	| IOT169 |	50 Cent range
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:01,504	| IOT169 |	Really cheap and when you're thinking that there's any billions of these things connecting
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,784	| IOT169 |	That's a lot of money
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,552	| IOT169 |	So they're working
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:04,576	| IOT169 |	I don't know when
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,392	| IOT169 |	She is doing this
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| IOT169 |	This is worth noting.
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| IOT169 |	Because Verizon
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,000	| IOT169 |	He said that they're going to do it
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,280	| IOT169 |	T-Mobile said that they were going to
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,376	| IOT169 |	Initially in the US AT&T and Verizon
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,656	| IOT169 |	We're focused on doing LT
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,936	| IOT169 |	PCAT and which has
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| IOT169 |	Like I said
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:21,984	| IOT169 |	Hire date
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,264	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,032	| IOT169 |	Europe
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,544	| IOT169 |	Asia
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,104	| IOT169 |	Like yeah nb-iot let's make it so
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,408	| IOT169 |	But in the US not so much
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,688	| IOT169 |	So much so now that
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,248	| IOT169 |	These guys are actually piggybacking on T-Mobile
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,528	| IOT169 |	Announcement doing this
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,064	| IOT169 |	It's worth noting
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,856	| IOT169 |	The big questions I have
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,392	| IOT169 |	Are again about module
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:43,488	| IOT169 |	So you're going to need this for like high-value devices that are moving all over
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| IOT169 |	The place to think
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:45,792	| IOT169 |	Shipments of
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,328	| IOT169 |	Computing equipment
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,120	| IOT169 |	Pandora jewelry or
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,632	| IOT169 |	Medicine
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,168	| IOT169 |	Things that
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,192	| IOT169 |	Are going to travel
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,984	| IOT169 |	Possibly even around the globe
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| IOT169 |	But definitely
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| IOT169 |	Around the country
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,848	| IOT169 |	And that it won't be cost-prohibitive
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,920	| IOT169 |	Like kind of a more expensive device
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| IOT169 |	And more
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,200	| IOT169 |	Data plan
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,504	| IOT169 |	The other element here is the date
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,576	| IOT169 |	So how is AT&T going to charge people
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| IOT169 |	When
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,648	| IOT169 |	Historically
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| IOT169 |	They want to do these
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,488	| IOT169 |	Individual deals with
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,280	| IOT169 |	Companies in people there are
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,815	| IOT169 |	Companies out there like particles
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,119	| IOT169 |	Twilio that
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,399	| IOT169 |	Can support nb-iot
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,447	| IOT169 |	But that's
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:24,959	| IOT169 |	Again
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| IOT169 |	Question
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,567	| IOT169 |	I mean they can't use the traditional
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:35,967	| IOT169 |	Pricing that we use with consumers for phones and Neo data rates are phones and such because as a consumer we we have some
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,503	| IOT169 |	Super fast Wireless at this point
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,039	| IOT169 |	Pandora streaming
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| IOT169 |	Big things like video
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,879	| IOT169 |	This is not that so
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:47,743	| IOT169 |	Yeah I don't know how they're going to do this and the kind of
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,535	| IOT169 |	Burns my bottom that
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:55,935	| IOT169 |	I have to pay like $10 a month for LTE service on my Apple watch because they're kind of using that old pricing
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,727	| IOT169 |	Even though my Apple watch
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,007	| IOT169 |	Only uses I checked
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,543	| IOT169 |	About a hundred
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,823	| IOT169 |	Bytes per
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:08,223	| IOT169 |	Month and yeah I'm paying $10 for that sewing up her database is it extremely expensive they cannot do this
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,503	| IOT169 |	It's never going to succeed if they do that
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:14,879	| IOT169 |	Auntie says they're going to launch vim in the US
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| IOT169 |	In 2019
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,439	| IOT169 |	And they're going to follow it
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,463	| IOT169 |	Mexico
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,023	| IOT169 |	Verizon
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,047	| IOT169 |	Plans here
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,863	| IOT169 |	Are similar but they're doing their NBA team
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| IOT169 |	Filled out
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,143	| IOT169 |	This year
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,447	| IOT169 |	And they've said they're they're going to cover
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,239	| IOT169 |	The whole country by the end of the
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,079	| IOT169 |	Yeah that is all the news we have on
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:34,591	| IOT169 |	Nb-iot
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,127	| IOT169 |	Low-power wide-area
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:36,639	| IOT169 |	At work so far
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,223	| IOT169 |	Let's go on to our next story which is
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT169 |	Play spots

EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,031	| IOT169 |	Was actually the first company to
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,823	| IOT169 |	Hook up Netflix to
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,895	| IOT169 |	Your Netflix account in your hotel room Marriott
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,199	| IOT169 |	Over the last few
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,271	| IOT169 |	15 and I was a big deal
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,295	| IOT169 |	It took a lot of logistics
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT169 |	Actually
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,599	| IOT169 |	Make sure that
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,367	| IOT169 |	When you left
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT169 |	Deactivated
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,463	| IOT169 |	And that's actually going to happen
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:58,047	| IOT169 |	In this case so instead of attaching to your individual Amazon
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,375	| IOT169 |	This is going to be a generic
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,143	| IOT169 |	Hotel
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,447	| IOT169 |	Count in the recordings are going to be deleted every day
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:07,263	| IOT169 |	In hotels are giving it access to the Boys Room
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,311	| IOT169 |	Andrew Madoff
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:09,823	| IOT169 |	Directions
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,127	| IOT169 |	But they will actually get
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,663	| IOT169 |	For the matinee for house
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,991	| IOT169 |	Fatality we sounds kind of like a whole little skill or action or
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,503	| IOT169 |	App even
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:18,527	| IOT169 |	They will
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,647	| IOT169 |	Yep the hotel will actually
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:29,279	| IOT169 |	Be able to measure engagement through analytics or they can do some customization by choosing like to fall
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,071	| IOT169 |	Music stations and such like
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,095	| IOT169 |	Amazon
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:38,495	| IOT169 |	Give an example of Marriott offering TED talks on Echo devices for example Selby pre-configured which
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,543	| IOT169 |	You don't want just access or nothing
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,335	| IOT169 |	But eventually
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:47,711	| IOT169 |	This kind of concerns me eventually they're going to let you temporarily link your Amazon account
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,527	| IOT169 |	Better running he's mad at me for hospitality
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,295	| IOT169 |	Blueprints
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,063	| IOT169 |	And that's
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:58,463	| IOT169 |	Really nice as you get customization but you got to trust that when you check out your account is automatically disc
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,303	| IOT169 |	Schenectady cuz that's what's going to happen you're not going to disconnect it it's going to happen
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| IOT169 |	Or is it
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| IOT169 |	One hopes that it will
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,399	| IOT169 |	Because Marriott has experience with
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:10,239	| IOT169 |	Like I remember talking to Marriott and the Nets
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,007	| IOT169 |	Looks guys and they spin
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| IOT169 |	A long time
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,079	| IOT169 |	Making sure this
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,359	| IOT169 |	Properly
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| IOT169 |	And was safeguard
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:16,895	| IOT169 |	User info
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,919	| IOT169 |	Information
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,455	| IOT169 |	Conscious
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| IOT169 |	Spent a similar amount of
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,063	| IOT169 |	Worry is
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,575	| IOT169 |	There's a couple
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,599	| IOT169 |	1
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,135	| IOT169 |	Battlements
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,671	| IOT169 |	There's a lot of questions in
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,975	| IOT169 |	The consumers mind about privacy
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,511	| IOT169 |	Around this so I think
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,327	| IOT169 |	But there are plenty of people who will see this in their hotel room
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,655	| IOT169 |	If I were walking into a hotel room
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| IOT169 |	The explicit purpose of having
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| IOT169 |	Affair
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,751	| IOT169 |	I would probably look askance
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,591	| IOT169 |	And that's because there been some weird glitches
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,919	| IOT169 |	Like the echo randomly recording people in
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,199	| IOT169 |	I'm thinking it hears things
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,967	| IOT169 |	But it doesn't hear
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| IOT169 |	That's actually a little worrisome
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:59,391	| IOT169 |	And even actually in one recent case sending that conversation to contact
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:08:59,903	| IOT169 |	Yeah and I try
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,951	| IOT169 |	My data believe it
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,255	| IOT169 |	Don't trust
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| IOT169 |	These sorts of
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,863	| IOT169 |	Weird errors glitches at the stakes in some of these
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,631	| IOT169 |	Glitches
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,655	| IOT169 |	Could be high
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,167	| IOT169 |	Especially Fingerhut
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:14,495	| IOT169 |	But maybe that's a good reason not to have your own account linked
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,287	| IOT169 |	Isn't the hotel just yours
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,079	| IOT169 |	Amazon
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:23,199	| IOT169 |	Yeah that's the thing I don't know that I would like my own account but I would just look at it as
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:29,599	| IOT169 |	The TV that they put on there with the channels that they offer right I don't think I would log into my PlayStation Vue account
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,623	| IOT169 |	For example
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:36,511	| IOT169 |	Have access to my channels in my DVR stuff while on vacation it would be nice but I can do that on my my own device
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| IOT169 |	Yasso
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,839	| IOT169 |	And if that's
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,655	| IOT169 |	We'll see how that works but I think this is a
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,423	| IOT169 |	Really
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,959	| IOT169 |	Good use case for the echo
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,031	| IOT169 |	I know Amazon has really ambitious plans
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,543	| IOT169 |	I'm talking to
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,591	| IOT169 |	Across a wide variety
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| IOT169 |	Industries
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,407	| IOT169 |	And there are tons of Industries everyday that
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:58,271	| IOT169 |	What do you think about getting the echo at restaurants or in industrial Factory
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| IOT169 |	So voice is going to be a huge
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,343	| IOT169 |	Huge deal
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,367	| IOT169 |	Everywhere in
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,647	| IOT169 |	Amazon's really doing
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| IOT169 |	Good job trying to
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,231	| IOT169 |	It's funny you say that
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,511	| IOT169 |	Because
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:12,351	| IOT169 |	That was a great segue right to an article that I wrote this week
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,935	| IOT169 |	On basically The Madam a everywhere strategy
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:21,823	| IOT169 |	That I think is really helping Amazon keep its digital assistance leadership
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:28,735	| IOT169 |	Animes that they're doing it because unlike their competitors such as Google Apple and Microsoft
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,783	| IOT169 |	What do they have at Amazon doesn't have
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,879	| IOT169 |	They have desktop and mobile software platforms are there
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:38,207	| IOT169 |	So how is Amazon doing this right how are they stay
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:44,607	| IOT169 |	Granted they have first-mover status so that helps but doesn't guarantee success obviously it gets back to something you just
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,399	| IOT169 |	I said about the hotel bit
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,423	| IOT169 |	Utrust
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,215	| IOT169 |	Amazon with your data
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| IOT169 |	And when you look at the companies I just mentioned
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,567	| IOT169 |	Apple is up there with trust
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| IOT169 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,615	| IOT169 |	I would say
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,663	| IOT169 |	But Google
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:01,503	| IOT169 |	Many people are not as many people I think Trust
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:03,295	| IOT169 |	Google with their data
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:07,903	| IOT169 |	As opposed to Amazon with their data so I think that really really helps
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,951	| IOT169 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:13,791	| IOT169 |	Amazon's being very open and they have to be because the only way you're going to get this
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:17,631	| IOT169 |	Platform is a platform Developers
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:22,495	| IOT169 |	They've got like 11 developer kits that you can buy where is
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,519	| IOT169 |	The other folks don't
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:30,431	| IOT169 |	They have the most skills out there depending on who you ask and they've about 30,000 Madame a skills Google says
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,479	| IOT169 |	1000 * 1 million
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,783	| IOT169 |	When million actions to try
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:40,159	| IOT169 |	But that's use case if that's not actual developer actions there are only around 2,000.
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,927	| IOT169 |	Directions
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:46,047	| IOT169 |	So young again Amazon is making a good play here to attract the Developers
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:51,167	| IOT169 |	Herewith building skills or routines are actions whatever you want to call them the other thing
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:55,263	| IOT169 |	He's really been talking about this I'll just raise it and I'm curious what you think
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,823	| IOT169 |	Biggest populated country on the planet
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,335	| IOT169 |	Is China
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,895	| IOT169 |	Who is persona non grata in China
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| IOT169 |	Google
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| IOT169 |	Yep
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,711	| IOT169 |	Amazon
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:07,039	| IOT169 |	Granted Amazon will be competing in some very
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:12,671	| IOT169 |	Aggressive and widely available retailers that are looking to their own boss and such
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:17,791	| IOT169 |	So it's not a cakewalk for them but they have an opportunity to work Google have no opportunity so
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:22,911	| IOT169 |	I think that's going to go a long way in the future towards keeping Madame a front and center for sometime so
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,703	| IOT169 |	So that
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,751	| IOT169 |	Okay well there you go
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,287	| IOT169 |	Did not argue with you on that
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:35,455	| IOT169 |	But not some people might not be curious to hear some comments on a voicemail if somebody disagrees
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,759	| IOT169 |	There's no right answer here obviously I would love to hear people
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:42,623	| IOT169 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,719	| IOT169 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,999	| IOT169 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,631	| IOT169 |	So let's try to make as looking at the space there's definitely some
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,911	| IOT169 |	Actions that it's taken
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:59,519	| IOT169 |	Still kind of TVD on that that the Cortana example is when wearing
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,567	| IOT169 |	That's both interesting and
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,847	| IOT169 |	Sanitize into some of
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,127	| IOT169 |	The things you mentioned
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,663	| IOT169 |	Only it's like that frenemy
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,943	| IOT169 |	Territory
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| IOT169 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:15,391	| IOT169 |	Yes I have not heard of Jan until I found her mention on voice bot. AI which is like my
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:18,207	| IOT169 |	My new go-to site for voice stats
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,487	| IOT169 |	It's really good size check it out
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:24,351	| IOT169 |	Gene is a company started by David karandash
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:30,239	| IOT169 |	Who is the former CEO of answers.com what do you think about it makes sense that somebody from answers.com
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:32,287	| IOT169 |	Working with an AI bought these days
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:36,895	| IOT169 |	Jane is that a I bought she is a high-powered office assistant
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,479	| IOT169 |	And launched about a week ago
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:46,879	| IOT169 |	The company raised 1.5 million in January 2017 to get started but they just got another 8.3 million dollars are 10
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,159	| IOT169 |	Enterprise a iPod
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,439	| IOT169 |	It's interesting because
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,975	| IOT169 |	With Jane
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:57,375	| IOT169 |	She can tie into your enterprise system so like you could just ask Jen what's the status of the Purina lead
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,143	| IOT169 |	That we've been working on
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:04,799	| IOT169 |	James Bond here's what I found in the CRM marketing department sent a proposal and expected to close on March 3rd
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:09,663	| IOT169 |	I mean you could go into your CRM system look all this up but if you can have a voice
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:16,063	| IOT169 |	Assistant do it for you it should be radically save a lot of time and again it's a very Enterprise AI Focus there's
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,855	| IOT169 |	What happening in this space all of a sudden
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,367	| IOT169 |	Hey voices
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,671	| IOT169 |	It is not the sole
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,695	| IOT169 |	There will be others
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:24,511	| IOT169 |	Prepare for the multimodal future Pep Boys
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,791	| IOT169 |	That's a lot of it
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,631	| IOT169 |	The invisible interface that everybody knows how to use
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,191	| IOT169 |	You just yell at it
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,031	| IOT169 |	Cheap the Enterprise
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,615	| IOT169 |	What's
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,407	| IOT169 |	HP Enterprise
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,687	| IOT169 |	Because they
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:45,759	| IOT169 |	Heaven in
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,783	| IOT169 |	Unquote intelligence

EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,087	| IOT169 |	And services
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| IOT169 |	Over the next
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:52,671	| IOT169 |	Here's I bring this up because
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,719	| IOT169 |	I am super excited about
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,487	| IOT169 |	Edge computing
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,279	| IOT169 |	Element for iot
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:00,863	| IOT169 |	I know even if you're focused on smart home stuff and not thinking
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,143	| IOT169 |	About Enterprise type
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,167	| IOT169 |	Examples
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,703	| IOT169 |	Not everything can go back to the
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,239	| IOT169 |	We obviously tok
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,775	| IOT169 |	Sollozzo a lot of
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,543	| IOT169 |	Computing
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| IOT169 |	In processing
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,615	| IOT169 |	From all of the sensor data is going to happen
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,407	| IOT169 |	At what they call the edge
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,223	| IOT169 |	And this is a rich vein of opportunity
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,759	| IOT169 |	A lot of startups and big
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:21,855	| IOT169 |	So everyone from Intel and Cisco to hpn
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,391	| IOT169 |	I don't know just pick another big-name
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,255	| IOT169 |	Gear that is optimized
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,047	| IOT169 |	Data processing really quickly
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,607	| IOT169 |	They don't have to be low powers
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,679	| IOT169 |	Cuz everybody's definition of the edge is a little different soompi
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,519	| IOT169 |	People are like it's a sensor but most of these guys are thinking about an aggregation
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,055	| IOT169 |	That sits on a factory
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| IOT169 |	Floor inside
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,359	| IOT169 |	Closet and
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,663	| IOT169 |	Like a lot of this data shouldn't go up to the cloud
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,455	| IOT169 |	Because of security or
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:47,967	| IOT169 |	Tradesy
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:54,879	| IOT169 |	Rules some of its latency Centric so you can't have a factory that's like relying on data to dictate once and
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,391	| IOT169 |	Nothing turns off
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,927	| IOT169 |	Any latency there
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,975	| IOT169 |	Quite honestly deadly
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,511	| IOT169 |	So either why it's important
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,535	| IOT169 |	This is YH
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:02,815	| IOT169 |	Investing here
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| IOT169 |	Now
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| IOT169 |	The question is
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT169 |	What is an investor
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,655	| IOT169 |	Steak picado
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,935	| IOT169 |	Everyone makes season
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:12,799	| IOT169 |	3 years ago IBM was
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,079	| IOT169 |	Earlier this year
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:16,383	| IOT169 |	Microsoft was like we're investing 5 billion in it iot
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:19,455	| IOT169 |	Insulate PS4 billion at the edge
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:19,967	| IOT169 |	Does that mean
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,527	| IOT169 |	It's going to invest in R&D
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,087	| IOT169 |	And it's going to focus on business models
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:25,599	| IOT169 |	Which would be
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:29,695	| IOT169 |	A lot of it's going to be security AI machine learning
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,463	| IOT169 |	And
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:30,975	| IOT169 |	Again
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,815	| IOT169 |	Talked about this isn't highly specific
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,351	| IOT169 |	But it is worth mentioning
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,911	| IOT169 |	Cuz we're all cloud
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:45,055	| IOT169 |	And the four billion is going to be invested over the next 4 years so roughly a billion a year
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,103	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,895	| IOT169 |	Yay more money for
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,223	| IOT169 |	All right now
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,503	| IOT169 |	True that smart home
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:54,783	| IOT169 |	Tp-link
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,159	| IOT169 |	Tp-link is adding
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,463	| IOT169 |	Deco
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,231	| IOT169 |	Mesh routers
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:08,351	| IOT169 |	Along with
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,887	| IOT169 |	They're going to be able to have your router
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT169 |	Aunt gift
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,471	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:13,983	| IOT169 |	Kevin
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,031	| IOT169 |	I love it
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:22,431	| IOT169 |	Because all these extra hubs boxes gateways Etc that were plugged into the router just never made
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:28,831	| IOT169 |	Sense to me just put the dawn radio chips for smartphones in the router to begin with and that's what they're doing
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:33,695	| IOT169 |	They had a this is there I think they're second mesh router The Deco M5 which is a dual-band
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,791	| IOT169 |	Router no other radios are the Wi-Fi maybe that Bluetooth
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:43,167	| IOT169 |	Now they got zigbee in a deco M9 plus mesh router to tribe instead of Dual Band
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,215	| IOT169 |	Yes more of this please
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,007	| IOT169 |	AR price
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT169 |	All right
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| IOT169 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,103	| IOT169 |	Smart
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,615	| IOT169 |	Fridges
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,919	| IOT169 |	DRM specifically
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,431	| IOT169 |	Smart fridge
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,967	| IOT169 |	This is a
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,759	| IOT169 |	Twitter thread that I somehow got through
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,551	| IOT169 |	I'm really excited about
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,367	| IOT169 |	This fellow was complaining about
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,159	| IOT169 |	An RFID reader on
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| IOT169 |	GE
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:09,023	| IOT169 |	Appliances so this RFID reader basically measures
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| IOT169 |	If you have a
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,327	| IOT169 |	Branded
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,375	| IOT169 |	Water filter in your fridge
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,655	| IOT169 |	And if you don't
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,959	| IOT169 |	The water dispenser won't dispense
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,983	| IOT169 |	Really
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,495	| IOT169 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:24,127	| IOT169 |	It's not good for the lovely
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,175	| IOT169 |	It's red because it encompasses everything that you would have
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,527	| IOT169 |	In the sky being
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:32,831	| IOT169 |	Doesn't work
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:36,671	| IOT169 |	We might hack it but most mainstream consumers know
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,999	| IOT169 |	Yes but it also includes GE Appliance
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,047	| IOT169 |	Weighing in to say
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,327	| IOT169 |	He's like hey
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,119	| IOT169 |	What is this and why are you doing this
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:49,215	| IOT169 |	Angie appliances says what this refrigerator requires this
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,751	| IOT169 |	Particular technology to work
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,055	| IOT169 |	Direct lease please see the following link for details
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,335	| IOT169 |	And then
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| IOT169 |	She is like
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:58,431	| IOT169 |	The guys like this is unacceptable I don't like that and then
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,199	| IOT169 |	This guy
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,735	| IOT169 |	Geappliances says
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,063	| IOT169 |	Well we recommend only using geappliances RFID
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,135	| IOT169 |	Filters as they are designed for your refrigerator specifically
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,719	| IOT169 |	Usual a non-genuine filter
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:13,023	| IOT169 |	Guaranteed to work properly and may damage the area
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,607	| IOT169 |	This Is Not Unusual
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,399	| IOT169 |	Any company that sells branded
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,191	| IOT169 |	Toner filters
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,215	| IOT169 |	Whatever else that
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,751	| IOT169 |	Comes with his stuff
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,543	| IOT169 |	They're always going to say hey user
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,311	| IOT169 |	Branded stuff
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,079	| IOT169 |	But
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,383	| IOT169 |	If we think back to Keurig in their pickups in
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,407	| IOT169 |	ERM associated
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,687	| IOT169 |	K-Cups
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| IOT169 |	It becomes harder
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,503	| IOT169 |	When you connect a device to the
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,039	| IOT169 |	To do this
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,831	| IOT169 |	That's
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:41,695	| IOT169 |	Yeah me know I have a Samsung fridge and
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:47,839	| IOT169 |	Usually I buy the Samsung water filters but every once in a while either not available River and I'll get much cheaper
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,631	| IOT169 |	Third-party filter
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,423	| IOT169 |	I know it will work with my fridge
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,727	| IOT169 |	It will not work with this guy's French
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,031	| IOT169 |	He does not have that option and it's not
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:59,615	| IOT169 |	Disclose when you buy the fridge that it will only work
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,175	| IOT169 |	The persuaders DRM on the filters essentially
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:05,247	| IOT169 |	Yes and this is actually a really prevalent
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:08,063	| IOT169 |	Idea in the appliance industry
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| IOT169 |	Because
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| IOT169 |	They're looking for ways to
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,415	| IOT169 |	You know creep do services
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:17,535	| IOT169 |	Right so reminding you that your filters do and then being able to let you order One automatically
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| IOT169 |	But
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,399	| IOT169 |	For the people who are like brother saves
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:22,911	| IOT169 |	This guy saying
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:23,935	| IOT169 |	$50
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:29,055	| IOT169 |	Reminder usually 40-ish
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:29,567	| IOT169 |	So yeah
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:33,919	| IOT169 |	Where is a third-party one might cost you the $15 or less
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:37,503	| IOT169 |	And in my case I actually have a water filtration system
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,783	| IOT169 |	Full House
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,831	| IOT169 |	So I don't actually use the filter in my
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:44,415	| IOT169 |	But in that case GE does offer up iPad
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,951	| IOT169 |	So it just
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,999	| IOT169 |	If you put the bypass in
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,839	| IOT169 |	So your options here in this case are we
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,607	| IOT169 |	Return the fridge
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| IOT169 |	Buy the GE part
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,423	| IOT169 |	Orbit whole house water filtration system
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,983	| IOT169 |	I guess orange shoes
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:02,591	| IOT169 |	It looks like he is going to return it from the thread
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,359	| IOT169 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,127	| IOT169 |	This guy is like
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,639	| IOT169 |	I am returned
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,223	| IOT169 |	Interesting bit is talking about 2
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:12,063	| IOT169 |	Disclosure the filters typically last at least 3 to 6 months
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:15,135	| IOT169 |	Which when you figure this out when you run into this problem
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,184	| IOT169 |	It'd be well Pastor return.
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,952	| IOT169 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:23,328	| IOT169 |	So we're going to say if you were making a smart Appliance
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,608	| IOT169 |	With your product in this
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| IOT169 |	You got it exclusive
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,192	| IOT169 |	I feel like the FTC
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,472	| IOT169 |	And other organizations
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,496	| IOT169 |	What do you like
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,264	| IOT169 |	That's not cool
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,800	| IOT169 |	Sorry Green Revolution
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,408	| IOT169 |	Tigres
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,176	| IOT169 |	CRM
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,688	| IOT169 |	Mark Bridges
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:41,504	| IOT169 |	All right
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| IOT169 |	Let's talk about other
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| IOT169 |	Things that have gone wrong
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,600	| IOT169 |	Google is going to fix
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,624	| IOT169 |	Their location
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:47,904	| IOT169 |	Google home
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:53,536	| IOT169 |	Yes it's a bit scary to me that this is
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:58,912	| IOT169 |	Just been found but krebsonsecurity reported about it
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:03,008	| IOT169 |	You can inject some JavaScript in a website if you are at
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:09,408	| IOT169 |	Evil person I guess and that script can run and find out if you have a go
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,944	| IOT169 |	Google home read Chromecast on
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| IOT169 |	Your Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:18,624	| IOT169 |	And if you give it about a minute to run the script that is it can get super precise location.
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| IOT169 |	Lake County Within
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| IOT169 |	10 meters I believe
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,744	| IOT169 |	That's really bad
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:29,376	| IOT169 |	So Google is aware of it now and they are going to fix it I haven't seen when it's getting fixed but
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,912	| IOT169 |	Really really bad
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:31,936	| IOT169 |	Really really bad
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:38,336	| IOT169 |	I just I'm surprised I mean that home product is not brand new I mean you expect these kind of
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,408	| IOT169 |	Remember that
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,432	| IOT169 |	Incredible data
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,200	| IOT169 |	Consumption
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:54,976	| IOT169 |	Yeah that's fair to say I don't know if you wash it but there's about a minute-and-a-half video of somebody actually doing this
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:55,744	| IOT169 |	Script
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,536	| IOT169 |	The maid to actually exploited
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:01,632	| IOT169 |	And it like opens up a location in Google Maps to 239 close radar
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:08,032	| IOT169 |	Yeah it does take a minute like I'm staring at the screen like watching paint dry but you know that's not the point
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,152	| IOT169 |	What's less scary scary
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:19,296	| IOT169 |	Dependent be called bsh has partnered with techstars to develop accelerator program for the connected kitchen
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,088	| IOT169 |	If you are like me this is
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,112	| IOT169 |	Super exciting
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,648	| IOT169 |	TSH is 8
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,720	| IOT169 |	So one of the German iot
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,488	| IOT169 |	Countries that we talk
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,024	| IOT169 |	Satellites
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:32,864	| IOT169 |	Basically are going to create this accelerator with techstars
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:36,192	| IOT169 |	The focus is going to be on digital business models and
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,472	| IOT169 |	Analogies for the
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,800	| IOT169 |	Home so something that we are super interested in
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,080	| IOT169 |	And and super excited about
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,616	| IOT169 |	This will start
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| IOT169 |	In Munich
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,408	| IOT169 |	In
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,944	| IOT169 |	2019
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:51,552	| IOT169 |	And it'll be a three-month accelerator program they've committed to finding it and making it happened
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| IOT169 |	2021
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,880	| IOT169 |	Looking for 10 companies
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:57,184	| IOT169 |	So if you are excited about this
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:59,488	| IOT169 |	Keep an eye on techstars is website
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,000	| IOT169 |	And
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,560	| IOT169 |	I am sure you're going to see something about their partnership
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,608	| IOT169 |	Esh
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,144	| IOT169 |	Maybe I'll get my refrigerated
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,936	| IOT169 |	Crock pot
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,960	| IOT169 |	Biscottini
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,728	| IOT169 |	Munich
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,496	| IOT169 |	Next year
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,008	| IOT169 |	Go for it
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,872	| IOT169 |	But only picking 10 I mean
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,920	| IOT169 |	That's
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:18,944	| IOT169 |	Brilliant
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:21,760	| IOT169 |	Yes it is you're going to be one of the 10
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,296	| IOT169 |	You're welcome
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,368	| IOT169 |	Little tiny other things
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,136	| IOT169 |	Things to mention
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,928	| IOT169 |	One Google now has a podcast
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:32,512	| IOT169 |	And I know a lot of our audience listens to things
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,536	| IOT169 |	On the web or
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,072	| IOT169 |	Variety podcast
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,400	| IOT169 |	Less than half of you actually listen on iTune
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:42,752	| IOT169 |	So if you're one of those people who are listening on an Android phone
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,032	| IOT169 |	Or the Google home
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| IOT169 |	Now you have a podcast
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| IOT169 |	You can use
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,640	| IOT169 |	You do and even cooler I think
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:54,272	| IOT169 |	Is that when you listen to a podcast on your Google home you can posit
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:58,624	| IOT169 |	And in the podcast app on your phone you can say
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:02,720	| IOT169 |	Resume playing whatever the podcast is and it takes up with your phone left off
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,000	| IOT169 |	Well that's nice
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,840	| IOT169 |	Say when someone listens to it on the
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,120	| IOT169 |	That
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,144	| IOT169 |	Podcast
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:13,216	| IOT169 |	No
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,240	| IOT169 |	Yusuf Yusuf
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,312	| IOT169 |	Okay and we have to clarify
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:17,824	| IOT169 |	Haitian
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,104	| IOT169 |	Last
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:20,640	| IOT169 |	All right
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,408	| IOT169 |	Buckle up
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| IOT169 |	You guys
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:25,760	| IOT169 |	If you thought it was confusing last week prepare to be
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,344	| IOT169 |	In last week's episode we talked about 3
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,416	| IOT169 |	When talking about the nest connect
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| IOT169 |	Device
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:36,256	| IOT169 |	And this is a device that acts as a bridge from your Wi-Fi network to
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| IOT169 |	The other
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:37,792	| IOT169 |	Thread and
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,328	| IOT169 |	Bluetooth networks in the house
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,608	| IOT169 |	We said
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:43,424	| IOT169 |	Did it was thread ready and that it would run open
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,472	| IOT169 |	It is
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,496	| IOT169 |	Running open
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,032	| IOT169 |	Thread but it is also
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,312	| IOT169 |	Thread ready
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:49,824	| IOT169 |	Those are two separate
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:53,664	| IOT169 |	We also said Google Nest thread ready software was called
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:57,248	| IOT169 |	Open thread is actually an open-source thread
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,528	| IOT169 |	Group certified reference staff
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,600	| IOT169 |	That you used to build actual thread
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| IOT169 |	Supposed to
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,672	| IOT169 |	Thread ready devices
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,720	| IOT169 |	So the nest connect runs open
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| IOT169 |	Thread but is actually still a threat Reddit
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,560	| IOT169 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,584	| IOT169 |	Without asking
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,936	| IOT169 |	Yes that's all I can say yes
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:17,984	| IOT169 |	That help
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:22,336	| IOT169 |	I think part of the confusion I don't know if he said this last week or not is that
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:25,408	| IOT169 |	Some of these Hardware products came out while
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,200	| IOT169 |	The thread spec was kind of an
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:27,712	| IOT169 |	Slight
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| IOT169 |	And
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:33,600	| IOT169 |	It looks like there's transition in the works to following the truth.
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,368	| IOT169 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:39,744	| IOT169 |	Hey I just got an email from the wise

EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,872	| IOT169 |	Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:00,384	| IOT169 |	I've got a
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,432	| IOT169 |	Question for you regarding
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,456	| IOT169 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| IOT169 |	Have you guys
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,504	| IOT169 |	Tried using
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,784	| IOT169 |	Getting your Alexa devices
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,576	| IOT169 |	Such as your Fire tablet
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,856	| IOT169 |	Or your ex
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,624	| IOT169 |	Spot
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:13,952	| IOT169 |	Or your Amazon Fire TV have you tried saying
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,232	| IOT169 |	Padme
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,256	| IOT169 |	Show me the front door
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:18,560	| IOT169 |	Have you been successful in
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:22,144	| IOT169 |	Connecting to the ring video doorbell or two Arlo
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,912	| IOT169 |	Pro Camera
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,936	| IOT169 |	And if yes
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,960	| IOT169 |	How is
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:25,728	| IOT169 |	Speed
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,752	| IOT169 |	Versus
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,312	| IOT169 |	Just using the smartphone app
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,080	| IOT169 |	Or
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:30,848	| IOT169 |	Yap on the table
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,896	| IOT169 |	Just wanted to get your experience on that
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:35,200	| IOT169 |	Is the experience Key West
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:40,832	| IOT169 |	Compared to using Alexa and
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:41,344	| IOT169 |	Siri
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:43,392	| IOT169 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,184	| IOT169 |	This is
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,256	| IOT169 |	I'm sorry to disappoint you I have done some of these things but
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,584	| IOT169 |	I have used my Amazon
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,352	| IOT169 |	Echo Show
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,144	| IOT169 |	To see what is happening
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,960	| IOT169 |	For my Arlo cameras and to see what's happen
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,240	| IOT169 |	On my
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:00,032	| IOT169 |	Video doorbell which is by
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,800	| IOT169 |	August
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,312	| IOT169 |	Not by
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,592	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,360	| IOT169 |	I can tell you
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:04,640	| IOT169 |	That there is
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,968	| IOT169 |	In my experience so far it is not faster
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,480	| IOT169 |	Everything going into
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:09,760	| IOT169 |	And
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:10,784	| IOT169 |	It's kind of a bummer
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,832	| IOT169 |	But it makes sense though
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:18,464	| IOT169 |	There's a technical reason why opening the app on your phone is going to be quicker
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:21,536	| IOT169 |	And that's because it's a lot quicker to just tap a nap and have
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:25,888	| IOT169 |	It opened immediately as opposed to speaking to a voice assistant where that
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:28,704	| IOT169 |	Recordings to go to the cloud has to come back
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,728	| IOT169 |	And then
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,008	| IOT169 |	The voice assistant
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,544	| IOT169 |	Toddler has to make the thing happen
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:37,152	| IOT169 |	So there's going to be at least I'm going to say one two three seconds minimum
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:40,992	| IOT169 |	So what difference early days when I first tried it out the August was like rough
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT169 |	Play seven seconds
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,296	| IOT169 |	Shane
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,344	| IOT169 |	They felt like that are I'm not even to put that much debt are in the
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:48,672	| IOT169 |	But
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,696	| IOT169 |	It did get a little better
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,488	| IOT169 |	But it never got
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,512	| IOT169 |	To the same
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:56,096	| IOT169 |	That being said sometimes it's nice and
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,632	| IOT169 |	It's not going to catch the
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:01,216	| IOT169 |	Yes man right I used my Arlo on the
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:05,312	| IOT169 |	I actually put an Arlo camera on a roof deck and I would use it to check in on
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:05,824	| IOT169 |	The kids when they
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,128	| IOT169 |	Stuck so
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:08,896	| IOT169 |	I would just
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,664	| IOT169 |	Down in the kitchen I be
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,712	| IOT169 |	Show me the roof
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,480	| IOT169 |	And poof
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| IOT169 |	I can see what was happy
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,552	| IOT169 |	I think so in that case
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,064	| IOT169 |	It didn't matter
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,368	| IOT169 |	It would be terrible in a
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,136	| IOT169 |	A Security Site
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,416	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:26,560	| IOT169 |	I'm glad can ask this though because I actually forgot that Madame a is built into my fire
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:32,960	| IOT169 |	10 HD tablet and I have actually turned her off on that because I'm almost always around a Madam a device
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:36,544	| IOT169 |	But the advantage of the tablet is it has a screen
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,080	| IOT169 |	And I never thought to
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:41,408	| IOT169 |	Try and really use it in that way kind of like a show or a spot
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:46,784	| IOT169 |	So thank you for that kind I will probably turn her back on and do some testing now as a result of this
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| IOT169 |	Correct
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:50,880	| IOT169 |	So
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,928	| IOT169 |	And I don't have Siri
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,720	| IOT169 |	On anything that's connected to anything
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| IOT169 |	That Siri
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,768	| IOT169 |	Control cell
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:59,328	| IOT169 |	I don't know and for what it's worth I do have
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:03,168	| IOT169 |	Google Assistant built into my TV set-top box
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:09,056	| IOT169 |	In my office which is connected to a big 4K TV and I do use that to say hey
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,848	| IOT169 |	G show me the
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,640	| IOT169 |	Front window where I have a nest camera
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:15,456	| IOT169 |	It does work but again you got that latency
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:21,088	| IOT169 |	Tilted my point is this is not unique to Amazon this is the way this is all architected for all of them
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,160	| IOT169 |	Remember
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,440	| IOT169 |	If you would like to be entered

EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,312	| IOT169 |	I gave thanks
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,848	| IOT169 |	You're coming hey Stacy thanks for having me
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:23,456	| IOT169 |	Several months ago I wrote about
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:25,760	| IOT169 |	Bunch of startups that are disrupting
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,296	| IOT169 |	Leak Detection space
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,856	| IOT169 |	Inflow is one of those startups
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,880	| IOT169 |	So it really fast
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,160	| IOT169 |	Telus
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,184	| IOT169 |	What flow does
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:37,536	| IOT169 |	Yes flow is a water monitoring and shut off technology
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,304	| IOT169 |	G for the home
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,072	| IOT169 |	One device
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:39,840	| IOT169 |	Install Azan
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| IOT169 |	The main water supply line
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:45,728	| IOT169 |	Proactively monitors the Integrity of the whole plumbing system to prevent
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,264	| IOT169 |	Catastrophic water damage
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:50,080	| IOT169 |	From happening at all we learned habits of the home
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:52,128	| IOT169 |	And we detect things that lead to leak
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:55,712	| IOT169 |	Slight high pressure thermal expansion freezing pipes
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,016	| IOT169 |	And by monitoring for those things
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:01,344	| IOT169 |	We can alert the homeowner and if something catastrophic happens
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:04,928	| IOT169 |	Can automatically shut off the water thereby preventing claims
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:09,280	| IOT169 |	So you do catastrophic like oh my gosh my pipe has burst it's crazy
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,048	| IOT169 |	Do you also do things
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,632	| IOT169 |	Absolutely so our technology
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,168	| IOT169 |	It detects something this
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,448	| IOT169 |	Small as a drop of water a day
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:19,264	| IOT169 |	Allison mosto Leak Detection falls into
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:20,032	| IOT169 |	A couple of different cat
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,592	| IOT169 |	You either have technologies that
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:26,176	| IOT169 |	Do not install on the main water supply line or ones that do
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:32,576	| IOT169 |	So like you just covered my friends at Roost and notion I would put those in the category of like the point sensor cattle
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:34,112	| IOT169 |	They're not on the main line
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:38,464	| IOT169 |	Many of other technologies that install on the mainline those generally can catch League
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:41,024	| IOT169 |	You know anywhere in the home like ours can
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:43,584	| IOT169 |	I think our technology is very unique
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,352	| IOT169 |	And that
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,632	| IOT169 |	We also have pressure sensor
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:48,192	| IOT169 |	Capability which is allows us
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:50,496	| IOT169 |	To catch things like micro leaks
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,032	| IOT169 |	So by doing pressure test
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:53,312	| IOT169 |	Yes we can identify
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:59,712	| IOT169 |	Leaks that are tiny behind the wall underneath the slab of the home that generally cannot be found by just
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:01,248	| IOT169 |	Monitoring the flow
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,040	| IOT169 |	Another category
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,600	| IOT169 |	Which is those that turn the water off
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,880	| IOT169 |	And those that
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,672	| IOT169 |	And you guys actually will
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:09,952	| IOT169 |	Turn the water off
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:10,720	| IOT169 |	Absolute
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:14,304	| IOT169 |	You're right those are the two different ways that we kind of breakouts at
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,072	| IOT169 |	Competitive land
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,096	| IOT169 |	Landscape now there is
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:18,144	| IOT169 |	A lot of questions around pricing
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,680	| IOT169 |	Installation art technology
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,704	| IOT169 |	Does required
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,472	| IOT169 |	Professional insulation
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:23,520	| IOT169 |	Technology
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:26,848	| IOT169 |	Do not but I think what you get for that in the end of the day is
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,384	| IOT169 |	A technology that
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:30,432	| IOT169 |	And really help prevent water damage
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,224	| IOT169 |	From happening in the first place which I think is really any
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:39,648	| IOT169 |	And I'll just toss out some of those competitors so you don't have to say their names
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,184	| IOT169 |	Falcon
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:43,488	| IOT169 |	Flume
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:44,768	| IOT169 |	And some others
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,816	| IOT169 |	Lots of options out there and leave
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,120	| IOT169 |	Super hot police tube
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:49,888	| IOT169 |	Be right now
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,400	| IOT169 |	Why
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,448	| IOT169 |	First of all
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,472	| IOT169 |	When you look at it
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:56,288	| IOT169 |	Homeowners insurance claims that happen every year
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:56,800	| IOT169 |	Water dam
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,872	| IOT169 |	As a result of Plumbing failures is the leading
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,200	| IOT169 |	Things every year
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:07,040	| IOT169 |	More than five times likely they'll have a water damage claim versus
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| IOT169 |	Or fire
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,368	| IOT169 |	And that's usually where people mine
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:16,768	| IOT169 |	When they think of homeowners insurance and what they're trying to protect against it's about 9 billion dollars every year
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:19,072	| IOT169 |	Worth of losses for the insurance
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:21,888	| IOT169 |	Industry and it's five times more likely
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,936	| IOT169 |	That you'll have water damage in your home
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,984	| IOT169 |	Then a fire claim
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,264	| IOT169 |	Or a ceph
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:29,824	| IOT169 |	So by frequency it is
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,848	| IOT169 |	Deleting cars
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,384	| IOT169 |	Claims about 25
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,664	| IOT169 |	Percent of all homeowners
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,176	| IOT169 |	Insurance claim
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:40,064	| IOT169 |	And so even though people's minds homeowners Minds frequently go to you know fire theft
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:45,184	| IOT169 |	There's really a lot of human Peril involves are the insurance industry it definitely has a
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,976	| IOT169 |	The focus on the water damage claim
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,792	| IOT169 |	And it is preventable
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,560	| IOT169 |	I mean you can
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,840	| IOT169 |	Really prevent a hurricane
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,888	| IOT169 |	Through it a neighborhood
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,936	| IOT169 |	But seems like fire things like that
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:58,240	| IOT169 |	Things like Plumbing failures
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,800	| IOT169 |	These are things that can be prevented with the right
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,824	| IOT169 |	Two technologies
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:06,432	| IOT169 |	We've been working on this for about 10 years my father is my co-founder and
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,712	| IOT169 |	Inventor and
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:10,784	| IOT169 |	She has been a mechanical engineer for years
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:14,624	| IOT169 |	For the plumbing industry he was a manufacturer but really notable
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:17,440	| IOT169 |	Here was that he was actually an expert witness
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:18,976	| IOT169 |	Miss for the plumbing industry
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,256	| IOT169 |	Defending
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,280	| IOT169 |	Subrogation claim
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,048	| IOT169 |	Games from insurance
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,608	| IOT169 |	Plumbing failure would happen
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:28,704	| IOT169 |	Put in a home maybe a water connector pops off of the main water supply line
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:32,288	| IOT169 |	An insurance company would maybe payout that claim and then turn around
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,080	| IOT169 |	Send file a subrogation claim against
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:38,176	| IOT169 |	Plumbing manufacturer who they think may be responsible maybe a legend
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,968	| IOT169 |	Product liability or negligence
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:42,784	| IOT169 |	And my father had defended over a thousand
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:45,600	| IOT169 |	None of those claims he was seeing these astronomical
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,112	| IOT169 |	Client app
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:49,696	| IOT169 |	And here he is the Forefront of Plumbing innovation
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,488	| IOT169 |	He said previous and bench
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:57,888	| IOT169 |	Sensitive sold over 18 million units and he's seeing these crazy claims happening as a result of Plumbing
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,936	| IOT169 |	Failures and he decided that they're needed
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,960	| IOT169 |	To be a better way
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,984	| IOT169 |	So this gets us
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,520	| IOT169 |	Send to one of my favorite topics
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,544	| IOT169 |	Switches insurance
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:05,824	| IOT169 |	Because
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:09,408	| IOT169 |	Gosh it feels like these guys should have a vested interest
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,456	| IOT169 |	I'm putting this kind of product
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,992	| IOT169 |	In the market and getting it into
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:13,760	| IOT169 |	The consumer's hands
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:15,808	| IOT169 |	What are you actually finding
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,856	| IOT169 |	When it's released
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:20,160	| IOT169 |	I think that although
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:20,928	| IOT169 |	Most insurance
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:22,976	| IOT169 |	Sweet talk to you I mean every insurance
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,280	| IOT169 |	We talked to understand the value prop
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:27,840	| IOT169 |	They understand what it is we're doing
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:30,144	| IOT169 |	They're very intrigued we are also
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:36,544	| IOT169 |	Similar to our friends in a roost and notion were working with a number of different insurance companies on pilot
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:41,920	| IOT169 |	But because the technology is expensive and because it needs to be you know professionally installed
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,944	| IOT169 |	We believe the
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:46,528	| IOT169 |	Why is there and it'll pay for itself to adopt
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,064	| IOT169 |	And we found ourselves
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:50,368	| IOT169 |	In what seemed like an endless
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,160	| IOT169 |	Cycle of the pilot test
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,952	| IOT169 |	And so we decided was
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,000	| IOT169 |	We were going to collect our own data
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,792	| IOT169 |	And we were going to get ourselves comfort
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:01,376	| IOT169 |	Trouble with our ability to actually help prevent claims
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,144	| IOT169 |	Susan Drive down
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,680	| IOT169 |	The frequency and severity
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,448	| IOT169 |	And
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:06,496	| IOT169 |	Come out with our own guarantee
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,776	| IOT169 |	To homeowners
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:10,080	| IOT169 |	Is that if they adopt our technology
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,896	| IOT169 |	And if they act reasonably by
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:15,456	| IOT169 |	You know taking care of their alerts when they happen
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:21,088	| IOT169 |	And maintaining their home with the tips we give them that we will guarantee that they will not have catastrophic water damage
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:21,856	| IOT169 |	Pitch in their home
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:23,392	| IOT169 |	We just took
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,928	| IOT169 |	An approach that work I know
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,976	| IOT169 |	Insurance companies agnostic
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:29,792	| IOT169 |	If you will until the insurance company comes around
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:32,864	| IOT169 |	And does ketchup and I believe that they will
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,376	| IOT169 |	Eventually
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:37,216	| IOT169 |	But in the meantime our value proposition kind of stands for itself
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,312	| IOT169 |	The doorbell company
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,592	| IOT169 |	And now owned by Amazon
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:45,408	| IOT169 |	Offered a deductible reimbursement process for their stuff
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,944	| IOT169 |	Tattoo they did and
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,968	| IOT169 |	Jamie siminoff
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,272	| IOT169 |	From ring was actually one of my First Investors
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:54,880	| IOT169 |	In my company and he was one of my early adviser so that was definitely a play out of there
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:56,416	| IOT169 |	Play book I saw Jamie.
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:59,232	| IOT169 |	Doing that a long time ago and kind of scratch my head and I was like
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:05,376	| IOT169 |	That's something that we may be able to do once we collect more data and feel really comfortable now Jamie did that with an insurance
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,912	| IOT169 |	He did that with
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,704	| IOT169 |	American Family Insurance I believe
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,776	| IOT169 |	And so we got so confident
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,568	| IOT169 |	And you know we were kind of
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:19,968	| IOT169 |	Working with different partners and we just decided hey this is something that we can potentially do ourselves looked at the data that we have been
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,736	| IOT169 |	Collecting from
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:27,136	| IOT169 |	The many homes that we've installed our technology in and just made the decision internally that this was something that we were just going to go up
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:27,904	| IOT169 |	About doing ourselves
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:29,440	| IOT169 |	So from an Actuarial basis
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:30,464	| IOT169 |	Does Ensure is love
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,024	| IOT169 |	Do you have to have a certain number of like
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,304	| IOT169 |	It's like man years but they're just year
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:35,584	| IOT169 |	Years of data on
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,656	| IOT169 |	How do you guys
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:44,544	| IOT169 |	Create models what are confidence intervals what is this look like when you're like setting aside money in escrow
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:45,568	| IOT169 |	To pay this out
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:49,408	| IOT169 |	I mean truthfully with the homes that we've been installed with so far
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,200	| IOT169 |	We haven't seen any catastrophic water
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:56,832	| IOT169 |	Anyone that follows our technology the way that it should be kind of did the math to see how many homes
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,368	| IOT169 |	We would have had to pay out claims
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:00,416	| IOT169 |	4 so far if every single person
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:04,000	| IOT169 |	It's signed up for home protect program and we just we didn't have any claim
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,280	| IOT169 |	So to some extent is a
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,816	| IOT169 |	The startup you know you can just
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:09,632	| IOT169 |	Look at the data you have I wouldn't say that any of the data that we
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:12,448	| IOT169 |	Collected would get any of the big insurance companies
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:18,848	| IOT169 |	Comfortable we've been operating as a company for new three years and had a about a product on the market for less than
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:20,384	| IOT169 |	One so I don't think there is
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:22,176	| IOT169 |	Any way that we could get an insurance company
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:27,296	| IOT169 |	But that's kind of the way that we went about it that's why we went about it the way that we did
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:30,880	| IOT169 |	Let's talk about this from
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:37,280	| IOT169 |	Perspective only because they care so much about longevity and this is the sort of product where I plan to install this
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:38,560	| IOT169 |	How often should I
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:40,608	| IOT169 |	Replace this or think about how often should I have to
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,936	| IOT169 |	The part of our technology that can
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:45,984	| IOT169 |	Really suffer from wear and tear
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:52,128	| IOT169 |	Is the mechanical ball valve or technology does turn on and turn off the water every single day that's how
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:59,039	| IOT169 |	Test every day whether or not there's a leak in the home we know definitively whether or not there are leaks every single day
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:01,343	| IOT169 |	Turning on and turning off the water
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:03,135	| IOT169 |	And actually eating that ball Bell
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:03,903	| IOT169 |	.
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,183	| IOT169 |	Mechanical part could wear
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:09,535	| IOT169 |	Parent are so we've tested that for well over five years we've actually tested it over 8
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:11,839	| IOT169 |	We believe that once you install this
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:15,167	| IOT169 |	You really don't need to think about it for at least five years that's a week
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:17,471	| IOT169 |	I think the useful life is but it could be much longer
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,007	| IOT169 |	Any device
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:20,287	| IOT169 |	Nest isn't
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:21,567	| IOT169 |	Reduce the number of different
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:27,199	| IOT169 |	You know thermostats ring has introduced new doorbells that technology just gets better and better with time
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,223	| IOT169 |	So I don't believe that this
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:33,087	| IOT169 |	This is the kind of product that you just going to want to let you know set it and forget it for the next 50 years I believe that
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:35,391	| IOT169 |	Some point people will probably want to upgrade anyways
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:39,999	| IOT169 |	Okay so for a while nest on the thermostat front was doing upgrades like
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,023	| IOT169 |	Every 12 to 8
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,047	| IOT169 |	18 months which belt
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,583	| IOT169 |	Like super fast
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:49,983	| IOT169 |	Granted it was a brand new product so I doubt it but what do you think the logical product update cycle is for something
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,263	| IOT169 |	That is smart
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:58,175	| IOT169 |	It's closer to about like 24 to 36 months I just believe I think that in our space
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:59,199	| IOT169 |	They specifically this is
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:02,015	| IOT169 |	This is so new and there's so much that we can do around water
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:04,319	| IOT169 |	That I'm going to come tell you you're going to c-diff
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,599	| IOT169 |	Different versions of our product
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:08,159	| IOT169 |	Released within the next 24 to 36 months
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:14,047	| IOT169 |	For sure and I think that you know we're all kind of waiting as you've touched on in your previous articles for some
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:17,887	| IOT169 |	Great connected home platform to kind of bring all these products
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:20,703	| IOT169 |	Together I think with all the data that were collecting
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:22,495	| IOT169 |	We're only going to make the home
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:24,287	| IOT169 |	Smarter from our standpoint
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:28,127	| IOT169 |	Specifically I can tell you like we're collecting data every second of the day
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:31,199	| IOT169 |	From a water flow standpoint pressure stamp
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:35,039	| IOT169 |	Temperature I mean this is all new data that no one is really
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:39,391	| IOT169 |	You know using yet to make the home more thoughtful and so as differ
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,927	| IOT169 |	Protocols May
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:43,999	| IOT169 |	Come to the Forefront and whatnot I think for a number of reasons
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:46,303	| IOT169 |	Maybe 24 to 36 months
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,095	| IOT169 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,119	| IOT169 |	Insurance
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:51,679	| IOT169 |	It's cuz I didn't quite as much as I wanted to there
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,447	| IOT169 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:54,495	| IOT169 |	Priestly so you guys have started this
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:57,823	| IOT169 |	I agree that the insurance Market is waiting on data that
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:01,151	| IOT169 |	I don't know if they'll ever get what do you think
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,943	| IOT169 |	They're going to do in the smart
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,247	| IOT169 |	Cuz there's this idea that they're going to
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:07,295	| IOT169 |	Remake the way they offer
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:08,063	| IOT169 |	Policies
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:10,879	| IOT169 |	Premiums but then there's also a much more
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:14,207	| IOT169 |	Have Monday and idea that they'll just do it as a competitive differentiator like
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:16,767	| IOT169 |	In marketing their insurance products which is maybe less exciting
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:19,071	| IOT169 |	Yeah and I think the ladder is what they've
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:21,119	| IOT169 |	I've been doing today all the big
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:24,191	| IOT169 |	Partnerships that we've seen between iot products
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:24,703	| IOT169 |	Can insurance
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:26,239	| IOT169 |	I've really been about Mark
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:27,775	| IOT169 |	It's really been about
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:28,799	| IOT169 |	The differentiating
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:29,567	| IOT169 |	Their product
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:30,847	| IOT169 |	@the insurtech conference
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:33,151	| IOT169 |	In October of last year
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:33,663	| IOT169 |	I had the
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:36,479	| IOT169 |	Share some thoughts on stage
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:39,039	| IOT169 |	And one of the things I said to insurance companies is
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,575	| IOT169 |	I want a partner with insurance
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:42,623	| IOT169 |	Companies that actually want
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,647	| IOT169 |	To drive down
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:45,695	| IOT169 |	Claim frequency and severity
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,975	| IOT169 |	That's what we're doing
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:48,767	| IOT169 |	People want to
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:51,839	| IOT169 |	Introduce Flo is a marketing product they can do that
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:54,911	| IOT169 |	But really we really want to make an impact on insurance
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:45:00,543	| IOT169 |	Really want to make an impact on how often homeowners are being inconvenienced by water damage
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,335	| IOT169 |	So far there's a lot of
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,383	| IOT169 |	Talk and I think that you are seeing
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,151	| IOT169 |	Startup insurance
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:12,063	| IOT169 |	Are seeing the opportunity and are moving you know very quickly to adopt iot and really big That Into You Know.
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:14,879	| IOT169 |	The way that they are offering Insurance in the way that they're
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:16,415	| IOT169 |	Apple protecting home so
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,439	| IOT169 |	If they don't
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,975	| IOT169 |	To get it together that's right
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,023	| IOT169 |	The disruption
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,047	| IOT169 |	Is really going to happen
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:23,839	| IOT169 |	I will say Stacy there was one
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:25,119	| IOT169 |	Gaia can't name is
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:31,263	| IOT169 |	Name cuz we were under Andy and I can't even name the insurance company but there was one executive from one of the top five insurance
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:34,079	| IOT169 |	They said said to me you know what some point the insurance
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,871	| IOT169 |	Industry just needs
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:37,407	| IOT169 |	Look at each other
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,687	| IOT169 |	And say hey
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:40,479	| IOT169 |	This is a great thing
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:42,271	| IOT169 |	You know we can test this
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:43,039	| IOT169 |	And I mean
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:43,807	| IOT169 |	Are products
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:45,343	| IOT169 |	She's probably been tested by most
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:47,647	| IOT169 |	Insurance companies in there
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,415	| IOT169 |	Employee homes
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,695	| IOT169 |	And I know that they're just
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:51,487	| IOT169 |	They're all their eyes light up when they
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:58,143	| IOT169 |	You know in real-time they can see what's happening with their homes water it'll shut off the water for them automatically
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,703	| IOT169 |	So at some point the executives
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:04,031	| IOT169 |	You know on the business side need to go back to the x-rays and just say hey
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:04,799	| IOT169 |	We don't
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,567	| IOT169 |	Need
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,591	| IOT169 |	50000
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:08,383	| IOT169 |	Years worth of data
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:14,015	| IOT169 |	Like this is just a great thing and it's logical that this is going to help drive down claim and we have to
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:14,527	| IOT169 |	To do something
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:18,111	| IOT169 |	And so what he believes was going to happen
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:21,183	| IOT169 |	Is that at some point you're just going to get
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:27,327	| IOT169 |	A bunch of people together in a company that just said this is too good to pass up we need to do something aggressive here
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,863	| IOT169 |	And I kind of share that thought with
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,655	| IOT169 |	I don't know if that act
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,423	| IOT169 |	Actuarial
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:33,471	| IOT169 |	50000 years of data is
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,007	| IOT169 |	Is going to happen before
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:41,407	| IOT169 |	You just got a few people that are thinking logically that are just willing to put their neck on the line and say this is something we have to adopt
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:43,199	| IOT169 |	That's more likely to happen first
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:48,831	| IOT169 |	And if they don't it feels like they risk being cut out and there's a lot of opportunities
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:52,927	| IOT169 |	According to McKinsey
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:56,255	| IOT169 |	The insurance company like Google or Amazon
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,583	| IOT169 |	And create an insurance product
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:03,679	| IOT169 |	Corporates connected devices that would be a much better deal
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:05,471	| IOT169 |	For consumers because they would have
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,239	| IOT169 |	Again
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:08,543	| IOT169 |	Products like yours as part of that portfolio
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,311	| IOT169 |	Unclaimed sky
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:10,079	| IOT169 |	Process
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:10,847	| IOT169 |	Policy pricing
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:13,151	| IOT169 |	Do you think that's feasible
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:14,687	| IOT169 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:16,991	| IOT169 |	I think that not only are we going to
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:19,039	| IOT169 |	See those kind of companies
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:19,551	| IOT169 |	Adopt
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:22,623	| IOT169 |	The right Technologies in the more aggressive way
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:24,159	| IOT169 |	They're going to know what to do with all the
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,951	| IOT169 |	Data link right now
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:27,999	| IOT169 |	Even you know I have a nest in my house
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:29,023	| IOT169 |	I have
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:30,303	| IOT169 |	Ring doorbell I have
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:31,583	| IOT169 |	My flow device
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:37,983	| IOT169 |	And none of them are really talking to each other at least in a very smart way that's helping to
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:40,543	| IOT169 |	Protect my home and giving me multiples
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:41,567	| IOT169 |	On that invest
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:42,847	| IOT169 |	With my device
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,383	| IOT169 |	With the flow device
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,407	| IOT169 |	Installed in a home
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:50,783	| IOT169 |	Like I said before we're collecting data every second of the day and so we know when
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:52,575	| IOT169 |	People are home and not home
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,855	| IOT169 |	Just based on their water
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:57,439	| IOT169 |	So at some point you're going to see
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,719	| IOT169 |	When the flow device
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,255	| IOT169 |	Shows that there's been no water use
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:05,119	| IOT169 |	DiGiorno flushes of a toilet for example for 24 hours but the alarm has
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:07,423	| IOT169 |	You should get a ping
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:12,799	| IOT169 |	You should probably set your alarm it doesn't look like you're home because you haven't had any water running here
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:16,895	| IOT169 |	Once you are able to connect all of these different devices
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:19,455	| IOT169 |	You're going to get a home that's much more resilient
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:20,991	| IOT169 |	Much smarter
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:23,551	| IOT169 |	And I think that the way that it's looking
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:28,415	| IOT169 |	It's much more likely than Amazon or Google is going to come in and do that rather than
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:29,439	| IOT169 |	And insurance
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:36,095	| IOT169 |	Do you think customers and consumers are going to be excited about sharing all that data providers
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:37,887	| IOT169 |	I think it's all about
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:38,655	| IOT169 |	What's a quid pro quo
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,191	| IOT169 |	I think that
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:43,775	| IOT169 |	Data can be used as a currency so today we don't
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,055	| IOT169 |	Volunteer
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:46,335	| IOT169 |	Homeowners data
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:47,359	| IOT169 |	To share with
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:48,639	| IOT169 |	Insurance Company
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:49,407	| IOT169 |	However
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:52,223	| IOT169 |	If a homeowner would like to get some kind of an
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:53,247	| IOT169 |	Incentive from their care
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:55,295	| IOT169 |	And their carrier will offer that in
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:56,575	| IOT169 |	Incentive in exchange
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:49:01,183	| IOT169 |	Or some sharing of data then that's a decision that the homeowner
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,975	| IOT169 |	Should be able to make on their own
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:04,767	| IOT169 |	If they don't want to share the data then
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:09,375	| IOT169 |	You know they don't have to accept whatever the insurance company is offering
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:15,775	| IOT169 |	So I think that it's a decision that homeowners have to make I think it's an option for them ultimately I do think they will
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:20,895	| IOT169 |	Will share their data as long as it's used in a responsible way it will make their premium
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:22,431	| IOT169 |	Lower not just because of
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,479	| IOT169 |	The incentive that they're getting from
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:30,367	| IOT169 |	The insurance carrier for the adoption But ultimately when you bring all of these different data points together
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:34,207	| IOT169 |	It's just going to make the home smarter and better able to protect you
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:38,303	| IOT169 |	Which will ultimately mean lower premium so I really do believe that it's in everybody's best
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:40,863	| IOT169 |	Pinterest you mentioned earlier some of the
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:42,911	| IOT169 |	Cool things that we can do with water in
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:44,447	| IOT169 |	So I'm curious
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:50,847	| IOT169 |	So when you can just learn a lot about
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:51,615	| IOT169 |	Homeowners
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:53,919	| IOT169 |	You can learn a lot about how they interact
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:55,967	| IOT169 |	With their home one of the things that I've been
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:57,503	| IOT169 |	Discussing with insurance
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:50:00,575	| IOT169 |	Carriers and the light bulb goes off they get it is
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:01,599	| IOT169 |	When you
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:02,879	| IOT169 |	Receiving alert
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:05,695	| IOT169 |	From Flo that for example you have high
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:06,207	| IOT169 |	Water pressure
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:13,631	| IOT169 |	High water pressure essentially is like high blood pressure in your body if you have high blood pressure for long periods of time
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:14,399	| IOT169 |	That's putting under
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:17,727	| IOT169 |	The Strain on your veins or arteries eventually organs.
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:20,799	| IOT169 |	When you have high water pressure in
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:21,823	| IOT169 |	On your pipes that me
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:22,335	| IOT169 |	Means that you're putting
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:24,127	| IOT169 |	Do strain on your pipes
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:29,247	| IOT169 |	Your fixtures your appliances and eventually something will burst this is part of the preventive side of our technology
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:31,295	| IOT169 |	So when you have this data
EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:32,063	| IOT169 |	And you have these
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:33,599	| IOT169 |	Set alerts from Flo they're telling you
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:40,255	| IOT169 |	Hey you got high water pressure this is a maintenance opportunity you got to do something about it and I'll let say that the homeowner ignores those
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:42,559	| IOT169 |	They throw caution to the wind
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:43,583	| IOT169 |	No they don't do anything
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:45,887	| IOT169 |	Now I think that says something
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:46,655	| IOT169 |	About
EDL	00:50:46,655	00:50:48,447	| IOT169 |	Potentially that homo
EDL	00:50:48,959	00:50:51,775	| IOT169 |	Is that the same kind of homeowner that leaves their doors unlock
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,079	| IOT169 |	Doesn't set their alarm
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:55,359	| IOT169 |	Smell gas and doesn't do any
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:57,919	| IOT169 |	I think there's a lot that in
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:58,431	| IOT169 |	Insurance
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:00,735	| IOT169 |	Learn about customer
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:02,015	| IOT169 |	Behavior and I don't
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:06,879	| IOT169 |	Mean to suggest that you know homeowner should be scared of data I think what this is doing is
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:08,159	| IOT169 |	It's offering more
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:09,439	| IOT169 |	Opportunities
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:10,719	| IOT169 |	For homeowners
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:11,487	| IOT169 |	To see what happen
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:12,511	| IOT169 |	Behind the black box
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,303	| IOT169 |	That is their Plumbing
EDL	00:51:14,303	00:51:15,071	| IOT169 |	Behind all these different
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:18,143	| IOT169 |	I think the key to a smart home is
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:19,167	| IOT169 |	Having a home that's
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:20,703	| IOT169 |	More thoughtful that suggest
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:24,543	| IOT169 |	To you when there are different problems lurking when you need to act
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:29,407	| IOT169 |	And not just you know being able to open and close your door by pushing a button
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:32,223	| IOT169 |	I think it's really about having a home that's smarter that better put
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,783	| IOT169 |	XU so that's one of the things that I'm
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:35,807	| IOT169 |	Suggesting about
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:38,367	| IOT169 |	Water data I think it's a great indicator of
EDL	00:51:38,879	00:51:40,415	| IOT169 |	Not only occupancy
EDL	00:51:40,415	00:51:43,487	| IOT169 |	But it's a great lens into all of the different Acts
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:48,095	| IOT169 |	Cavities in the home and being able to better protect you from a number of different dimensions
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:49,631	| IOT169 |	Awesome
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:53,471	| IOT169 |	Because sometimes I am
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:57,567	| IOT169 |	I am curious to see this Brave New World
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:00,127	| IOT169 |	Thank you so much for coming on the show this
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:06,015	| IOT169 |	Thanks for having me Stacy appreciate it thanks so much for listening
