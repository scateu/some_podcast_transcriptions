EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,304	| IOT157 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,072	| IOT157 |	Probably
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:14,400	| IOT157 |	Men that feel like there's two big stories this week there's like
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,168	| IOT157 |	The continuing
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,728	| IOT157 |	Privacy debacle is everyone's like holy cow
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,008	| IOT157 |	These companies are collecting your data
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,312	| IOT157 |	And then on the iot side
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:21,824	| IOT157 |	Weave
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,616	| IOT157 |	Combine Belkin witch
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,920	| IOT157 |	I know that when you saw that you sent me
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,712	| IOT157 |	And emailed it so eloquent
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,992	| IOT157 |	I said whoa
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,320	| IOT157 |	But all I can think of at the time now
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,624	| IOT157 |	I thought that too that was my splits I was like
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,904	| IOT157 |	Actually I think was more like
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,952	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:42,560	| IOT157 |	Let's start with that Foxconn which is a contract manufacturer that we all know and love
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,328	| IOT157 |	Because they
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,352	| IOT157 |	Make the iPhone
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:51,264	| IOT157 |	They build a lot of products that you probably not aware of yes the iPhone but also laptops by other manufacturers
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,056	| IOT157 |	Windows machines in particular
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,336	| IOT157 |	I think they may
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,872	| IOT157 |	Put some Chromebooks together but
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:03:03,040	| IOT157 |	Yeah I mean they must remind me of HTC if you're familiar with HTC which many people are not these days because they're kind
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:03,808	| IOT157 |	Going downhill
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,344	| IOT157 |	They were at like a manufacturer
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,112	| IOT157 |	Picture of phones
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:10,464	| IOT157 |	Specifically and then decided to Branch out and make their own stuff
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:14,304	| IOT157 |	And put their brand and logo on things and I don't know if that's what fox
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:16,864	| IOT157 |	Complaints to do I suspect actually not
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:21,472	| IOT157 |	If they purchase Belkin for the 866 million dollars that they plan to spend on it
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:27,616	| IOT157 |	I don't think a Belkin name goes away I don't think you see Foxconn on anyting
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,456	| IOT157 |	Most of you guys are probably some
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| IOT157 |	Belkin owns
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:33,760	| IOT157 |	Couple things that
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,552	| IOT157 |	Like hey it's the Belkin
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,832	| IOT157 |	Batteries cables
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,880	| IOT157 |	Accessories
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:44,256	| IOT157 |	Absolutely so they do all that but they also own the WeMo brand of connected home devices
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,048	| IOT157 |	Which includes Outlets
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,096	| IOT157 |	Lights switches and
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,168	| IOT157 |	Pics of sensors they also own fin
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:54,496	| IOT157 |	I got a joint venture with fin which actually is a smart leak detection
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:58,592	| IOT157 |	Company that is actually sold through plumber so it's a different distribution
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| IOT157 |	It's not right to consume
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:06,016	| IOT157 |	And then they also have the Linksys brand of routers that way back in the day Cisco bought Linksys
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,784	| IOT157 |	Because you know
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,808	| IOT157 |	Radish Wikipedia
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:10,880	| IOT157 |	Hot Because the Internet was going to be hot and then Cisco is like
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,696	| IOT157 |	Falcon
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,000	| IOT157 |	All of these things are now
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,536	| IOT157 |	Possibly going to Foxconn
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:23,423	| IOT157 |	I say possibly because this is a deal that probably will be subject to approval from the US committee on foreign
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:23,935	| IOT157 |	Investment
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,215	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,495	| IOT157 |	Dismay
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,519	| IOT157 |	Not happen
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| IOT157 |	This committee has recent
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,103	| IOT157 |	The kibosh on broadcom
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,639	| IOT157 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:38,527	| IOT157 |	And that idea here is that you don't want to let foreign companies by strategic assets for the
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:43,391	| IOT157 |	I would imagine that the same committee that's involved with saying
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:49,791	| IOT157 |	Don't buy Huawei phones in the US which apparently had to carrier deals earlier this year
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,351	| IOT157 |	Basically fall through Verizon and AT&T
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:56,703	| IOT157 |	So you can't buy Huawei phones unless you buy direct or through
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,727	| IOT157 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,799	| IOT157 |	Payback Best Buy's dropping a line as well for the same types of recents
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,639	| IOT157 |	Sew-in given this Administration which we just don't know how this
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,687	| IOT157 |	So there's that
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| IOT157 |	Now what
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,223	| IOT157 |	I think it's kind of
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,271	| IOT157 |	Interesting here in Kevin and I tried to find a
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,551	| IOT157 |	Got this out we don't know who makes
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,671	| IOT157 |	Has been in business since 1983
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:20,255	| IOT157 |	Its Revenue last year was what was its Revenue Kevin
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:26,655	| IOT157 |	700 and let me get the exact number for 789 million
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT157 |	Dollars
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| IOT157 |	This is not
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,495	| IOT157 |	Awesome deal this is not
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:35,871	| IOT157 |	Exactly this sounds like maybe welcome site
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| IOT157 |	Let's have an X
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,223	| IOT157 |	So what I find most interesting is
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,247	| IOT157 |	This idea
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,319	| IOT157 |	Contract manufacturers getting into
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:49,695	| IOT157 |	Its own branded line of stuff so is it going to what does that mean for a company like Flex
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,511	| IOT157 |	Here in the US that are also big contra
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,535	| IOT157 |	Best manufacturers
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:58,911	| IOT157 |	They've actually seen their businesses change a lot all of these companies in the last cup
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,447	| IOT157 |	Couple of years probably
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:05,055	| IOT157 |	Last for five years as more connected devices come on the
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,127	| IOT157 |	So they're investing a lot in
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:12,991	| IOT157 |	Helping companies that were not in the tech manufacturing space get into
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,783	| IOT157 |	It's so when I visited Flex
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,551	| IOT157 |	Example of couple
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:21,183	| IOT157 |	It's back I saw that they had a partnership with a clothing manufacturer to make smart clothing
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,951	| IOT157 |	And
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,255	| IOT157 |	They had a whole team of Engineers that
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:27,327	| IOT157 |	Just like testing out crazy stuff to offer
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,631	| IOT157 |	Non tech companies in Partnership
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:34,751	| IOT157 |	And I thought that was kind of like an interesting way to move that business forward a little bit
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:40,895	| IOT157 |	I'm curious if we'll see them try to buy their own stuff and kind of go upmarket if you remember it's a possibility
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:41,919	| IOT157 |	I don't know
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:48,831	| IOT157 |	Yeah I don't know if that's a tough call it and it's I think it's very challenging for a contract manufacturer to do their own thing
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:54,975	| IOT157 |	You know they're behind the scenes company they're not known to Consumers by name I don't know I mean
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:07:00,351	| IOT157 |	Part of me says maybe they're buying this for the patents apparently r700 patents involved in this deal as well
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,143	| IOT157 |	Petabytes
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,727	| IOT157 |	I know they were saying and we're about to see a lot of patent Act
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,495	| IOT157 |	Activity in
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,007	| IOT157 |	Consumer IO
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,055	| IOT157 |	He's so maybe but
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,335	| IOT157 |	I don't know
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,103	| IOT157 |	I just I feel like
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,687	| IOT157 |	It's tough for a company like this to
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,967	| IOT157 |	Make your own
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,015	| IOT157 |	Stuff and sell and also make
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:22,623	| IOT157 |	Gear for other companies that may compete in the same space that that's going to be an issue I think
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:28,255	| IOT157 |	And for consumers that are sitting there going to wait I liked my Belkin stuff
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:33,119	| IOT157 |	For the US and now I don't know if I'm going to trust routers from China I thought this instantly
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,143	| IOT157 |	I was like
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,447	| IOT157 |	China is a scary place with a surveillance technology
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| IOT157 |	Bent
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,775	| IOT157 |	But I would say to you that
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,823	| IOT157 |	A lot of you probably have tp-link
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,591	| IOT157 |	Gear with
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,103	| IOT157 |	Which is a Chinese
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| IOT157 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:47,967	| IOT157 |	Maybe
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,479	| IOT157 |	Maybe you should
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,271	| IOT157 |	I do that feels like
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,087	| IOT157 |	That is what we know about this deal
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,671	| IOT157 |	So let's move on to our other big story which is
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,183	| IOT157 |	Facebook
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,535	| IOT157 |	We'll just call it Facebook and just data
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,839	| IOT157 |	Data over Beach I mean
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:07,423	| IOT157 |	Everybody coming to grips and being aware that this is happening
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,703	| IOT157 |	When we've been talking about it
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,727	| IOT157 |	Are your side
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:16,127	| IOT157 |	Yeah I mean we all knew that Facebook and they're not the only one obviously but Facebook was collecting our data
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:16,895	| IOT157 |	Right
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,687	| IOT157 |	You always say you are the product
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| IOT157 |	You're using something like Facebook
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,015	| IOT157 |	This is a mess because
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:28,415	| IOT157 |	It's still a question of did Facebook really do anything wrong when it comes to third parties getting access to that
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| IOT157 |	Data
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:32,767	| IOT157 |	Through various apis and creating apps on Facebook
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| IOT157 |	Quizzes and so on and so forth
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,583	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:40,703	| IOT157 |	I'm still in kind of trying figure out do I blame Facebook or do I not for one thing and I don't know how you feel about that
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,495	| IOT157 |	I think what we're
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,775	| IOT157 |	This is an apple
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| IOT157 |	I think this is us coming to Reckoning
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,895	| IOT157 |	Reckoning with the model that we built
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,223	| IOT157 |	And you see this in this type of
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:56,319	| IOT157 |	Conversation but you also see this right now with all the paintballs that are being erected
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,343	| IOT157 |	For various
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,367	| IOT157 |	Journalism sites
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,903	| IOT157 |	Write the internet used to be
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,927	| IOT157 |	Free and
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,743	| IOT157 |	Everybody was open it was free it was all these things
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| IOT157 |	And what's happening is
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,095	| IOT157 |	We're gradually locking away parts of
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:15,519	| IOT157 |	That doesn't have to be a bad thing I know you know anytime you take away something that was free it feels awful but it's all
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,847	| IOT157 |	I also like we talked about with iot the business models
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:22,943	| IOT157 |	But we've accepted somewhere like wait a second what is this mean
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,223	| IOT157 |	Maybe I don't want to accept that
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,783	| IOT157 |	I don't think people really understood
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,319	| IOT157 |	Entirely
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,367	| IOT157 |	Not what they were getting into but the ramen
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| IOT157 |	Applications of
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| IOT157 |	And you can see these ramifications
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,463	| IOT157 |	Like we talked about
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,535	| IOT157 |	Digitization makes everything searchable by
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,887	| IOT157 |	So it's much more accessible in a way that it isn't mine just
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,655	| IOT157 |	You're relying on
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,423	| IOT157 |	People's memory
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,447	| IOT157 |	Right and then
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:48,799	| IOT157 |	It is also stored forever even these stupid things that you don't even
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:52,383	| IOT157 |	And it can be instantly search so
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:58,527	| IOT157 |	When you have those dumb tweets that you fired off at 2 a.m. during your college Years you know that maybe you're like
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,551	| IOT157 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,063	| IOT157 |	I don't think that
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,367	| IOT157 |	It's still there
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:06,207	| IOT157 |	And that people are coming to terms with that they're like I don't like that that's scary
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:08,767	| IOT157 |	And I think the next step is
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,559	| IOT157 |	Realizing that could be used for
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,119	| IOT157 |	4 and we talked about this a lot on the show but things like
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,703	| IOT157 |	China's kind of surveillance State and what they're doing with their
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,727	| IOT157 |	Social credit
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,263	| IOT157 |	That's
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| IOT157 |	We're not that far from it
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:25,151	| IOT157 |	I mean ensures they look at in credit card companies they look at Facebook
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,687	| IOT157 |	Understand your credit report
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,271	| IOT157 |	You're right when you say it's we're not that far away and and
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:36,671	| IOT157 |	China is a perfect example because I don't remember exactly when but I'm going to guess about six months ago so we
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| IOT157 |	First started on the show talking about the scoring
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,791	| IOT157 |	That China is using for all of its citizens
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:44,351	| IOT157 |	At the time like I wonder what they're going to do with that
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:47,679	| IOT157 |	And since then they've done a lot with that in just before the show
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| IOT157 |	You would point out an article where
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,287	| IOT157 |	Now if you are jaywalking and
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,079	| IOT157 |	Shanghai I guess it is
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,103	| IOT157 |	Shenzhen
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,639	| IOT157 |	If your jaywalking in Shenzhen
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,431	| IOT157 |	A camera will notice
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:01,247	| IOT157 |	You use facial recognition through the system
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| IOT157 |	To find out who you are
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,575	| IOT157 |	Put your photo up near that
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,879	| IOT157 |	Street and then send you a text message for your fine
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,647	| IOT157 |	Mean
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,671	| IOT157 |	This is moving
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,487	| IOT157 |	Fast once you have a date at start figuring out how to use it
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:16,095	| IOT157 |	I want to see a quick and easy implementation cuz I know it's not but if that's what it seems like from the outside
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,935	| IOT157 |	Yeah and that is a fully automated Circle right
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| IOT157 |	That is like
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT157 |	You break the law
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,007	| IOT157 |	Like a camera sees it
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,311	| IOT157 |	Publicly shame you
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,151	| IOT157 |	I mean ask it all happened before you have finished crossing the street at the
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,199	| IOT157 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,735	| IOT157 |	And then everyone
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| IOT157 |	Fat guy
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,599	| IOT157 |	Don't be that guy
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,647	| IOT157 |	So bringing this back to Facebook cuz
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,183	| IOT157 |	That's where I
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,999	| IOT157 |	I feel like I can look what I brought these kind of examples up to
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,815	| IOT157 |	Because maybe they didn't read dystopia
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,327	| IOT157 |	In science fiction
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,399	| IOT157 |	I'm like hey guys this is
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,191	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| IOT157 |	You know what would make him stop laughing
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,311	| IOT157 |	Doing what I did what's all this news had a couple days back
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:00,383	| IOT157 |	And I don't know if you did but I would recommend everybody do this just to get
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| IOT157 |	Some perceptions
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,455	| IOT157 |	Ideas on visualization here
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,503	| IOT157 |	I downloaded my data file from
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,039	| IOT157 |	Facebook and I went through it
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:10,623	| IOT157 |	And mine was not as bad as some people because a lot of people are complaining that
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:15,743	| IOT157 |	Every single call but they have made on their phone or phones that they had Facebook install on
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:19,071	| IOT157 |	There was a log of those calls who they called how long he spoke etcetera Etc
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:22,143	| IOT157 |	I did not have that aspect of it because
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,959	| IOT157 |	Turns out I never enable Messenger to have
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,519	| IOT157 |	My phone number Access and so on so forth
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,287	| IOT157 |	But
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,823	| IOT157 |	All of my contacts
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,847	| IOT157 |	Friends
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| IOT157 |	Place I checked in
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,919	| IOT157 |	Every post
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,943	| IOT157 |	Every
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,503	| IOT157 |	Photo it's all there I mean I did was a large file
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:43,903	| IOT157 |	I would recommend people do that just to get some scoop on what they really have you don't think about it but when you see it
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,743	| IOT157 |	It makes you could be a wake-up call in some people need I think
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,047	| IOT157 |	Yeah well in mind I actually
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,583	| IOT157 |	I never had Facebook on my phone
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:52,863	| IOT157 |	I don't know
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| IOT157 |	Xiamen Facebook
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,703	| IOT157 |	But I did it for Instagram
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:03,103	| IOT157 |	I had to say yes and then I noticed that yes oh my gosh it had all my calls and that's a
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:03,871	| IOT157 |	Journalist that's terrifying
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,663	| IOT157 |	Alex just because
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,943	| IOT157 |	And are you have sources that you're trying to
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:07,967	| IOT157 |	At 10
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,271	| IOT157 |	Think about God what do they know
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,087	| IOT157 |	The other thing I can recommend is if you go to Google
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,135	| IOT157 |	Dot-com take out
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,415	| IOT157 |	You can get your Google
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,951	| IOT157 |	Which is actually to me
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,743	| IOT157 |	In some ways its carrier
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,791	| IOT157 |	Because it's so much more
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| IOT157 |	But it's also I knew Google was doing
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,959	| IOT157 |	And I will also say that Google builds a lot of products that make
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,751	| IOT157 |	Really convenient to share
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT157 |	The stuff with him
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,543	| IOT157 |	I'm not saying that's better
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,823	| IOT157 |	But I am saying that
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,127	| IOT157 |	You know I feel like I get more bang for my buck from Google
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:41,247	| IOT157 |	Ian Connor related it to because I can test back to Facebook in a second so bear with me
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,783	| IOT157 |	A lot of
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,063	| IOT157 |	People complain about
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,599	| IOT157 |	Privacy aspect of Google
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| IOT157 |	Which I totally got
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:51,231	| IOT157 |	You're getting free products and services they're getting your data they're getting ad Revenue Etc
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:55,071	| IOT157 |	That's all on the consumer side if you don't want that you can actually pay
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,119	| IOT157 |	Free G suite and a Google account
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,191	| IOT157 |	Gmail and all that so much less
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,215	| IOT157 |	You can't do anything
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,751	| IOT157 |	Well
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:06,591	| IOT157 |	They don't have the data now so you're not going to get targeted ads and so on and so forth
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| IOT157 |	But you're right
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,943	| IOT157 |	There's a convenience factor you give up you couldn't complain
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:13,247	| IOT157 |	Me all the time about this and complain
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,807	| IOT157 |	You can't use Google assistant on Google home
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,599	| IOT157 |	To its fullest extent with your
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,927	| IOT157 |	Book techniques that with your G Suite account that you have cuz you pay for that
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,463	| IOT157 |	And Google doesn't mine that data
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:26,303	| IOT157 |	So bring it back to Facebook I meant to do that for a sorry
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| IOT157 |	Would people actually
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,375	| IOT157 |	Consider paying for Facebook
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,679	| IOT157 |	As opposed to using it for free
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:37,823	| IOT157 |	And not having Facebook collect maybe as much then again it gets back to that lack of convenience you won't be able to do as much with I don't know I don't know the answer
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:41,151	| IOT157 |	Well the challenge with paying for Facebook is
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:45,503	| IOT157 |	I think if you want people to pay for things you have to become a truly Universal kind
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| IOT157 |	Platform
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,831	| IOT157 |	Standard right and I don't know if Facebook is actually there
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,647	| IOT157 |	So that's it and we talked about this
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,439	| IOT157 |	For the show but we were talking about cuz
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,511	| IOT157 |	Facebook the big story for this weekend
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,023	| IOT157 |	Facebook
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,839	| IOT157 |	Is that the data kerfuffle his
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| IOT157 |	Let It Go
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,679	| IOT157 |	Decide not to release some smart home
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,191	| IOT157 |	Products
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,239	| IOT157 |	At f8 in May
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:09,311	| IOT157 |	So there's two stories one is from Bloomberg
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,871	| IOT157 |	Saying that it won't release its smart speaker
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,407	| IOT157 |	And then
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,223	| IOT157 |	The information has a story talking about
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:20,319	| IOT157 |	A device called portal that would use facial recognition technology
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| IOT157 |	To help set up video
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,879	| IOT157 |	Friends and family
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:23,647	| IOT157 |	Facebook
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,975	| IOT157 |	On that device now plans to process and store the video data
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,255	| IOT157 |	On it rather than in the
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:28,767	| IOT157 |	Company servers
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| IOT157 |	And they might even
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,583	| IOT157 |	Andele por
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:37,727	| IOT157 |	I would imagine that's tied to that the smart home speaker or display smart
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,495	| IOT157 |	Screen
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,519	| IOT157 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,335	| IOT157 |	I got to be honest do you know anybody that wants
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:46,175	| IOT157 |	It's a product like that from Facebook to begin with even before this date of thing I don't
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,199	| IOT157 |	I can't
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,223	| IOT157 |	I just don't
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:55,135	| IOT157 |	I don't I mean Facebook has so many users in so many people use messenger like as their default communication between the
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,647	| IOT157 |	My friend so
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:59,231	| IOT157 |	So maybe something like this but this gets to what we were talking to
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,791	| IOT157 |	My brother uses messenger
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:02,559	| IOT157 |	I do not
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,863	| IOT157 |	So we communicate via text
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,887	| IOT157 |	Because he
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,447	| IOT157 |	Do you know he sends me messages and I'm like
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,471	| IOT157 |	I'm not inside
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:11,775	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:13,823	| IOT157 |	Horrifying
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,407	| IOT157 |	I don't have an Amazon to talk to some people in
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:20,479	| IOT157 |	Facebook speaker to talk to some other people in like it's like the
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,015	| IOT157 |	Free carterfone
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,783	| IOT157 |	Landlines
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,855	| IOT157 |	The makery
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:29,951	| IOT157 |	And then I realize a lot of people to use Facebook for day-to-day message
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:34,559	| IOT157 |	I use it when I'm on an Android phone with my family because they're all on iPhones I couldn't
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:39,167	| IOT157 |	You know I can't use iMessage and text and all that but they complain whatever
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:43,007	| IOT157 |	Yeah that's it is a mess right now it is
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,287	| IOT157 |	All right
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,567	| IOT157 |	So let's move on
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,383	| IOT157 |	From things that are messy to
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,663	| IOT157 |	Things that are
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:54,271	| IOT157 |	Positive I don't know if it's positive now that we've discussed all this mess but you got a survey from JFK
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:59,135	| IOT157 |	Found it over 1/4 so 27% of us consumers have more than
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| IOT157 |	3 smart home devices
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,951	| IOT157 |	And another
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| IOT157 |	7%
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| IOT157 |	On two or three
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,535	| IOT157 |	It's actually less than
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:11,167	| IOT157 |	So 34% have two or more is another way of saying it I don't know they surveyed
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,263	| IOT157 |	So that's
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:20,127	| IOT157 |	Yeah and that surprises me a little bit too because it's usually if you buy a smart speaker you tend to buy
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,663	| IOT157 |	More of them
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:25,503	| IOT157 |	For other rooms and that's why we have these small products like the echo
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,295	| IOT157 |	. in the home mini and so on
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:31,135	| IOT157 |	Sorry I'm a little surprised that it's low on terms of owning multiple
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,415	| IOT157 |	Mayan
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,535	| IOT157 |	Yeah I mean I can see if you would hang out in one main room and
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| IOT157 |	But not
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| IOT157 |	You know I can see it
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,863	| IOT157 |	Course the group that owns
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:44,191	| IOT157 |	The most is Millennials age 25 to 34
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:47,775	| IOT157 |	Their ownership is at 64%
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,615	| IOT157 |	They seem to be the type of people that I guess I'm talking about in terms of having one for every room
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:56,735	| IOT157 |	What we just talked about almost 7 and 10
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| IOT157 |	Millennials
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:58,783	| IOT157 |	Expect devices from
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:17:59,807	| IOT157 |	Avengers 2
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:03,903	| IOT157 |	That's right cuz people do not want to be in these
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,207	| IOT157 |	Ecosystems get that through your head
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| IOT157 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,511	| IOT157 |	I agree
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,023	| IOT157 |	I agree
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:13,631	| IOT157 |	Before we forget only cuz this is related to I know we're going to go to some other smaller news items
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:17,215	| IOT157 |	I noticed that the UK has put a draft out

EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,536	| IOT157 |	Awful maybe because I didn't
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:25,632	| IOT157 |	Connect Google pay to assistant maybe I have to do that first I don't know
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,168	| IOT157 |	But
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,192	| IOT157 |	What are the steps that you
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,240	| IOT157 |	Or what does it say you should do and what
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,592	| IOT157 |	I don't know if there are any steps other than having

EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:40,480	| IOT157 |	The recipient will have to have Google pay to receive the funds
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:46,112	| IOT157 |	You even get to that part though I don't think that's it
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:49,184	| IOT157 |	I don't think that's it and I know that eventually they're just going to have a
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,464	| IOT157 |	A separate
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:54,048	| IOT157 |	App for this a Google pay send app for peer-to-peer payments but
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,072	| IOT157 |	Odd
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,376	| IOT157 |	Can I use it on an Android phone to
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,168	| IOT157 |	All right
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,936	| IOT157 |	Well
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,216	| IOT157 |	Seriously this is possible
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,128	| IOT157 |	Little Google story Philips Hue scenes are Now natively supported by
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,152	| IOT157 |	Assistant
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,712	| IOT157 |	Yay

EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| IOT157 |	If you can remember them
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| IOT157 |	You can now use Google Assistant
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| IOT157 |	Send it to actually play the scene
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| IOT157 |	That is correct
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,608	| IOT157 |	It's in the home control settings of the Google home app so you have to do that
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,400	| IOT157 |	They originally supported
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:36,800	| IOT157 |	Not reason but eventually supported Philips Hue Lights just for the basics right the lights yes but not the same so that's the part that's new
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,824	| IOT157 |	Yes and
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,384	| IOT157 |	You can always support your
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:44,224	| IOT157 |	Seems like you know me or SmartThings
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| IOT157 |	And those also work
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,040	| IOT157 |	Assistant so this is just native
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,672	| IOT157 |	I did notice that Google and Amazon both have a different
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,720	| IOT157 |	Feeling for what a warm white light is
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,536	| IOT157 |	I don't know what I did a video on it and I was like
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:02,656	| IOT157 |	That's weird but if I tell Google to turn my living room lights to a warm White
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,216	| IOT157 |	It turns it to a almost yellow color
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,264	| IOT157 |	But Amazon turns mine too
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,288	| IOT157 |	A white color
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:09,824	| IOT157 |	Daylight
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| IOT157 |	What they all need
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,688	| IOT157 |	All of these assistants need a setting for
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,224	| IOT157 |	You defining the
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,504	| IOT157 |	Color temperature
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,272	| IOT157 |	So that way
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,320	| IOT157 |	I'm going to disagree with you
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| IOT157 |	Because I don't have any people
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,136	| IOT157 |	I think they should have
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:28,512	| IOT157 |	Universal RGB code cuz that actually exist and they should adopt that
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:31,584	| IOT157 |	Lakeside whatever Phillips says is warm white they should
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,888	| IOT157 |	My hunch is the API
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:36,704	| IOT157 |	Could be
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:42,592	| IOT157 |	I'm going to keep it simple to not have to configure that I agree most people don't want to do that
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,128	| IOT157 |	But I'm not one of those people who want to do that
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,456	| IOT157 |	People like me
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,808	| IOT157 |	Louis, and I'm going to stay at in the middle
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,600	| IOT157 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:56,672	| IOT157 |	The lowest common denominator in the first place
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,816	| IOT157 |	We also have news from particle it is an iot development board
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,864	| IOT157 |	And they have
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT157 |	Acquired
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:08,192	| IOT157 |	A company called red bear labs
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| IOT157 |	It is
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,752	| IOT157 |	Weather
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,544	| IOT157 |	Closest professional partners
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,336	| IOT157 |	Redbear does
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| IOT157 |	They make
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,616	| IOT157 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,432	| IOT157 |	So this is basically
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,992	| IOT157 |	Is a company that's been making iot
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:24,320	| IOT157 |	Hardware platforms plus their device cloud and device OS
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,624	| IOT157 |	They really wanted to get deeper on to the
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,696	| IOT157 |	It's interesting that
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,720	| IOT157 |	Red bear
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,512	| IOT157 |	The first product was a Kickstarter
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,048	| IOT157 |	Yes just like particle
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,096	| IOT157 |	Oh well there you go
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,144	| IOT157 |	I'm interested seems interested in me.
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:41,728	| IOT157 |	A Kickstarter product would be eventually a company gets purchased but
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,288	| IOT157 |	I didn't know particle was a Kickstarter as well
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,592	| IOT157 |	Or maybe it was an Indiegogo
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,360	| IOT157 |	It was a crowdfund
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,968	| IOT157 |	Apparently the particle mesh boards that have
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,248	| IOT157 |	Paris latest
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,016	| IOT157 |	Version of
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,064	| IOT157 |	Hardware development kits
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,576	| IOT157 |	They have
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:59,136	| IOT157 |	Mesh capabilities for Wi-Fi Bluetooth
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,416	| IOT157 |	Is Aunt
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,184	| IOT157 |	I think cellular
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,696	| IOT157 |	Maybe
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,256	| IOT157 |	Baidu for cellular and yes
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,024	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,560	| IOT157 |	Those were developed in conjunction with
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:10,144	| IOT157 |	They're so you've already seen the results of their collaboration
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,960	| IOT157 |	Just to bring him on in
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,240	| IOT157 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:20,640	| IOT157 |	That is a little bit of news on that front it's it's actually good news because you know I remember when particle
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,920	| IOT157 |	Particle launched
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,944	| IOT157 |	They launched with
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,248	| IOT157 |	Dozens of other companies that
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,784	| IOT157 |	We're trading iot development
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,552	| IOT157 |	Forum boards
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,136	| IOT157 |	Very few of those companies are still around there are still some
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:32,928	| IOT157 |	Imagine
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,720	| IOT157 |	Most of them died or just cut it
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,280	| IOT157 |	Went away for lack of you so we're going to see a consolidation
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,352	| IOT157 |	And we also have August
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:43,936	| IOT157 |	We have been remiss we have not talked about these updates on the August
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,264	| IOT157 |	Locks and doorbell products but in the last month or so
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,568	| IOT157 |	I've been a couple big news items from them
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT157 |	At
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,128	| IOT157 |	Nice items will be honest
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:55,200	| IOT157 |	Is those of you guys who have an August doorbell
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:58,016	| IOT157 |	Like me now get 24 hours of
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,296	| IOT157 |	Recordings
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,064	| IOT157 |	Free
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:06,464	| IOT157 |	So this actually I thought was awesome because it's like the doorbell games getting kind of competitive now that Amazon has bought
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,488	| IOT157 |	Ring and
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,048	| IOT157 |	Lawsuits from
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,608	| IOT157 |	Skybell and nest
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,376	| IOT157 |	But their doorbell
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,168	| IOT157 |	Also basically
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,448	| IOT157 |	24-hours free
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,984	| IOT157 |	That's really useful
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,752	| IOT157 |	I think
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,544	| IOT157 |	Cuz if you missed the call you can go right back and see
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,360	| IOT157 |	And then they've been able to
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,384	| IOT157 |	Lock
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,408	| IOT157 |	On Siri
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,504	| IOT157 |	Yeah you can actually unlock
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,856	| IOT157 |	With Siri using anything but a homepod and I guess
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:40,256	| IOT157 |	The idea there is those are devices you carry with you where is the homepod is in your house or somebody might be able to scream through your door hey hey
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:40,768	| IOT157 |	Unlock the door
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,584	| IOT157 |	All right so, do you want to talk about the
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,096	| IOT157 |	Fibaro
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:48,448	| IOT157 |	I do I'm actually going to talk about two things because they're tied together
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:50,496	| IOT157 |	Because I couldn't use the fibaro plug
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:54,080	| IOT157 |	Until I set up the Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,616	| IOT157 |	SmartThings link
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:58,176	| IOT157 |	Because you need SmartThings for the fibaro plug
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,712	| IOT157 |	Well it's a Z-Wave plug
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| IOT157 |	I'll get more to that in a second
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:08,160	| IOT157 |	But I just want to mention poor folks who are familiar with SmartThings this basically this USB dongle of East
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,672	| IOT157 |	SmartThings link
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:14,304	| IOT157 |	Plugs into Nvidia Shield set-top box which is what I have and turns the set-top box into
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:16,096	| IOT157 |	A SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:19,680	| IOT157 |	I was not that familiar with SmartThings list my first real foray into things
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:23,008	| IOT157 |	With it I have taken everything off my wink hub
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,824	| IOT157 |	And set it up with SmartThings on the Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:30,176	| IOT157 |	And it's no different use the same SmartThings app use the classic app for now
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:34,016	| IOT157 |	And it was fantastic and in fact I'm finding that the
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,296	| IOT157 |	USB
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:38,624	| IOT157 |	Dongle which houses the zigbee and Z-Wave radios
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:42,720	| IOT157 |	Has much better range than I found in the past mother products hubs in particular
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:47,328	| IOT157 |	I don't have to put my Z-Wave devices for example real close to the hub
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,120	| IOT157 |	Which is outstanding so
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,912	| IOT157 |	Having said all that
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,448	| IOT157 |	What's the weather tomorrow plugged in
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,496	| IOT157 |	Because I had to use it with SmartThings
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:55,776	| IOT157 |	It's
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:58,336	| IOT157 |	It's very nicely designed it like all of them
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,896	| IOT157 |	List of all products it is essentially a
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,944	| IOT157 |	Three prong outlet that you plug in
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:08,576	| IOT157 |	It monitors in real-time the amount of energy that's being used by something is plugged into it
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:13,952	| IOT157 |	You can also know if you're using SmartThings you can turn it on and off remotely
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,744	| IOT157 |	Outside the US
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:18,304	| IOT157 |	Deport which is very very nice to have
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,072	| IOT157 |	And it's
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:24,960	| IOT157 |	Also designed so that it doesn't take up any rooms that you can still use the second Outlet in your wall which is awesome
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,568	| IOT157 |	Yeah this is a Z-Wave model again with the USB plug
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,336	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,872	| IOT157 |	The interesting thing is
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:38,016	| IOT157 |	Even with SmartThings and I had to install a custom device Handler that tomorrow provided me in order to get it to work with SmartThings
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,624	| IOT157 |	I can see it I can remotely turn it on and off in the app
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:48,256	| IOT157 |	I can see how much juice it's using right now our voicemail Raspberry Pi is running on it
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,792	| IOT157 |	It has even peaked at more than
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,584	| IOT157 |	2 Watts at any given time
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,120	| IOT157 |	So that's obviously a low-power device
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,680	| IOT157 |	The little LED ring around
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,704	| IOT157 |	The front
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,728	| IOT157 |	The plug
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:01,312	| IOT157 |	It will glow in a different color based on how much output
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:03,872	| IOT157 |	Energy is being used so that's really cool
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:10,016	| IOT157 |	I can't do much on the automation side and that's really because to do that you need the fibaro
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:13,600	| IOT157 |	Controller which is their Hub and I don't have that so I would love
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,392	| IOT157 |	Smart things to say
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,160	| IOT157 |	Hey when
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:20,256	| IOT157 |	Certain devices turned on in my wife's hair dryer in the morning after she takes a shower
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:23,328	| IOT157 |	Turn on the lights downstairs cuz that's what she's going next
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,864	| IOT157 |	Every single day without fail
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:27,168	| IOT157 |	But I can't do that type of automation
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:31,520	| IOT157 |	Solely through SmartThings unfortunately so if you're going to be limited if you don't have enough
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,288	| IOT157 |	Sbarro
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,056	| IOT157 |	Controller
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,080	| IOT157 |	Other than that
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,872	| IOT157 |	Really nice I like it
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,712	| IOT157 |	I like I like it and how much is it and would you pay that
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:46,112	| IOT157 |	It's you that's the thing tomorrow pricing there tend to be a little bit higher like if I go back to see my remote inside
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,672	| IOT157 |	Switch and I think that might have cost me thirty bucks
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:52,000	| IOT157 |	This Is 50 without the USB
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,280	| IOT157 |	60 with USB
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,352	| IOT157 |	You are
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,376	| IOT157 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,400	| IOT157 |	And now
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,424	| IOT157 |	Let's go

EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:32,960	| IOT157 |	And
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,520	| IOT157 |	Today we have a question from Dom about smart
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:40,896	| IOT157 |	Fox today's iot podcast listener hotline is brought to you by Schlage maker of electronic locks
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:45,760	| IOT157 |	Schlage electronic locks make life so much easier and more convenient

EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:54,464	| IOT157 |	Visit schlage.com to learn more
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:54,976	| IOT157 |	Hey Stacy
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,256	| IOT157 |	My name is Dom
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,816	| IOT157 |	Actually I find it a little bit ironic that
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:01,632	| IOT157 |	That message was brought to me by Schlage smart locks
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:03,680	| IOT157 |	Because I actually had a question about a Smart Lock
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,472	| IOT157 |	I was wondering I've been seeing
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,240	| IOT157 |	Smart locks around in
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,288	| IOT157 |	Interested in getting one
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,312	| IOT157 |	My house but
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,360	| IOT157 |	What is the
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:14,432	| IOT157 |	Standard for or what is the normal practice
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:16,224	| IOT157 |	What to do with the
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:20,576	| IOT157 |	Because usually I see the smart locks they only really replace
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,344	| IOT157 |	Like a deadbolt
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:22,880	| IOT157 |	Or like
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,184	| IOT157 |	Two smart locks
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:28,768	| IOT157 |	For one door or is there a Smart Lock where they're connected to
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,048	| IOT157 |	Or do you have
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:33,888	| IOT157 |	Smart deadbolt and then a regular door handle with a lock built in
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:38,496	| IOT157 |	Which kind of seems to me to defeat the purpose of having a Smart Lock if you have one of them
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,800	| IOT157 |	That's digitally locked in the other one that has to have
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,616	| IOT157 |	Cuz I ain't know the goal to me is to
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:45,664	| IOT157 |	Remove the key from the equation that way
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,200	| IOT157 |	With you
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,480	| IOT157 |	So I was
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,528	| IOT157 |	Just curious whether you have done
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,808	| IOT157 |	This on at your house
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,880	| IOT157 |	Speak on that topic or
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,648	| IOT157 |	You've heard of
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:58,720	| IOT157 |	Anyone else doing it I just don't know what to do like what's the standard package
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:01,024	| IOT157 |	When you're replacing regular locks
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:01,536	| IOT157 |	Smart locks
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:02,560	| IOT157 |	Just one
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,144	| IOT157 |	If you can speak on that I would really appreciate
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:06,912	| IOT157 |	Preciate it thanks
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,984	| IOT157 |	Okay. This is a really good question
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:13,824	| IOT157 |	And I'm still at Kevin answer because right now it is thundering and my dog
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| IOT157 |	Going.
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:24,064	| IOT157 |	Yes so it is a good question because a lot of people do have both a
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,624	| IOT157 |	Keylog as well as a keyed deadbolt
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,416	| IOT157 |	Unfortunately.
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,440	| IOT157 |	Most if not
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:31,744	| IOT157 |	All the locks that I can think of
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:34,048	| IOT157 |	Tend to work with the deadbolt only
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,328	| IOT157 |	In which case
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,864	| IOT157 |	Yeah the key to part
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:38,144	| IOT157 |	Traditional lager
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,192	| IOT157 |	Becomes kind of moot
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:42,496	| IOT157 |	We have one and I don't like that at all
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:48,640	| IOT157 |	It would be nice if we could see that ice maker is take that into consideration for people who want a key lock as well that maybe they
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:52,992	| IOT157 |	That works in conjunction with the deadbolt but right now it seems to be deadbolt only
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,296	| IOT157 |	So you would have to leave that
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,576	| IOT157 |	Main door lock
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,880	| IOT157 |	Unlock all the time if that's your situation
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,672	| IOT157 |	What is the key lock in the door knob
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:06,816	| IOT157 |	Well that would be for if you maybe you didn't have a deadbolt at first maybe you added a deadbolt later
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:10,656	| IOT157 |	Minister minimum level of security are you going to get
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,448	| IOT157 |	Yeah you're going to have a key door lock
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,752	| IOT157 |	And then maybe you add
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:18,592	| IOT157 |	The deadbolt door as a secondary thing but no matter what your front door's always going to come in at
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT157 |	Keyed door lock
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:22,688	| IOT157 |	Okay yes and I never really thought about this
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:25,504	| IOT157 |	Because yes I do have one and we just leave it alone
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,296	| IOT157 |	Same as me
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,088	| IOT157 |	So that's your thoughts
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:31,392	| IOT157 |	Process. And if you're looking at this sort of thing
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:35,232	| IOT157 |	Think carefully about what you're looking for in a Smart Lock
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:40,608	| IOT157 |	There's things like the August and those don't have key pads at all they're just remote
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,376	| IOT157 |	Lock and unlock
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:44,192	| IOT157 |	There's things like the Kevo which also don't have it
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:44,960	| IOT157 |	Keypad
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:45,728	| IOT157 |	Press it in
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:50,080	| IOT157 |	It's theoretically unlocks mine was a little iffy sometimes
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:54,944	| IOT157 |	And then there are those with keypads and those are candy because you don't actually need your phone you can just
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:56,992	| IOT157 |	Punch in the keypad number and then it opens
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:00,320	| IOT157 |	But the remote connectivity is also nice because then you can set up
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,088	| IOT157 |	Cool like
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:01,600	| IOT157 |	Automations
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:02,880	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:04,160	| IOT157 |	There's a whole wide world
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,928	| IOT157 |	Blocks out there
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,464	| IOT157 |	All of the Bluetooth ones
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,768	| IOT157 |	Be aware that if you're going to buy a Bluetooth lock
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,304	| IOT157 |	Did you just going to
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:15,424	| IOT157 |	Need your phone to be around it and you can't do anything remotely
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,192	| IOT157 |	To unlock it
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:16,960	| IOT157 |	R Lockett
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,240	| IOT157 |	Unless you have one of their
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,568	| IOT157 |	They sell these Bluetooth Wi-Fi converters that are basic
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,896	| IOT157 |	If you have a Z-Wave or zigbee lock
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,736	| IOT157 |	You're going to tie that into a something like a wink or SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:31,040	| IOT157 |	And then you're going to have remote access
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,368	| IOT157 |	Those are just some things to consider as you
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:34,880	| IOT157 |	You're buying
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:38,720	| IOT157 |	All right I think that's it for this portion of the show
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:45,632	| IOT157 |	We have Leslie Saxon who's talk about the future of healthcare you're definitely want to hear that because it's it's
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,912	| IOT157 |	It's a little surprising her vision
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:53,824	| IOT157 |	And a message from our sponsor, hey everyone we are taking a break for The Intern

EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:07,968	| IOT157 |	K&S you built these things what do you see as some of the big challenges
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:08,480	| IOT157 |	Customers have
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,296	| IOT157 |	Seeing customers
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:17,696	| IOT157 |	To need a very clear veginal investment for the iot project it's important for them to be able to do
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,464	| IOT157 |	Define that
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:19,744	| IOT157 |	Before the project begin
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:22,048	| IOT157 |	And really understand what the value by Disney
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,328	| IOT157 |	Timing for that value
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:29,728	| IOT157 |	We also seeing customers for whom iot security is a big concern so it's a very important for them to do

EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:27,840	| IOT157 |	I'm talking to her at South by Southwest is part of the IEEE
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,864	| IOT157 |	Tech for Humanity
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| IOT157 |	All right
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:31,936	| IOT157 |	Soccer socks and thanks so much
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,728	| IOT157 |	Coming on the show this week
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:35,776	| IOT157 |	It's great to be here at South Pine to see you
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,592	| IOT157 |	Awesome okay so let's just Dive Right In
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:42,944	| IOT157 |	You are talking about a wholesale change in the way we get medical care
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:43,712	| IOT157 |	Edgewater
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:44,480	| IOT157 |	Connected
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:48,064	| IOT157 |	Well telemedicine I assumed as part of this their wearables are all
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,344	| IOT157 |	Kinds of crazy stuff Soto
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:50,368	| IOT157 |	Talk to me about your vision
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:55,488	| IOT157 |	Great I'm actually here at South by Southwest talking about to be part of that vision is part of the IEEE
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,536	| IOT157 |	Tech for Humanity series
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:59,072	| IOT157 |	Can a few different years and
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:05,216	| IOT157 |	As the program has about them now talking about a really important part of building the new healthcare
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,752	| IOT157 |	And that's Iris security
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,312	| IOT157 |	So we talked about that at this meet
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,080	| IOT157 |	Eating about how to protect
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,896	| IOT157 |	Digital Data one of the great things about
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,432	| IOT157 |	Digital health is that
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:18,528	| IOT157 |	It has the potential to really support the health care of every individual
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,600	| IOT157 |	Digitally anybody with access to the internet
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,648	| IOT157 |	So that's kind of a Phenom
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:27,232	| IOT157 |	People who live in places without infrastructure
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,768	| IOT157 |	People get Healthcare anywhere
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:30,560	| IOT157 |	Iview what is
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,352	| IOT157 |	A very important movement
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,888	| IOT157 |	Healthcare because instead of sort of
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:38,240	| IOT157 |	Dummy down Healthcare and making it the quality and experience for everybody
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,544	| IOT157 |	Digital Health can make at the Four Seasons experience forever
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,080	| IOT157 |	That's what everybody
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:42,592	| IOT157 |	Desserts
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,896	| IOT157 |	Be able to access the best
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,176	| IOT157 |	Technologies
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,736	| IOT157 |	Expertise that Healthcare provides so
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:49,504	| IOT157 |	We sing
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,272	| IOT157 |	That
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,088	| IOT157 |	Virtual care will constitute 80% of Medical Care in
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:54,624	| IOT157 |	And that
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:55,648	| IOT157 |	Bricks-and-mortar care
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:56,416	| IOT157 |	Hospital visits
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,952	| IOT157 |	Clinic visits will be maybe
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,232	| IOT157 |	90%
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| IOT157 |	Why is that good
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:03,072	| IOT157 |	First of all it's good because you're leveraging your experts
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:03,840	| IOT157 |	Over
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,352	| IOT157 |	More people
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,656	| IOT157 |	Secondly it's good because
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:09,728	| IOT157 |	You can reach more people on thirdly it's really cost
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,264	| IOT157 |	But it's complicated
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| IOT157 |	Okay that was a lot to take in
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:20,224	| IOT157 |	First off when does this Future come about where 80% of our care is done via some sort of
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,504	| IOT157 |	Internet-based care
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,528	| IOT157 |	Part of it's already happened
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:23,552	| IOT157 |	I think we're seeing it
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:24,832	| IOT157 |	Last
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,880	| IOT157 |	What 3-4 years
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:28,160	| IOT157 |	When no Americans
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:31,744	| IOT157 |	We're tracking her health even with non medical grade sensors
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:34,048	| IOT157 |	About thirty 40% of Americans have it some
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:39,168	| IOT157 |	Quantify themselves with a wrist-worn or some other type of activity sensor just with
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:39,936	| IOT157 |	Their phone
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:46,080	| IOT157 |	So what we're seeing now is we're seeing this sort of merger of personally collected Healthcare data with traditional data
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:49,664	| IOT157 |	So you know Apple announced this ability to support
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,432	| IOT157 |	Are there platform
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,968	| IOT157 |	Traditional Medical
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,784	| IOT157 |	Electronic medical data as well as personal data
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:55,552	| IOT157 |	And so
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:41:00,160	| IOT157 |	We're now moving toward that virtual care Vision Telehealth is one small step
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:00,928	| IOT157 |	It doesn't really scale
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,488	| IOT157 |	I'll tell housemates as you can get a docker
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:04,256	| IOT157 |	Toronto screen a realtor
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:05,792	| IOT157 |	And that's good
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:10,656	| IOT157 |	But we're trying to do is beyond that so we've created a virtual human me
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,448	| IOT157 |	Simon expert in cardiac rhythm disorder
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:16,800	| IOT157 |	And my virtual human is fueled by voice recognition AI
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:20,384	| IOT157 |	She can provide unbelievable in-depth content to you
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:22,432	| IOT157 |	And a very deeply personal way
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,968	| IOT157 |	When you see my virtual human
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:27,040	| IOT157 |	Do you mean this is personalized to you or is this just
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,088	| IOT157 |	Something you built that is a virtue
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,368	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:32,416	| IOT157 |	Now it's very easy to create
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,440	| IOT157 |	Very realistic furniture
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,720	| IOT157 |	This looks like me
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,048	| IOT157 |	So this is your digital twin with your health data
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,328	| IOT157 |	Yes this is my digital
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:42,144	| IOT157 |	Play who after you see me in a clinic Hazard if you've never met me
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:44,704	| IOT157 |	Senior Living in Bangladesh you can ask me questions about heart
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,728	| IOT157 |	Rhythm disorders
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,752	| IOT157 |	Am I
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:48,032	| IOT157 |	Answers are based on
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:50,336	| IOT157 |	30 years of experience answering
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,360	| IOT157 |	Impatience questions and every

EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,759	| IOT157 |	Data
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:59,807	| IOT157 |	Lies to you because it's an AI engine
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,575	| IOT157 |	I can learn
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:03,135	| IOT157 |	And has already templated 36
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,415	| IOT157 |	Questions commonly asked question
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:08,511	| IOT157 |	And it gets smarter and smarter so what we found is that people
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:09,791	| IOT157 |	Feel
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:13,631	| IOT157 |	Learn and understand better when they are in control you're not pushing information
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,655	| IOT157 |	To them they're pulling it
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,167	| IOT157 |	When they want it
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:17,215	| IOT157 |	Plus my virtual human is
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,751	| IOT157 |	Constantly in the same mood
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,543	| IOT157 |	She's very interested she's
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,079	| IOT157 |	My virtual human has
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,103	| IOT157 |	Standardizing
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:26,431	| IOT157 |	Information doesn't deliver one way one day
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,199	| IOT157 |	Smarter than me
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT157 |	She doesn't prescribe yet
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:31,295	| IOT157 |	But since you'll be able to read the emotion in your face
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:32,831	| IOT157 |	And understand how you're feeling about some
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:36,671	| IOT157 |	But she'll get smarter and smarter so that virtual human
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:39,487	| IOT157 |	Really scales I think one of the first things we have to build out
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:41,023	| IOT157 |	In this virtual system is
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,559	| IOT157 |	High-end medical information form
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,887	| IOT157 |	In the virtual care system it's not the usual
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:48,703	| IOT157 |	Paternalistic care of the patient is has unimpressive
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,983	| IOT157 |	Play control their the orchestra
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,263	| IOT157 |	Just like other things
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,823	| IOT157 |	You decide when you're going to read The Wall Street Journal
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,591	| IOT157 |	Purses that have posed for
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,127	| IOT157 |	Whatever
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:56,639	| IOT157 |	Patience
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:00,735	| IOT157 |	They access things when they want they disclose things when they want
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:01,503	| IOT157 |	They can
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:03,039	| IOT157 |	Retrieve deeply personal for
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,319	| IOT157 |	Formation that's a super hard thing
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:07,647	| IOT157 |	Can you get the other things that I'm trying to sell for just
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,415	| IOT157 |	Yours
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:11,231	| IOT157 |	It's frustrating to try and deliver excellent Medical Care is
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:11,743	| IOT157 |	The gaps
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:17,119	| IOT157 |	We have the best experts and Technologies in the world how did we leave it all together for a patient there fam
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:20,447	| IOT157 |	How do we allow them to deeply learn things they don't get so
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:21,727	| IOT157 |	Traumatized by
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:24,543	| IOT157 |	No major diagnosis for chronic diseases they have to deal with
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:25,823	| IOT157 |	And I think
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:26,847	| IOT157 |	We can make that a lot better
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,359	| IOT157 |	Potential
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:33,247	| IOT157 |	So we're really on The Cutting Edge of building all the things that it takes and we want these experience to happen everywhere
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:34,527	| IOT157 |	In your car
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:35,551	| IOT157 |	Airplane
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:38,111	| IOT157 |	I can't wait till I'm in a plane and I'm like
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,903	| IOT157 |	Oh my gosh virtual doctor
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,927	| IOT157 |	I'm having a panic attack
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,743	| IOT157 |	Just think about how disgusting
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:44,767	| IOT157 |	Planes are and how they're not healthy
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,303	| IOT157 |	Now they could be
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,839	| IOT157 |	It could be a place to Enlighten for
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,679	| IOT157 |	I love planes I love playing this kind of
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:55,519	| IOT157 |	I do everything like a car to play this kind of iPhone I just have to build house offer
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,031	| IOT157 |	Turn Services on
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:44:02,943	| IOT157 |	Okay well let's back up just a little bit because I want to talk about the pieces that need to be in place cuz you've mentioned
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:04,991	| IOT157 |	And obviously software in Crazy places
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:05,503	| IOT157 |	Or to be
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:08,575	| IOT157 |	I feel crazy you've also mentioned personalized
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,855	| IOT157 |	Not just you
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:10,367	| IOT157 |	Being
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:13,951	| IOT157 |	Export it someplace but also a personalized experience based on
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,767	| IOT157 |	My personal health which implies machine learning
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:20,095	| IOT157 |	Or models about me so let's break down the
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:22,399	| IOT157 |	Pieces that need to be in place to deliver this kind
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:25,215	| IOT157 |	First of all we need to be able to
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,007	| IOT157 |	Get information from you
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,775	| IOT157 |	Anytime
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:28,543	| IOT157 |	Right
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:30,591	| IOT157 |	That's medical-grade diagnostic information
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:32,895	| IOT157 |	Pretty good so
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:36,223	| IOT157 |	We have a lot of those things already I can get real-time EKG from anybody
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:36,991	| IOT157 |	I can get
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:39,039	| IOT157 |	A lot of physiologic sensor soon
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,319	| IOT157 |	Will be able to get metabolic
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,087	| IOT157 |	Information
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:44,415	| IOT157 |	Continuous glucose lactate blood values that allow me to make it
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,231	| IOT157 |	Safe decision and allow you to understand your
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:50,303	| IOT157 |	We need to provide people with very high and
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,327	| IOT157 |	Information that's personal
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:55,679	| IOT157 |	It's easy to say you get a diagnosis of breast cancer to do a Google search
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,215	| IOT157 |	It's very different if you're pre-med
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,751	| IOT157 |	Tulsa breast cancer
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:01,055	| IOT157 |	How do you continue to get
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:01,823	| IOT157 |	A very meaningful
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:03,871	| IOT157 |	Shred to you how do you understand
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:05,663	| IOT157 |	How your environment may impact your wrist
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:08,223	| IOT157 |	If you have a genetic predisposition or something
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:10,271	| IOT157 |	So it's a combination of
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:11,039	| IOT157 |	Contacts
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:11,807	| IOT157 |	Learning
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:13,855	| IOT157 |	And being able to be on you early
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:17,183	| IOT157 |	What sensors understand how you're feeling where you are where you go
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:19,487	| IOT157 |	And collect that data and then sort of rational
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:23,071	| IOT157 |	It's a very difficult challenge because even in my area
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:23,839	| IOT157 |	Cardiac rhythm
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:26,143	| IOT157 |	I'm seeing data for instance we have
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:28,191	| IOT157 |	Programs in performance military athletic
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:32,287	| IOT157 |	The warfighters are professional athletes that
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:34,335	| IOT157 |	Isn't my area of expertise but because it's
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:35,359	| IOT157 |	Continuous data
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:36,383	| IOT157 |	I'm not used to seeing
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:37,663	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,687	| IOT157 |	I don't know what it means
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:39,711	| IOT157 |	And it scares me
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:41,503	| IOT157 |	That's why I have to Benchmark
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,271	| IOT157 |	Two things I do know
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,807	| IOT157 |	And I have to wait
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:46,111	| IOT157 |	Collect clinical events trailer
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:46,623	| IOT157 |	Dangerous is at
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:51,999	| IOT157 |	So it's going to take a fair amount of Science and patience to do that but given the amount of data use
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:54,303	| IOT157 |	Accumulate so fast that will happen you know
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,839	| IOT157 |	Exponentially faster than
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,863	| IOT157 |	Medical progress is half
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,447	| IOT157 |	So this kind of clinically valuable data
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:03,519	| IOT157 |	Seems like a key element and then understanding what
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:07,871	| IOT157 |	To make of it like my doctor have a cardiologist and he does not want to see any of my
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:11,967	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:13,247	| IOT157 |	It feels like we need both
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:14,783	| IOT157 |	Advice for
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:16,319	| IOT157 |	Medical grade information gathering
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:18,111	| IOT157 |	But then also
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:19,135	| IOT157 |	The studies
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:20,415	| IOT157 |	Will say to you
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:21,695	| IOT157 |	Hey
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:23,487	| IOT157 |	Here's a 10-year history of someone in
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:26,047	| IOT157 |	And here's with this sort of pattern over that 10 years books
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,095	| IOT157 |	Correct are people doing that work
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,887	| IOT157 |	Yeah we're doing that
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:31,423	| IOT157 |	Work so we can start to develop
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,959	| IOT157 |	The Predictive Analytics but the
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:35,007	| IOT157 |	Wrist-worn and other senses are getting
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:35,775	| IOT157 |	Continue get more active
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:38,335	| IOT157 |	Any one of I think RX
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,615	| IOT157 |	Expertise in the centers we can take
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:41,407	| IOT157 |	A regulated sensor
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,223	| IOT157 |	Reply to an athlete or Warfighter in it
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,015	| IOT157 |	Non-regulated sensor
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:48,063	| IOT157 |	Reply to a patient it doesn't matter it's all going to be the same
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:50,367	| IOT157 |	Wellness will merge with
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,903	| IOT157 |	What's chronic diseases Halo continue
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,695	| IOT157 |	Tomorrow weather 1.1 August 2nd
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,975	| IOT157 |	Another pointer Daiso
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:47:01,631	| IOT157 |	How do we get the most hated we can to start that deliver meeting back and when you have more people delivering the state
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:05,215	| IOT157 |	Collated and contextualize it it's really important
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:10,079	| IOT157 |	So we talked about having sensor data what about the human environment
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:14,431	| IOT157 |	Privacy environment what other aspects do we need to consider when we're talking about
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:16,223	| IOT157 |	Virtual care I don't even know what to call this
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,759	| IOT157 |	Avocado
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:19,039	| IOT157 |	Virtual care no more
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:19,551	| IOT157 |	Continuous model
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:23,391	| IOT157 |	So it's really complicated right just a regulatory isb
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,183	| IOT157 |	Because digital is
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:26,463	| IOT157 |	Right it's not
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,231	| IOT157 |	Border
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:27,999	| IOT157 |	So hot
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:28,767	| IOT157 |	I think of data
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:29,791	| IOT157 |	We definitely are
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:30,303	| IOT157 |	Previous
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,095	| IOT157 |	Conception of data keeping
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:34,143	| IOT157 |	What's good to keep a private lock it away
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:36,447	| IOT157 |	Digital health is slightly
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:39,263	| IOT157 |	So we've been working for instance with the FDA
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,799	| IOT157 |	Weird about the global
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:43,359	| IOT157 |	Model for what software for help to regulate
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,639	| IOT157 |	Chloe
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:45,663	| IOT157 |	That's been a huge accomplishment
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:49,503	| IOT157 |	Over the last say three four years so that was pretty clear guidelines
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,807	| IOT157 |	What's a regulated vs. unregulated piece of soft
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,599	| IOT157 |	What about cyber security
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:56,159	| IOT157 |	Text Achilles heel of digital health
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:57,183	| IOT157 |	To have health data breach
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:47:59,743	| IOT157 |	Cybersecurity is really a
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:00,511	| IOT157 |	Control shift
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,279	| IOT157 |	It's more
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,303	| IOT157 |	I think about it like
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:05,631	| IOT157 |	You know it started with sort of young people at the drive-in
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,399	| IOT157 |	I feel like
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:07,423	| IOT157 |	It starts with
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,447	| IOT157 |	Things like how to say
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:13,311	| IOT157 |	Create culture awareness of what are good cyber habits because cybersecurity is
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,847	| IOT157 |	Shared responsibility
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:17,663	| IOT157 |	The patient the manufacturer of the widget
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:18,943	| IOT157 |	The tax
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:20,991	| IOT157 |	The cell phone maker the carrier right
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:21,503	| IOT157 |	The government
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:26,367	| IOT157 |	So we have to start to build resiliency in our system cybersecurity will be something we have to
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:27,647	| IOT157 |	Continuously deal with
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:30,463	| IOT157 |	Don't be breaches but we have to build resilience systems and that's
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:32,255	| IOT157 |	All the way down the chain
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:34,815	| IOT157 |	So we work very hard on that
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:38,655	| IOT157 |	So along the issue of cybersecurity closely related to this is privacy
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,703	| IOT157 |	And I will say that my mom
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:41,983	| IOT157 |	It's probably at 1 far end
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,007	| IOT157 |	The spectrum that she is
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,287	| IOT157 |	So
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,055	| IOT157 |	So worried
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:46,079	| IOT157 |	Privacy
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,359	| IOT157 |	She keep seeing
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:51,455	| IOT157 |	Seeing stories about pharmaceutical companies wanting to use patient data to help
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,223	| IOT157 |	Improve
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:52,991	| IOT157 |	Trek discovery
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:55,551	| IOT157 |	And things like that really freaked her
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,831	| IOT157 |	Her out so I think is
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:58,623	| IOT157 |	We have these discussions about Cyrus
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:48:59,647	| IOT157 |	Security we should also talk
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:01,439	| IOT157 |	What's happening in
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:02,207	| IOT157 |	The Privacy Rule
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:06,303	| IOT157 |	So there's privacy in the sense that you don't want your name disclosed or associated with
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:12,703	| IOT157 |	Right and then there's the ability to take large amounts of data for instance let's say you want to look at all approved drugs
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:16,543	| IOT157 |	And try to look at all the outcome measures that you have on those trucks to see if you
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:17,311	| IOT157 |	You can use them for others
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:19,103	| IOT157 |	I don't think anybody would have jacks
EDL	00:49:19,615	00:49:20,895	| IOT157 |	So that's the kind of
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:21,919	| IOT157 |	In a really
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:23,455	| IOT157 |	Important area then there's
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:24,479	| IOT157 |	This privacy discussion
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:27,295	| IOT157 |	The societies
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:28,063	| IOT157 |	Impressions
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:29,855	| IOT157 |	Feelings about privacy are highly generation
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:33,951	| IOT157 |	To your mother may feel very intrusive to share any bit of data
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:36,767	| IOT157 |	2 yoga person they may give up an enormous amount of data
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:37,535	| IOT157 |	For the greater
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:38,303	| IOT157 |	Could not
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:40,863	| IOT157 |	Concerned about it so privacy is a really in
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:42,399	| IOT157 |	Part of this
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:46,239	| IOT157 |	Pick one of the tenants of cyber security and privacy is that an individual should
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:47,263	| IOT157 |	Have the ability to
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:48,799	| IOT157 |	To take them self off
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:54,687	| IOT157 |	She may be giving your heart rate or giving dated insurance company to show that you're healthy to get a lower
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:56,991	| IOT157 |	Rate for life insurance or health insurance
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:59,039	| IOT157 |	You may be voluntarily giving day to you
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:00,575	| IOT157 |	Employer so you don't want to do that
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:03,903	| IOT157 |	You should be able to take yourself off
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,671	| IOT157 |	But that right without pain
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:06,975	| IOT157 |	We're seeing this play out a lot professional
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:12,095	| IOT157 |	Princess professional NBA players just putting their last negotiating agreement that they won't
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:13,375	| IOT157 |	Where player
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:14,399	| IOT157 |	Performance sensors
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:15,167	| IOT157 |	Because
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,471	| IOT157 |	They don't know if the data is accurate
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:18,239	| IOT157 |	They don't know how it's going
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:19,519	| IOT157 |	Secure
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:20,799	| IOT157 |	And so
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:23,871	| IOT157 |	Part of that that has to be explained to them
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:26,175	| IOT157 |	I think that kind of thing
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:27,967	| IOT157 |	Gift of the governance around
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:28,991	| IOT157 |	It before you start to
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:30,783	| IOT157 |	Developing that's all go
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:31,551	| IOT157 |	Start to happen
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:33,087	| IOT157 |	What are the policies around
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:33,855	| IOT157 |	The governor
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:36,159	| IOT157 |	Medical Data that's collected
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,695	| IOT157 |	Performance or for health
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:41,279	| IOT157 |	And we don't we have HIPAA everyone don't worry about it
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:41,791	| IOT157 |	Is HIPAA a enough
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:43,583	| IOT157 |	It was a very small
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:44,351	| IOT157 |	Pizza Hut
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:47,423	| IOT157 |	You know it's really about the collective data in your own ability to cut
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:48,191	| IOT157 |	Control your data
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:49,727	| IOT157 |	Because it was clear to us in
EDL	00:50:49,727	00:50:52,287	| IOT157 |	When we started building the virtual care system
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:57,407	| IOT157 |	I look around everybody I said late when I got to do this the wrong way before we go. Let's figure out what are values admission is
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:59,967	| IOT157 |	Our mission is to supply the best
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:02,527	| IOT157 |	Healthcare to everybody on the globe anytime
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:04,831	| IOT157 |	And we are directed toward the patient
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:07,647	| IOT157 |	Or the athlete or the Warfighter that is our interest
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,415	| IOT157 |	Not
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:12,255	| IOT157 |	The medical system not the government not the lead not the team it's the individual
EDL	00:51:12,767	00:51:15,839	| IOT157 |	That helps us a lot as we start to determine what the government
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:16,607	| IOT157 |	HEB
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:19,423	| IOT157 |	It is trying to represent the best interests of the individual is providing the day
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:22,239	| IOT157 |	One thing I worry about with this sort of effort
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:24,799	| IOT157 |	Is in the internet we have
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,079	| IOT157 |	Continually pushed
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:27,359	| IOT157 |	The burden of
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:28,639	| IOT157 |	Handling
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:34,527	| IOT157 |	Ticketing at ticketing is just the easiest thing I can think of right now but even bill paying all of this the bird
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:36,575	| IOT157 |	Chest back to the individual there's a lot of
EDL	00:51:36,575	00:51:37,599	| IOT157 |	There's a lot of effort
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:38,879	| IOT157 |	Were there and so on
EDL	00:51:38,879	00:51:40,671	| IOT157 |	Curious what it means
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:42,207	| IOT157 |	What the role of the individual is
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:43,743	| IOT157 |	This individual
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:45,279	| IOT157 |	Continuous virtual
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:49,119	| IOT157 |	That's a great question I wish I was asked more to really insightful
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:49,631	| IOT157 |	Question answer
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:53,983	| IOT157 |	This is going to be different it's not doctor tells you what to do
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:57,055	| IOT157 |	This is having a real stake a dog in the fight
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:52:01,407	| IOT157 |	In your own Healthcare and controlling it and I think that that's the only way we get behavioral change
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:02,687	| IOT157 |	Is we get engagement
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:07,807	| IOT157 |	If people have to convince themselves and learn that they feel better with healthier habits it's better for them
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:08,831	| IOT157 |	Whoever there
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:11,135	| IOT157 |	Take care of whether it's their kids their parents their spouse
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:14,719	| IOT157 |	So I I'm all for it but does require a lot more
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:15,487	| IOT157 |	Without
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:16,511	| IOT157 |	Keeping patients down on the farm
EDL	00:52:17,023	00:52:18,559	| IOT157 |	Staff to understand their drugs
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:23,679	| IOT157 |	There to engage in their care and they have to partner with us to make it better because I I don't
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:24,703	| IOT157 |	I spend a lot of time
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:26,239	| IOT157 |	Interrogating a patient
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:30,079	| IOT157 |	Like I'm a cop on did you do this or that and then feeling judge I want them to come to me
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:31,871	| IOT157 |	As a partner
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:35,199	| IOT157 |	And I'm going to add my little expertise and I'm going to be Captain Sully on the Hudson
EDL	00:52:36,223	00:52:39,295	| IOT157 |	Because I need translators 34 years old to sit there and interrogate patients
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:41,855	| IOT157 |	And everybody
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:44,671	| IOT157 |	I've done that for too long I really want to be able to
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:46,207	| IOT157 |	Focus on the people who need me
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:48,511	| IOT157 |	Everybody else feel care for
EDL	00:52:48,511	00:52:49,791	| IOT157 |	And protected but
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:51,327	| IOT157 |	Takes a lot of
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:52,351	| IOT157 |	Personal responsibility
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:53,631	| IOT157 |	From the patient
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:56,191	| IOT157 |	And the pair models have to follow and they're not there yet
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:52:59,263	| IOT157 |	The business is going to meet so many needs
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:00,543	| IOT157 |	That will create a new
