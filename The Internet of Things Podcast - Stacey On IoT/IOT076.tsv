EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:43,424	| IOT076 |	In between that all of our news and our guess we're going to have a message from our sponsor macadamia
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,728	| IOT076 |	And they're talking about how they built a
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:49,312	| IOT076 |	Medical device that actually integrates with the Alexa voice services
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:52,640	| IOT076 |	And then finally we have Adam justice of connectsense
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:57,504	| IOT076 |	If you are cast this week talking about homekit and the home
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,808	| IOT076 |	App on iOS 10
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,320	| IOT076 |	Cool
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,112	| IOT076 |	It's going to be awesome
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,416	| IOT076 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,440	| IOT076 |	Amazon news
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:08,000	| IOT076 |	Yay yay
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:15,936	| IOT076 |	It's kind of a muffled ear because it's not huge to us but it's it's a huge price reduction on a new.
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,008	| IOT076 |	Yes a. Normally cost
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| IOT076 |	The $90
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:26,688	| IOT076 |	I thought it was cheaper than that but yeah I guess I did pay $90 but now the new. We all knew. That kind of looks like the o
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,248	| IOT076 |	Is priced at 4999
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,808	| IOT076 |	I'm totally taking one of those up for my daughter
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,368	| IOT076 |	I've been I've been waiting for something like
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,928	| IOT076 |	Because I can plug it into her Sonos Play 5 speakers
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,440	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| IOT076 |	That will that will work
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,256	| IOT076 |	It will be awesome
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:40,768	| IOT076 |	Michigan
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:41,792	| IOT076 |	Talk to her
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,144	| IOT076 |	Will you buy her one in black or the new white color
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,984	| IOT076 |	I'm thinking probably White
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,824	| IOT076 |	Looks nice look shiny
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,896	| IOT076 |	It's always good not always good but
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:02,784	| IOT076 |	On the inside apparently Amazon has what's called a new Echo spatial perception technology so
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,088	| IOT076 |	That should help
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,904	| IOT076 |	If you have multiple echos are. Sore
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,720	| IOT076 |	Well the cap wouldn't matter if we have to press the Papas
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:14,048	| IOT076 |	So apparently the new technology will help
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,560	| IOT076 |	.
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:18,144	| IOT076 |	Determine which room you're in so to speak so they are all
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,216	| IOT076 |	Talk back to you which happens to me all the time in my house actually
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,544	| IOT076 |	The people complain about that a lot
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,080	| IOT076 |	Very rarely does it
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,360	| IOT076 |	Separated by 2
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,896	| IOT076 |	Respect you
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| IOT076 |	And that's that second
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:37,088	| IOT076 |	That's actually going to be available to the older devices as well so that's good because they're kind of stink if one was smarter than
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,624	| IOT076 |	Then the rest of them so to speak
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,392	| IOT076 |	So
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,672	| IOT076 |	Looks like software updates coming
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,208	| IOT076 |	Eventually
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,744	| IOT076 |	When will probably
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,768	| IOT076 |	Be smarter than the other
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,632	| IOT076 |	We got hopefully a little bit of a ways all right and then also
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,424	| IOT076 |	Anybody listening in the UK
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:54,752	| IOT076 |	We're recording this on Wednesday to collect tomorrow but Wednesday
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| IOT076 |	Amazon launched their
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,360	| IOT076 |	You kick it like availability for the echo in the UK
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,152	| IOT076 |	So everybody who's always asking me about that
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,736	| IOT076 |	Today is your day actually be in Germany as well
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,784	| IOT076 |	Adam Germany
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:13,184	| IOT076 |	I'm not in Germany I'm not I'm not focused on the excitement there until you swing by and pick one up there
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,512	| IOT076 |	The people in London
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,047	| IOT076 |	Are very excited
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| IOT076 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,119	| IOT076 |	Enough silliness
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,143	| IOT076 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,447	| IOT076 |	TV underbelly of The Internet of Things
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:28,287	| IOT076 |	Department of Justice created and ioc study group
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:33,407	| IOT076 |	I don't know what we think about this this this basically is a 10 to 15 members
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:38,271	| IOT076 |	A group of people that have created a threat analysis team to
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:41,599	| IOT076 |	Talk about the threats posed by self-driving cars
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,623	| IOT076 |	Medical devices
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,903	| IOT076 |	Other interconnected
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,999	| IOT076 |	I think I want to make sure that
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:53,119	| IOT076 |	Jessica's going to say I think they have to do this isn't somebody has to do this I'm going
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,959	| IOT076 |	Glad to see an orthopedic justice department but that's
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,983	| IOT076 |	Neither here nor there
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,799	| IOT076 |	We talked so many times about
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,103	| IOT076 |	Different hacks and tweaks and things that
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,639	| IOT076 |	Have
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:08,479	| IOT076 |	You don't given personal information through Internet of Things devices and
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT076 |	There's
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,575	| IOT076 |	Obviously cyber security issues going on in the world today so
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,367	| IOT076 |	I think it's a good thing though
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,183	| IOT076 |	I think it's a good thing
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,463	| IOT076 |	I always worry because
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,511	| IOT076 |	You know a lot of these things that they
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,279	| IOT076 |	Get together
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:25,631	| IOT076 |	They research things for like a good year so and then
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,167	| IOT076 |	Report and then nothing happens
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,983	| IOT076 |	That will have you know I have two cars
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,055	| IOT076 |	Problematic and then we'll have
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,103	| IOT076 |	A flurry of activity
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,431	| IOT076 |	Ignores most of what was advised in that initial
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,735	| IOT076 |	Report and then we'll get some laws that filled
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,295	| IOT076 |	But maybe I'm just cynical
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,135	| IOT076 |	No I don't think you're cynical I think you're being a realist and
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:50,975	| IOT076 |	And you're you describe accurately what typically happens with these groups but
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:54,047	| IOT076 |	I guess it's better than nothing so to speak
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:58,143	| IOT076 |	We should get some good information of bacon actually heal
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,679	| IOT076 |	If you Department of Justice you cancer
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,727	| IOT076 |	Subpoena automakers and sadism
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,239	| IOT076 |	Hey
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,567	| IOT076 |	We are looking at that so we want more information and
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,383	| IOT076 |	Automakers pretty much have to give it to him so
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,687	| IOT076 |	I feel like we could get some
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| IOT076 |	Important
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:15,551	| IOT076 |	Stop coming too late and just the fact that they're under some sort of scrutiny
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,831	| IOT076 |	Hopefully we'll get them to
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT076 |	I think
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,367	| IOT076 |	Ben
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| IOT076 |	We really should
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,439	| IOT076 |	Pay attention to this even though I know
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,743	| IOT076 |	Felipe
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| IOT076 |	Okay today
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,327	| IOT076 |	The other
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,351	| IOT076 |	Little piece of news that
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,935	| IOT076 |	Against dark seedy underbelly of Internet of Things
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:37,055	| IOT076 |	Isabel connected sex toys arstechnica has a story that
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,639	| IOT076 |	Yes it's true interest in sex toys so it's connected vibrator
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:43,199	| IOT076 |	It actually is a lawsuit
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:46,015	| IOT076 |	Filed by the owner of the We-Vibe connected
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,039	| IOT076 |	Typewriter
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,063	| IOT076 |	Poo
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,391	| IOT076 |	Basically says that the company because it's
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,159	| IOT076 |	The word
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,999	| IOT076 |	How long her vibrator was used for and the vibration settings
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,511	| IOT076 |	She used
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:01,119	| IOT076 |	And send that data to their servers in Canada that they were violating her privacy
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:04,959	| IOT076 |	Big cheeser is basically the lawsuit
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,519	| IOT076 |	Terminology
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,847	| IOT076 |	And I feel like
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| IOT076 |	On one hand
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,991	| IOT076 |	Any connected device you have is going to send your data back to manufacturer in their store
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,551	| IOT076 |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:26,463	| IOT076 |	It sounds like she didn't really get much of a privacy notification and she certainly if she did didn't get it until after she had purchased the Prada
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,743	| IOT076 |	Which is incredibly
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:34,143	| IOT076 |	And that's why I was just going to say that's the key and that's pretty much the norm for all these devices unless you really real
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,471	| IOT076 |	Really digging around before you purchase an iot device
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| IOT076 |	And check
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,567	| IOT076 |	To see maybe on the website with the privacy
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,663	| IOT076 |	I'll see you at your place we buying something and then you're finding out
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:49,247	| IOT076 |	You know during the setup process perhaps order needs deletion or whatever maybe
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,295	| IOT076 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,575	| IOT076 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:56,159	| IOT076 |	How to change that quite honestly how does the industry change that
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,255	| IOT076 |	Well I think we need probably some sort of
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,047	| IOT076 |	We need some sort of federal intervention
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,119	| IOT076 |	Or a lawsuit may be a judge
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,655	| IOT076 |	Judicial intervention that says
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,679	| IOT076 |	Hey
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:08,703	| IOT076 |	You know what
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,751	| IOT076 |	For like a physical product
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,055	| IOT076 |	That you guys are selling people
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,639	| IOT076 |	You can't retro you can't basically after purchase
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:21,247	| IOT076 |	Force them into these onuris privacy conditions
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:21,759	| IOT076 |	Or
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,343	| IOT076 |	Arbitration clauses or insert whatever kind of
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,135	| IOT076 |	Issues it's right there
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,159	| IOT076 |	In
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,463	| IOT076 |	With software people
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,767	| IOT076 |	Allow that to happen even though judges
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,535	| IOT076 |	I just hate you
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,095	| IOT076 |	They're like well you can
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,911	| IOT076 |	Alita install at whatever
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,703	| IOT076 |	With apps
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,495	| IOT076 |	Eunos ideas
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:47,871	| IOT076 |	It's free you just get rid of it if you don't want it which is kind of silly because it's not like you're not going to use Google because you didn't
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,247	| IOT076 |	That's probably the way this
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| IOT076 |	Please out if we want to
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,551	| IOT076 |	Stop this
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,575	| IOT076 |	The question is
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,855	| IOT076 |	Will
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,391	| IOT076 |	The federal government or
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,671	| IOT076 |	Consumer organizations
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:05,279	| IOT076 |	And I think probably not at least not for awhile
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,071	| IOT076 |	And I think
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,911	| IOT076 |	A lot of the burden is still on a consumer to understand how cloud
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| IOT076 |	Cloud enabled devices working
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,519	| IOT076 |	Let me know pervert example
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,799	| IOT076 |	In this particular case
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,591	| IOT076 |	You could if
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:22,431	| IOT076 |	You bought one of these connected vibrators your partner
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,991	| IOT076 |	Could be run the world and control the device
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:25,759	| IOT076 |	Right
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:30,111	| IOT076 |	That doesn't happen over over Wi-Fi it's happening through the cloud and servers and so on so
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,903	| IOT076 |	You know that going in I think
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,487	| IOT076 |	We have to collectively raise the mainstream
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,279	| IOT076 |	Intelligence about
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:41,887	| IOT076 |	Peyote and cloud and then so on unfortunately in and I hate to say that because but
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,703	| IOT076 |	People need to understand this stuff
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,775	| IOT076 |	Because it's changing the world is changing the way we live
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,847	| IOT076 |	And yes you are going to give up some privacy
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,871	| IOT076 |	So you need to know this going in
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,919	| IOT076 |	I would also say
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:57,503	| IOT076 |	Like this could be deemed quote-unquote sensitive information and maybe they could
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:05,183	| IOT076 |	Medical devices that are connected those things are governed by like HIPAA
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,487	| IOT076 |	Maybe we think about legislation that
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,071	| IOT076 |	Glasses devices that are
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,351	| IOT076 |	Personal
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| IOT076 |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,447	| IOT076 |	But I would also say the rest of the world isn't always a
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,983	| IOT076 |	This freaky is the us about sex
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| IOT076 |	So
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,263	| IOT076 |	Just Beat It
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,847	| IOT076 |	Even something as mundane as like a pill tracker
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,895	| IOT076 |	That's going to know what medicines are on
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,479	| IOT076 |	That might be covered by hippos that it might not be
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,575	| IOT076 |	Against
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,671	| IOT076 |	We'll keep an eye on this because it is interesting especially given the
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,719	| IOT076 |	Companies don't always protect their data and
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:39,999	| IOT076 |	Yet
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,303	| IOT076 |	That's a problem over the cat act
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,167	| IOT076 |	Kevin you brought up
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,679	| IOT076 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:54,079	| IOT076 |	So for folks who don't know Microsoft does have health tracker
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:57,151	| IOT076 |	The Microsoft band it's been out probably for two or three years now
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,991	| IOT076 |	I did purchase one when it first came out really liked it it's cross platform
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:05,855	| IOT076 |	I know an update to it the Band 2 came out maybe last year
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:10,975	| IOT076 |	But it's looking like the band to maybe the last band
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:16,607	| IOT076 |	For Microsoft looks as though according to Mary Jo Foley zdnet
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,399	| IOT076 |	Who's very knowledgeable eyes
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,935	| IOT076 |	Great sources
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,751	| IOT076 |	It sounds like the band Hardware is being
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,543	| IOT076 |	I guess discontinued
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,615	| IOT076 |	They're going to sell the current inventory but
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,431	| IOT076 |	It doesn't look like they have any plans to make a new band
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:36,319	| IOT076 |	There's discussion about the team behind the actual band has since been disbanded no pun intended
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:41,695	| IOT076 |	But instead of getting out of house tracking what they're going to do is they're going to focus on their
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,255	| IOT076 |	Microsoft health platform
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,839	| IOT076 |	Which you can use to track your daily activities exercise
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,143	| IOT076 |	Y'all different metrics and so on
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,703	| IOT076 |	I have use Microsoft health
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| IOT076 |	Cloud platform
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:12:00,639	| IOT076 |	At the time it was not totally impressed by it but it has been a while so I don't want to say anything about the current state of it so
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,687	| IOT076 |	But it looks like another another
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,223	| IOT076 |	Hardware
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,271	| IOT076 |	Dismemberment hear of
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| IOT076 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,111	| IOT076 |	About dismembered
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,879	| IOT076 |	Pretty strong
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:13,951	| IOT076 |	Lychee we've now lost
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,511	| IOT076 |	How many bands like we've lost the FuelBand for Nike
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| IOT076 |	Was killed
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| IOT076 |	Jawbone
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| IOT076 |	When is in
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:25,215	| IOT076 |	Disarray is probably the kindest frailing for that the maker of
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,727	| IOT076 |	Connected Fitness
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,799	| IOT076 |	Bam and Missy
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,311	| IOT076 |	We got
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,103	| IOT076 |	I got the Under Armour store
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:38,527	| IOT076 |	And I actually action glad you mentioned that somebody sent me a message on Twitter yesterday saying the
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,575	| IOT076 |	Under Armour
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,599	| IOT076 |	Health kit box
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,415	| IOT076 |	Which I think was was $400 at the time
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:49,535	| IOT076 |	What is available at Target for $120 which makes me wonder is that going away
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,351	| IOT076 |	I was thinking about that I feel like
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,631	| IOT076 |	Because
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:57,471	| IOT076 |	I can easily pull in information from other sources it feels like
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,543	| IOT076 |	And because if you look at Fitbit
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,823	| IOT076 |	And what it is.
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,591	| IOT076 |	With the market
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:07,455	| IOT076 |	People are probably like you know but the engagement should be at the app and you can
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,735	| IOT076 |	Bring all the stuff in
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,783	| IOT076 |	So why don't you leave Fitbit the low in
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,855	| IOT076 |	Band business better phrase
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,135	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,207	| IOT076 |	Just focus on the software experience of building any coaster
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| IOT076 |	Which
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| IOT076 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,863	| IOT076 |	This is kind of how I figured a lot of this way
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| IOT076 |	Play out
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,447	| IOT076 |	Almost feel probably have like Garmin and
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| IOT076 |	Polar
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:35,615	| IOT076 |	Fitness trackers for really intense people absolutely
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:41,247	| IOT076 |	Absolutely actually next time on the show I'll have to talk about my polar m600 Android Wear watch
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,551	| IOT076 |	Suu admissions
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,599	| IOT076 |	So yes that's
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,183	| IOT076 |	And we should mention
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,999	| IOT076 |	But we won't go too far into death because our guest is going to
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,023	| IOT076 |	Really going to death
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,303	| IOT076 |	With iOS 10 butts
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:59,679	| IOT076 |	Wechat iOS 10 and last Wednesday is when the iPhone 7 launched
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,287	| IOT076 |	With the airpods and that sort of thing so
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| IOT076 |	I feel like we should probably talk
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| IOT076 |	Momentarily
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,663	| IOT076 |	Play about it I I will say that I did a story
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,455	| IOT076 |	Last Friday
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,991	| IOT076 |	On what I think I feel like
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,551	| IOT076 |	Putting Siri in your ear
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,367	| IOT076 |	With wireless audio basically gives you
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,415	| IOT076 |	Siri in your ear
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| IOT076 |	Control of the Internet of Things
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:22,975	| IOT076 |	For the future
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,511	| IOT076 |	Not today
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:27,071	| IOT076 |	This is very much an interim step the power
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:27,839	| IOT076 |	Consumption
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,631	| IOT076 |	Texas to hired battery life
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,167	| IOT076 |	Whichever
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,703	| IOT076 |	Everyone think of it
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| IOT076 |	And it sounds like the audio quality on these things
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,335	| IOT076 |	It's probably
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:41,919	| IOT076 |	Probably about the same as the wired quality
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,991	| IOT076 |	But yeah you raise an interesting point or many in that article
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:49,343	| IOT076 |	I think Siri has a ways to go before it becomes the end-all-be-all
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| IOT076 |	Your assistant
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,439	| IOT076 |	Not to screw
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,999	| IOT076 |	You purchased
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,791	| IOT076 |	Have you used
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| IOT076 |	Can you purchase the airpod
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| IOT076 |	I did not
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:04,959	| IOT076 |	I did not purchase the airpods because I just don't see
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,007	| IOT076 |	The
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:11,103	| IOT076 |	I just don't have the need for it I have other wireless headphones at do
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,895	| IOT076 |	That will work just fine
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,943	| IOT076 |	They're including the lightning
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| IOT076 |	Wired
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,271	| IOT076 |	Earbuds in the phone with the phone
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,831	| IOT076 |	And frankly
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:26,975	| IOT076 |	It sounds silly but I Twilight I'd agree that Apple has Salve pairing problem for Bluetooth headphones
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,767	| IOT076 |	You only
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,559	| IOT076 |	Typically paired them once
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:35,423	| IOT076 |	So it saves me maybe 30 seconds of frustration and then
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| IOT076 |	I move on I just did you seem like a very
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,543	| IOT076 |	I don't know what's it's
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| IOT076 |	Typical Apple product
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:45,919	| IOT076 |	I'm going to say in a wireless World pairing is
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,431	| IOT076 |	A pain point
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,991	| IOT076 |	And you can see they put the
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:53,343	| IOT076 |	Same attention to detail in the caring process and getting things online
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,415	| IOT076 |	You basically use your phone
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| IOT076 |	A picture of the device
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,719	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,743	| IOT076 |	It connects to your phone
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,375	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:11,519	| IOT076 |	What's Happening Here is there just like I think they're chipping away a lot of problems that we really know we had at that make
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:15,871	| IOT076 |	Normal people do I didn't think about what they did with
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:21,247	| IOT076 |	What airport did they bathe they just made it really easy to set up like a Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:25,855	| IOT076 |	And we're finally getting to the point where the rest of the night she's like oh hey we should probably do some
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:27,903	| IOT076 |	So again
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,927	| IOT076 |	I think it's a problem
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,743	| IOT076 |	It's not a huge problem but Apple doesn't
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,535	| IOT076 |	Necessarily have to tackle the huge problem
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:41,727	| IOT076 |	Not very very true I agree and it shows a lot of innovation on their part to create a new Bluetooth chip
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,751	| IOT076 |	The WW1
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,567	| IOT076 |	Which they said they're not going to license
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,591	| IOT076 |	I'm so beat
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:48,383	| IOT076 |	Specific to Apple products which
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:48,895	| IOT076 |	Shagging
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:53,247	| IOT076 |	Typical
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,527	| IOT076 |	But
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:17:01,695	| IOT076 |	So an endless are airpods do work with any other device over Bluetooth just you've done
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,719	| IOT076 |	Repair themselves
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,535	| IOT076 |	Just want folks understand that they're not specific to the iPhone
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:06,815	| IOT076 |	Sparta
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,863	| IOT076 |	Yes you could have airpods
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:12,703	| IOT076 |	You too could have airpods
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,215	| IOT076 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,263	| IOT076 |	Tell us how they were
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,055	| IOT076 |	Alright so
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:20,127	| IOT076 |	Let's talk about the Philips Hue motion sensor because we
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| IOT076 |	This is
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:26,783	| IOT076 |	We must this is Phillips lunch this two weeks ago I've had it in my house
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,551	| IOT076 |	In various rooms
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| IOT076 |	Playing with it
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,135	| IOT076 |	This is a 3995
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,671	| IOT076 |	Motion sensor that will
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,695	| IOT076 |	Basically
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,463	| IOT076 |	Turn your Hue Lights On
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,047	| IOT076 |	And it will be available in October
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,375	| IOT076 |	And having lived with it I really like this
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,911	| IOT076 |	The motion sensor solved
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,447	| IOT076 |	A specific problem that I've had in
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,751	| IOT076 |	In the bathroom problem in the bathroom
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,287	| IOT076 |	And that is
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,335	| IOT076 |	When you go to the bathroom at night
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,383	| IOT076 |	Turn on the light
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,919	| IOT076 |	2B and it blinds you and
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| IOT076 |	You're awake hysterical
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,759	| IOT076 |	So I wanted a light that dims automatically
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,063	| IOT076 |	After I went to bed basically
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,599	| IOT076 |	And then the rest of time it would be lovely
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:02,879	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,231	| IOT076 |	This is so sad
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,279	| IOT076 |	The Hue app lets you said
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:12,351	| IOT076 |	Times for the motion sensor when you setup the motion sensor
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| IOT076 |	You can say
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,935	| IOT076 |	During these times I would like my light to be
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,727	| IOT076 |	This color is
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,007	| IOT076 |	This level of brightness
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:21,055	| IOT076 |	During these times I would like to be
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,639	| IOT076 |	And then I would like it to go off
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,151	| IOT076 |	After certain
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:30,271	| IOT076 |	They didn't have the option of going off like
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,551	| IOT076 |	Saying
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:35,135	| IOT076 |	During the day leave it on for 5 minutes and drink the night leave it on for only 1 minute
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:36,927	| IOT076 |	Pikachu
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| IOT076 |	I love this
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:42,559	| IOT076 |	Because I'm going to use the song I think I'm going to buy this
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:46,911	| IOT076 |	Or a couple rooms were exempt those kind of rooms are usually in clothes
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:49,215	| IOT076 |	Something to put it in the bathroom
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,543	| IOT076 |	I'm also going to put it in our laundry room cuz I'll often times
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| IOT076 |	That switches are weird
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,127	| IOT076 |	Spot even though I did move it
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,943	| IOT076 |	Using Lutron
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,991	| IOT076 |	Remote on the wall
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,271	| IOT076 |	Switch
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,831	| IOT076 |	I'm going to have to take those out because you can't use hue light switch
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,135	| IOT076 |	Lutron dimmers
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,183	| IOT076 |	But I'll take that switch out
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:11,487	| IOT076 |	Motion sensor in there any time I open the
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,767	| IOT076 |	Laundromats going to turn on
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,839	| IOT076 |	Your hands are off in full
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,399	| IOT076 |	We often leave the light on
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,935	| IOT076 |	So
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,447	| IOT076 |	Closet
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,727	| IOT076 |	12
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,311	| IOT076 |	Maybe if you have kids I'm trying to think of that would really be
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,591	| IOT076 |	Crates
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:30,687	| IOT076 |	I have an open floor plan downstairs and I try to get out there and I didn't like it
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,199	| IOT076 |	There
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,991	| IOT076 |	Simply because
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,551	| IOT076 |	Which is always moving back and forth down there the lights
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,415	| IOT076 |	That's the Hue motion sensor
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:43,231	| IOT076 |	Goodbye I will say though if you don't have Hue Lights
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| IOT076 |	The stack
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,023	| IOT076 |	Lights
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,351	| IOT076 |	Have the motion sensing capability inside the bulb
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:52,703	| IOT076 |	You do need a hug Kevin so you will not like this
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,471	| IOT076 |	Buttfor
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,567	| IOT076 |	For $90 you can get a traditional a19 kit
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:01,663	| IOT076 |	How much is a normal light bulb or for $100 you can get a starter kit for
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,455	| IOT076 |	Downlights
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,991	| IOT076 |	Par30s
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| IOT076 |	Impose
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,063	| IOT076 |	Oh that's two light bulbs in the hub
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:13,183	| IOT076 |	If I didn't have the Hue system already in my house I probably actually choose this
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,231	| IOT076 |	The staff lights as
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,511	| IOT076 |	Because they can do the same thing
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:19,583	| IOT076 |	Except you don't have a motion sensor wandering around
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,375	| IOT076 |	That's the review
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:21,887	| IOT076 |	For you
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:24,703	| IOT076 |	You can also run 12u motion sensors
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,471	| IOT076 |	On
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:25,983	| IOT076 |	1
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:33,663	| IOT076 |	Sounds like a good solution for very specific use case I don't think it would take out my whole house with a bunch of motion sensors
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:39,039	| IOT076 |	No I mean it's it's not really worthwhile in the motion sensors themselves
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,599	| IOT076 |	Are not particularly Innovative they're not like
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,623	| IOT076 |	Small order
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,183	| IOT076 |	Motion sensor
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:49,279	| IOT076 |	Now I will say I have
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,047	| IOT076 |	I think
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:53,119	| IOT076 |	5 different ways I can turn my Hue Lights on and off now in my house
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,911	| IOT076 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,703	| IOT076 |	That's right it's almost scary
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,007	| IOT076 |	Isn't it though
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,031	| IOT076 |	All right
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,335	| IOT076 |	And the other review we have is
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,383	| IOT076 |	The Kevo 2nd generation
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,151	| IOT076 |	Smart Lock
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,455	| IOT076 |	And this is a Bluetooth Smart Lock
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:09,759	| IOT076 |	But I insulted my house and
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,551	| IOT076 |	The key feature is that you
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,319	| IOT076 |	Touch
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:12,831	| IOT076 |	Unlock it
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:16,672	| IOT076 |	In I'm not having a lot of success getting that to work
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,184	| IOT076 |	But
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,256	| IOT076 |	I will say that the lock install
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| IOT076 |	Easily
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,304	| IOT076 |	I did a video on
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,584	| IOT076 |	Hoping to post it for you guys but
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,120	| IOT076 |	King in London
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,656	| IOT076 |	Fixing a little fun and hard
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,424	| IOT076 |	Aaron's
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,704	| IOT076 |	So install is easy
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,496	| IOT076 |	The software is easy
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,288	| IOT076 |	It doesn't have
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,336	| IOT076 |	A lot of features in
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,384	| IOT076 |	The second generation
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,688	| IOT076 |	The new features they have is a
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,480	| IOT076 |	Smart key
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,040	| IOT076 |	And what it is basically is
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,600	| IOT076 |	It's just extra security around
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,624	| IOT076 |	The Walking Dead
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:50,720	| IOT076 |	The smart key is All Souls are wreaking feature
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,792	| IOT076 |	Ocado you can rekey your locks using
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| IOT076 |	Smart key
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:57,888	| IOT076 |	I have not done that yet I pulled the instructions out
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:02,752	| IOT076 |	I was kind of a little overwhelmed by it will try and see how that works but
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,776	| IOT076 |	I'm not sure
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,848	| IOT076 |	I'm not sure that there's a lot of extra
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,384	| IOT076 |	Value here
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:12,224	| IOT076 |	Well if the touch feature work and I'm assuming
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,016	| IOT076 |	It means
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,784	| IOT076 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,552	| IOT076 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,600	| IOT076 |	Okay cuz so so and what that
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,672	| IOT076 |	Explain to me what that does that when it works so it
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,720	| IOT076 |	If you touch the lock
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:26,048	| IOT076 |	And then check to see if phone is in proximity that it unlocks
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,352	| IOT076 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,120	| IOT076 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,912	| IOT076 |	Some of it
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| IOT076 |	Might be
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,496	| IOT076 |	I installed this and
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:40,128	| IOT076 |	I may have been a little too rapid fire and going back and forth this was on my back doors
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,432	| IOT076 |	We don't actually use that door very often
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,736	| IOT076 |	The pros of it are
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,784	| IOT076 |	Kwikset lock which is a
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,576	| IOT076 |	Daily Standard blog
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,648	| IOT076 |	If you've already got Kwikset box at your house
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:56,000	| IOT076 |	Probably going to fit so that install should be pretty easy it works most of the time
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,048	| IOT076 |	I will say there is a bug with
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT076 |	IOS
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,888	| IOT076 |	10 coming out that
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,424	| IOT076 |	The touch to Rockwall
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,984	| IOT076 |	Work until the issue affects which they expect
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,568	| IOT076 |	I feel like
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,104	| IOT076 |	I wouldn't rush to buy this product
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:14,432	| IOT076 |	And you know if you're looking for a Smart Lock
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,992	| IOT076 |	Like this is a Smart Lock
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,296	| IOT076 |	It didn't feel like
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:23,136	| IOT076 |	I need to have product it did not change my life in any way
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,464	| IOT076 |	You can buy an extra key fob
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,000	| IOT076 |	So you can buy a key fob
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,816	| IOT076 |	Quick fats for $25 that
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,936	| IOT076 |	But again
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,264	| IOT076 |	Doesn't seem you're not a must-have at this time
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:47,200	| IOT076 |	If you have specific questions about the locket would like me to
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,248	| IOT076 |	Do something with it I am happy to
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,016	| IOT076 |	Do that
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,552	| IOT076 |	Eva fans now
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,624	| IOT076 |	I think that wraps up our news for this week
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,904	| IOT076 |	K24a cast
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:59,232	| IOT076 |	Who is Adam justice of connectsense will be talked about homekit
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,792	| IOT076 |	Some fun tips and tricks and things you could do with
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,072	| IOT076 |	Home app
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:07,168	| IOT076 |	Before that stay tuned for a word from our sponsor
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:13,568	| IOT076 |	Everyone we're going to take a break for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is macadamia which is an iot
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,128	| IOT076 |	User experience design and software developer
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:20,736	| IOT076 |	We have rain and Taemin from Macadamia talking about
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,504	| IOT076 |	Healthcare
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:27,904	| IOT076 |	50% of your business is actually Healthcare and I'm really curious what's happening right now at the intersection of
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:30,208	| IOT076 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:34,560	| IOT076 |	Clevescene explosion in healthcare and iot and it's
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,840	| IOT076 |	Read me about
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,656	| IOT076 |	Connecting devices and apps
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| IOT076 |	Applications and data
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:46,592	| IOT076 |	And that's really where we're seeing a lot of exciting new project submerge both in the on the clinic
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,616	| IOT076 |	Girl facing side
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,408	| IOT076 |	Sew-in hospitals and
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,688	| IOT076 |	Clinicians offices
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,480	| IOT076 |	And on the consumer side
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,760	| IOT076 |	What if you guys built
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:54,528	| IOT076 |	For this Market
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:25:00,928	| IOT076 |	One exciting project that we worked on deals with implants there's a sensor in the
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,000	| IOT076 |	Implant during surgery the surgeon can
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,536	| IOT076 |	Manipulate
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:11,936	| IOT076 |	Depending on where the implant is to figure out the appropriate placement or the ideal placement to ensure that
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:18,336	| IOT076 |	Got the outcome postoperatively will be beneficial and then postoperatively when they're doing patient phone
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:21,152	| IOT076 |	They can actually turn the sensor on
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:27,552	| IOT076 |	And get real-time data and Trends data that they used to correlate with patient
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:31,648	| IOT076 |	Recorded information about potentially you know activity levels and they can
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| IOT076 |	Sakura.
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:38,816	| IOT076 |	What they see is happening to the sensor and make appropriate adjustments to their care plan or their
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| IOT076 |	Rehabilitation
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,144	| IOT076 |	More on the consumer front
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,704	| IOT076 |	We're working with a client building a really neat
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,264	| IOT076 |	Kojak product leveraging
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:51,104	| IOT076 |	Alexa voice services and its product actually help seniors live
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:53,664	| IOT076 |	Longer and more independent lives at home
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:55,968	| IOT076 |	So for instance when mrs. Jones wakes up
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,576	| IOT076 |	This device will actually ask her hello Martha how well did you sleep
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:03,904	| IOT076 |	And we'll find out whether or not she yes she slept well
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:08,000	| IOT076 |	Will reminder if she's taking her pills if she hasn't because they upset her stomach
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,816	| IOT076 |	That will be recorded in that information
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,632	| IOT076 |	Can be provided not only to the physician in charge
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:16,448	| IOT076 |	But also to send her daughter
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:19,264	| IOT076 |	Who is primarily responsible for her care
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,824	| IOT076 |	What do you need to know about working in
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:27,968	| IOT076 |	Patient privacy and security as the opportunity to take this
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,272	| IOT076 |	Solution to the cloud is happening
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,344	| IOT076 |	Architecting that solution in a way that helps
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:36,160	| IOT076 |	Healthcare companies maintain their hitrust
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,440	| IOT076 |	And HIPAA certification
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,000	| IOT076 |	Cure connecting a device
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:43,840	| IOT076 |	And sending information to a mobile device
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:48,960	| IOT076 |	Because it's being used for clinical reasons if it needs to be FDA-approved
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,752	| IOT076 |	As we mentioned in last week's podcast
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:57,664	| IOT076 |	The user experience for these medical devices is critical in many instances they won't be used by people who
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:01,504	| IOT076 |	Add experience with an iPhone or a mobile device
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:06,624	| IOT076 |	And we'll be looking for a very natural way to interact and communicate with that device
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,672	| IOT076 |	I can't wait to learn more
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:15,072	| IOT076 |	To learn more about Macadamia and its Healthcare Solutions go to Macadamia. Com Health Care
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:21,472	| IOT076 |	Hey everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham and we are
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:26,080	| IOT076 |	The Internet of Things podcast today's guest is Adam justice of connect
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,384	| IOT076 |	Hi Adam how are you
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:31,200	| IOT076 |	Hi thanks for having me today Stacy
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:33,248	| IOT076 |	I am super excited so
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:36,320	| IOT076 |	I told Adam for really long time because connectsense
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,112	| IOT076 |	Started out
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,624	| IOT076 |	Man
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:41,696	| IOT076 |	Three four years ago making wifi-connected
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:45,280	| IOT076 |	Outlets and sensors when did you guys start this atom
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:49,888	| IOT076 |	Yeah we launched that brand in 2013
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,680	| IOT076 |	In the Wi-Fi Center business and
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,192	| IOT076 |	Since
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,240	| IOT076 |	Expanded from there
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,288	| IOT076 |	Getting into homekit with the outlets at
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,104	| IOT076 |	Yes so
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,664	| IOT076 |	Adam was last on the show back in
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,736	| IOT076 |	June of 2014 when Apple launched
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:05,504	| IOT076 |	Homekit
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:10,368	| IOT076 |	And I thought it'd be great to have him come back because he's been doing his video interviews are these
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,904	| IOT076 |	I guess they're not interview
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,720	| IOT076 |	Is there there video demonstrations of
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:16,256	| IOT076 |	What is excited about with homekit
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:19,328	| IOT076 |	So before we start talking about that
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,376	| IOT076 |	Adam just give me your take
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,656	| IOT076 |	Apple's approach to the
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:23,936	| IOT076 |	I'm so far
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,496	| IOT076 |	Yeah I mean I stink
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:30,080	| IOT076 |	You know we were very excited when last time I was on the show and
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,360	| IOT076 |	Finalize apples
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,640	| IOT076 |	Doing something about homekit
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:36,736	| IOT076 |	And you know that took a little while to get off the ground but
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:41,600	| IOT076 |	We finally started to see it on products shipping last year you know in quantity
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:44,160	| IOT076 |	And it started to gain momentum
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,440	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| IOT076 |	Now with
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:51,328	| IOT076 |	Everything you're doing an iOS 10 it really feels like apple is finally endorsing this
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:55,680	| IOT076 |	Putting its full weight behind it and I think it's a really exciting time
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:29:00,288	| IOT076 |	Brung it but for the industry in general and kind of home automation
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:00,800	| IOT076 |	In general
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:05,920	| IOT076 |	Why are you so excited about the industry in general cuz right now I feels kind of like worth it
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,200	| IOT076 |	Trough of despair
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:12,320	| IOT076 |	And people are question
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:16,160	| IOT076 |	So many competing standards than efforts and
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:19,488	| IOT076 |	I kind of look around my house in like God some of this is just junk
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,816	| IOT076 |	So why are you excited
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:29,984	| IOT076 |	So I think this is really a moment for the industry where you know people are going to install iOS 10
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,520	| IOT076 |	And this week and
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:37,920	| IOT076 |	They're going to see this new app on their phone and start to think alright what can I do with this you know maybe that brings them into an Apple Store
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,712	| IOT076 |	Best Buy or somewhere
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:42,528	| IOT076 |	I got to see that homekit logo and really start to get
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,576	| IOT076 |	You know what idea of what they can
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:47,648	| IOT076 |	Do it. And I really think it comes down to
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:49,696	| IOT076 |	Consumers having that one
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,720	| IOT076 |	Great experience
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,512	| IOT076 |	And you know
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,792	| IOT076 |	Comcast says a lot of things
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:54,560	| IOT076 |	Right
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:58,144	| IOT076 |	To get that first kind of wow experience and I think once you have that
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,960	| IOT076 |	It leaves you wanting more and
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:02,496	| IOT076 |	That's one of the nice things about
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,312	| IOT076 |	Don't get experience as a you add more
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:05,824	| IOT076 |	Products
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| IOT076 |	To your home
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,408	| IOT076 |	1 + 1 is
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,176	| IOT076 |	Is more than
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:10,688	| IOT076 |	2
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,992	| IOT076 |	You might be for 5
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,272	| IOT076 |	460
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,552	| IOT076 |	Okay so
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:18,368	| IOT076 |	Listeners who are not well-versed in homekit
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:24,256	| IOT076 |	Basically to get certified as a homekit device you have to have a special Apple Certified Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,792	| IOT076 |	Work Bluetooth chip IP
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,072	| IOT076 |	Init
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:29,120	| IOT076 |	In the device basically being
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,656	| IOT076 |	Mfi certified
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,960	| IOT076 |	And that allows Appleton
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,752	| IOT076 |	Ensure the security between device
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,824	| IOT076 |	That's important so every home kit
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:40,640	| IOT076 |	Device out there has this special chip
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,176	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,968	| IOT076 |	Let's see what else do you need to know
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,296	| IOT076 |	The other thing to note is that
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,832	| IOT076 |	Are the standard in general
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,624	| IOT076 |	Memes that if you
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,952	| IOT076 |	Buy multiple products that bear this logo
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:57,536	| IOT076 |	I'm you're not going to have to worry about trying to figure out how do I get these
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:00,352	| IOT076 |	Things to talk to each other or how do they coexist
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,888	| IOT076 |	That's just kind of comes natively
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| IOT076 |	Awesome so
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:08,288	| IOT076 |	Last year these devices started hitting the market but you could
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:14,432	| IOT076 |	Control them individually through the apps for like the elegado Spencers or for the Hue Lights
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:17,760	| IOT076 |	What's happening now with iOS 10 is
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| IOT076 |	Apple is releasing
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:19,808	| IOT076 |	Home
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:23,648	| IOT076 |	Which is an app to control all of this together
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,696	| IOT076 |	Now third-party companies had
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:28,256	| IOT076 |	Released these types of programs before but
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,560	| IOT076 |	As Adam pointed out these are
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,840	| IOT076 |	It's far different
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,888	| IOT076 |	And far more mainstream when apples like
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,424	| IOT076 |	Here it is
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:36,704	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:39,264	| IOT076 |	I don't know if it's actually going to be right on your
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,312	| IOT076 |	What's that screen called where you
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,848	| IOT076 |	Pull it up with your finger and like
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,128	| IOT076 |	You get your
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,152	| IOT076 |	Flashlight
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:49,248	| IOT076 |	Can your Wi-Fi settings you scroll over to get music and then scroll over that you get
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:49,760	| IOT076 |	Home
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,832	| IOT076 |	Yeah so that's called the control center
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:58,208	| IOT076 |	And I really think I just put out a video in the last week
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:01,280	| IOT076 |	I really think this is one of the killer apps for iOS 10
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,560	| IOT076 |	And homekit
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:04,096	| IOT076 |	Because
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,608	| IOT076 |	You know
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:10,496	| IOT076 |	That home app or you know Siri are great ways to access stuff but being able to
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| IOT076 |	Just flip up that
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| IOT076 |	Control center
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,336	| IOT076 |	Do something really quick is
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| IOT076 |	Really nice and elegant
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:16,896	| IOT076 |	Got it
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,920	| IOT076 |	Okay so
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,944	| IOT076 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,968	| IOT076 |	I played with
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,736	| IOT076 |	Home
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:25,600	| IOT076 |	In iOS 10 and you have to so let's talk about some of the features that you know
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,136	| IOT076 |	We think are really cool
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,672	| IOT076 |	Ashley Let's help people
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:31,744	| IOT076 |	Let's start with adding homekit certified devices
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,024	| IOT076 |	How would we do that
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:33,792	| IOT076 |	How is this differ
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:41,472	| IOT076 |	So that's done there's a little plus button up in the upper right-hand corner of the home app
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,520	| IOT076 |	And that's where you would go to a device
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,800	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,592	| IOT076 |	So some of the things that
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:49,152	| IOT076 |	Apple does here to make this Annie
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,920	| IOT076 |	Easy process
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:55,552	| IOT076 |	Is they have a a process for Wi-Fi accessories called Wireless
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:56,320	| IOT076 |	Accessory
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,856	| IOT076 |	Configuration or wack
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,392	| IOT076 |	So that means
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,440	| IOT076 |	For a certified accessory
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,512	| IOT076 |	You don't need to go find that little
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:07,840	| IOT076 |	Piece of paper that has your Wifi password on it
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,888	| IOT076 |	If your phone is already
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:11,168	| IOT076 |	Talking to
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:13,472	| IOT076 |	Your Wi-Fi access point
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:14,752	| IOT076 |	It will just pass those
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:15,776	| IOT076 |	Details write down
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:16,544	| IOT076 |	Statics
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:18,080	| IOT076 |	So that's a really nice
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,104	| IOT076 |	Simple way to get
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:23,968	| IOT076 |	Devices on to Wi-Fi and then from the security perspective
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:29,600	| IOT076 |	I'm you're just going to use your camera to scan a code that goes with every accessory
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,880	| IOT076 |	And then boom you're done
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,416	| IOT076 |	Enough from there
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:34,720	| IOT076 |	Customize it kind of put it in a room
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,768	| IOT076 |	Decide if it's a favorite accessory or not
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,584	| IOT076 |	The things like that but the set of processes
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,608	| IOT076 |	Is pretty elegant
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:42,144	| IOT076 |	Pretty easy
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,216	| IOT076 |	So when I first start
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:46,240	| IOT076 |	With this
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:47,776	| IOT076 |	You know if I'm imagining myself
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:51,104	| IOT076 |	I'm excited about
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,920	| IOT076 |	Do you have any advice on what the first device
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:54,944	| IOT076 |	Someone should get is
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:57,504	| IOT076 |	How to even think about what they should be
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:00,832	| IOT076 |	Either the first device
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,856	| IOT076 |	Is always
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:05,184	| IOT076 |	A hard one but I think you want to solve it
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:07,232	| IOT076 |	Easy problem so or kind of a
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT076 |	Convenience Center
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:08,512	| IOT076 |	Your life
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:12,096	| IOT076 |	Shows this can be as easy as like I want to turn on this lamp
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:15,424	| IOT076 |	You know he's away your you know I want to run this on a timer
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:16,960	| IOT076 |	Like that so
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:20,800	| IOT076 |	In a frog getting started device I really like something that doesn't
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,568	| IOT076 |	Acquired
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:24,384	| IOT076 |	Too much install you know like are smart Outlets
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:27,456	| IOT076 |	Where it it just fits over an existing Outlet
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,784	| IOT076 |	And then you know once you get a feel for what
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,808	| IOT076 |	It's all about
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,344	| IOT076 |	What's going on then you can
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,624	| IOT076 |	Going deeper with some
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:39,232	| IOT076 |	Sound like a door lock or thermostat or something that's going to require a little bit more
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:39,744	| IOT076 |	Install time
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:44,352	| IOT076 |	Got it yeah I'm always like light bulbs are good Outlets are good
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,632	| IOT076 |	And other things
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,144	| IOT076 |	They're a little bit more
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:51,264	| IOT076 |	What else like when first homekit came out
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:54,848	| IOT076 |	People kind of got frustrated because it was hard to tell Siri
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| IOT076 |	What things to turn on
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,176	| IOT076 |	And there's very
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:01,248	| IOT076 |	Real naming conventions that you need to follow
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:05,856	| IOT076 |	Do you want to give people some advice about how to name things for homekit
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| IOT076 |	To avoid Lake
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:11,744	| IOT076 |	You know I I remember actually I had this issue when I got my Amazon Echo
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,560	| IOT076 |	And connected it to my lights it was like
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,632	| IOT076 |	Kitchen light
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,192	| IOT076 |	It was a little ridiculous
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,216	| IOT076 |	So
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:25,312	| IOT076 |	What about what makes it easier or
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,336	| IOT076 |	How would we do that with him
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:33,248	| IOT076 |	So there's a ton of different ways to kind of give Siri commands to something
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,552	| IOT076 |	The most basic would be what you name a device
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,856	| IOT076 |	I think something that's
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,904	| IOT076 |	Easy to remember and
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,672	| IOT076 |	Easy to under
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,184	| IOT076 |	Stand
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,488	| IOT076 |	Is definitely important
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,512	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:50,656	| IOT076 |	Also that you know Series going to understand it too I think there were some issues early on that this is God
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:54,496	| IOT076 |	Way way better as time has gone on
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,056	| IOT076 |	Even throughout iOS 9 and definitely more in Iowa
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:01,920	| IOT076 |	You don't have to memorize a script book of phrases
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:04,480	| IOT076 |	You know things you would naturally say us you know
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:08,064	| IOT076 |	Turn on the bedroom light or turn on Adams bedroom lamp for
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:12,160	| IOT076 |	Something like that it's going to make sense and however you're going to phrase that
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:13,696	| IOT076 |	Siri will be able to figure that out
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,744	| IOT076 |	When you add a light bulb
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:19,072	| IOT076 |	Example to a room or lamp it gives you the
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,352	| IOT076 |	The option of saying
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:22,144	| IOT076 |	Hey this is Anna living room this isn't it better
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:26,752	| IOT076 |	And you should actually take the time to group your lights if you're doing
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:29,312	| IOT076 |	Several rooms at a time or one room at a time
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,616	| IOT076 |	Because then you can just
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,896	| IOT076 |	Say hey turn on the bedroom
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,176	| IOT076 |	And then that will have
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:35,968	| IOT076 |	Yasso
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:41,088	| IOT076 |	Definitely setting up rooms is a great way to command a bunch of devices at once
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:41,600	| IOT076 |	So then
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:45,440	| IOT076 |	You also have this concept of services so like all lights
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,208	| IOT076 |	RS Turbo
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:47,744	| IOT076 |	So then you could say things
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,256	| IOT076 |	Like
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,304	| IOT076 |	Turn off all the lights
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,072	| IOT076 |	In my bedroom
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,096	| IOT076 |	And that will
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:57,984	| IOT076 |	If you want to get him more cost of you can also program was called the scene so you can
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,032	| IOT076 |	Group together multiple devices
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:00,544	| IOT076 |	All at once
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:04,384	| IOT076 |	I haven't seen them like goodnight is a great example of one that
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:04,896	| IOT076 |	Built-in
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,968	| IOT076 |	Default and so you know
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:10,016	| IOT076 |	Whatever you want to do lock the doors
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,296	| IOT076 |	Turn off the lights
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,088	| IOT076 |	Set the thermostat down
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,136	| IOT076 |	When you say goodnight
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:18,976	| IOT076 |	Making program that all into that one action and then Siri understands
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,256	| IOT076 |	You say
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,536	| IOT076 |	You know hey Siri
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:24,608	| IOT076 |	Goodnight then it's going to program that scene
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,656	| IOT076 |	Set your house for whatever you sent there
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,472	| IOT076 |	All of our podcast listeners their house just went dark
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:33,056	| IOT076 |	Apple really did something cool here I think
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,104	| IOT076 |	Actually I first saw this with Sivan
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:35,616	| IOT076 |	Which is a
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,896	| IOT076 |	Can a higher end
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,944	| IOT076 |	Home automation company
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,224	| IOT076 |	But they actually let you
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:46,112	| IOT076 |	If you get if you basically set your lights up and maybe your thermostats perfect maybe
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:49,184	| IOT076 |	The dimness is great everything's perfect
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:52,768	| IOT076 |	You can actually just tell it to take a snapshot of that
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:53,536	| IOT076 |	Create that scene
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:56,096	| IOT076 |	Which I think is great cuz
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,376	| IOT076 |	You may be like hanging out
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:02,496	| IOT076 |	You know doing something to eat, look up and you're like you know it this is pretty nice I'm very comfortable
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,288	| IOT076 |	This is how we watch movies
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,080	| IOT076 |	Let's just make this our movie watching
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:07,360	| IOT076 |	You don't have to go back in life
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,408	| IOT076 |	Figure out how my lights are
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:14,528	| IOT076 |	20% or anything like that my air conditioner at 75
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,040	| IOT076 |	You just
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,832	| IOT076 |	It knows and I think
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,136	| IOT076 |	Those kind of touches are
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT076 |	Very Apple
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:23,488	| IOT076 |	Like actually I used to call Savant the apple of home automation
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,048	| IOT076 |	Now that Apple's doing
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:26,560	| IOT076 |	I don't know what I'm doing
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:31,168	| IOT076 |	Let's see what else do you like or is worth talking about
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:36,032	| IOT076 |	So I mean I think beyond the basics in the whole map
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:38,336	| IOT076 |	You know once you get diondoes
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:39,872	| IOT076 |	Initial things
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:45,504	| IOT076 |	Definitely getting into that automation tab is where you can start to do some more advanced stuff
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:48,064	| IOT076 |	So this should be where you kind of run
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:53,696	| IOT076 |	I do a lot of kind of scheduled stuff so my front porch lights are tied to this
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,976	| IOT076 |	So I have a
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:59,072	| IOT076 |	Daily automation to turn those off at a certain point and turn them on at
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:38:59,840	| IOT076 |	At sunset
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:02,144	| IOT076 |	You can also say
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,680	| IOT076 |	You know when
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:05,216	| IOT076 |	This device does
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,240	| IOT076 |	Something
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,008	| IOT076 |	Then
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,544	| IOT076 |	It'll trigger the scene
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:11,104	| IOT076 |	So cool example I like a V
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:11,872	| IOT076 |	To be like
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:13,920	| IOT076 |	Is there something you're doing anyways
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:17,760	| IOT076 |	That would say I'm going to bed so let's say
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:18,528	| IOT076 |	You turn off
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,552	| IOT076 |	Your bedside light
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:20,832	| IOT076 |	You could actually
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,392	| IOT076 |	Make a automation that would say
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,952	| IOT076 |	When I turn off my bedside light
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:27,232	| IOT076 |	Send trigger that good night
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:29,792	| IOT076 |	So instead of having to kind of be
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,072	| IOT076 |	Commanding of it
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:33,120	| IOT076 |	Just do that activity that you do anyway
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,424	| IOT076 |	In your regular routine
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,960	| IOT076 |	And I think that's where it starts to get
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:39,264	| IOT076 |	A little bit more while a little bit more
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:46,688	| IOT076 |	Senator tell everybody who tries to do this as someone who once spent six months trying to create the right
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,480	| IOT076 |	Automation for going to bed
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,552	| IOT076 |	I'm not sure it can be done if you live in a household
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:56,672	| IOT076 |	But I started with turning off my bedside light but then I ended up turning off
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,440	| IOT076 |	You know
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:59,232	| IOT076 |	Everything downstairs while my husband
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:39:59,744	| IOT076 |	Can we still down there
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,816	| IOT076 |	So then I was like okay
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,352	| IOT076 |	Let's say
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:08,448	| IOT076 |	Let's what I turn off my bedroom light and there's no motion downstairs for 15 minutes
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:11,008	| IOT076 |	That was not great because then
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,800	| IOT076 |	For 15 minutes afterwards like
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:14,848	| IOT076 |	Nothing would happen
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:15,360	| IOT076 |	And I was like
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:16,384	| IOT076 |	Go to sleep
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| IOT076 |	So
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:19,456	| IOT076 |	I played around with a bunch of different things in
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:20,736	| IOT076 |	I finally gave up
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:24,320	| IOT076 |	So if anyone else has some creative ways to indicate that feel free
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:26,880	| IOT076 |	My other thought was just stick up button on the bed and just
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,648	| IOT076 |	Prescient
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,696	| IOT076 |	But I got an echo when I just tell her
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,744	| IOT076 |	What do you do
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:32,512	| IOT076 |	Worse
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:34,560	| IOT076 |	Do you have more successful automations Maybe
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:37,888	| IOT076 |	I do a lot of timers that I'm running
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:40,448	| IOT076 |	I do some automations
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,728	| IOT076 |	Stuff like that
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:45,312	| IOT076 |	You could also get pretty complex you could kind of give it
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,336	| IOT076 |	Some variables of like
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,872	| IOT076 |	Only do this
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,152	| IOT076 |	When
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:52,480	| IOT076 |	You know this light's not on or something like that so
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:54,272	| IOT076 |	How to take it account that
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,552	| IOT076 |	That scenario
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,344	| IOT076 |	But yeah I mean I think
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:59,648	| IOT076 |	The important thing to remember to hear is like
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:01,440	| IOT076 |	They're just getting started with this stuff
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:07,840	| IOT076 |	It's definitely going to get more elegant and more advanced overtime kind of got to build a foundation for
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:08,608	| IOT076 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:10,912	| IOT076 |	So I think it's a great place to start and
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,704	| IOT076 |	It's only going to get more exciting
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:20,128	| IOT076 |	I feel like right now I'm having the same sort of feelings conversations and whatnot that I had probably too
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,920	| IOT076 |	Two or three years ago when all of like
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,712	| IOT076 |	SmartThings and
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,528	| IOT076 |	Staples connect Hub in the Lowe's Iris Club
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,576	| IOT076 |	Hub came out
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,856	| IOT076 |	Which was all around
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:32,416	| IOT076 |	Kind of programming an Automation and scenes
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:35,232	| IOT076 |	What is different this time around
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| IOT076 |	I would say the
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,840	| IOT076 |	Big difference is that
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,912	| IOT076 |	Certification PC talked about earlier
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,448	| IOT076 |	It's really important for
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:46,240	| IOT076 |	Security but it's also
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:50,336	| IOT076 |	Ensuring that all those products are going to work together so
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,384	| IOT076 |	I don't know that some of those other systems
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:54,687	| IOT076 |	Go to as much of an extent
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:59,807	| IOT076 |	To certify products it's more like you know that product builds in integration and
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,831	| IOT076 |	An Hayward
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:03,135	| IOT076 |	This is pretty deep
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,159	| IOT076 |	Level
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,183	| IOT076 |	You know integration
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:10,303	| IOT076 |	And I think as we move Beyond in a home automation where it is
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,583	| IOT076 |	Today 2
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,887	| IOT076 |	You know more of the kind of conscious home
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:15,423	| IOT076 |	Concept where
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:19,263	| IOT076 |	Enter your home is kind of adapting to you as you move through out at throughout the day
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,055	| IOT076 |	That's where this kind of
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:23,615	| IOT076 |	Deep level of integration between devices
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:24,383	| IOT076 |	Really going to matter
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:28,223	| IOT076 |	Another thing is how people might use apps
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:33,343	| IOT076 |	So you know if you're like me and you have dozens of connected devices you also have you know
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:36,927	| IOT076 |	Doesn't have to buy apps on your phone for those connected devices
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:42,047	| IOT076 |	Part of the promise of Home seems to be that I don't actually have to open those apps anymore
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:46,143	| IOT076 |	And I'm curious as a company that's making a device
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:48,191	| IOT076 |	Is there a way for me to like setup
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,471	| IOT076 |	Do I need to even
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,263	| IOT076 |	Download The Connect Sense app to
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,055	| IOT076 |	Connect a
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,847	| IOT076 |	Connectsense
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,615	| IOT076 |	Outlet
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,127	| IOT076 |	To home
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:43:01,759	| IOT076 |	So certainly we would still love you to download our app but as a
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:03,039	| IOT076 |	It stands today no
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,063	| IOT076 |	You wouldn't have to download it
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:08,671	| IOT076 |	For anything other than a firmware
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:12,511	| IOT076 |	So that's something that you wouldn't be able to do in
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:15,071	| IOT076 |	In-app so we definitely still recommend to our customer
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,375	| IOT076 |	Samurai pain there
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:19,167	| IOT076 |	Especially for that
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:20,447	| IOT076 |	I'm one of the cool things
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:21,471	| IOT076 |	Home does it do
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:26,079	| IOT076 |	Is that if you dive into the details for an individual device
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:28,639	| IOT076 |	Is it'll actually linked you out to that man
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,407	| IOT076 |	Facture app
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:32,223	| IOT076 |	So I think any time you're going to have
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:35,039	| IOT076 |	Middle set up or maybe troubleshooting or
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,319	| IOT076 |	Even some more advanced
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:39,647	| IOT076 |	Can't go into too much detail but we're working on
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:43,231	| IOT076 |	New features for our smart Outlets that you're not going to see in home
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:45,023	| IOT076 |	You know home is at basics.
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:47,071	| IOT076 |	You want to be able to turn outlets on and off
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:48,863	| IOT076 |	We're going to build
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:52,447	| IOT076 |	Some deeper cooler stuff that you're only going to be able to do in are at so
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:55,519	| IOT076 |	I think there's still a place for manufacturers apps
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,591	| IOT076 |	Home becomes kind of that
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:00,127	| IOT076 |	Default everyday experience
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:04,479	| IOT076 |	How many people do you think will want to go that much deeper
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:06,783	| IOT076 |	Is it feels like to bring
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:08,063	| IOT076 |	This into the mainstream
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:13,439	| IOT076 |	Homekit is addressing a lot of the issues like it's hard to get things connected
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:17,023	| IOT076 |	You know there's so many features that's hard to figure out what you want to do with this stuff
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:20,351	| IOT076 |	So in a way home is like a nice entry point
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,167	| IOT076 |	And the hope is you people will go deeper
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:26,239	| IOT076 |	How many people do you think
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:26,751	| IOT076 |	Really well
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:31,359	| IOT076 |	Yeah I mean I think you've got your mainstream user and
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,383	| IOT076 |	And they're probably going to
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,663	| IOT076 |	Stick mostly to home
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,199	| IOT076 |	Most manufacturers I think
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:37,759	| IOT076 |	Probably will recommend set up through their ass
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,527	| IOT076 |	You know a lot
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:39,039	| IOT076 |	Do
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:42,111	| IOT076 |	Special things are going to have some special sauce they need
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,903	| IOT076 |	Setup process
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:49,023	| IOT076 |	But that's fine but you know I think you have also your your hire end-users that are
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:49,791	| IOT076 |	You know
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:50,815	| IOT076 |	More
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:53,631	| IOT076 |	Going to want to do more complex things and I think that's it
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:55,679	| IOT076 |	Interesting place where manufacturers
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,215	| IOT076 |	Can still be Innovative and
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:57,983	| IOT076 |	Bison
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:58,495	| IOT076 |	Other unique
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:00,543	| IOT076 |	Queso
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:06,431	| IOT076 |	Most people feel like Hardware is going to be kind of commoditized in the space overtime
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:10,783	| IOT076 |	Are you guys worried about Apple kind of taking over the customer relationship for y'all
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:14,111	| IOT076 |	I'm not particularly worried about it I mean I think
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,903	| IOT076 |	It's still
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:18,207	| IOT076 |	They're going to help bring it to
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:19,743	| IOT076 |	To the mainstream and
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:21,535	| IOT076 |	That's good for Hardware companies
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,303	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:28,191	| IOT076 |	You know we are still going to look for ways where we can differentiate and provide great hardware and Grading
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,215	| IOT076 |	Experiences
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:31,775	| IOT076 |	And you know to me is it's a partnership
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:34,335	| IOT076 |	So I was excited when I saw
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,871	| IOT076 |	Stall mats I saw it as a
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:39,199	| IOT076 |	Endorsement I'm not seeing it as a threat to anything we're doing
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,479	| IOT076 |	Okay
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:44,831	| IOT076 |	All right things got a little dark there why don't you tell me your favorite thing to do with home
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:46,623	| IOT076 |	I would say my
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:47,647	| IOT076 |	Favorite things
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:50,719	| IOT076 |	Do is probably set up favorites
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:52,767	| IOT076 |	And then like I mentioned earlier you
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:53,791	| IOT076 |	Use those favorites
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:54,815	| IOT076 |	Control center
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:46:00,447	| IOT076 |	As of uses throughout the entire beta process that's probably the one thing I find myself using
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:02,751	| IOT076 |	The most cuz it's so quick and easy
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,287	| IOT076 |	And
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:05,823	| IOT076 |	Just gets whatever you're looking new
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:08,639	| IOT076 |	Get turned on or off for control Done Quick
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,175	| IOT076 |	Do you Siri very off
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:15,551	| IOT076 |	I do I still use it from time to time that's probably one I use more so for
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:16,831	| IOT076 |	Scenes
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:20,671	| IOT076 |	Quick control of another individual devices control center
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,183	| IOT076 |	My go-to
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:23,231	| IOT076 |	Okay and we should also mention that
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:25,279	| IOT076 |	When you're out of the home
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:29,375	| IOT076 |	You at will need an Apple TV to actually
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:32,447	| IOT076 |	Heard like timers and things that you said so scheduled items
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:36,287	| IOT076 |	You'll need an Apple TV to make sure those run when your phone isn't around
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:37,567	| IOT076 |	Or an iPad
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:38,847	| IOT076 |	So
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:41,151	| IOT076 |	I assume you have something like that in your house what is your
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:46,015	| IOT076 |	I do I use the Apple TV the latest
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:47,039	| IOT076 |	Greatest thing as Apple
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,319	| IOT076 |	Before
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:52,159	| IOT076 |	Contact us at HUB but I was really happy that they also gave that
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,951	| IOT076 |	That option for an iPad
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:54,975	| IOT076 |	In the settings field
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:47:01,375	| IOT076 |	Sitting for a lot of people iPads kind of a couch device that doesn't necessarily leave the home alone.
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:03,167	| IOT076 |	So that makes a ton of sense
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:04,447	| IOT076 |	Gives people some other out
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:06,495	| IOT076 |	Oh shirt yeah I've got
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:10,079	| IOT076 |	Who say I have iPad scattered everywhere
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,103	| IOT076 |	Mom so now I
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:16,735	| IOT076 |	Anything else you want to tell us about him
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:19,039	| IOT076 |	I know I meant think it's in
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:20,831	| IOT076 |	Exciting times definitely think
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:23,647	| IOT076 |	People should check it out when they upgrade to iOS
