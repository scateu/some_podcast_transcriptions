EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,432	| IOT136 |	Robot.
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,736	| IOT136 |	And if you were not around in
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,296	| IOT136 |	Thoughts so 2005
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,088	| IOT136 |	Mm
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,624	| IOT136 |	Sony introduced
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:05,696	| IOT136 |	Cute little robot dog called aibo
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:08,000	| IOT136 |	It was crazy expensive I did not own one
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,536	| IOT136 |	And then in 2006
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:10,560	| IOT136 |	They
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:15,680	| IOT136 |	They put it out yes they pulled the plug on
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,984	| IOT136 |	Add people were sad because
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:18,496	| IOT136 |	Cuz there were lots of
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,544	| IOT136 |	Who loves their eyebrows and back
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:23,360	| IOT136 |	They were actually people who held funerals for the
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,176	| IOT136 |	Big things
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| IOT136 |	So I was really excited
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,480	| IOT136 |	But then I
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:34,368	| IOT136 |	So is planning to be less excited with the new aibo
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT136 |	Wow
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,672	| IOT136 |	I think it's cool that they brought it back
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:40,768	| IOT136 |	I mean I'm not saying everybody needs a robotic dog and Stacy you have a dog I have a dog
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,328	| IOT136 |	Sometimes you can hear them on the show in the background
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:45,376	| IOT136 |	Put some people don't want to deal with
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,168	| IOT136 |	An actual dog and I get that
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:49,984	| IOT136 |	But you want to companion so that's what I though is before I get to the
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:53,056	| IOT136 |	It's actually an interesting product itself I mean
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:57,920	| IOT136 |	This is everybody dog that can move around 22 axis it's got OLED panels
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,736	| IOT136 |	Expertise issues expressions
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:05,344	| IOT136 |	Sony makes a lot of computer vision products so all those Imaging sensors and
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,368	| IOT136 |	Products like the iPhone
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,392	| IOT136 |	Sony makes
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:15,072	| IOT136 |	It's really cool to see Sony saying hey you know what computer vision is now a real thing happening in the world
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,888	| IOT136 |	And we got technology for this let's put it in this
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,424	| IOT136 |	Aptoide and see what happens
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:20,960	| IOT136 |	So it has
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,520	| IOT136 |	Yeah I mean it is impressive from a
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| IOT136 |	Technical standpoint
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| IOT136 |	Right
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,616	| IOT136 |	Is it though cuz here's where we get to
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,152	| IOT136 |	It reminds me of
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:34,272	| IOT136 |	Cosmo which is $150 connected toy for kids that is just a door
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| IOT136 |	And it has
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,856	| IOT136 |	Image recognition
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,368	| IOT136 |	It rolls around
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,184	| IOT136 |	Small Earth
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,208	| IOT136 |	Send the dog and it doesn't
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT136 |	Move is
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,256	| IOT136 |	It doesn't have the
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,536	| IOT136 |	22 access web movie
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,864	| IOT136 |	It cost 150 and I
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,680	| IOT136 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,216	| IOT136 |	This is not a toy
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:59,360	| IOT136 |	But even if it was what's a $700 a thousand dollars less
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,408	| IOT136 |	I still would not be interested this is why
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:05,504	| IOT136 |	On top of the purchase price there is a monthly subscription
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,832	| IOT136 |	That is going to cost you $26 a month
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,624	| IOT136 |	You have to have that for like 3 years
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:14,464	| IOT136 |	And that's giving the dog Wi-Fi and LTE connectivity
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT136 |	Cloud backup cuz you know
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:16,768	| IOT136 |	Because you want to
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,559	| IOT136 |	Remember where he got his bone you could
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,911	| IOT136 |	There's an app that goes along with it I mean
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,983	| IOT136 |	A subscription for a dog I don't know
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,799	| IOT136 |	Should I buy food for my dog
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,847	| IOT136 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:33,663	| IOT136 |	Guess what your dog doesn't have life he can't be used as wifi hotspot
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:37,759	| IOT136 |	I don't know I mean this is just that it's just a stretch
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| IOT136 |	To me a lot of money
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,319	| IOT136 |	It is a lot of my
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,623	| IOT136 |	And I will purchase
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,487	| IOT136 |	The original was too early for its
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:51,071	| IOT136 |	And I think this is now the right time for something like this
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,351	| IOT136 |	And
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:57,471	| IOT136 |	I actually think there will be an audience for it even with the $26 a month subscription fee
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:57,983	| IOT136 |	Although
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,031	| IOT136 |	Kind of like does my robotic
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,055	| IOT136 |	Nini Deli
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,895	| IOT136 |	I mean I feel like we're going to start seeing people ask
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,943	| IOT136 |	These questions because right now
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,503	| IOT136 |	Cellular costs are still very high
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,015	| IOT136 |	Compared to you
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| IOT136 |	Wi-Fi which is basic
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| IOT136 |	And so
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:13,855	| IOT136 |	I think
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,183	| IOT136 |	Maybe they could have chop that subscription fee
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,719	| IOT136 |	And the bill of materials to make
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,231	| IOT136 |	A dog
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,279	| IOT136 |	A bit
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,303	| IOT136 |	Okay I was just making Wi-Fi
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| IOT136 |	If you wanted to
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,607	| IOT136 |	Take your dog to
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:30,495	| IOT136 |	You have Wi-Fi at the Starbucks but getting to and from the Starbucks you have to
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:37,663	| IOT136 |	Healthy I guess but it's kind of interesting I agree that yes there is an audience for this I remember reading about older folks
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,479	| IOT136 |	Lived alone fat companion
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:45,087	| IOT136 |	And I'm not going to judge on that that if that helps those people then so be it I think that's great
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| IOT136 |	But this is not
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| IOT136 |	Mass Market
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,415	| IOT136 |	Product in my opinion now
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,439	| IOT136 |	You know nothing
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,767	| IOT136 |	Well let's talk about San Diego
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:56,607	| IOT136 |	Because I've been there twice this year and I love it it's a lovely place
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:58,911	| IOT136 |	And it is getting smarter
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| IOT136 |	This is not
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:03,519	| IOT136 |	Exactly new we talked about San Diego in the past
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,799	| IOT136 |	Because it's had a pilot Smart City
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,871	| IOT136 |	Graham now that pilot is moving into production
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:14,015	| IOT136 |	And they're working with cheese current to manage the LED Street lamps in the city
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,807	| IOT136 |	They also are
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:19,135	| IOT136 |	They put in 3200 sensors and they're going to stick
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,927	| IOT136 |	3000 more sensors
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,207	| IOT136 |	In the city which is
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,743	| IOT136 |	Quite a lot of sensors
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:28,607	| IOT136 |	Yeah I mean this is a whole city wide after this is not just like sections of the city there
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,911	| IOT136 |	Spending 30 million dollars to deploy this
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,679	| IOT136 |	And
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:37,823	| IOT136 |	I think it's good I am a little worried because they are working with ge's current they're throwing everything into products
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,103	| IOT136 |	Cheese products
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:42,943	| IOT136 |	So I'm kind of like what happens to that data I do feel like
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:49,087	| IOT136 |	A lot of Articles focusing on the Smart City don't think about who has access to that data how it's managed in
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,415	| IOT136 |	Even inside a city one of the challenges that
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:55,999	| IOT136 |	Cities have to deal with in it's worth it for the citizens to know is
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,279	| IOT136 |	How
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,815	| IOT136 |	The data from different sensors
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,607	| IOT136 |	Is shared across
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:01,887	| IOT136 |	So
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:05,471	| IOT136 |	Do police have access to you no surveillance cameras or do they have there
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,823	| IOT136 |	And those kind of things become really important
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| IOT136 |	When you think about
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,615	| IOT136 |	Qatar privacy app
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,895	| IOT136 |	Locations and
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,663	| IOT136 |	Economic
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| IOT136 |	Considerations
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:17,247	| IOT136 |	Right right some of the services that AR
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:22,623	| IOT136 |	Rolling out actually touch upon that in fact is they're looking at installing shotspotter which is affecting
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:25,951	| IOT136 |	Location of gunshots in real time and at first I thought I was a good idea about
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:30,303	| IOT136 |	Before the show station I was talking about and she didn't mention to me that the last cities that use shotspotter
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:36,703	| IOT136 |	Are actually getting rid of it and I did not realize that never definitely privacy implications there of sensors that are
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,983	| IOT136 |	Listening for gunshots that
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,311	| IOT136 |	Can also record conversations and so on so forth so that's
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,359	| IOT136 |	Definitely something that needs to be considered
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,639	| IOT136 |	Yes and
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:48,735	| IOT136 |	It's probably not a lot of cities taking it out but several cities are taking it out the
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,295	| IOT136 |	Because they felt like they didn't San Antonio is one
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:57,951	| IOT136 |	They're talking about it Oakland is another concern to that you know it's a little redundant people will report gunshots
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,487	| IOT136 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| IOT136 |	When they hear the
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,839	| IOT136 |	Sometimes there's false positives and that was a problem
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| IOT136 |	932 privacy concern
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:09,215	| IOT136 |	Shotspotter microphones keep recording
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,727	| IOT136 |	After
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,007	| IOT136 |	Detect shots
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,055	| IOT136 |	So please have use that in
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,847	| IOT136 |	In court to try to invite
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,383	| IOT136 |	People for crimes now
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| IOT136 |	If those people committed the crime
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:21,503	| IOT136 |	Probably okay but if not they just have to be at the wrong place at the wrong time
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| IOT136 |	Recipe you know
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,343	| IOT136 |	So there are definitely some
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,623	| IOT136 |	Liberties
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,647	| IOT136 |	Things to think about here
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,695	| IOT136 |	I hope the cities are
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,719	| IOT136 |	And speaking
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,487	| IOT136 |	Of a lack of privacy
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,535	| IOT136 |	Let's talk about Apple
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,047	| IOT136 |	Because it is
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:40,447	| IOT136 |	Cell focus on user privacy and I think that's probably going to be a problem for it going forward into the smartphone
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| IOT136 |	Basically
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,007	| IOT136 |	There's bad news for homepod
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,799	| IOT136 |	Lovers and lovers
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,079	| IOT136 |	I guess you can't love it yet it doesn't
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:50,175	| IOT136 |	It's not out by the homepod speaker when it comes out
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,455	| IOT136 |	There's
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:57,855	| IOT136 |	Kevin yeah I mean it's for the homepod comes out next month for $349 and
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:04,255	| IOT136 |	Apple hasn't really said much about it so we're all kind of guessing what will it be able to do with behave like
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,815	| IOT136 |	OK Google Home Products on Amazon Echo products
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| IOT136 |	Not out of the box
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:13,471	| IOT136 |	Is what I can tell you right now and that's because the SDK for it Apple has just provided to Developers
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,031	| IOT136 |	Say hey here you can start making apps for the homepod
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,311	| IOT136 |	But
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:20,127	| IOT136 |	Only in a few categories such as messaging list
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| IOT136 |	Endnote
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| IOT136 |	2
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,711	| IOT136 |	You'll be able to use
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:30,111	| IOT136 |	Homepod to control Apple music by voice but I don't see any third-party Music Services coming anytime soon
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,623	| IOT136 |	Because
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:35,999	| IOT136 |	There's no way to do that Apple hasn't provided a way to do that so it seems like it's going to be a very limited
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,791	| IOT136 |	Experience and the shame of it is
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| IOT136 |	And my opinion
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:42,143	| IOT136 |	Siri is already a limited experience because
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:48,543	| IOT136 |	It's not as smart at getting information in my opinion is some of the other assistants out there and of course it is within Apple's wall
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,591	| IOT136 |	Olive Garden which there's pros and cons to that I
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,871	| IOT136 |	No issue there but
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,943	| IOT136 |	It's just an observation you know he's going to work with homekit
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,223	| IOT136 |	But what else
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| IOT136 |	You know I ain't just
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:59,039	| IOT136 |	I think this is going to be a very
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,343	| IOT136 |	Limited product when it first comes out
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,903	| IOT136 |	Well in that was very much like homekit
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,951	| IOT136 |	And homekit is much better now
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,743	| IOT136 |	But even today
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| IOT136 |	Developers are still Lake
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| IOT136 |	Where's my homekit support
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:17,983	| IOT136 |	They've been promising homekit products and haven't actually released them because of challenges working within the
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,263	| IOT136 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,543	| IOT136 |	And so
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:24,895	| IOT136 |	I was really excited about homepod and I thought this would actually help push
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,175	| IOT136 |	Homekit to the mainstream
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,503	| IOT136 |	This does not make me feel like
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,527	| IOT136 |	That's going to happen
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:34,623	| IOT136 |	And it's frustrating as a reviewer someone who talks about the
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:41,023	| IOT136 |	The stuff because so many consumers are looking forward to homekit I get so many questions about things were
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,071	| IOT136 |	Working with homekit and people have been waiting for
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,863	| IOT136 |	Literally years and
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,143	| IOT136 |	Feels like
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| IOT136 |	Apple has promised them
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| IOT136 |	Something that works in
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| IOT136 |	So far
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,031	| IOT136 |	It's pretty minimal
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,567	| IOT136 |	Everyone else feels Miles Ahead
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| IOT136 |	Will it does work
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,383	| IOT136 |	It's just Luke
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,199	| IOT136 |	You don't have to breath of options
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,735	| IOT136 |	That you had with other platforms
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,015	| IOT136 |	PreSonus support standpoint
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,551	| IOT136 |	And you had said that a lot of these
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,575	| IOT136 |	Product makers
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:10,207	| IOT136 |	That deal with challenges not only challenges but changes because Apple went from a hardware base than occasionally
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:15,839	| IOT136 |	Security bit to software-based in I mean that stuff to these companies can't change in a diamond
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,607	| IOT136 |	Producing Hardware
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,399	| IOT136 |	So that has caused delays
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,447	| IOT136 |	Thanks and maybe some people just like you know what
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:25,055	| IOT136 |	Like you said others feel Miles Ahead such as Google's and Amazon's ecosystem
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:28,895	| IOT136 |	Maybe people just throwing their hands up and saying we'll get down get when we get to it
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:33,247	| IOT136 |	Yeah and I would say from a developer side that makes a lot of sense from
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,271	| IOT136 |	Consumers
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:38,111	| IOT136 |	I don't want to say look Amazon's really good it's easy to work with
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:42,975	| IOT136 |	Do that or Google if you're already on a bunch of Google services Google home has
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| IOT136 |	Over 6
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,327	| IOT136 |	Christie Partners right now in the smart home section it is definitely a
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,167	| IOT136 |	Do you want to keep waiting
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:57,311	| IOT136 |	Good waiting and I'm in Apple's ecosystem
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,359	| IOT136 |	I would say it's not
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,151	| IOT136 |	So I'm sad
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,967	| IOT136 |	Well I think a lot of people will purchase this
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,015	| IOT136 |	Even with these potential
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:08,831	| IOT136 |	Limitations just because of the bus sound
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,135	| IOT136 |	Quality is my gas and they will feel it
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT136 |	349
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,999	| IOT136 |	And Apple's technology they are getting a better sound system than what's available
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,303	| IOT136 |	That's just what people may think and that's fine
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| IOT136 |	And it will work with her
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,119	| IOT136 |	It has Siri support
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:27,519	| IOT136 |	For built-in but if you want to control Spotify for example by voice that's not happening you have to do it through if it's
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:31,615	| IOT136 |	Play Spotify through AirPlay 2 and control by voice on your phone not through the
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,919	| IOT136 |	Speaker itself so it just seems
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,943	| IOT136 |	Talk Dirty to Me
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| IOT136 |	Awkward
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,503	| IOT136 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,855	| IOT136 |	Okay here's some fun news bits before we get to
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,671	| IOT136 |	Arvig review of the Echo Plus and Amazon smart home
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,719	| IOT136 |	Which is
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,743	| IOT136 |	Coyote
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,303	| IOT136 |	Form as a service
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,095	| IOT136 |	For companies that are
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,375	| IOT136 |	Usually selling products
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:55,679	| IOT136 |	Consumer so think big name brands
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,215	| IOT136 |	Are selling connected products to Consumers
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,007	| IOT136 |	Girl who stood on
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:04,383	| IOT136 |	Ala and they just raised $60 in a series D round
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:04,895	| IOT136 |	Stay
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,455	| IOT136 |	The capital but they're doing it
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:09,503	| IOT136 |	Because they are going
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,831	| IOT136 |	And they are creating a joint venture in China with sunset
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| IOT136 |	Communication
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,879	| IOT136 |	Telco
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,647	| IOT136 |	Telecommunications
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| IOT136 |	In China
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:21,791	| IOT136 |	And I think this is gray tail has been around since before the iot was
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,071	| IOT136 |	Even a thing
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,095	| IOT136 |	Really they've been around
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,631	| IOT136 |	2010
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT136 |	Which
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:28,447	| IOT136 |	Holy mackerel that's a really long time ago
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,263	| IOT136 |	What house what else was happening
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,847	| IOT136 |	Can I have 2 years that's a long time
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:37,663	| IOT136 |	What's before Nest which was when everyone was like oh my God
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,015	| IOT136 |	And I've got a crack update for everyone
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,831	| IOT136 |	We talked about this two weeks ago crap is a
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:50,975	| IOT136 |	Vulnerability in the Wi-Fi protocol itself with client devices and your router's so all of your
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| IOT136 |	Phones
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:54,047	| IOT136 |	Smart ovens smart whatever's
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,583	| IOT136 |	Are all affected
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:58,911	| IOT136 |	Wi-Fi and most companies have done a really good job
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,447	| IOT136 |	Either they are not
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,727	| IOT136 |	Vulnerable to the attack
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,007	| IOT136 |	That's because of the way they structured
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,799	| IOT136 |	Their products
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:08,383	| IOT136 |	Which is Yay good June nest and feel like wink
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:12,223	| IOT136 |	Is in that category and then others have been updating
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,247	| IOT136 |	Like mad
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:18,879	| IOT136 |	Crazy Mad personally my Nvidia Shield got an update for that address this as well as added other features
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,975	| IOT136 |	I bought an essential phone last week and got an update through them
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,535	| IOT136 |	From Google with that address McCracken chorizo
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,839	| IOT136 |	I was surprised how quickly on some of my devices
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,119	| IOT136 |	That actually showed up
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,911	| IOT136 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,239	| IOT136 |	What didn't get update
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,543	| IOT136 |	Is actually pretty stunning to me so
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:40,639	| IOT136 |	Two big names in the iot space and in their outer space
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,919	| IOT136 |	I reached out to Belkin
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:46,015	| IOT136 |	The day of and they were like yeah we're working on it
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:46,783	| IOT136 |	What's out there
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,831	| IOT136 |	So now two weeks later I felt like
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,855	| IOT136 |	Okay let's just check in
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:56,255	| IOT136 |	They still haven't released a patch for their devices and then the other is tp-link which is another big router maker but
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:15:00,351	| IOT136 |	Also makes the casa and other connected devices
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| IOT136 |	They have light bulbs
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,423	| IOT136 |	Kasa smart home app
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:06,751	| IOT136 |	And they have not done an update either although they do
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,775	| IOT136 |	Did say hey yes
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,543	| IOT136 |	Yes we're aware of it
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| IOT136 |	So
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:09,823	| IOT136 |	I don't know what to say
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,127	| IOT136 |	I look at this and this is why
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| IOT136 |	Hive historically been
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,943	| IOT136 |	I don't know about 2 p.m.
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,455	| IOT136 |	Alex products
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,247	| IOT136 |	Worries me
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:20,831	| IOT136 |	I am also a little worried about the security on wemos products just because of the
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| IOT136 |	The way that's built
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:25,695	| IOT136 |	It's a known fact that you can walk into someone's house if you're running
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,463	| IOT136 |	A WeMo
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,767	| IOT136 |	App if you walk onto their Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:32,095	| IOT136 |	You can actually control their WeMo devices if you have access to their
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,799	| IOT136 |	Tp-link sort of surprises because Google partnered with them for the original Google onhub router they were two models of that
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,823	| IOT136 |	Tp-link made one of them
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,919	| IOT136 |	I'm sorry it's not that they're not
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,431	| IOT136 |	They just haven't
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| IOT136 |	We have
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:49,759	| IOT136 |	People working
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:51,551	| IOT136 |	And
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,623	| IOT136 |	Mozilla
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,647	| IOT136 |	Because they're still around
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,671	| IOT136 |	Music
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| IOT136 |	Ouch
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,279	| IOT136 |	I love Mozilla because
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:01,791	| IOT136 |	What they're doing
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,327	| IOT136 |	Work on the open
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,375	| IOT136 |	Privacy rights I shouldn't
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:11,519	| IOT136 |	I heard they're not as prominent as they once were for various reasons I agree I agree
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:14,079	| IOT136 |	I need credit is iot effort that felt like
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,871	| IOT136 |	If you just like
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:16,895	| IOT136 |	So
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,199	| IOT136 |	But they did survey
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,479	| IOT136 |	190000
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT136 |	The people
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| IOT136 |	And
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| IOT136 |	Discovered how people felt about
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:26,111	| IOT136 |	Privacy and smart devices and Kevin
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,159	| IOT136 |	What jumped out at you for
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:34,559	| IOT136 |	This will have you obviously a lot of people are concerned about privacy and this is global by the way this is not just
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,095	| IOT136 |	190000 people in one
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:42,495	| IOT136 |	Region of the world is global privacy and that kind of filled to some degree that ship has
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,519	| IOT136 |	Assailed
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:47,359	| IOT136 |	But I totally understand that people still really don't understand
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,895	| IOT136 |	Peyote and all the difference
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,687	| IOT136 |	Things that make it work
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:55,039	| IOT136 |	They said fewer than 30% of respondents said they can't explain IRT or botnets
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:55,551	| IOT136 |	Blockchain
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,599	| IOT136 |	RFID for example
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:01,183	| IOT136 |	And fewer than 40% could explain what a DDOS attack was so
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| IOT136 |	Yeah people still have a lot of
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,535	| IOT136 |	Learning to do and I blame kind of the industry and
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:08,607	| IOT136 |	The people like us to degree who explain it I mean we need to
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:13,471	| IOT136 |	Get the message out more to get people to understand what they're buying into if they're going to look towards this future or so
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,007	| IOT136 |	I agreed
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:19,615	| IOT136 |	The thing is it actually sucked me what is Brazil
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| IOT136 |	So resilient
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:27,807	| IOT136 |	They have both in Brazil in India they have the highest rate of connected Appliance ownership at 15%
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,087	| IOT136 |	7% for the rest of the
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:34,975	| IOT136 |	And Brazilian respondents were the most excited about how quote-unquote easy as Martin
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:38,047	| IOT136 |	4% selected
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,071	| IOT136 |	The top benefit
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,351	| IOT136 |	The world being more
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,655	| IOT136 |	So the Brazilians are like
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,167	| IOT136 |	Super Pump
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| IOT136 |	People in the US France the UK
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,263	| IOT136 |	Canada there were less
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,823	| IOT136 |	I don't know I just like
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,335	| IOT136 |	Go Brasil
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:57,247	| IOT136 |	Yeah I wonder and I don't have like Molly I should you have a survey data out there so I'll go check it out shorts I wonder how the
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:00,319	| IOT136 |	People in Brazil feel about the privacy and security as a result
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,087	| IOT136 |	Are they
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:05,183	| IOT136 |	Kind of like saying I don't care just get me connected baby I want to live this life
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:09,023	| IOT136 |	That would be very interesting to see so I'm going to go back into the rug surveyed and check that out
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| IOT136 |	Yeah cuz
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,607	| IOT136 |	I want to go to Brazil now
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,423	| IOT136 |	Adidas fun
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,983	| IOT136 |	Just because why not
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:22,591	| IOT136 |	Sure is something I enabled and I thought was really cool you guys
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,127	| IOT136 |	May already know about it be
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| IOT136 |	Because it was report
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,919	| IOT136 |	Earlier this month but
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,735	| IOT136 |	The Google home if you're part of the preview
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,783	| IOT136 |	And you can go and become part of the
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:32,575	| IOT136 |	The pretty version of the software
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,855	| IOT136 |	You get something called
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| IOT136 |	Google home
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,647	| IOT136 |	Night mode
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,439	| IOT136 |	And if you know what this is
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| IOT136 |	You are ahead of me
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,047	| IOT136 |	How is awesome
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,607	| IOT136 |	Basically what it does is
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,375	| IOT136 |	When it's night
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,655	| IOT136 |	Nighttime
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:50,751	| IOT136 |	You can set particular hours for the Google home to lower volume
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,263	| IOT136 |	Intimately
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,567	| IOT136 |	Which
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| IOT136 |	Yes because
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:19:01,247	| IOT136 |	Like my daughter runs around in this is less a Google home thing but she does turn up the volume
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,039	| IOT136 |	11
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,575	| IOT136 |	Turn music loud
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,367	| IOT136 |	So you know sometimes
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,391	| IOT136 |	Play tonight
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,671	| IOT136 |	Turn off the light
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,463	| IOT136 |	And holy cow
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:16,863	| IOT136 |	Okay I have a similar situation the girls go to bed a lot earlier than I do so I'll send
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:22,495	| IOT136 |	In my office I watch TV and we talk to the Google home either to turn the TV off shut the lights dim the lights whatever
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:26,591	| IOT136 |	And it is so loud because I was listening music loud during the day time so the LED is really
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:32,991	| IOT136 |	I'm the only one in the room but boy oh boy every time I go to bed pretty much wake everybody up the Google home so I'm going to get in that bed approach
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,759	| IOT136 |	Why didn't
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,039	| IOT136 |	But I want this
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,063	| IOT136 |	I don't know why you didn't either
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT136 |	Anime
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,671	| IOT136 |	Go get that
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,951	| IOT136 |	Prettiest
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,719	| IOT136 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,743	| IOT136 |	Speaking of matinee
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,255	| IOT136 |	That was like
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,559	| IOT136 |	Gluteus
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,095	| IOT136 |	I got the
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| IOT136 |	I got it yesterday
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,679	| IOT136 |	And started play
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,471	| IOT136 |	It's there two parts to the
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,287	| IOT136 |	This one is the Echo Plus is Hardware itself
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:01,407	| IOT136 |	And then to the stuff that Amazon has now recently done to make it smart home interface
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,455	| IOT136 |	Is it better or just different
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,247	| IOT136 |	We're going to go with
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:08,575	| IOT136 |	Different right now but go ahead
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:09,855	| IOT136 |	So.
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:11,647	| IOT136 |	Hardware for the Echo Plus
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,415	| IOT136 |	Is
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:12,927	| IOT136 |	Excellent
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,719	| IOT136 |	Substantial piece
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,999	| IOT136 |	Equipment
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:20,095	| IOT136 |	Sounds good it sounds a little bit better than the echo it's probably not as good as the Sonos one
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,655	| IOT136 |	And it
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,191	| IOT136 |	Has a zigbee radio in
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,495	| IOT136 |	So initially I set it up
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:30,335	| IOT136 |	In my own home but since I have a hub for most of my zigbee bulbs
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| IOT136 |	Because they're
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,895	| IOT136 |	Philips Hue I was like
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,687	| IOT136 |	I don't know what is happening
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,735	| IOT136 |	I took it off
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,527	| IOT136 |	I reset it up on my guest Network
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,343	| IOT136 |	With the pulpit actually came with it which was a
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,367	| IOT136 |	Philips Hue bulb
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,391	| IOT136 |	Is a white bulb
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,439	| IOT136 |	And I set that up and let me tell you
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,463	| IOT136 |	Super easy
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,023	| IOT136 |	So the Echo Plus is not something you need
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,815	| IOT136 |	Unless you don't have any
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,839	| IOT136 |	Other hubs that
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:52,863	| IOT136 |	Zigbee in
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| IOT136 |	So and
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:21:01,055	| IOT136 |	If I could just add I think that is why they did not include a Z-Wave radio because this is targeted for people who do not already have Smart Home
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,567	| IOT136 |	UPS
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,871	| IOT136 |	That's my takeaway
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,687	| IOT136 |	You probably don't need this most of people listen to the show
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,503	| IOT136 |	Fridge is fine
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:12,575	| IOT136 |	If you want to give you know your parents
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT136 |	Or someone
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,111	| IOT136 |	A lovely gift
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| IOT136 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,159	| IOT136 |	This actually might be a good price
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:18,208	| IOT136 |	So I tested it with a Philips Hue bulb
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,768	| IOT136 |	I also had an osram bulb and it worked
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,792	| IOT136 |	And
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:24,352	| IOT136 |	I don't know what else to tell you about this other than
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,632	| IOT136 |	Yeah don't by your heart
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:29,216	| IOT136 |	Yeah I reckon so somebody that way just get the list
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:33,568	| IOT136 |	Expensive that goes if that's what you want to do because you also said they changed the software
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,616	| IOT136 |	And I have seen some of this
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:37,664	| IOT136 |	Last week in factories are newsletter
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:39,712	| IOT136 |	Bird was a support page
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:44,064	| IOT136 |	That showed how you could add Echo devices to your smart home groups
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:50,976	| IOT136 |	And by doing so instead of having to say the name of the lights in the room with the echo you can then just say
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,024	| IOT136 |	Lights on or lights off and based on
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,048	| IOT136 |	Proximity
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:56,096	| IOT136 |	But the group setting essentially
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:22:01,728	| IOT136 |	The actor would know which like you're talkin about without naming them and it would take that action which is a beautiful thing
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:08,128	| IOT136 |	I should point out it only works with Echo devices so if you have a smart home speaker that has the voice
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:08,896	| IOT136 |	Services
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,176	| IOT136 |	Then it will not work
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,712	| IOT136 |	And it only works with
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:17,344	| IOT136 |	Bulbs as we found out where the WeMo switch in my group and Stacy I think you two have a Wiimote and something else
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:20,928	| IOT136 |	I have a WeMo Insight switch I have a Lutron fan
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,208	| IOT136 |	And I have a
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| IOT136 |	A WeMo Insight and WeMo dimmer
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,328	| IOT136 |	Right so those wemos make gumballs
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT136 |	Smart
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:33,728	| IOT136 |	And this setting will not work with those with only work with smart bulbs
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,312	| IOT136 |	But it is a little sad
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,360	| IOT136 |	Because I have a hodgepodge of
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,896	| IOT136 |	Different reasons
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:46,272	| IOT136 |	Places like so I have my WeMo Insight switch to test like how much things
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,808	| IOT136 |	How much electricity
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:51,392	| IOT136 |	But it's also nice because I can set sunrise sunset
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,672	| IOT136 |	As my schedules on the
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,464	| IOT136 |	Insight switch and I like
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:55,744	| IOT136 |	As a automatic
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:23:01,120	| IOT136 |	So I don't think I can do Sunrise scheduling yet for the Amazon extra
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,888	| IOT136 |	You can't do schedule
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,656	| IOT136 |	Because it's not
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| IOT136 |	Not really a homo
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:03,936	| IOT136 |	Automation platform
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:08,288	| IOT136 |	So we're probably seeing is Amazon moving into a home automation
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:12,384	| IOT136 |	Platform slowly and surely and I will see you interface
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,664	| IOT136 |	On the app so if I go in
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,712	| IOT136 |	Any devices I see all of my
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,992	| IOT136 |	50 Cent my devices
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:22,368	| IOT136 |	Arrow in two columns it looks very much like a SmartThings does with its devices even
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,904	| IOT136 |	Actually wink doesn't
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,720	| IOT136 |	Into
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,280	| IOT136 |	But SmartThings has
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,560	| IOT136 |	And I actually like
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,096	| IOT136 |	So but
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:42,848	| IOT136 |	Hard to say I mean for people who again our first time buyers of a hub and they buy this they won't have
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,128	| IOT136 |	Have anything to compare it to
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,408	| IOT136 |	So
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:49,248	| IOT136 |	You and I miss you it's a little more complicated than it used to be but they'll never know
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,576	| IOT136 |	Yes
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:24:00,000	| IOT136 |	You can also add scene so remember how we were talking about with the software developers were going to do with
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:03,328	| IOT136 |	In a Philips Hue if you don't have the Hub do you need the app with is
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:08,448	| IOT136 |	The answer is you do need the skill so you will need to log in on the app
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,216	| IOT136 |	If you want to
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,496	| IOT136 |	Control
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,264	| IOT136 |	Lots of stuff
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,568	| IOT136 |	I should have said that earlier and
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,128	| IOT136 |	I couldn't get any of the scenes that it pulled in for
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,640	| IOT136 |	From Phillips to work
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,664	| IOT136 |	So
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:20,480	| IOT136 |	I'm still trying to figure out what I did wrong there
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,248	| IOT136 |	Since I
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:24,576	| IOT136 |	I've had it for like 12 hours and some of those hours were Halloween and sleeping
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,904	| IOT136 |	I don't have the new help but my wink shortcuts
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:30,720	| IOT136 |	Showing up in scenes and are still working
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,488	| IOT136 |	Cuts of always showed up
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,072	| IOT136 |	Shortcuts have always
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,144	| IOT136 |	As they were in the device
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:38,656	| IOT136 |	Craigslist so now they
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,216	| IOT136 |	I now have a
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,984	| IOT136 |	A lot more
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:42,752	| IOT136 |	So I have things
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,288	| IOT136 |	Arctic Aurora
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,312	| IOT136 |	You know what that is
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,336	| IOT136 |	Color Loop
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:47,616	| IOT136 |	I have also
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,640	| IOT136 |	They don't really have them
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| IOT136 |	Cuz they don't
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:55,808	| IOT136 |	Yeah I wonder if they would with the Hue bridge in use
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,344	| IOT136 |	Could it sounds like that's where they coming from
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,112	| IOT136 |	No
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,648	| IOT136 |	This was me testing it
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,928	| IOT136 |	Unknot the
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| IOT136 |	Plus
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:04,000	| IOT136 |	This was me testing it on the other echos
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| IOT136 |	Not the Plus
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:05,792	| IOT136 |	Got you
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:06,816	| IOT136 |	Oh it's okay
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:08,608	| IOT136 |	I'm going to buy a shed
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,960	| IOT136 |	In the shed
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:18,080	| IOT136 |	Look for it because soon I'm going to be rationalizing Miami
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:20,128	| IOT136 |	Echoes because I have way too many
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,640	| IOT136 |	Maybe we'll
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,456	| IOT136 |	Give away the Plus for someone who needs a smart
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,552	| IOT136 |	Happy holidays to our users

EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,488	| IOT136 |	A very smart one
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,000	| IOT136 |	Might I add
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| IOT136 |	From Brian
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,816	| IOT136 |	Ecstasy
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,888	| IOT136 |	This is Brian Denver Amazon
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| IOT136 |	Amazon delivery service
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,472	| IOT136 |	I believe it Amazon Cloud cam
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,496	| IOT136 |	Actually there
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| IOT136 |	Check Amazon fraud
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:27,968	| IOT136 |	Talk to him is actually required feature of Amazon in terms of service state that must be facing the door you
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,736	| IOT136 |	Use for delivery
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,760	| IOT136 |	Arizona ski happiness
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:33,600	| IOT136 |	Amazon music player photos for videos
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,160	| IOT136 |	Stinky cream to demonstrate
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:36,928	| IOT136 |	August
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:41,280	| IOT136 |	Say snitcher someone can't blame the Amazon delivery person
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,304	| IOT136 |	For pre-existing
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,376	| IOT136 |	Which probably explains why Amazon is getting
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,144	| IOT136 |	Sojourner
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,912	| IOT136 |	In the prices Key bundle
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,216	| IOT136 |	Camera
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:49,984	| IOT136 |	Free insulation
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,312	| IOT136 |	Anyway that's my two bits
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,872	| IOT136 |	Already
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:27:02,784	| IOT136 |	That is a super astute observation Brian obviously the Amazon Cloud Cam and the key tool
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,552	| IOT136 |	Livery service
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,320	| IOT136 |	Sandlock
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:08,160	| IOT136 |	Helps consumers because you know if you're ordering from Amazon Prime and
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,208	| IOT136 |	It's getting delivered in your house where you want it
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,256	| IOT136 |	Delivery people are not running a muck in your house
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,072	| IOT136 |	You know watching TV while you're gone and whatnot
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,096	| IOT136 |	But yes
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,376	| IOT136 |	Shame on me for not looking at like
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:23,776	| IOT136 |	The terms of service and all that kind of requires that cloud cam because this does protect Amazon as well you know you not to be able to say some
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,544	| IOT136 |	It was not delivered
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,848	| IOT136 |	LSA the delivery person
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,384	| IOT136 |	Threw it on the front porch
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,152	| IOT136 |	Now it's damaged
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:31,200	| IOT136 |	Send me another one ready that soup
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,248	| IOT136 |	It really doesn't make sense
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:37,856	| IOT136 |	Photos the consumer and for Amazon to require that cloud cam for the key delivery service
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,136	| IOT136 |	Agreed
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,672	| IOT136 |	Let me have such smart

EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:24,608	| IOT136 |	Trust me I'm working on two really interesting area one of them is connected vehicles and in that space
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,400	| IOT136 |	We're really seeing the
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,424	| IOT136 |	Continue
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,984	| IOT136 |	Conductivity of all the cars in the Telco
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:36,640	| IOT136 |	Where they are offering what we called the OBD Uncle so making any existing cars
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:42,016	| IOT136 |	On the road today connected with an OBD dongcopter going to have a great
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,040	| IOT136 |	Company called
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:47,392	| IOT136 |	Emoji of presenting how's that working with SCP and really offering to days
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:53,280	| IOT136 |	Which is the T-Mobile offering which is powered by sap connected vehicle
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:57,120	| IOT136 |	So that's going to be a really exciting question another
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,888	| IOT136 |	Area
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:59,424	| IOT136 |	Is if course blockchain

EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,272	| IOT136 |	Controversial
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,296	| IOT136 |	Among some of the
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:56,928	| IOT136 |	Let's just kick it up with controversy
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:58,720	| IOT136 |	You guys in the MyQ garage door
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:02,304	| IOT136 |	Which I own an actual
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,328	| IOT136 |	That awesome
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,376	| IOT136 |	You guys recently decided to start charging
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,168	| IOT136 |	Your users
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:07,680	| IOT136 |	Reviews of
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,008	| IOT136 |	I'm curious why
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,544	| IOT136 |	Fac
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:18,944	| IOT136 |	We have had them IQ application which works with are Chamberlain and LiftMaster garage door openers for more than
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,712	| IOT136 |	5 years
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,480	| IOT136 |	Andaz
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,528	| IOT136 |	As a durable goods manufacturer
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,320	| IOT136 |	We initially looked at it
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:26,624	| IOT136 |	How does this increase our bill of
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:29,440	| IOT136 |	What's the cost of the Wi-Fi chip
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,464	| IOT136 |	And the related
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,512	| IOT136 |	Components and what sort of a price increase
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,280	| IOT136 |	Do we need to put on her
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:36,608	| IOT136 |	In order to recover our car
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,144	| IOT136 |	Over the last five years
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,424	| IOT136 |	We have realized
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,448	| IOT136 |	That
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,728	| IOT136 |	Are MyQ app
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,264	| IOT136 |	Among its user base
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,032	| IOT136 |	Is it
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,800	| IOT136 |	Extremely walrus
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,336	| IOT136 |	If you take a look
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:46,848	| IOT136 |	Look at the rating
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,640	| IOT136 |	Other some of the highest out there
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,456	| IOT136 |	It comes with a huge response
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,224	| IOT136 |	Stability
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,296	| IOT136 |	People expect 99.9% uptime
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:58,112	| IOT136 |	Otherwise they're locked in or locked out of their garage
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:01,696	| IOT136 |	They expect for there to be a level of security
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:06,048	| IOT136 |	Because for almost 80% of us homeowners this is the front door
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,096	| IOT136 |	Because their garage is attached
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,632	| IOT136 |	To their home so they don't want it
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:13,728	| IOT136 |	To be able to be hacked or penetrated and anyway that doesn't get lease
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,008	| IOT136 |	Equal if not exceed
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,288	| IOT136 |	Regular garage door open
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:19,872	| IOT136 |	And then to see they like to have ongoing
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,408	| IOT136 |	Features and functionality
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,968	| IOT136 |	Such as integration with partners
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:30,368	| IOT136 |	Or new features that continue to be dreamed up once you have the capability of a connected
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,136	| IOT136 |	Garage door opener
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:34,208	| IOT136 |	And so we found that really there were to invest
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:38,048	| IOT136 |	Since one was making the product connectable to the internet and
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:41,632	| IOT136 |	In the first place and the second one was the ongoing investment
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,912	| IOT136 |	Of creating
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:43,936	| IOT136 |	Uptime
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,472	| IOT136 |	From creating security
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:50,848	| IOT136 |	Continuing to upgrade it was features and functionalities that are users would like to see overtime
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:52,640	| IOT136 |	And when did you realize
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:55,968	| IOT136 |	This product that you were pushing out into the market
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:56,736	| IOT136 |	It was eventually
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,016	| IOT136 |	Was on its way to be
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,552	| IOT136 |	More of a service
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,064	| IOT136 |	At least in terms
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:05,184	| IOT136 |	When I arrived about 20 months ago
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:07,744	| IOT136 |	I came with background in the connected home
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,024	| IOT136 |	Connected building
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:09,536	| IOT136 |	Connected fact
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,352	| IOT136 |	And so I came with
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,632	| IOT136 |	The benefit of understanding
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:14,912	| IOT136 |	What do
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,192	| IOT136 |	Ongoing value
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:17,472	| IOT136 |	Created by the
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,496	| IOT136 |	Company looks like
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,288	| IOT136 |	As well as the ongoing cough
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:23,360	| IOT136 |	Responsibilities as a supplier
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,896	| IOT136 |	Call that service or that
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:26,944	| IOT136 |	Good and and what I found was
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,224	| IOT136 |	Gem
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,504	| IOT136 |	We had created something
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:30,784	| IOT136 |	That had
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,576	| IOT136 |	Agreed amount of reception
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:35,392	| IOT136 |	But not a lot of understanding or thinking
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,696	| IOT136 |	How we were going to
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,232	| IOT136 |	Continue to evolve
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,512	| IOT136 |	The value of this product
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,048	| IOT136 |	And pay for it
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,840	| IOT136 |	So it's probably with 20
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,376	| IOT136 |	Months ago when I joined the company
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:47,680	| IOT136 |	That we started having conversation
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:51,264	| IOT136 |	All of these Partnerships that were requested by customers
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:53,824	| IOT136 |	Partners all of these things that we could do to the app
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:56,896	| IOT136 |	But we really couldn't afford because those things work
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,432	| IOT136 |	Competing with the core business
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:34:59,712	| IOT136 |	Witches products
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,248	| IOT136 |	That brought Revenue
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,552	| IOT136 |	The profit and we began to look at it a different way
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:05,344	| IOT136 |	And so
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:08,672	| IOT136 |	From your standpoint I thought this was interesting as this idea that
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,976	| IOT136 |	It's kind of cannibalizing your existing business
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,256	| IOT136 |	2
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:16,864	| IOT136 |	Put development cost towards the ongoing Security in the ongoing maintenance at this program
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,168	| IOT136 |	Because normally those resources are
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,192	| IOT136 |	Reviews for selling
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:20,960	| IOT136 |	The physical Hardware
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:22,240	| IOT136 |	Product
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,288	| IOT136 |	So have you guys shifted the way
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:25,568	| IOT136 |	Ization
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,104	| IOT136 |	The biggest
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,408	| IOT136 |	Conflict that we found was in
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,944	| IOT136 |	Engineering resources
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,712	| IOT136 |	Software developer
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,760	| IOT136 |	And we did
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:35,808	| IOT136 |	Change our entire organization
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,576	| IOT136 |	Structure
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,368	| IOT136 |	To better align
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,416	| IOT136 |	With where we saw our grow coffee
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:46,048	| IOT136 |	Opportunities in the future so one area that we ended up creating was a line of business
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,584	| IOT136 |	It's called the emerging businesses
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,120	| IOT136 |	Lob line of business
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:51,168	| IOT136 |	Just that would allow us to focus on
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:53,472	| IOT136 |	On some of these new and disruptive
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:53,984	| IOT136 |	Things
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:55,776	| IOT136 |	That we wanted to
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:56,544	| IOT136 |	Store
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:00,640	| IOT136 |	And that we wanted to test and that we wanted to incubate and bring it
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:04,224	| IOT136 |	Critical mass before we put it in the more mature business
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:06,272	| IOT136 |	And they have their own engineering resource
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,296	| IOT136 |	They don't have to cook
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,064	| IOT136 |	Compete against
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:12,928	| IOT136 |	The more mature businesses that can guarantee growth and profit right at the outset
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,720	| IOT136 |	Still allows for some risk-taking some
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,232	| IOT136 |	Experiment
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,536	| IOT136 |	The other thing that we did and
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,328	| IOT136 |	We separated are
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,376	| IOT136 |	Businesses more by end-user
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,912	| IOT136 |	Standby Brandon Channel
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:25,728	| IOT136 |	So we now have a residential line of business we have a
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,752	| IOT136 |	Commercial line of business
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:33,152	| IOT136 |	We have a premier access line of business International line of business and distribution and Automotive as well as the emerge
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,432	| IOT136 |	Line-of-business
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,992	| IOT136 |	Talk to you about before and that does allow
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:37,760	| IOT136 |	4
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,272	| IOT136 |	Focus
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,320	| IOT136 |	The end-user application
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,368	| IOT136 |	Right now
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,136	| IOT136 |	Maybe
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,976	| IOT136 |	Hardware durable good base but may just as well be
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,768	| IOT136 |	Software systems and services
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,536	| IOT136 |	Like we're discussing
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:54,656	| IOT136 |	So let's get to this if service because there's been a couple things that
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:57,984	| IOT136 |	User soap
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:01,056	| IOT136 |	The first was a few years ago
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:01,824	| IOT136 |	When
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:04,640	| IOT136 |	Chamberlain promised homekit compatibility with
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,408	| IOT136 |	The MyQ system
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,712	| IOT136 |	In the thought was they weren't going to charge
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:09,248	| IOT136 |	Turns out that
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,552	| IOT136 |	Homekit requires an extra search chips
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:12,832	| IOT136 |	You have to make new physical Hardware
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,856	| IOT136 |	Go for it and
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,160	| IOT136 |	Then Chamberlain charged for
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:16,928	| IOT136 |	Abridge
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,232	| IOT136 |	This rubbed a lot of people
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,024	| IOT136 |	And now
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:25,120	| IOT136 |	Those are other users like them are really looking at the charging
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,912	| IOT136 |	Integration
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:29,472	| IOT136 |	Promise that she
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,032	| IOT136 |	Other services
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,568	| IOT136 |	So I'm curious
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,848	| IOT136 |	How that happened
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:39,712	| IOT136 |	So I'll refer back to the earlier discussion where when we started this journey
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:42,016	| IOT136 |	Nobody else has really done much as a
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:45,600	| IOT136 |	Before and we were looking at it as to how much can this
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,112	| IOT136 |	Chip Coffey
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:48,928	| IOT136 |	And how much does it cost to just enable if
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:49,440	| IOT136 |	Service in the fur
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,768	| IOT136 |	And we thought that we could recoup our cost
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,048	| IOT136 |	In the initial sale price
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:57,632	| IOT136 |	The product that we've been on this journey for almost 6 years now
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,936	| IOT136 |	We've discovered again
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:02,496	| IOT136 |	Send that to deliver on the uptime Promises
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,288	| IOT136 |	Security promises
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:08,896	| IOT136 |	The partnership integration promises the extra value added services that
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,664	| IOT136 |	Consumers are asking
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,968	| IOT136 |	There's an ongoing
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:13,504	| IOT136 |	To the service
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:14,784	| IOT136 |	Start as week
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,064	| IOT136 |	Continue to add
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,112	| IOT136 |	Features functionality
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,136	| IOT136 |	Partnerships
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,160	| IOT136 |	Integration
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:25,024	| IOT136 |	Then if we feel that there are customer segments that are willing to pay for it
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:26,816	| IOT136 |	And other customer segments
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,584	| IOT136 |	For whom it's
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,864	| IOT136 |	Completely irrelevant
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:31,424	| IOT136 |	Then we put that into the premium tier
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,448	| IOT136 |	Where we charge
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:34,496	| IOT136 |	$1 a month or $10
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:40,896	| IOT136 |	You'll see more and more going into the premium tier and you'll see more and more going into the base pre-service but ultimately
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:42,688	| IOT136 |	This is something that
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,992	| IOT136 |	We wouldn't be able to
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,272	| IOT136 |	Afford to continue
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,832	| IOT136 |	Investing in the business if we made everything free
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:51,136	| IOT136 |	And how did you guys come about with that price
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,952	| IOT136 |	We have several different we came out at
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,976	| IOT136 |	Several different directions
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,256	| IOT136 |	Analyze
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,304	| IOT136 |	First off
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,840	| IOT136 |	We wanted to understand
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:01,376	| IOT136 |	You know what are are caught
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,168	| IOT136 |	We don't price based on cost
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,936	| IOT136 |	But
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,472	| IOT136 |	You do have to have an awareness
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:07,520	| IOT136 |	Of what sort of cost are incurring
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:10,336	| IOT136 |	Because if the value does not exceed the cost
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,104	| IOT136 |	Then maybe it's not so
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,176	| IOT136 |	And then we did
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:16,736	| IOT136 |	Some very detailed analysis
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,248	| IOT136 |	Customer
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:18,784	| IOT136 |	Around what
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:22,112	| IOT136 |	Value are we delivering and what is the willingness to pay for that.
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:25,952	| IOT136 |	And we came back with a variety of different options that
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:32,352	| IOT136 |	Equilibrium approximately a dollar a month or we got $10 a year might and sent people to sign up for
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,120	| IOT136 |	A year at a time
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:35,680	| IOT136 |	What percent of your user base do you think
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,448	| IOT136 |	Will sign up for something
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:42,080	| IOT136 |	Well we've had a large percentage of our user base sign up for the F10
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:46,176	| IOT136 |	The homekit integration particularly during the 30-day.
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:47,712	| IOT136 |	Where there's a free trial
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:50,016	| IOT136 |	And we're continuing to monitor
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:53,088	| IOT136 |	The participation rate as the free trial.
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:53,856	| IOT136 |	Spire
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:54,880	| IOT136 |	NetSpend
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,904	| IOT136 |	In some cases
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:58,208	| IOT136 |	Triple digit growth day by day by day
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:59,488	| IOT136 |	Small numbers admittedly
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:01,536	| IOT136 |	But then the other thing is that
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:04,096	| IOT136 |	As I mentioned we do intend to keep adding
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:06,400	| IOT136 |	Features functionality services in apple
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,936	| IOT136 |	Locations to that premium tier
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:10,752	| IOT136 |	And so if people value
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:11,776	| IOT136 |	And enjoy if
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| IOT136 |	And or homekit integration
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:17,408	| IOT136 |	They find that they get other features and functionality that
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,944	| IOT136 |	Continue to validate that invest
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:23,040	| IOT136 |	Or it brings in new segments and new users who
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:27,136	| IOT136 |	Initially weren't willing to pay for the action homekit integration but they would
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:29,696	| IOT136 |	For future applications that we bring to Market
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,488	| IOT136 |	So what are some of those future applications
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:34,048	| IOT136 |	Well I think my product manager
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,072	| IOT136 |	Strangle me
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,352	| IOT136 |	If I were to
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:36,864	| IOT136 |	Pronounce
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:40,704	| IOT136 |	But one thing that I can tell you about that would be available but
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,984	| IOT136 |	Time we are this podcast
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:45,312	| IOT136 |	As many people don't realize that we have an automotive component
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,080	| IOT136 |	HR business
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:48,384	| IOT136 |	That we license our technology
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:50,176	| IOT136 |	For the Homelink application
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:56,064	| IOT136 |	Is the ability to use an integrated button in your car to open and close your garage door rather than
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,088	| IOT136 |	A removable trans
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:58,880	| IOT136 |	At the CMAs show
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,672	| IOT136 |	Which is one of our industry shows
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,464	| IOT136 |	We announce our partnership with alpine
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:06,816	| IOT136 |	People who own select Alpine navigation or entertainment
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,632	| IOT136 |	Would then be able to use MyQ
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,400	| IOT136 |	On Alpine
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:13,728	| IOT136 |	Connect to open the garage door as they're approaching rather than have
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:15,776	| IOT136 |	Physical
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,056	| IOT136 |	Transmitter like
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:19,616	| IOT136 |	So it can further
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:22,944	| IOT136 |	Allow for integration they can activate their home mode
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:25,248	| IOT136 |	That would turn on lights for their house is lit
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:30,368	| IOT136 |	Put their nest learning thermostat so that the house is it a comfortable temperature all from
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,928	| IOT136 |	In the car and so that's
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,464	| IOT136 |	An example of
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,256	| IOT136 |	More and more applications
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:38,048	| IOT136 |	Become available once we can have
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:40,352	| IOT136 |	HD devices connected to the internet
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,144	| IOT136 |	And that we can create more value for our user
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,960	| IOT136 |	This idea of charging for subscription
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:47,008	| IOT136 |	I believe that we're going to have
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,824	| IOT136 |	Pay for subscriptions for a lot of Arc
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:52,384	| IOT136 |	It's just part of the business model that
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,431	| IOT136 |	You just talked about
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,711	| IOT136 |	Baidu
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:58,271	| IOT136 |	About kind of death by a thousand subscription
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,551	| IOT136 |	So I can see
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:01,343	| IOT136 |	Chamberlain
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:04,415	| IOT136 |	Ring 30 bucks a year
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,231	| IOT136 |	IOS security thing
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:08,511	| IOT136 |	X number of dollars
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:12,351	| IOT136 |	Plus maybe some share cloud storage etc etc
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,399	| IOT136 |	So when I start looking at that
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,423	| IOT136 |	I wonder how you
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,471	| IOT136 |	Your subscription
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,263	| IOT136 |	As part of an entire
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,543	| IOT136 |	Fire systems
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:21,823	| IOT136 |	A subscription that is going
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:25,407	| IOT136 |	So I agree there is a little bit of a
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,431	| IOT136 |	Consumer paradigm
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,711	| IOT136 |	That stuff is free
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:30,271	| IOT136 |	But people are beginning to realize that
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,295	| IOT136 |	Stuff isn't really free
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:34,623	| IOT136 |	When you upgrade to the latest IOS you
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:36,159	| IOT136 |	You find out that some of your free apps
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,695	| IOT136 |	Haven't been updated
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,719	| IOT136 |	And may never be up
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:40,767	| IOT136 |	Jaded and it's hard to complain about that cuz
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,791	| IOT136 |	They were free in the first place
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:47,679	| IOT136 |	People are beginning to learn that if you want a service without advertisements or commercials or things like that
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,215	| IOT136 |	But you have to pay for it
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:53,055	| IOT136 |	Some people are also beginning to learn the notion of a freemium model you get the base
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:55,103	| IOT136 |	Version for free maybe LinkedIn
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:56,639	| IOT136 |	Evernote or something like that
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,431	| IOT136 |	And then if you want the premium version
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:59,455	| IOT136 |	Name something that you may value
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:01,247	| IOT136 |	And you have to pay it
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:01,759	| IOT136 |	Subscription model
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:04,831	| IOT136 |	And so customers are beginning to realize
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,111	| IOT136 |	That if you want
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:06,623	| IOT136 |	Premium
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,415	| IOT136 |	Service B. Noka
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,439	| IOT136 |	Commercials are extra
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,207	| IOT136 |	Features are
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,231	| IOT136 |	Or somebody
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:14,815	| IOT136 |	Updating it making sure that it's upgraded and secure overtime
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,607	| IOT136 |	You're going to have to pay some dollars
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:17,375	| IOT136 |	That being said
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:20,703	| IOT136 |	Competition for recurring Revenue dollars
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:21,727	| IOT136 |	Fierce
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:23,775	| IOT136 |	Everybody wants a piece
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:25,311	| IOT136 |	Piece of the consumer's wallet
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:28,383	| IOT136 |	And the consumer only has so many dollars
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,663	| IOT136 |	That they're willing to pay
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,687	| IOT136 |	For a monthly fee
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:34,015	| IOT136 |	Description your home alarm service is competing against your cable
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,295	| IOT136 |	And people have to do
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,319	| IOT136 |	Decide what's more important
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:42,719	| IOT136 |	And so really it's we're relying on our ability to create value that the end users
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:43,487	| IOT136 |	Want
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:44,767	| IOT136 |	And are willing to pay for
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:48,863	| IOT136 |	And ultimately there are some that will survive and there are some that won't
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:50,911	| IOT136 |	Survive but right now it's the Wild West
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,703	| IOT136 |	You know everybody wants to have
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:53,983	| IOT136 |	Connected
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:56,031	| IOT136 |	They realize how much it cost
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:57,311	| IOT136 |	To maintain a Kinect
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,079	| IOT136 |	The device
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:03,711	| IOT136 |	Further subscriber base over a long. Of time and they're trying to figure out how to get paid for it
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:04,991	| IOT136 |	At the same time
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:07,551	| IOT136 |	That these ecosystems are trying to
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:10,623	| IOT136 |	Consolidate and some of the consolidators
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:11,903	| IOT136 |	Are looking for
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:14,207	| IOT136 |	How did they assemble Partnerships but
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:16,511	| IOT136 |	Keep the recurring monthly Revenue to themselves
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:20,351	| IOT136 |	Two very exciting time I can't tell you where the equilibrium will balance out
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,167	| IOT136 |	But in order for us to control our own destiny we
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,703	| IOT136 |	We have to continue to develop
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:25,471	| IOT136 |	Things that
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,519	| IOT136 |	Consumers will value and are willing to pay for
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:30,335	| IOT136 |	Sure I'm just wondering is eventually they'll be kind of like
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,359	| IOT136 |	Like a cable package
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:31,871	| IOT136 |	For the smart
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,199	| IOT136 |	Provider ISP
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,735	| IOT136 |	Some third-party
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,271	| IOT136 |	Whereas security
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:41,855	| IOT136 |	A system just I no longer know what
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,879	| IOT136 |	To you guys
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,391	| IOT136 |	In particular
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:45,439	| IOT136 |	Part of a package of
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:47,743	| IOT136 |	Cloud storage Plus
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:48,511	| IOT136 |	You know if dinner
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,279	| IOT136 |	Decorations Plus
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,839	| IOT136 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:52,351	| IOT136 |	Possible
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:55,167	| IOT136 |	And there's so many different directions at that taking
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,215	| IOT136 |	You can see the security
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,263	| IOT136 |	Providers taking a lead on that you
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:02,591	| IOT136 |	Home automation Partners taking a lead on that you can
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:06,175	| IOT136 |	To see the cable and telephone line companies taking a lead on that
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:08,223	| IOT136 |	You can see that damn
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:11,039	| IOT136 |	The world taking a lead on that and that the home assistant
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:12,831	| IOT136 |	And we're not really sure where it's at
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:14,111	| IOT136 |	To settle out
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:15,391	| IOT136 |	But the good thing
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,439	| IOT136 |	Is that every single one of those partners
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,975	| IOT136 |	Want garage
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:22,047	| IOT136 |	Well maybe you guys will get to be the ESPN
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,351	| IOT136 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,375	| IOT136 |	New stuff
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,655	| IOT136 |	You guys have
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,935	| IOT136 |	Expanded from
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:29,215	| IOT136 |	You've obviously had
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:30,495	| IOT136 |	Business outside
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:32,031	| IOT136 |	Consumer but I know that
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,079	| IOT136 |	Roughly a year ago I talked
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:35,103	| IOT136 |	Tacori Cerise over
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:36,383	| IOT136 |	About
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:38,431	| IOT136 |	You guys starting to create a service package for
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:39,967	| IOT136 |	Commercial customer
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:41,247	| IOT136 |	Merced actually helps them
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,551	| IOT136 |	Understand their business better based on like
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,319	| IOT136 |	Like how much time
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,855	| IOT136 |	Trucks are spinning at loading dock
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:46,623	| IOT136 |	Bassinet sort of in
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:47,391	| IOT136 |	Information
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:48,927	| IOT136 |	So I'm curious
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:50,975	| IOT136 |	1 how are you guys evaluating these new Hopper
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:54,047	| IOT136 |	It might be that the business
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:54,815	| IOT136 |	That you guys are working on
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:57,375	| IOT136 |	And where do you see you guys going next on that
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:00,703	| IOT136 |	So you're right to our reorganization
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:02,495	| IOT136 |	Did create a commercial line
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:06,079	| IOT136 |	Fitness now we've always sold commercial door openers
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,359	| IOT136 |	It's part of our core comp
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:08,895	| IOT136 |	Trauma residential line
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,991	| IOT136 |	And so they're heavier Duty and they do a few different things
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:16,319	| IOT136 |	Take advantage of our engineering Act
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:18,879	| IOT136 |	Toyota open
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:20,415	| IOT136 |	Commercial doors
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:20,927	| IOT136 |	Maybe for a disc
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:23,743	| IOT136 |	Warehouse the issue is is that
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:24,511	| IOT136 |	The biggest
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:25,023	| IOT136 |	Competitor
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,583	| IOT136 |	In the commercial line of business is do nothing
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,351	| IOT136 |	Unlike
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,631	| IOT136 |	Residential homes
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:31,167	| IOT136 |	The commercial doors
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:33,215	| IOT136 |	Are often manually power
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,751	| IOT136 |	Do you have a worker coming in the morning
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,543	| IOT136 |	And they roll that
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:38,335	| IOT136 |	Hang up in the morning and maybe
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:40,383	| IOT136 |	They might close it a little bit throughout the day
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:42,943	| IOT136 |	But in large part they remain open
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,711	| IOT136 |	For much of the day
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:45,759	| IOT136 |	Are they closing at the end of the day
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:48,063	| IOT136 |	And for years we've been relying
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,879	| IOT136 |	On a value proposition that talked about injury.
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:53,183	| IOT136 |	And workman's comp
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:54,207	| IOT136 |	Claim avoidance
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:56,511	| IOT136 |	As one of the reasons for why
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:58,047	| IOT136 |	Owner-operators
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:00,095	| IOT136 |	Distribution center stay
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,375	| IOT136 |	Should invest in
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:02,399	| IOT136 |	Commercial door opener
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,935	| IOT136 |	But the reality is
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:04,447	| IOT136 |	Is that
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:06,239	| IOT136 |	A cost avoidance
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:09,311	| IOT136 |	For whose cost it isn't even in your operating plan
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:11,615	| IOT136 |	Is one of the first things
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:13,151	| IOT136 |	Should be cut it really
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:13,919	| IOT136 |	Resembles insurance
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,479	| IOT136 |	And when you are resource
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:18,015	| IOT136 |	That's one of the line items
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:20,831	| IOT136 |	And so by creating this
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:22,879	| IOT136 |	Line-of-business where the group
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,671	| IOT136 |	Really focusing
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:26,207	| IOT136 |	On the End customer
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:28,767	| IOT136 |	And what are their problems and what are their offer
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:30,047	| IOT136 |	Judaism
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:30,815	| IOT136 |	It's all for them
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,863	| IOT136 |	We gained a lot more insight
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:33,887	| IOT136 |	Around
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:35,679	| IOT136 |	How their business works
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:36,703	| IOT136 |	And how we can
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,983	| IOT136 |	Better contribute to that business
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:41,311	| IOT136 |	Through an automated and connected
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,847	| IOT136 |	Commercial Door operator
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:45,151	| IOT136 |	That can contribute to things like
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:46,175	| IOT136 |	Energy saving
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:48,735	| IOT136 |	ASPCA at the Spaceway
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,503	| IOT136 |	Climate control
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:50,783	| IOT136 |	Or
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:51,551	| IOT136 |	Safety
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:52,319	| IOT136 |	Plaintiff
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,855	| IOT136 |	Say it's a pharmaceutical
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:54,367	| IOT136 |	Warehouse
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| IOT136 |	They need to
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:56,671	| IOT136 |	Cooperate
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:58,207	| IOT136 |	To a regulatory
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:00,511	| IOT136 |	Security has been in force
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,535	| IOT136 |	Or efficiency
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:03,071	| IOT136 |	If you think about
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:05,887	| IOT136 |	Many people have a certain number of doctors
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:07,679	| IOT136 |	For their distribution warehouse
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:10,495	| IOT136 |	I think that they're all being utilized equally
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:13,311	| IOT136 |	And then there are capital requests add on more
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:17,407	| IOT136 |	If we can provide the data that shows them the actual usage
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:18,943	| IOT136 |	And the trends that they
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:24,575	| IOT136 |	Can understand when the right time to invest in then the back of a p&l on
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:28,159	| IOT136 |	Real insight as to how they can operate their business
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:28,927	| IOT136 |	More effectively
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,975	| IOT136 |	It doesn't trade on
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:31,743	| IOT136 |	Fear
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:34,303	| IOT136 |	And cost avoidance that really isn't even in their planning at 4
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:38,911	| IOT136 |	Yay
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:46,079	| IOT136 |	Let's wrap it up with others in your position
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:48,639	| IOT136 |	Or rather in a similar position
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:49,407	| IOT136 |	Products
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:51,967	| IOT136 |	And it cost them money over the long term
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:55,551	| IOT136 |	What would you do differently if you were building
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:57,343	| IOT136 |	MyQ today
EDL	00:48:57,343	00:48:57,855	| IOT136 |	And the ground up
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:48:59,903	| IOT136 |	Well if you reference
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:00,927	| IOT136 |	Starting to charge for some
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:03,743	| IOT136 |	That has been free for almost six
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:05,535	| IOT136 |	Sears has not made me the most
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:06,047	| IOT136 |	Most popular purse
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:08,095	| IOT136 |	It's been a
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:08,863	| IOT136 |	Small butt
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:09,631	| IOT136 |	Vocal
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:12,703	| IOT136 |	Group of detractors and if I had to do it over again
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,727	| IOT136 |	I would have
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:17,567	| IOT136 |	I could rewind to 6 years ago I was in a company then but if I
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:20,895	| IOT136 |	Somehow travel back in time I would have done more thinking
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:21,663	| IOT136 |	About
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:23,711	| IOT136 |	What value are we creating
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:25,759	| IOT136 |	What service are we offering
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:28,319	| IOT136 |	And what do we want to offer free
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,855	| IOT136 |	But what do we need to charge
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:32,415	| IOT136 |	In order to help keep the investor
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:35,487	| IOT136 |	Going if anybody thinks that they're going to start out
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:37,535	| IOT136 |	Free and once people love it
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:40,607	| IOT136 |	Then you're going to start charging and people will be happy to pay
EDL	00:49:40,607	00:49:42,143	| IOT136 |	Dog probably end up in
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:42,911	| IOT136 |	The same boat that I was
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:46,495	| IOT136 |	Once we did start charging for certain integration
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:47,519	| IOT136 |	Beyond RV services
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:48,799	| IOT136 |	Got it
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:50,335	| IOT136 |	You guys build your own cloud pot
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:51,615	| IOT136 |	Correct
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:53,407	| IOT136 |	Yes we absolutely did
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:55,711	| IOT136 |	Being a company that is rooted in
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:56,479	| IOT136 |	Security
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:58,527	| IOT136 |	And making sure that we have
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,551	| IOT136 |	An offering
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:00,575	| IOT136 |	That controls
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:03,391	| IOT136 |	Security of what for most people is their front door
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:04,159	| IOT136 |	The garage door
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:06,975	| IOT136 |	We wanted to make sure that we
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:08,511	| IOT136 |	Had full control over that
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:09,791	| IOT136 |	Okay so
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:10,815	| IOT136 |	That's still
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:11,327	| IOT136 |	From your perspective
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:13,887	| IOT136 |	It's still a good decision
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:15,167	| IOT136 |	We can
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:16,191	| IOT136 |	Monitor
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:19,775	| IOT136 |	And we can make sure that we understand what's happening
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:20,543	| IOT136 |	100% of
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:21,567	| IOT136 |	The time and
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,335	| IOT136 |	For us
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:28,735	| IOT136 |	The other opportunities around commercial or perimeter or other applications just continues to make that a good to see
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:29,503	| IOT136 |	Vision is weird
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:30,783	| IOT136 |	Word branching out from
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:32,831	| IOT136 |	Are base residential business even further
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,111	| IOT136 |	Excellent
