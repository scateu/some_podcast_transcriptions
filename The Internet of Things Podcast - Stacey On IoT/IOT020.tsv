EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:12,544	| IOT020 |	Stand this is your
EDL	00:00:13,056	00:00:14,336	| IOT020 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:14,336	00:00:15,616	| IOT020 |	And your other host
EDL	00:00:16,128	00:00:17,152	| IOT020 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:17,152	00:00:20,480	| IOT020 |	And we have got a lot of really good stuff for you this week
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:23,040	| IOT020 |	So far we've got Google's new router
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:24,064	| IOT020 |	Intel
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:25,344	| IOT020 |	IDF which is a
EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,368	| IOT020 |	It's developers forum
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:28,928	| IOT020 |	We got some new findings from some iot startups
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:32,000	| IOT020 |	And we have an awesome guest talking about
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:32,768	| IOT020 |	How
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:33,536	| IOT020 |	Enterprises
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:37,632	| IOT020 |	We'll be able to like take advantage of the Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:39,168	| IOT020 |	So with that
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:41,216	| IOT020 |	Let's get it started
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:48,128	| IOT020 |	Let's Get It Started actually Google got it started and we talked about this possibility in the past and now it is real
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:51,968	| IOT020 |	Google has a brand new wifi router
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:56,064	| IOT020 |	Which of course everybody has a Wi-Fi router or two or three Vanessa pose in their home
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:58,624	| IOT020 |	So this is the onhub and what
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,904	| IOT020 |	Makes this different
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:00,672	| IOT020 |	Couple things actually
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,720	| IOT020 |	This is actually supposed to be
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:07,328	| IOT020 |	Put out there not hidden away in a closet or data center
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,864	| IOT020 |	Don't room or whatever
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:11,424	| IOT020 |	This actually looks like a nice router make
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:12,192	| IOT020 |	Do you have a date
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:12,704	| IOT020 |	Bats entering your house
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:16,544	| IOT020 |	I can neither confirm nor deny a Datacenter Nore safer
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:17,056	| IOT020 |	Excellent
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:20,640	| IOT020 |	Will you know what I mean some people
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:24,480	| IOT020 |	Crazy little mediacenter closets and such were they have all the servers for
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,248	| IOT020 |	Stuff
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:27,040	| IOT020 |	That's where the router is and also
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:30,112	| IOT020 |	Well that's no good because you don't want these Wireless signals to be
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:34,464	| IOT020 |	In the corner of a house in closed room with walls for the signals to pass through
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:36,512	| IOT020 |	This actually looks like a nice little
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,584	| IOT020 |	Gadget or Appliance and I know there's a difference between the two
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:42,912	| IOT020 |	It's a nice-looking router doesn't look like a router I guess it's
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:44,192	| IOT020 |	Probably the best way to say it
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,472	| IOT020 |	The onhub
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:49,824	| IOT020 |	The other thing is supposed to do is not to look pretty but also its
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,360	| IOT020 |	Should be simple to use
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:56,224	| IOT020 |	It's a bad end Google has a little application course there's an app for everything
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,808	| IOT020 |	And the app is good for Android and iOS
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,856	| IOT020 |	So that way you can configure your router or you can
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,928	| IOT020 |	Check the status of it and so on
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:10,048	| IOT020 |	There's I think like a dozen or maybe even 13 and 10 is in there and
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:12,096	| IOT020 |	One of them is constantly checking
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,400	| IOT020 |	For your network quality and what the
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:16,448	| IOT020 |	The ratchet does the onhub
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,728	| IOT020 |	Lashley
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,264	| IOT020 |	Several other routers on the market but
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,592	| IOT020 |	What it will do it will change the channels and provide
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,384	| IOT020 |	You look like a quality of service
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:28,224	| IOT020 |	Certain types of traffic so maybe you're watching video and you want to make sure
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,992	| IOT020 |	That you're
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:32,832	| IOT020 |	2160p stream from Netflix is working good
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,368	| IOT020 |	You know the onhub can help with that
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,464	| IOT020 |	That's the tie level but at a lower level
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,512	| IOT020 |	What is this have to do with iot and
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,536	| IOT020 |	Stacy I think
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,072	| IOT020 |	You might have said this in the past
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:45,376	| IOT020 |	Maybe there's going to be a router that
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:49,984	| IOT020 |	Will support natively like brillo and weave and all that stuff for IRT from Google
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,264	| IOT020 |	Will gas so
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,288	| IOT020 |	Back in the day
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,312	| IOT020 |	There's actually two reason
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,104	| IOT020 |	One is religious
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,128	| IOT020 |	The most obvious
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,688	| IOT020 |	Which is that there's a lot more devices
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,712	| IOT020 |	What's with the internet
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| IOT020 |	And when you have more devices
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,576	| IOT020 |	Your network is just inherently more
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,368	| IOT020 |	And
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:11,744	| IOT020 |	When you're sticking something that stationary on your wall or on your door that's going to rely on Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,280	| IOT020 |	You're actually going to
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,608	| IOT020 |	Since you can't move it to find like the best quarter in your house
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,656	| IOT020 |	To get Wi-Fi reception for that thing
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,704	| IOT020 |	You need the best wifi all over your house
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,264	| IOT020 |	So having a really good
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,288	| IOT020 |	Browder
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,616	| IOT020 |	Impossible even more access points is really cool
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,176	| IOT020 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,992	| IOT020 |	Being able to prioritize is just
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,040	| IOT020 |	I don't know I just think it's so essential
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,344	| IOT020 |	Especially like if your
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,184	| IOT020 |	I just think the more devices you have the more you need Tennessee's enterprise-class
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,232	| IOT020 |	But
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,768	| IOT020 |	Sexy stuff
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,816	| IOT020 |	We did talk about Brillo
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| IOT020 |	Specifically
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,120	| IOT020 |	As kind of a
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,936	| IOT020 |	A real time operating system for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| IOT020 |	The Google was talking about
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,776	| IOT020 |	Putting inside
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,544	| IOT020 |	Routers
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:57,568	| IOT020 |	In
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:02,944	| IOT020 |	We still don't understand how this is actually going to work but the idea was that
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,504	| IOT020 |	It would have some sort of Hub device
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,576	| IOT020 |	That would kind of talk to other devices on the Note
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,624	| IOT020 |	And how to control them in
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,440	| IOT020 |	Onhub could be that device
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:19,071	| IOT020 |	Right now the Amazon Echo actually is the brains of my smart home
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,839	| IOT020 |	In many ways
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,167	| IOT020 |	So it is not crazy to think
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,727	| IOT020 |	That a router could also be the brand
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,239	| IOT020 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,519	| IOT020 |	Especially
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,543	| IOT020 |	If it did more than
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,151	| IOT020 |	Well this actually does because it supports Bluetooth as well
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:36,223	| IOT020 |	Once you start supporting Bluetooth
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| IOT020 |	Then
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:41,599	| IOT020 |	This could act as kind of those Bridge devices for things like
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:46,719	| IOT020 |	The August door lock that doesn't have Wi-Fi built in but you want to give it that keep
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,487	| IOT020 |	Ability
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:52,095	| IOT020 |	And you don't kiss again a lot of these devices that are Bluetooth only
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:55,423	| IOT020 |	That you want to add that remote connectivity that Wi-Fi get you
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,447	| IOT020 |	They sell these
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,983	| IOT020 |	Extra
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,799	| IOT020 |	Plugin WiFi Bridges is kind of what they're called
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| IOT020 |	In
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| IOT020 |	I think I've seen about
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,919	| IOT020 |	Four or five of these marketed
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,503	| IOT020 |	Ford locks there's some for sensors
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,807	| IOT020 |	In the problem with them is
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,623	| IOT020 |	I don't have that many outlets free
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:15,647	| IOT020 |	In my house
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,695	| IOT020 |	And they're very ugly
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:22,303	| IOT020 |	I'm pretty but you know you only want so many white boxes
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:22,815	| IOT020 |	Stick it out of here
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,887	| IOT020 |	So if you can cram all that door router
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,655	| IOT020 |	My God
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,935	| IOT020 |	Please do it because
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:31,263	| IOT020 |	Hey it's one less you know $50 Bridge you have to buy
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,311	| IOT020 |	One more Outlet to free up
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,127	| IOT020 |	I'm excited about that
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:40,991	| IOT020 |	It looks a lot like there is a startup actually doing something sort of sim
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,783	| IOT020 |	Call the Eero
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,575	| IOT020 |	It is e e r o
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:48,927	| IOT020 |	And they're trying to make a beautiful router with awesome kind of
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| IOT020 |	Features
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:53,023	| IOT020 |	Much like this it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the router
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,607	| IOT020 |	In doing a lot with software so people do not have to
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,119	| IOT020 |	Become like
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,399	| IOT020 |	Years in order
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| IOT020 |	What there
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,471	| IOT020 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,031	| IOT020 |	So I think this is
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,615	| IOT020 |	Awesome this looks kind of like a reference design or may not
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| IOT020 |	Quite the out in the market
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| IOT020 |	Dad is fat
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:14,015	| IOT020 |	No it's actually available now for 199 99
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:16,319	| IOT020 |	You can get it now from a couple places
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT020 |	Direct
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,159	| IOT020 |	From the Google Store from Amazon
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,463	| IOT020 |	Walmart.com That's only in the US
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,231	| IOT020 |	Starting today
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:27,839	| IOT020 |	And it will be on sale in retail stores in the US and Canada in the next few weeks
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,607	| IOT020 |	So it's
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,399	| IOT020 |	It's actually available as of
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,679	| IOT020 |	The show literally today
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:35,519	| IOT020 |	And there's a follow-up is going to be another one made by a sus
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:38,335	| IOT020 |	That will also cost 199 so this is
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,895	| IOT020 |	I guess that's kind of where you going with this is a reference design
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,967	| IOT020 |	It seems like there may be a anyways Fleet of these types of
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,551	| IOT020 |	On hubs are not calling and routers are calling at the onhub
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,831	| IOT020 |	But you'll be able to purchase
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,159	| IOT020 |	Got it okay so yes that's what I'm thinking about 9
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,439	| IOT020 |	I think I was reading about the AC
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,975	| IOT020 |	Made devices
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,791	| IOT020 |	Right later this year they didn't specify when that would be
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,351	| IOT020 |	That's great cuz you know I forgot tp-link access
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,447	| IOT020 |	Set my home and I've played with the tp-link cloud management software
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,215	| IOT020 |	Adidas no bueno
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:10,847	| IOT020 |	You know I talked to Chet Pipkin he was on the show and I talked to him in a brainstorm Tech event
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:16,223	| IOT020 |	And I was asking him I was actually begging him I was like you know you guys bought the Linksys name
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,503	| IOT020 |	You know what
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,039	| IOT020 |	Bringing back the iconic lie
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,063	| IOT020 |	Linksys router shaper
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:23,903	| IOT020 |	Is a cool idea but you know the best thing you could do for the Linksys brand to keep it relevant
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,207	| IOT020 |	Is introduced some awesome
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:30,815	| IOT020 |	But consumer-friendly software that does the things people want to do
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,863	| IOT020 |	Cuz his response was like
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,655	| IOT020 |	If you log into your router you can do a lot of that
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,239	| IOT020 |	Technically he is correct however
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:42,079	| IOT020 |	And I don't care what brand router you use I've tried most of the major ones
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:46,431	| IOT020 |	Yes he is correct if you just log into the router you can there's usually web interface
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,735	| IOT020 |	They're not
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| IOT020 |	Not not
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,575	| IOT020 |	Friendly or easy to use or not intuitive
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,367	| IOT020 |	Most consumers I think would
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,951	| IOT020 |	Look at half for only be 3/4 the verbage on these
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| IOT020 |	Set up
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,511	| IOT020 |	Apps and say what
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,791	| IOT020 |	It does that even mean
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,559	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:08,447	| IOT020 |	Your chances are there's a lot of routers that do some similar things to the onhub now you can you can
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:13,567	| IOT020 |	Specify quality service for video streams and so on and so forth now but you have to know how to do it
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:17,663	| IOT020 |	So if they've created software that makes it simple it basically says
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,455	| IOT020 |	Would you like to prioritize your video
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:22,527	| IOT020 |	Streaming right now I'm going to say yes
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:25,087	| IOT020 |	They're not going to know what the other
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,111	| IOT020 |	Jargon is
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:29,695	| IOT020 |	No see what I'm looking at this article in wired all about
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,463	| IOT020 |	The onhub
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| IOT020 |	Guess what it says
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,839	| IOT020 |	It supports Bluetooth Wi-Fi and Google's new weave language
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:40,191	| IOT020 |	Which which is designed to help appliances in Connected home devices talk to each other
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,959	| IOT020 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,519	| IOT020 |	So there we go we've got brillo and weave
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:49,663	| IOT020 |	Presumably brella somewhere in there definitely we've we still aren't 100% sure what we've is but maybe forget a router in
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,431	| IOT020 |	Start
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,223	| IOT020 |	Start playing around with it we'll figure it out
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,271	| IOT020 |	Maybe we can figure it out
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,343	| IOT020 |	All right
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,111	| IOT020 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,415	| IOT020 |	There we go we just spent $200 each
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,207	| IOT020 |	Really one of us
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,255	| IOT020 |	LOL cancel my order
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,327	| IOT020 |	Cuz I'm currently
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,143	| IOT020 |	I'm always happy
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:16,287	| IOT020 |	Just out of curiosity how old is your router and what standard or standards does it support
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,335	| IOT020 |	Oh it's a doe isn't your tooth at 11
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,383	| IOT020 |	Alcatraz is mine
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,407	| IOT020 |	So it's
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,175	| IOT020 |	Recent
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,943	| IOT020 |	Enough
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:25,247	| IOT020 |	I can't tell you what version of mymo it is
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,551	| IOT020 |	And how
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,063	| IOT020 |	Up-to-date data
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:31,135	| IOT020 |	That's okay I don't want Rider Envy of yours is better than mine
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:38,815	| IOT020 |	Cuz I was serious I'd actually I haven't streaming 4K Netflix throughout the house and that the router is in the second floor on
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,095	| IOT020 |	On one corner of the house
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:44,191	| IOT020 |	The TV is on the first floor in the far opposite corner of the house
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| IOT020 |	Your TV should be hardwired
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,335	| IOT020 |	I don't have any hard wiring in this house of Fortune
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,895	| IOT020 |	If it's all its
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,943	| IOT020 |	Is Wi-Fi or nothing in my home so
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:10:01,343	| IOT020 |	And I have to say I have a masseuse it's older it's at ac66u is the model if I recall correctly
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,391	| IOT020 |	And it was one of the best investments I made
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,183	| IOT020 |	Two years ago whenever it was
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:08,767	| IOT020 |	Netflix stream 4K working rate and that's with other people
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| IOT020 |	Using the network in the
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,095	| IOT020 |	Very
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,167	| IOT020 |	Perhaps one day we will do it
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,727	| IOT020 |	A total episode dedicated to router subnet
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,519	| IOT020 |	And really like lose every
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:27,967	| IOT020 |	Today is not that day people don't worry we're done go ahead
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,295	| IOT020 |	Is Intel in other big company news is Intel
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:34,111	| IOT020 |	Right now this week in San Francisco
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,927	| IOT020 |	Will say across the street from the
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| IOT020 |	Target open
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,207	| IOT020 |	At home store
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,327	| IOT020 |	Intel developer forum
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,863	| IOT020 |	Which is
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,631	| IOT020 |	Big
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,655	| IOT020 |	Great show
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| IOT020 |	Today or Tuesday
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,471	| IOT020 |	Intel CEO
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,495	| IOT020 |	Did the keto
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,007	| IOT020 |	Which was
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT020 |	Surprisingly
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| IOT020 |	All about the internet
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:11:01,247	| IOT020 |	It's not surprising Because The Internet of Things is like the hottest thing since sliced bread but it was surprising because Intel didn't actually
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,087	| IOT020 |	Can't talk about any data centers he didn't talk about
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:09,183	| IOT020 |	Any of the new light chips for workstations or laptops or servers
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:11,231	| IOT020 |	I'm not surprised I mean that's
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:18,143	| IOT020 |	That's not sexy in 2015 you know I mean I know that's important those chips are very important Data Center
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,423	| IOT020 |	Obviously important
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,703	| IOT020 |	Considers is Fort
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,239	| IOT020 |	Billion dollars
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,823	| IOT020 |	Alright so it's important to the capital i
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:29,919	| IOT020 |	With but the point is what's up incoming and
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,223	| IOT020 |	Obviously we know because we talked about it every week
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,015	| IOT020 |	And Intel has
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:38,623	| IOT020 |	Been late to Market when terms of mobile for example
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,975	| IOT020 |	And they don't repeat that when it comes to IRT and that's why it's the S this year
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,023	| IOT020 |	That was a big part of their
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,815	| IOT020 |	They're keynote as well it wasn't
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,375	| IOT020 |	It wasn't those data center chips and graphic chips
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,191	| IOT020 |	And so on and so forth in the newest core chips for PCs
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,239	| IOT020 |	They were really showing off skin
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:57,055	| IOT020 |	Iot wearables and stuff like that so
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,847	| IOT020 |	Wasn't surprised that's what I mean
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,383	| IOT020 |	Okay and
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,175	| IOT020 |	So from a chip perspective
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,991	| IOT020 |	Really what we saw it was something they introduced in
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:09,343	| IOT020 |	That's it yes but when they introduced NCS it was a concept
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,111	| IOT020 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,879	| IOT020 |	And
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| IOT020 |	Inside it had a
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| IOT020 |	Arm chip
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,207	| IOT020 |	I said it out loud
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:20,607	| IOT020 |	What was a concept I don't I don't fault them for what happened for folks who missed it they were showing off I don't recall
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,119	| IOT020 |	It was like a
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:27,775	| IOT020 |	Headphones that could measure your heart rate or something to that effect was something with their wearables division it was Prototype
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:34,175	| IOT020 |	And we later found out that even though they were talking about their own stuff all the time it had an arm chip in that particular probably because their chip
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,711	| IOT020 |	It wasn't quite ready for this
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:38,527	| IOT020 |	I don't fault them for that but it was a big brouhaha the time
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,063	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,575	| IOT020 |	Now
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,391	| IOT020 |	Several months later they have
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,415	| IOT020 |	It's called the Curie module
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,511	| IOT020 |	And this is a module
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:49,791	| IOT020 |	It's a whole pack
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,839	| IOT020 |	Which has the
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,423	| IOT020 |	Work which is their kind of tiny low-power small
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,703	| IOT020 |	It's a 32-bit
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| IOT020 |	Chip
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,519	| IOT020 |	So the courtship
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,823	| IOT020 |	It's got 384
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,591	| IOT020 |	Kill the Lights
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,359	| IOT020 |	A flash memory
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,895	| IOT020 |	And it has a
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,943	| IOT020 |	DSP sensor hub chip
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:12,063	| IOT020 |	Bluetooth low-energy radio a 6 axis accelerometer and gyroscope
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| IOT020 |	And
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:15,647	| IOT020 |	Battery charging stuff
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,463	| IOT020 |	Like I'm Epi Macon it basically which is a battery charging
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,535	| IOT020 |	Capabilities so it can be plugged in if you can charge it
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:24,095	| IOT020 |	So this little module is about the size of
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,631	| IOT020 |	Thumbnail
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,167	| IOT020 |	Little bit
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,191	| IOT020 |	It's hard to tell
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,007	| IOT020 |	So it's really tiny and they showed it
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,031	| IOT020 |	At the the
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,799	| IOT020 |	Keynote speech
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,615	| IOT020 |	Integrated into handlebars
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,383	| IOT020 |	Cuda BMX bike
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,151	| IOT020 |	Language of course
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,455	| IOT020 |	Was on stage doing
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:41,503	| IOT020 |	Crazy tricks because you know
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,551	| IOT020 |	You can't have an event like this without welding
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,879	| IOT020 |	So that security platform
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,695	| IOT020 |	And it runs a lot of different
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:52,767	| IOT020 |	Soccer kits at Intel calls.the Intel IQ software kit
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,815	| IOT020 |	It's there's things about identity
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,607	| IOT020 |	There's things about time to do
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,887	| IOT020 |	Pills with scheduling
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| IOT020 |	There's a bunch of them
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,703	| IOT020 |	There's Fitness ones like
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,495	| IOT020 |	It's kind of the answer to
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,007	| IOT020 |	Healthkit
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,543	| IOT020 |	It's more like
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,359	| IOT020 |	We give you give us a bunch of data and
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,943	| IOT020 |	These IQ systems run algorithms on them and pop out like
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,503	| IOT020 |	Useful answers are useful information
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:17,855	| IOT020 |	I'm and they're designed to do it like in a very small kind of
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,623	| IOT020 |	Computer memory
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:22,975	| IOT020 |	That is what Intel's that's kind of the Practical platform
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,255	| IOT020 |	And
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,071	| IOT020 |	Keto at the actual event
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,863	| IOT020 |	They should have some cool stuff like
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,703	| IOT020 |	A little clip that you can stick on your baby's car seat that you know when you
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,751	| IOT020 |	Can you put them in the car seat
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:38,335	| IOT020 |	It won't allow you to walk away from the car seat without the baby
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:41,407	| IOT020 |	You know what's nice for not leaving your baby in the car seat
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:46,271	| IOT020 |	And you know people were I I was I was on the Engadget live blog for a moment they were
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| IOT020 |	Who does that
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,135	| IOT020 |	So it happened sadist people
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,951	| IOT020 |	If you could pay that have that not happen to you
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,487	| IOT020 |	I guarantee you you would pay to not have
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,559	| IOT020 |	So silly
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:04,447	| IOT020 |	So there's there's cool things like that there's the date of you know for the bike handles or other athletic equipment from the tree platform
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:09,567	| IOT020 |	You know so with Intel idea of things lot of flashlights of in no devices
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,871	| IOT020 |	Lot of wearables lot of I
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,687	| IOT020 |	Coyote which parintele actually are two separate divisions
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,735	| IOT020 |	I still don't know why
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,295	| IOT020 |	Maybe one day we'll
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,855	| IOT020 |	So that's what that was
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,951	| IOT020 |	At this point I mean the Kure even though they announced it was coming
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:32,095	| IOT020 |	When they discussed it back in January this is really I guess Carrie is coming out party so there's no actual products as of yet that use it
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,655	| IOT020 |	Don't
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,447	| IOT020 |	I don't I don't know how
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,239	| IOT020 |	I don't know of any it's
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,287	| IOT020 |	It hasn't know it hasn't been a
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,055	| IOT020 |	Approved by the FDA
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,847	| IOT020 |	Absolute Radio
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,871	| IOT020 |	You can't have it in a product
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| IOT020 |	And Intel.
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| IOT020 |	Seem to me
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,087	| IOT020 |	I don't think so
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,367	| IOT020 |	That's about their Style
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,951	| IOT020 |	So yeah so we should be looking for until
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:01,279	| IOT020 |	To really kind of get into the consumer iot a little bit more which is
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,327	| IOT020 |	Well
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:06,399	| IOT020 |	That's kind of leads to an interesting question you know
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:10,239	| IOT020 |	What Intel needs now that has a chip and a software platform for it
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| IOT020 |	Who's going to partner with Intel
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,103	| IOT020 |	So that they showed off Google
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| IOT020 |	They should have some
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,479	| IOT020 |	Some real time audio kind of stuff with Google
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT020 |	The Shootist
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,551	| IOT020 |	Project Tango which is Google's 3D
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,111	| IOT020 |	3D imaging
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:31,487	| IOT020 |	Yeah I said it's a developer kit right now it's a tablet with them a bunch of sensors so that way you can literally
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,559	| IOT020 |	Get a 3D map of a room or object
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:40,959	| IOT020 |	Using his tablet and Intel has their own software called realsense which uses depth sensors of the Dell
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,519	| IOT020 |	Android tablet if it which one exactly it is
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:46,079	| IOT020 |	Uses Intel's depth-sensing I'd heard that those two
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:46,847	| IOT020 |	Supercuts
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,383	| IOT020 |	Working together now.
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,663	| IOT020 |	Realsense and Tango
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:52,223	| IOT020 |	Yes and they showed that off at the Keynote
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,783	| IOT020 |	And they use the word sense of occasionally
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,319	| IOT020 |	Which meaning
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,367	| IOT020 |	Shutters
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,135	| IOT020 |	Shutters
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:16:59,903	| IOT020 |	No no no
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,487	| IOT020 |	So that's that's not Curie that's their the real Sin
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:03,999	| IOT020 |	Monster
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,535	| IOT020 |	Yassi
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,303	| IOT020 |	I'm just thinking
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,631	| IOT020 |	Again having seen until get
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,935	| IOT020 |	Essentially demolishing the mobile market by
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,959	| IOT020 |	Arm processors
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,287	| IOT020 |	People have so much people I should say that
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,335	| IOT020 |	Company's product companies have so much
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,663	| IOT020 |	Time and money and effort invested in the arm
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,687	| IOT020 |	Platform
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:29,343	| IOT020 |	That I wonder if they're still going to be a struggle for until to get a foothold in the wearable Market
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,903	| IOT020 |	Now intel did show off
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:34,463	| IOT020 |	What they said was an Intel powered
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,255	| IOT020 |	Android Wear smart
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:36,767	| IOT020 |	Watch
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,071	| IOT020 |	That was made by father
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:44,447	| IOT020 |	Interesting Yokai fossils of the late to the game on Android Wear but that's okay
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,727	| IOT020 |	And so
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| IOT020 |	All we know about it
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,287	| IOT020 |	Is that it's going to run an inn
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:50,591	| IOT020 |	And that is all
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:56,991	| IOT020 |	I'm going to suspect that's probably not curious while I'm going to say that's a small Adam but we will see
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:57,503	| IOT020 |	It is a small
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:02,879	| IOT020 |	Yeah that makes more sense cuz it that I know what kind of phones they need in the Android Wear watches
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,743	| IOT020 |	Good luck in telxon minutes
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,767	| IOT020 |	What you know
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,559	| IOT020 |	Again I never bet
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,631	| IOT020 |	I don't know until because they have marketing they have
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,935	| IOT020 |	They can buy stuff if they were
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:22,335	| IOT020 |	Taking subsidized stuff I mean that's what happens with the low-cost Windows laptops you know that that's why they're cheaper than Chrome
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,359	| IOT020 |	Looks with your running arm chips
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,175	| IOT020 |	You know Intel is putting their atoms in
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,687	| IOT020 |	Tablets
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:30,271	| IOT020 |	Laptops and paying the the hardware vendors to do so
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| IOT020 |	So I
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:35,135	| IOT020 |	I don't know and you know they bought basis which is one of the best
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,183	| IOT020 |	Hardcore Fitness Mark Hour Fitness
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT020 |	Activity trackers out there
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:39,999	| IOT020 |	A lot of people
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,791	| IOT020 |	I agree I wouldn't bet against a migraine
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,327	| IOT020 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| IOT020 |	Little short bits of news
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,423	| IOT020 |	I'll send a big companies on the startup front
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:52,031	| IOT020 |	Filament which is a company that I have loved forever because it
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:55,103	| IOT020 |	Combines two crazy things which is the Internet of Things
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:55,871	| IOT020 |	End
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,639	| IOT020 |	Blockchain
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:59,455	| IOT020 |	Transaction database behind
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,991	| IOT020 |	Bitcoin
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:01,759	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:04,319	| IOT020 |	This company has raised $5000000
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,367	| IOT020 |	And has come out with its
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,415	| IOT020 |	Core product which is a
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,207	| IOT020 |	Ruggedized
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,719	| IOT020 |	Sensor
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,023	| IOT020 |	And in Bacolod
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:13,791	| IOT020 |	Tap
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| IOT020 |	In the network
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:17,631	| IOT020 |	Kind of architecture the taplerun on
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:21,471	| IOT020 |	And the network architecture is basically a technology stack
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,519	| IOT020 |	Around blockchain
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,823	| IOT020 |	So it's going to have blockchain for
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,103	| IOT020 |	They kind of distributed database
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| IOT020 |	It has
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:32,223	| IOT020 |	BitTorrent for distributed file sharing among all the sensors in the network
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,759	| IOT020 |	It has a
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,063	| IOT020 |	Mesh radio technology called
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:36,831	| IOT020 |	T mesh
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:42,975	| IOT020 |	Which is really cool it can go 9 miles and has incredibly low data rate
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| IOT020 |	It's like
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,279	| IOT020 |	300 kg
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:49,375	| IOT020 |	Minutes like might be the first dial-up modem my head
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:49,887	| IOT020 |	In the 90s
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,447	| IOT020 |	Actually sorry
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:58,079	| IOT020 |	It's really slow but
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,871	| IOT020 |	But it would be for
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,663	| IOT020 |	Small amounts of data
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,455	| IOT020 |	Diverging from devices
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:06,527	| IOT020 |	Is this sensor on is this soil
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,807	| IOT020 |	Fred dry
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:10,623	| IOT020 |	Yes basically Boolean type on off
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,135	| IOT020 |	Pets
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,719	| IOT020 |	So is Elsa runs Tallahassee
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,791	| IOT020 |	Which is a private messaging service so that's
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,071	| IOT020 |	How these things are going to
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| IOT020 |	Communicate
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:20,863	| IOT020 |	And
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,423	| IOT020 |	I feel like there's one more thing that I'm forgetting in here
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:26,495	| IOT020 |	The authentication software
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,823	| IOT020 |	Oh say can you see
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:34,175	| IOT020 |	Which is apparently that's the contract kind of
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,223	| IOT020 |	Authentication software
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:40,831	| IOT020 |	And it is used it's an ietf standard and it is used in a watt
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:46,207	| IOT020 |	You may be familiar with a lot because anytime you sign into something using Facebook or Twitter IDs
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:46,719	| IOT020 |	On the web
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,767	| IOT020 |	That is a lot basically
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,303	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,583	| IOT020 |	That is
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,631	| IOT020 |	That's the network stack that they've built
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,959	| IOT020 |	It's a really compelling idea because
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,495	| IOT020 |	Tidy is compelling because it's
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,031	| IOT020 |	A decentralized kind of
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:00,799	| IOT020 |	Coyote
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,311	| IOT020 |	Internet
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:05,151	| IOT020 |	The reason that school is because if you're somewhere in the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,967	| IOT020 |	And you don't have like the internet connectivity
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:14,367	| IOT020 |	This allows your devices to actually you give them a piece of information or a contract and they can just keep
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:16,159	| IOT020 |	Running off of that until you update it
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,696	| IOT020 |	So until like
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,464	| IOT020 |	If your
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,488	| IOT020 |	Your farmer in a field
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,304	| IOT020 |	Until you drive out the next time with you
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| IOT020 |	Your phone
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT020 |	Or a satellite phone if
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,376	| IOT020 |	If you're going out
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,168	| IOT020 |	Middle of truly nowhere
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,704	| IOT020 |	You know you can
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:34,080	| IOT020 |	Update with that connectivity like on a one-time basis every week or every month or every year
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,128	| IOT020 |	You know when and then
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT020 |	Pick up the information
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,176	| IOT020 |	Distributed
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,248	| IOT020 |	Price of it so the data will actually be stored
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:43,808	| IOT020 |	In devices until there's a connection available
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,600	| IOT020 |	Texted get it and or
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,392	| IOT020 |	Send receive
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,416	| IOT020 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,208	| IOT020 |	So it's good for
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,024	| IOT020 |	Crazy remote places it's also good for
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,864	| IOT020 |	Security because there are places where you want to have
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,400	| IOT020 |	Troll you don't want things always on the air
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,680	| IOT020 |	So this
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:01,984	| IOT020 |	Highly secure device
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,520	| IOT020 |	Gather data from it
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,312	| IOT020 |	Again same concept
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,872	| IOT020 |	And it's
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,384	| IOT020 |	Cheaper
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:12,224	| IOT020 |	Then having like a centralized Cloud Server that you know
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:17,856	| IOT020 |	Maybe you don't want to pay for that for 15 years or 20 years or however long you
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:20,416	| IOT020 |	Plan to have a mining operation in the middle of the Australian Outback
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:23,232	| IOT020 |	And maybe that's Overkill anyway
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,768	| IOT020 |	So that kind of Deeds
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,304	| IOT020 |	That's the market they're going out
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,328	| IOT020 |	After so it's not the same
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:31,424	| IOT020 |	Normal Market that we talked about a lot but it's a really interesting idea
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,472	| IOT020 |	They are not crazy
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,008	| IOT020 |	In the sense that they're not alone
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:39,104	| IOT020 |	IBM and Samsung are also testing the concept of
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,640	| IOT020 |	Using the blockchain
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,224	| IOT020 |	They're actually using ethereums network I believe
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,552	| IOT020 |	Where is these guys are using bitcoin's blockchain
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| IOT020 |	Technology
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,880	| IOT020 |	For those of you guys who are like
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,904	| IOT020 |	What the what
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,440	| IOT020 |	It's basically a difference
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,512	| IOT020 |	It's a difference in how they
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,536	| IOT020 |	Cryptocurrency
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:03,168	| IOT020 |	But yeah so I'm really excited about them I
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,448	| IOT020 |	Wish them luck and
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,728	| IOT020 |	$5000000 is
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:08,288	| IOT020 |	It's good for them and I can't wait to start hearing from customers
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,360	| IOT020 |	The Beatrice NYC
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,152	| IOT020 |	These things get implemented and see how well they work
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,432	| IOT020 |	It will be
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:15,200	| IOT020 |	It will be
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,224	| IOT020 |	Crazy interesting
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,528	| IOT020 |	Because I love having multiple models of thing
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,112	| IOT020 |	A b testing in the real world Network architectures
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,184	| IOT020 |	Alright final thing
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:25,952	| IOT020 |	Ring
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:29,792	| IOT020 |	We talked about it before they make a connected video doorbell weave
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,304	| IOT020 |	Tried it out
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:35,936	| IOT020 |	They also received funding they receive 28 million in a round that was led by
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,216	| IOT020 |	Sir Richard Branson
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,264	| IOT020 |	You may have heard of him
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| IOT020 |	I have
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,080	| IOT020 |	They're not changing their name to the
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:44,640	| IOT020 |	Nigel
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,920	| IOT020 |	I would expect them to
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,224	| IOT020 |	It's a shame
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:51,296	| IOT020 |	So that's just if you have a ring or yours
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,576	| IOT020 |	Sitting on the fence going
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,112	| IOT020 |	Which doorbell should I buy
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,160	| IOT020 |	I don't know which company will go out of business first
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,000	| IOT020 |	Maybe you're not as cynical as I am
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,072	| IOT020 |	I know
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:07,424	| IOT020 |	But they make a good price I think there I feel safe buying something from them
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,704	| IOT020 |	Aunt
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| IOT020 |	Their CEO was
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,544	| IOT020 |	It's really smart in that earlier on they made
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,080	| IOT020 |	Product that wasn't a good product
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:20,992	| IOT020 |	You know I asked him about it he's like you know we realize that we really needed to focus because we compete against
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,576	| IOT020 |	We don't compete against other video doorbell
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:29,696	| IOT020 |	Today's when you hit the mainstream consumer market for your product you're competing against Apple and Samsung
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:34,304	| IOT020 |	And if you're asking the consumer to pay $200 for device
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,352	| IOT020 |	That's who they're going to compare you again
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:41,984	| IOT020 |	Yeah it's interesting how certain brands have set up a price expectation
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:45,568	| IOT020 |	When you are at lesser no name and then
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,128	| IOT020 |	Nothing is wrong but I don't think most people would
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,688	| IOT020 |	Recognize their name or the product just yet
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:54,016	| IOT020 |	Yeah you're going to be compared to the apples the same songs and so on so
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:57,088	| IOT020 |	It's almost unfair but unfortunately the reality of it
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:24:58,880	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,440	| IOT020 |	I think that's probably all we have time for
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT020 |	For today
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,744	| IOT020 |	We have a guest right
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| IOT020 |	We do

EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,424	| IOT020 |	Currency services
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:16,800	| IOT020 |	And he is he did a report that we talked about a little bit a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:21,152	| IOT020 |	On the internet of things and he's going to talk about kind of how a company
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:24,992	| IOT020 |	Parrots of culturally to make Bank
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:28,576	| IOT020 |	With the internet of things so stay tuned for that
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:37,792	| IOT020 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,072	| IOT020 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,888	| IOT020 |	But I have our guest today
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:45,216	| IOT020 |	Ramaswamy who's the global head of the digital and
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| IOT020 |	Enterprise frittata
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,776	| IOT020 |	Consultancy services
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,080	| IOT020 |	Hello Satya how are you doing today
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,640	| IOT020 |	I'm good cuz he's already doing
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:56,480	| IOT020 |	I'm doing so well I am really excited to have you on the show
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| IOT020 |	People around the world
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:04,160	| IOT020 |	On what other companies are doing in the internet.
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:04,672	| IOT020 |	Space
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:08,256	| IOT020 |	Delta flight 795 of them
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:12,352	| IOT020 |	Completed the survey in Seoul right today between the answers
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:15,936	| IOT020 |	All the questions and that is what we took for analysis
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:18,240	| IOT020 |	And definitely
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,264	| IOT020 |	Seesaw
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:25,408	| IOT020 |	And yeah I was actually kind of stunned so what you guys found was that
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,736	| IOT020 |	80% of companies were already
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:31,808	| IOT020 |	Deploying internet of things kind of projects
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,600	| IOT020 |	And something
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,648	| IOT020 |	They're spending a lot of money
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:39,232	| IOT020 |	It's ugly and infect the quite a surprise
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:43,072	| IOT020 |	The fact that in a photo flight companies that actually
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,376	| IOT020 |	Do we sing something on the Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,144	| IOT020 |	Mainstays
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:48,704	| IOT020 |	And also the impact.
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:53,824	| IOT020 |	Example about the companies
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:58,176	| IOT020 |	Family departs another company
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:58,944	| IOT020 |	Project
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,784	| IOT020 |	Increase by 16%
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,344	| IOT020 |	In the areas where they are using
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,136	| IOT020 |	Which is really big
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,952	| IOT020 |	I'm sorry their revenue increased by
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,256	| IOT020 |	16% so16
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,096	| IOT020 |	On average
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:20,192	| IOT020 |	And then grows about a small group of companies about other companies
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,776	| IOT020 |	Increase of 30%
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,800	| IOT020 |	WWE
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,080	| IOT020 |	Initiative
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:32,224	| IOT020 |	Did you think about the revenue increases one of the biggest challenges that companies face
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,528	| IOT020 |	Because of intense competition
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,040	| IOT020 |	Flea markets
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,088	| IOT020 |	I'm at the same time
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,112	| IOT020 |	The cost
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,416	| IOT020 |	Prediction Cassidy's tomorrow
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,720	| IOT020 |	Maximum potential
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:48,864	| IOT020 |	So Cal Gas Company Springfield Avenue
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,192	| IOT020 |	Biggest caught up in what we call the volleyball
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:59,104	| IOT020 |	And I want this seems to be an important tool that is helping these companies break through that Valley boundary body
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,176	| IOT020 |	So the concept of the value boundary
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,712	| IOT020 |	Is what
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| IOT020 |	It is that
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:07,808	| IOT020 |	Increase your Revenue substantially
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:10,112	| IOT020 |	And you cannot also reduce your costs
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,624	| IOT020 |	Density
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:14,976	| IOT020 |	Because most of the costly was I've been up late in the last 10 to 15 years
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,512	| IOT020 |	Then you're not
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,584	| IOT020 |	Distance to be able to increase the value of 40
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:23,680	| IOT020 |	Companies are really looking at
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:28,800	| IOT020 |	And what you're seeing on the ground is that
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,080	| IOT020 |	Help them accomplish
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,640	| IOT020 |	Brasier report
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,920	| IOT020 |	I was really struck
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,712	| IOT020 |	I was trapped by the numbers
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,784	| IOT020 |	Because they are actually really significant and
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,088	| IOT020 |	I'm not hearing
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,136	| IOT020 |	A lot of the companies that I talk to
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,184	| IOT020 |	They are looking at
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,000	| IOT020 |	The industrial internet
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,072	| IOT020 |	Looking at this is a way to do kind of
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:54,656	| IOT020 |	Our return-on-investment so a lot of the times
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,472	| IOT020 |	They're kind of doing sandbox trial projects
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,752	| IOT020 |	The kind of
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,544	| IOT020 |	Become a little bit more efficient
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:04,896	| IOT020 |	They aren't looking at it is a kind of severely innovative
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,432	| IOT020 |	Play right off the bat
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:09,504	| IOT020 |	And despite what HE tells me in their press release
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:10,784	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:14,368	| IOT020 |	This next part of the report I really loved and
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:18,464	| IOT020 |	You had a whole section that the entire back chunk of your report
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,256	| IOT020 |	Talked about like
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,072	| IOT020 |	Highly successful iot leaders
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,096	| IOT020 |	And
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:27,168	| IOT020 |	You know I was I would love for you to tell me like
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,192	| IOT020 |	First off
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,544	| IOT020 |	What are some of the companies that you classified as some of these iot leader
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,384	| IOT020 |	Report
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:36,896	| IOT020 |	Damn.
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,736	| IOT020 |	30% or more of Revenue in
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,576	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,624	| IOT020 |	These are companies that are actually seeing
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:47,904	| IOT020 |	Substantial
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:54,048	| IOT020 |	And this is not just related to the amount of spending that they do
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,840	| IOT020 |	But really
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:59,680	| IOT020 |	David shining as the leader
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:03,264	| IOT020 |	And the thing to find out what exactly are they doing
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,800	| IOT020 |	Differently or what is common
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,848	| IOT020 |	Among all these companies
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,408	| IOT020 |	Thanks
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:14,016	| IOT020 |	What are the key observations that we have is that what the last
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,296	| IOT020 |	7 or 8 years
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:20,928	| IOT020 |	Did audible the five important digital technologies that are coming into play
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:24,000	| IOT020 |	Angry call about the digital 5 forces
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:27,328	| IOT020 |	The first one is about mobility and pervasive computing
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,864	| IOT020 |	Second one to support Big Data
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,424	| IOT020 |	Good things about social media
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| IOT020 |	Fortis stock
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,752	| IOT020 |	Insist on this machine learning
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,520	| IOT020 |	Intelligent
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,312	| IOT020 |	And this
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:42,176	| IOT020 |	Flight technology so it won't go any faster
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:46,272	| IOT020 |	And internet of things happens to be what we call of the composite
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,832	| IOT020 |	Because the class combinations of all these things
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:53,184	| IOT020 |	And in fact one of the only composite Falls that has all different elements
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:53,952	| IOT020 |	Yeah but it didn't work
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:59,328	| IOT020 |	And the net result of this composite for The Internet of Things is doing the companies
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:03,168	| IOT020 |	Is giving them an opportunity to completely re-imagined
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:03,680	| IOT020 |	Themselves
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:07,008	| IOT020 |	And I'll be calling cuz digital remaster Nation
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:11,104	| IOT020 |	And it's interesting seems to be important.
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,408	| IOT020 |	Angelina's
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,176	| IOT020 |	Before
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,456	| IOT020 |	We're actually going
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,992	| IOT020 |	Computer
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:21,344	| IOT020 |	First one is about creating and telling your business model
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,416	| IOT020 |	Second it's about creating and telling you products
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,952	| IOT020 |	Conservative that never existed before
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:31,328	| IOT020 |	And third one was about creeping customer segments in babies that was never done before
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:36,192	| IOT020 |	And the fourth one is about creating entirely new channels of distribution of their products
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,544	| IOT020 |	And the first one is about creating and telling your business processes
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:42,336	| IOT020 |	Complete remodeling
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,360	| IOT020 |	What they had before
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:49,248	| IOT020 |	And what you found that as a common theme
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:51,296	| IOT020 |	Accomplish
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:54,112	| IOT020 |	The 30% increase in Revenue Andre Ward initiative
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:57,696	| IOT020 |	Was that did not looking at a tactical rail
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:00,768	| IOT020 |	Port Canaveral transfer meteor imaginative
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:04,352	| IOT020 |	Ended up going and impacting all the six areas that I talked about
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,888	| IOT020 |	And that was one important thing
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,776	| IOT020 |	Okay wow you just gave us a whole lot you gave us
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,312	| IOT020 |	5 kind of
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:18,176	| IOT020 |	Big trends you gave a six ways that you should be looking it was six ways right that
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:19,456	| IOT020 |	They're changing their business
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,272	| IOT020 |	So let's unpack that a little bit
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,040	| IOT020 |	Because
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:23,808	| IOT020 |	Again
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,576	| IOT020 |	A lot of stuff there
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,112	| IOT020 |	Let's take
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| IOT020 |	Applying Big Data
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,928	| IOT020 |	Across all of these things
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,232	| IOT020 |	And then let's take how
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:34,304	| IOT020 |	A company might view its Workforce its
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:36,096	| IOT020 |	Change Iris are changing
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:39,680	| IOT020 |	Using all of these things to reimagine its Workforce how it interacts
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,472	| IOT020 |	His customers howitt
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:44,288	| IOT020 |	How it can be imagined it's business
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,360	| IOT020 |	And let's let's talk about how one of your leaders is doing
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,432	| IOT020 |	Short so
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,456	| IOT020 |	Take the kids of
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,480	| IOT020 |	A leader and
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:56,064	| IOT020 |	Let's talk about the six areas from business model
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,600	| IOT020 |	Products and services
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:58,880	| IOT020 |	Customer segments
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:04,512	| IOT020 |	The business part of the business model
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,328	| IOT020 |	Engine types of business model
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,888	| IOT020 |	Changing a business model is extremely clogged
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:13,216	| IOT020 |	But if you can make the change happen.
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:16,544	| IOT020 |	And if someone took advantage of Auto industry that is competing in
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| IOT020 |	Coyotes
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:20,384	| IOT020 |	Helping them do that important
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:24,224	| IOT020 |	Inductive by creating watercolors data transparency
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:29,088	| IOT020 |	So the ability of a manufacturer to Caribou Sublimity into
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:33,440	| IOT020 |	Hold the product of the creator
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,256	| IOT020 |	What does a jet engine used to being
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,792	| IOT020 |	Is performing at is being used
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:41,888	| IOT020 |	That's created the opportunity to intelligence the business model from
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:46,240	| IOT020 |	Capital expense business model tomorrow for an operating expense
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:50,592	| IOT020 |	People in industrial talking about the hole
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,384	| IOT020 |	Jefferson Industries
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:52,896	| IOT020 |	It's moving from
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:56,224	| IOT020 |	Selling engines for millions of dollars
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,528	| IOT020 |	Who actually selling Plus
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,552	| IOT020 |	Customer service
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:03,648	| IOT020 |	Soda dungeon
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,464	| IOT020 |	Or take the case of insurance companies
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,792	| IOT020 |	Insurance companies
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:11,584	| IOT020 |	Google play classic edition
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,352	| IOT020 |	Red Sox
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:14,400	| IOT020 |	You could have done then
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,448	| IOT020 |	They have a fuel classifications of drivers
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| IOT020 |	Discipline
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,264	| IOT020 |	Characteristics
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:23,104	| IOT020 |	And then they determine the premium based upon which segment.
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,384	| IOT020 |	I know you are not sending it
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:27,712	| IOT020 |	But that is not the optimal
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:31,040	| IOT020 |	Because for example some segments like a team segment
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,088	| IOT020 |	Are considered as bad drivers
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,112	| IOT020 |	From the get-go
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:37,184	| IOT020 |	And even if somebody is a good driver he does not get rewarded for
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,512	| IOT020 |	Winston August
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:44,096	| IOT020 |	Transparency for example vehicle to one of the
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,400	| IOT020 |	Insurance companies in North America theater system
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:49,728	| IOT020 |	Where do you use the sensors on the mobile phone
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,264	| IOT020 |	Telematic device
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:54,848	| IOT020 |	And that system intern talks to the Big Data System
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:59,200	| IOT020 |	And this data last message. Driving the cell phone tracks
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:03,040	| IOT020 |	Though you're driving too fast.
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,064	| IOT020 |	Song
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:08,416	| IOT020 |	Or are you driving at the weather conditions Changed by combining data from
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:12,256	| IOT020 |	The telematics device the mobile phone with the data from
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,560	| IOT020 |	But that sources for example
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,328	| IOT020 |	Anthony
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,888	| IOT020 |	Creative or I could just profile of the individual
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:21,984	| IOT020 |	So that no the premium can be determined at the individual level
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:25,312	| IOT020 |	So that's a fundamental difference.
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,336	| IOT020 |	It makes sometimes
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,104	| IOT020 |	Business model
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:32,992	| IOT020 |	Got it makes a lot of sense now I talked to some companies that are trying to introduce these swords
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:33,760	| IOT020 |	What's a business model
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,832	| IOT020 |	What they've run into though
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:38,624	| IOT020 |	Is it the middle men
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,160	| IOT020 |	Or their distribution Network
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,720	| IOT020 |	Makes that sort of change
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,512	| IOT020 |	A challenge
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,536	| IOT020 |	They
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:48,096	| IOT020 |	Don't want to be cut out or maybe they don't want to
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,376	| IOT020 |	Sell that new model
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,448	| IOT020 |	I think what's
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:55,776	| IOT020 |	Most interesting about this shift is company C
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:00,640	| IOT020 |	That the business model needs to change they try to make it happen
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,152	| IOT020 |	And then what
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,736	| IOT020 |	Define inertia in their distribution chain
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:08,064	| IOT020 |	And maybe they're like a home and now I have to remake Midas
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,088	| IOT020 |	Houston chain
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:10,368	| IOT020 |	Or they're like I have to
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,136	| IOT020 |	Condense
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,672	| IOT020 |	In a whole new layer of
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:15,488	| IOT020 |	People that I've never had to work with before to work with me
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:21,120	| IOT020 |	It really is an ecosystem play and it seems like the whole ecosystem is it quite
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:21,632	| IOT020 |	There yet
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:25,216	| IOT020 |	I completely agree with you.
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:27,520	| IOT020 |	Iot using ecosystem play 1G
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,312	| IOT020 |	From the
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:35,456	| IOT020 |	There's no one single player who is going to dominate
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,784	| IOT020 |	I'd like plants when we actually go in 30 employment
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,552	| IOT020 |	Play one
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:45,184	| IOT020 |	Fieldpointe dual-channel tens on his credit card and the companies do need to
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:48,000	| IOT020 |	CVS of taking the channel along with them
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:51,840	| IOT020 |	Seventeen.com
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:58,240	| IOT020 |	We brought about lot of difficulty Santos Tunisia
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:02,848	| IOT020 |	But if there is substantial value that is being delivered
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,408	| IOT020 |	The customer will come through the change
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,712	| IOT020 |	Rachel Noble
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:10,272	| IOT020 |	Doesn't listen W have from the internet Revolution
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:14,624	| IOT020 |	And I would say that the Internet of Things Revolution
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,648	| IOT020 |	Fuel Moto
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,720	| IOT020 |	Because the Internet Revolution was all about
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,536	| IOT020 |	The digital replacing II
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:25,376	| IOT020 |	But Internet of Things is all about the digitally enhancing.
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:25,888	| IOT020 |	Right
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,168	| IOT020 |	So in many ways
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:35,360	| IOT020 |	I'm very important question example one of the most inspiring example
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:39,712	| IOT020 |	I think about is the HP instant ink program
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:43,296	| IOT020 |	Ink by themselves
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:47,904	| IOT020 |	So you think about it the whole.com Revolution was
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,464	| IOT020 |	Basilic got replaced by a machine
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,768	| IOT020 |	But now the budget is a mission
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,048	| IOT020 |	Right so
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,352	| IOT020 |	There's no intention of a human being from a buying site
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:59,168	| IOT020 |	That's a really astute observation
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,216	| IOT020 |	And kind of scary
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:03,776	| IOT020 |	The fire is a machine
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:06,080	| IOT020 |	The seller is a machine so where do people fit in
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,552	| IOT020 |	It has created so much of value.
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:18,624	| IOT020 |	Even if I get replaced by a buyer let's take that example
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:24,768	| IOT020 |	The printer Arlington ink in creating value for me or not
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:30,656	| IOT020 |	I'm not emotionally attached to the fact that you know I could go on and Order
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:35,264	| IOT020 |	Oregon and order return online on my webpage
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:40,128	| IOT020 |	But the fact that the printer is detecting it is running low on
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,176	| IOT020 |	And automatically ordering it
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,480	| IOT020 |	Everything gets delivered to my doorstep
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| IOT020 |	And I don't get into
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,904	| IOT020 |	Ganges Restaurant
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:55,232	| IOT020 |	What time of day it is
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,792	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,816	| IOT020 |	What is that
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:00,608	| IOT020 |	Does cryptic summative value
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:05,472	| IOT020 |	For all people in the value chain that people will go along with the change
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:07,008	| IOT020 |	In a positive frame of mind
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,776	| IOT020 |	And I
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,544	| IOT020 |	Physical exam
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,336	| IOT020 |	Okay I agree with you
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:15,712	| IOT020 |	Probably even the people who are responsible for ordering ink it companies would rather spend their time ordering
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,272	| IOT020 |	I don't know anything but ink
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:21,856	| IOT020 |	So let's dig into a couple things so we talked
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,880	| IOT020 |	Some about kind of
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,672	| IOT020 |	You would offered these seven
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,976	| IOT020 |	Tenant 7 things that the
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,000	| IOT020 |	The leaders did
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:29,536	| IOT020 |	I'm in
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:30,560	| IOT020 |	We we talked
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:33,888	| IOT020 |	I hear you're a big guy for numbers and lists I'm sensing
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:37,216	| IOT020 |	You know you're at your five big shifts your six
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,800	| IOT020 |	You're six things companies can realize
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,824	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:43,104	| IOT020 |	The first thing went
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:46,944	| IOT020 |	Was literally iot leaders are more likely to reimagine their businesses in
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:52,320	| IOT020 |	Produce substantial values for customers not just values for themselves
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,600	| IOT020 |	And we kind of talked about
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:58,464	| IOT020 |	Second they deliver that value through new business models products and service offering
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,512	| IOT020 |	We talked about that
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:06,912	| IOT020 |	Third they appear more likely to see the Breakthrough potential of iot getting the ultimate truth on how their products and services
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:10,240	| IOT020 |	They're performing for customers as well as the actual usage patterns
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:13,312	| IOT020 |	I think we actually probably should dig into that
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:16,384	| IOT020 |	Actually one of the
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:18,688	| IOT020 |	Great benefits of iot and I think
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:23,552	| IOT020 |	I want to hear some sleep anxiety to product development
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:27,136	| IOT020 |	So the traditional software product development
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:30,464	| IOT020 |	I want a big change because now you can actually
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:31,744	| IOT020 |	So you can
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,680	| IOT020 |	And you can use that $2
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,960	| IOT020 |	The next version of the Torah
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:42,240	| IOT020 |	And make
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:44,032	| IOT020 |	Lord of incremental
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:45,056	| IOT020 |	Industry
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| IOT020 |	Talk to the digital
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,664	| IOT020 |	So that was a big thing that happened with the last
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:53,504	| IOT020 |	YouTube videos of analytics on software products
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:57,344	| IOT020 |	But now I want is actually golden Abel.
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:01,696	| IOT020 |	And then to something is sometimes what you hear back
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:04,000	| IOT020 |	Something machines may not exactly be what
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:04,512	| IOT020 |	You want
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:07,840	| IOT020 |	Company is coming
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:12,192	| IOT020 |	Many times to hear things that are not exactly what
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:12,704	| IOT020 |	Catolica
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:14,752	| IOT020 |	So how do you react to that
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,544	| IOT020 |	Got it
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:21,664	| IOT020 |	And so that that covers those kind of stories cover your fourth and fifth points which are the
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,944	| IOT020 |	Iot leaders
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:27,552	| IOT020 |	They organized themselves to act rapidly based on this performance and customer usage data
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:29,856	| IOT020 |	And they're just stay
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:33,184	| IOT020 |	Get better at dealing with internal resistance to hearing the truth about their toy
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,464	| IOT020 |	So
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:37,792	| IOT020 |	People ask for this button they must love it and then no one ever
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,304	| IOT020 |	Press that button
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:40,608	| IOT020 |	That's a hard truth
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:43,680	| IOT020 |	Or people really hate your product
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,472	| IOT020 |	That's a really hard
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:45,984	| IOT020 |	R-Truth
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:50,848	| IOT020 |	They make six I thought was great they may coyote reliable in the field
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,640	| IOT020 |	Especially reducing risks
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:53,919	| IOT020 |	Cyber security breaches
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:57,503	| IOT020 |	I think a lot of companies right now are still falling down
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,783	| IOT020 |	About that I'll be honest
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:02,111	| IOT020 |	I've noticed a lot of blaming the customer
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:02,879	| IOT020 |	About that
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:05,183	| IOT020 |	Or just outright ignoring it
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:10,303	| IOT020 |	And 7th they make small test investments before making broader and bigger one
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:12,607	| IOT020 |	I think
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:13,631	| IOT020 |	That last one is
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,143	| IOT020 |	Explain
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:18,239	| IOT020 |	You know if we want to end this with a sense of kind of
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:20,799	| IOT020 |	Security what is your advice to customer
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,335	| IOT020 |	As they're considering
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,615	| IOT020 |	Either
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,687	| IOT020 |	Connecting their own manufacturing or their own
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:30,783	| IOT020 |	Internal operations or if they're planning on making a
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:31,807	| IOT020 |	Product
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,343	| IOT020 |	Where do you think
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:36,671	| IOT020 |	They are when it comes to security what are the conversations they're having
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:41,535	| IOT020 |	2 IU is this point of security
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,327	| IOT020 |	Primarily because
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,607	| IOT020 |	Implications of the phone
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,167	| IOT020 |	And the computer
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:52,031	| IOT020 |	So the text
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:55,871	| IOT020 |	But good internet of things you're going to impact something in the physical world
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:43:01,503	| IOT020 |	So think about the impact of something happening to a jet engine burn this life is my dad
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:05,087	| IOT020 |	Or you are going full speed in the expressway and something happened
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:08,671	| IOT020 |	To the car because security please
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:14,303	| IOT020 |	AllMusic tonight what is system in your home and you talked everything was Secure
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:19,167	| IOT020 |	And then someone please play security and now they can actually deactivate
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:22,751	| IOT020 |	The Simpsons
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:26,335	| IOT020 |	So the implications of security office
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,103	| IOT020 |	Full
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,639	| IOT020 |	Performance
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,663	| IOT020 |	And I
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:33,759	| IOT020 |	I do think that it does not fully appreciated yet in its full magnitude
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:38,111	| IOT020 |	But the lot of the good Solutions providers that the worker
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,135	| IOT020 |	You know what
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:44,767	| IOT020 |	Are taking notice and solutions.
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:48,607	| IOT020 |	And the systems that you put together has security as one of the foremost
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,143	| IOT020 |	Things that about
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,679	| IOT020 |	Simply because
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:53,215	| IOT020 |	What are the implications of a beach
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:57,567	| IOT020 |	On what system that is operating in the physical world is just simply too big
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,639	| IOT020 |	Got it all right
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:06,015	| IOT020 |	Such a thank you so much for coming on the podcast today I really appreciate having
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,551	| IOT020 |	This kind of in-depth conversation
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:08,831	| IOT020 |	About
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,599	| IOT020 |	How
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,391	| IOT020 |	Companies can be successful
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:17,023	| IOT020 |	In the playing kind of iot in both their products and hopefully in their own operations
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:24,447	| IOT020 |	A Blog and I think so too great to talk to you in person
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,519	| IOT020 |	Awesome thank you
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:29,823	| IOT020 |	And that concludes our show
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:34,943	| IOT020 |	Thanks for listening this week will be back next week with more iot goodness
