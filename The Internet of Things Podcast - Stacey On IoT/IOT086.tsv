EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:00,672	| IOT086 |	Intelligent iot products and services
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:07,072	| IOT086 |	Samsung's artik smart iot platform provides both Hardware modules and cloud services either together
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:12,704	| IOT086 |	Or an integrated platform with an ecosystem of tools and partners to speed up your time-to-market

EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:15,776	| IOT086 |	Here we go into the show
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,056	| IOT086 |	Oh
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:17,568	| IOT086 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:18,592	| IOT086 |	Hit the news
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:19,616	| IOT086 |	Fast
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:26,528	| IOT086 |	Okay so we have some news that is just reported news is not necessarily true
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:31,648	| IOT086 |	It's not officially acknowledged by Apple but Mark Gorman over Bloomberg is reporting
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:35,744	| IOT086 |	That apple is getting out of a wireless router business
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:38,816	| IOT086 |	And I'm scratching my head over this because
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:42,400	| IOT086 |	They make several routers including one that has
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:44,192	| IOT086 |	The backup function in a time capsule
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,472	| IOT086 |	I'm just kind of surprised
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,520	| IOT086 |	Prize that they would do this because
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:50,848	| IOT086 |	It kind of fits in with the whole Smart Home homekit
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,920	| IOT086 |	Market to me now the only thing I can think of is maybe
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:56,224	| IOT086 |	All the other new router
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:58,528	| IOT086 |	People that are popping up on to the market or are just
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,088	| IOT086 |	Pushing the margins out for apple and I just
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,648	| IOT086 |	Don't think it's profitable business
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:05,184	| IOT086 |	I don't know I mean I feel like
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:09,280	| IOT086 |	I just spent $500 on 3 mesh routers I feels like
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,584	| IOT086 |	It feels like a space where Apple really
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:15,424	| IOT086 |	Hey has the bonjour is it bonjour is a protocol they use
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,728	| IOT086 |	Thank you Spanish or four
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,752	| IOT086 |	Yes I'll say yes
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:19,776	| IOT086 |	Keep it simple
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,640	| IOT086 |	They've actually put a lot of innovation here in
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,176	| IOT086 |	You know up until
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,736	| IOT086 |	The launch of all these new products
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:32,320	| IOT086 |	What was the way to go if you wanted an easy to set up Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| IOT086 |	Kind of operation
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:40,256	| IOT086 |	It was expensive yeah that was a couple years back it got it was easy and I agree with you but now it's some of the
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:43,328	| IOT086 |	The newer players make it at least as easy if not easier I think
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,912	| IOT086 |	And I don't know what that there's a lot more innovation
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,728	| IOT086 |	I don't think Apple can out innovate the month on Simplicity year
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,544	| IOT086 |	Other news is
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:56,128	| IOT086 |	Have you guys seen that now your Amazon Echo

EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:11,488	| IOT086 |	I tried the new text messaging skill
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:15,328	| IOT086 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:20,448	| IOT086 |	Yes that's what coordinating before they Shone like oh yeah I tried that thinking it was the text messaging I didn't
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,216	| IOT086 |	Qunar
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,752	| IOT086 |	Recipes
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:25,312	| IOT086 |	Well let me tell you about it cuz I have not tried it yet
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,104	| IOT086 |	Miss you guys
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,872	| IOT086 |	Nice butt
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,408	| IOT086 |	You should because Amazon
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,968	| IOT086 |	Has enabled an Allrecipes skill
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,272	| IOT086 |	The skill that you find
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,832	| IOT086 |	You can actually give the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:43,232	| IOT086 |	Ingredients on hand it will help you find a recipe that works for those ingredients and then you can do step by step recipe guide
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,816	| IOT086 |	Switch assembly I've been asking so you can say pause next
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,328	| IOT086 |	Repeat
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,352	| IOT086 |	Skip
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,888	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:53,216	| IOT086 |	I actually thought this was pretty cool and I can't wait to cook with it
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,288	| IOT086 |	Sadly I have yet to actually make a meal that
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,080	| IOT086 |	Involves all recipes but
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,128	| IOT086 |	Soon
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,176	| IOT086 |	I will let you know how it is in Kevin
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,992	| IOT086 |	The skill that you tripe is this the AT&T text message
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,064	| IOT086 |	It is it is I'm actually surprised it's coming
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:12,672	| IOT086 |	From AT&T and not a different carrier kind of figured T-Mobile kind of tries to push the
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:17,024	| IOT086 |	Boundaries of things Lil bit more but I'm so if you have an AT&T
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,047	| IOT086 |	Account
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,911	| IOT086 |	And an echo you can link the new AT&T text messaging skill
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,447	| IOT086 |	To your Echo
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:27,007	| IOT086 |	And then literally you can speak a command
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,311	| IOT086 |	To send a text message to
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:33,663	| IOT086 |	One of your preset favorites to set up to 10 favorites
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,455	| IOT086 |	When you do the setup of the skill
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,759	| IOT086 |	Tel Link through AT&T website in your account
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:41,343	| IOT086 |	And then you can just speak that person's name and say I want to send a text and
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:46,207	| IOT086 |	You can speak the text and it will repeat the text and then send it to that person
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,999	| IOT086 |	The person knows it's coming from
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,303	| IOT086 |	The echo however there's a little
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,839	| IOT086 |	Put her in the
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,887	| IOT086 |	Text message they receive it says sent by
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,679	| IOT086 |	Chicken shall not be named yourself
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| IOT086 |	Got it
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,495	| IOT086 |	Brooks weather
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:04,895	| IOT086 |	That's pretty cool cuz actually one of the Google home features I liked with the if this and that was the ability to actually send a text
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,431	| IOT086 |	Message to someone verbally
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,711	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT086 |	Yay

EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,007	| IOT086 |	Annual gift guide and I wish we had the
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,079	| IOT086 |	I could sing some

EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| IOT086 |	Let nothing you dismay
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,527	| IOT086 |	That are we in the spirit now
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,039	| IOT086 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| IOT086 |	Let's get it
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,599	| IOT086 |	Started with
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,647	| IOT086 |	The wearables category
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,839	| IOT086 |	I got a
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,351	| IOT086 |	Hi love
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:03,007	| IOT086 |	Use wearables from all my running and whatnot so I'd look for a wide range of wearables
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:08,383	| IOT086 |	Because certain people have funeral on GPS other people don't want GPS I get that
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:08,895	| IOT086 |	I think
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,991	| IOT086 |	For most people I would probably recommend a fit
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,551	| IOT086 |	Fitbit charge 2 for their activity tracking
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:21,695	| IOT086 |	It's a $150 normally prices Black Friday deals for 1:30
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,487	| IOT086 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,095	| IOT086 |	I think they do I think they do
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,607	| IOT086 |	So don't pay more than
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,911	| IOT086 |	Yasso
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,423	| IOT086 |	What would I
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:38,079	| IOT086 |	I mean there's tons of good choices in this price point where even last time Garland makes several choices here
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:44,735	| IOT086 |	You know you could even use a pebble watch and track your activities and such but it what I like about the Fitbit
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:49,087	| IOT086 |	Charge 2 with ecosystem it supports both IOS and Android that's a
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| IOT086 |	A big bonus
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:56,255	| IOT086 |	Choose your device by based on what phone you use I really like the social aspect of
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,071	| IOT086 |	Fitbit ecosystem as well as
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,351	| IOT086 |	The smart
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:03,423	| IOT086 |	Exercise SmartTrack exercise recognition
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,495	| IOT086 |	There's so many times that I don't have a charge to actually
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,823	| IOT086 |	Got these surge cuz I wanted GPS built-in
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:14,175	| IOT086 |	This does not have GPS built-in it will use GPS of your attached phone
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:14,687	| IOT086 |	But
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:21,599	| IOT086 |	SmartTrack I just love it you know you decide I'm going to go for a walk and you don't have a said anything it just decides hey yo
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,367	| IOT086 |	You're walking
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,903	| IOT086 |	I know it's your walking and it just
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,719	| IOT086 |	Tracks that for yuan and locks at Sault
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:29,023	| IOT086 |	I kind of like that opposed to Long battery life
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,607	| IOT086 |	Can get at least four if not five days out of it. Sleep tracking
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,679	| IOT086 |	Get reminders you need some basic smartphone alerts
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,495	| IOT086 |	That's I think
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,543	| IOT086 |	Pretty good for most people
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:41,823	| IOT086 |	I
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:45,407	| IOT086 |	10 to wear however I Smartwatch and I alternate between
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,991	| IOT086 |	It was for iOS notes for Android so I've got a choice for both of us
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| IOT086 |	People
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| IOT086 |	Both platforms
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,599	| IOT086 |	Well obviously the Apple watches is going to be your
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,183	| IOT086 |	Your iOS device pick I have an Apple Watch 2
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| IOT086 |	They start at
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:04,607	| IOT086 |	369 I believe we have watch to I would recommend watch to over the series 1
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,119	| IOT086 |	Because
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,703	| IOT086 |	You get the GPS built-in you get the faster chip and so on
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:12,031	| IOT086 |	Much better I have the old Apple watch have the new Apple watch
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,567	| IOT086 |	Much faster open apps
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,895	| IOT086 |	Really really nice does a great job with the GPS in the heart rate
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,455	| IOT086 |	So if you have IOS and iPhone
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,479	| IOT086 |	I would definitely go that route
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,039	| IOT086 |	Android you got a lot of choices
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,111	| IOT086 |	And I think Stacy you would said that your mom has like a
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,671	| IOT086 |	Gear Fit 2 or S2 smartwatch
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,695	| IOT086 |	Gear 2
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:32,511	| IOT086 |	Here to OKC
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,071	| IOT086 |	Certainly not bad I'm in there newer models out there
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,119	| IOT086 |	I tried the Samsung devices
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,399	| IOT086 |	Decent
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:45,311	| IOT086 |	I don't care if it's for the fact that they run the tizen operating system because you're limited to tizen only apps in there
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,871	| IOT086 |	Far fewer tizen apps that are Android apps
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:51,967	| IOT086 |	So after trying and I think I've got four five different Android Wear devices
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| IOT086 |	The polar m600
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,599	| IOT086 |	The $329 has
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:00,415	| IOT086 |	Integrated GPS and heart rate monitor
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,975	| IOT086 |	Waterproof you can swim with it
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,791	| IOT086 |	Obviously get all of your smartphone notifications
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,583	| IOT086 |	It is bulky but if your
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,887	| IOT086 |	Interested in tracking like
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:13,471	| IOT086 |	Everything sleep and outdoor activities swimming and so on
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:19,359	| IOT086 |	I think it's one of the best GPS activity tracking iPhone to be the most stable Android Wear device so
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| IOT086 |	Again 329
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,199	| IOT086 |	That would be my take if you have an Android device
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| IOT086 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT086 |	Good
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,551	| IOT086 |	Pics from Kevin
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:28,831	| IOT086 |	What you got
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,623	| IOT086 |	What's a cat what's a guy
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT086 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,439	| IOT086 |	I'm into this health and wellness kit
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:36,767	| IOT086 |	So I'm going to recommend the sense sleep
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,535	| IOT086 |	Monitor
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,071	| IOT086 |	And the Sleep pill
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,631	| IOT086 |	What this is I'm sure you seen it because it's
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,399	| IOT086 |	It's actually very pop
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,983	| IOT086 |	It's a white orb with like little lines all over it
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,031	| IOT086 |	$150
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,591	| IOT086 |	And basically what it does is
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| IOT086 |	It monitors your sleeping environment
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,199	| IOT086 |	And then it managers
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| IOT086 |	Your sleep
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,015	| IOT086 |	And then you're supposed to wake you up at like an app
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:02,111	| IOT086 |	Each day like the best time after REM sleep
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,623	| IOT086 |	Can all of that
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:08,255	| IOT086 |	What's interesting is if you have a bad sleep environment it actually tells you
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,535	| IOT086 |	So it attracts like
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,327	| IOT086 |	How you sleep
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,351	| IOT086 |	To your entire
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,631	| IOT086 |	Which
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,167	| IOT086 |	Some people
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,727	| IOT086 |	They may not be anything to survive
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,311	| IOT086 |	Complete waste of money because they sleep well and they have a totally awesome
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,639	| IOT086 |	If that is you this is not a device for you
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,943	| IOT086 |	There plenty of sleep trackers that you
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,991	| IOT086 |	Are built in a fitness tracker
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,831	| IOT086 |	But if you're constantly sleeping badly and you're not sure why
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:35,135	| IOT086 |	This is actually really interesting way to find out
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:40,767	| IOT086 |	So I think it's a good gift for someone who's maybe a little Insomniac in
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,791	| IOT086 |	We're just
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,303	| IOT086 |	Freep Sports
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:43,583	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,119	| IOT086 |	And it's pretty
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,631	| IOT086 |	So pretty
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:50,495	| IOT086 |	If you know you get all these basically monitors the air condition since
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,567	| IOT086 |	Humidity and temperature in your bedroom so if you're interested in knowing that anyway
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:54,847	| IOT086 |	Yay
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,127	| IOT086 |	Damn
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| IOT086 |	I also have
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:01,247	| IOT086 |	This is something for families and you can buy these in Lowe's
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:06,111	| IOT086 |	This is for the tech afraid person in your life like maybe it's a grandma maybe it's an ant
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:06,623	| IOT086 |	Uncle I don't
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,207	| IOT086 |	The nucleus smart intercom system
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,767	| IOT086 |	It's 199 if you buy a pair of them
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,815	| IOT086 |	And basically this is
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,399	| IOT086 |	I don't think this is good if you have a text Abby person don't buy this
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| IOT086 |	If you have someone who's kind of like
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:25,823	| IOT086 |	Weird are you you're sick of having those calls where you're like
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,615	| IOT086 |	Open Skype I'm going to call you
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,639	| IOT086 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:31,199	| IOT086 |	You know and then you're on the phone with someone while they're calling you on Skype and it's
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,807	| IOT086 |	You know so in if you got FaceTime and someone
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| IOT086 |	Comfortable using FaceTime
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| IOT086 |	Probably again.
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:38,879	| IOT086 |	But
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,671	| IOT086 |	Here Comes nice
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,439	| IOT086 |	It is
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,231	| IOT086 |	A direct link
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:49,375	| IOT086 |	From you your home to someone else's home or at the direct link inside your home so if you just want a video intercom
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,167	| IOT086 |	This is actually really
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,447	| IOT086 |	Workable solution
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:57,823	| IOT086 |	The video quality is not super great it's only a 5 megapixel camera in there
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,127	| IOT086 |	It didn't adapt to lighting
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| IOT086 |	So like
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,455	| IOT086 |	Don't put it where are you
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:03,967	| IOT086 |	Your back
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,015	| IOT086 |	Find a window
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,063	| IOT086 |	But other than that it works
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,111	| IOT086 |	I know that sounds like a terrible wreck
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT086 |	You know half the things I tried don't
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,975	| IOT086 |	It's a good thing
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:17,791	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,607	| IOT086 |	Alright so
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:27,007	| IOT086 |	We talked so many times about smart assistants and voice control in your smart home or just streaming music
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,775	| IOT086 |	With your voice
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,079	| IOT086 |	I was thinking what is the
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:34,431	| IOT086 |	Best way for someone brand new to the space that wants to experience
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,735	| IOT086 |	What we talk about when we discuss all that
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:37,759	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,063	| IOT086 |	I have to say I think the
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,367	| IOT086 |	Newest Amazon Echo Dot
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,415	| IOT086 |	The second gen. For $50
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:47,487	| IOT086 |	Is the best way to get your foot in the door there I mean
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:53,119	| IOT086 |	It works without a wireless Bluetooth speaker because it does have a small speaker in it
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,191	| IOT086 |	So you don't have to connect to another speaker
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:59,263	| IOT086 |	If you would like to you have that option I have mine connected to
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,799	| IOT086 |	Awesome Marshall Bluetooth
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:01,823	| IOT086 |	Speaker that
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,943	| IOT086 |	Alexa skills you get your
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,223	| IOT086 |	Information
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,503	| IOT086 |	If you
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,295	| IOT086 |	Ever add Smart Home
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:16,159	| IOT086 |	Devices to your house you know you can likely voice control
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:19,743	| IOT086 |	If this then that recipes that work with with the echo so
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,791	| IOT086 |	I think for $50 you just can't go wrong
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,095	| IOT086 |	And don't pay more than 40
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:26,911	| IOT086 |	Because
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:29,727	| IOT086 |	Amazon
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,567	| IOT086 |	Best Buy in Target
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,591	| IOT086 |	So Amazon
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:38,943	| IOT086 |	And there's probably some multi packs if you buy multiple
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,039	| IOT086 |	Echo dots as well there's a deal for 6
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,551	| IOT086 |	6 /
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,087	| IOT086 |	I don't remember
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,879	| IOT086 |	One for every room into for the bedroom
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,671	| IOT086 |	Bathroom
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,975	| IOT086 |	Bathroom bathroom
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:51,999	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:56,095	| IOT086 |	I would I would up this because it's Christmas and you love his pee
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| IOT086 |	Alright so
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,679	| IOT086 |	I would say
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,471	| IOT086 |	Spring for the Philips Hue
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:05,055	| IOT086 |	Light bulb set I know there's a hug but it's the easiest one.
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| IOT086 |	It works with
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,615	| IOT086 |	Just about every
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:10,175	| IOT086 |	So that
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,199	| IOT086 |	Is
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:15,039	| IOT086 |	I believe it's $70 for starter pack with two white
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:15,551	| IOT086 |	Ambience
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,903	| IOT086 |	And actually actually I think we saw a deal
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,695	| IOT086 |	42 bulbs
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,743	| IOT086 |	Two Philips Hue bulbs with a.
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,303	| IOT086 |	Oh yeah

EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,607	| IOT086 |	Seether
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,679	| IOT086 |	That sounds right I think so
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,447	| IOT086 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:35,263	| IOT086 |	Something could so many different people
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| IOT086 |	We're terrible
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,079	| IOT086 |	We brought you these deals
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:42,687	| IOT086 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| IOT086 |	I think
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:48,063	| IOT086 |	A hundred bucks you can introduce them to the smart home Concept in a way that is
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,855	| IOT086 |	Like freaking awesome
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,647	| IOT086 |	I would recommend if you do this one
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,207	| IOT086 |	A really great way to put that into
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:58,303	| IOT086 |	Effectus put it in your bedroom and replace your bedroom table side lamps
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,327	| IOT086 |	With those bulbs
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,631	| IOT086 |	And then you've got an alarm clock
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,399	| IOT086 |	Wake up light music
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,423	| IOT086 |	You've got
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:07,519	| IOT086 |	Your news briefing in the morning and then you could be like turn off my bedroom light

EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,911	| IOT086 |	I know you guys are sick of you talking about this
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,191	| IOT086 |	And I'm not going to talk about it
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,703	| IOT086 |	After this maybe
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:41,983	| IOT086 |	Baby
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,751	| IOT086 |	Joshua
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,519	| IOT086 |	I probably will
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,311	| IOT086 |	What's this is $1,500 * 9
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,335	| IOT086 |	Can I give you the
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,103	| IOT086 |	Gimmicky pricing
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:52,991	| IOT086 |	So $1,500 now the reviews from the tech press have been impressive
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:59,391	| IOT086 |	The reviews for normal people apparently a lot of normal people had some glitches so there were glitches there and there were people who are fresh
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:16:59,903	| IOT086 |	Frustrated with their
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,207	| IOT086 |	So I don't know what to say about that
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,487	| IOT086 |	I had a great experience with
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,511	| IOT086 |	Sing and I loved it
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,303	| IOT086 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:09,119	| IOT086 |	But like the Fast Company guy he had a terrible experience
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| IOT086 |	Send
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,191	| IOT086 |	His semen took too long to cook
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:17,055	| IOT086 |	I forgot about it and he was irritated by the number of notifications although you could turn those off
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,847	| IOT086 |	It felt very different
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,895	| IOT086 |	Like his experience with
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,687	| IOT086 |	And that happens
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,991	| IOT086 |	What happens if it's a brand new product
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT086 |	You know lots of
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,319	| IOT086 |	Not moving Parts but lots of
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:33,951	| IOT086 |	Complexity unit to kind of simplify the cooking experience and some people going to have a good experience another system people
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,743	| IOT086 |	I guess so
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,047	| IOT086 |	I'm standing by it though cuz man
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,095	| IOT086 |	If I found this under the tree
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:46,751	| IOT086 |	After the show I'm going to show it to my wife and I'm going to see what she thinks cuz she's a normal
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:50,591	| IOT086 |	And she gets frustrated on my tax stuff so we'll see what she says
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,151	| IOT086 |	I'm going to have my husband Andrew
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,175	| IOT086 |	Come on the show
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,223	| IOT086 |	Talk about so you are going to here about it
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:01,855	| IOT086 |	And that's that's a big endorsement there it is
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,135	| IOT086 |	All right
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,231	| IOT086 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,535	| IOT086 |	So we talked a lot about bulbs
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,095	| IOT086 |	The past two years and
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:15,679	| IOT086 |	Now is always a good time to add more bulbs I think maybe you can get some good deals
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:22,591	| IOT086 |	I keep coming back to two brands of bulbs for my needs and I think they meet a lot of people's needs
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,383	| IOT086 |	They're not fancy
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| IOT086 |	But they do the trick
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,199	| IOT086 |	So4
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:30,527	| IOT086 |	Low cost smart connected bulbs that work with
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| IOT086 |	Just about every
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,343	| IOT086 |	Platform that I can think of
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:39,743	| IOT086 |	The cree bulbs for $15 white Cree bulbs and get them in soft white or daylight 50
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,255	| IOT086 |	$10
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:43,583	| IOT086 |	Again work with a lot of different hubs in and what not
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,399	| IOT086 |	Controlling my voice with different assistant
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:51,263	| IOT086 |	I don't think so wrong for $15 plus their LED so you know your electric bill
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,335	| IOT086 |	Also like the osram lightify
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,127	| IOT086 |	Tunable connect
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:59,711	| IOT086 |	Did bulb switch again are still white but you can tune
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:03,807	| IOT086 |	The light color the white uniform like that all the way down to
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:06,879	| IOT086 |	From soft wake up to Daylight anything in between
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:10,975	| IOT086 |	You going to pay twice the prices agree about so you had a really really want
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:15,071	| IOT086 |	Tunable bulbs for these became both birthdays are dimmable I should say so
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,143	| IOT086 |	Those are my two Bowlby pics
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,959	| IOT086 |	And just for perspective cuz I just replaced
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:21,983	| IOT086 |	6
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:25,055	| IOT086 |	Light bulbs with LED
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| IOT086 |	Much cheaper
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,151	| IOT086 |	Well
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,687	| IOT086 |	.
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,479	| IOT086 |	Yes they're cheap
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,247	| IOT086 |	But
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,015	| IOT086 |	I actually
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,831	| IOT086 |	They had for $15
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| IOT086 |	A
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,879	| IOT086 |	Sylvania
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT086 |	Not connecting
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,951	| IOT086 |	LED in the
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,975	| IOT086 |	This was a BR30
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,279	| IOT086 |	It was actually br40
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,327	| IOT086 |	Abdou BR30 was
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:47,839	| IOT086 |	1295
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,119	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,655	| IOT086 |	Just for perspective
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,679	| IOT086 |	For $15 you
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:52,959	| IOT086 |	Epic reconnect
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,543	| IOT086 |	I decided to not do that because I
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,895	| IOT086 |	I just wanted to control it from the switch for these bulbs so
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:03,455	| IOT086 |	It's not I mean you can buy cheaper light bulbs
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,991	| IOT086 |	For like
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:09,087	| IOT086 |	High-quality LEDs especially if you're going to put them against a dimmer switch
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,391	| IOT086 |	Which you really wanted to get
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,671	| IOT086 |	The higher quality
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,439	| IOT086 |	Don't
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:13,951	| IOT086 |	Don't hum
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,279	| IOT086 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:17,791	| IOT086 |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,887	| IOT086 |	For what it's worth and Anna
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,423	| IOT086 |	The best either not connected or
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:27,775	| IOT086 |	Standard LED bulbs at Home Depot last week and there are
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,055	| IOT086 |	Four packs of
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:34,687	| IOT086 |	40 and 60-watt replacements for 20 bucks of 5 bucks a bulb
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:38,015	| IOT086 |	Nice for the creases
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,551	| IOT086 |	Answer was this
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:45,439	| IOT086 |	Are the typical normal bulbs and the ER thirties and forties are down that bulbs
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:50,303	| IOT086 |	For those of you who do not speak fluent light bulb
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,071	| IOT086 |	Because why would you
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,375	| IOT086 |	Okay I'll talk
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:53,887	| IOT086 |	Emendation
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:59,519	| IOT086 |	Because I tried these this year and I love them I'm going to recommend the stack lighting
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:04,383	| IOT086 |	Even though I ultimately did not go with them because I have Hue Lights in my house
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,407	| IOT086 |	And I just wanted one
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| IOT086 |	Setopati
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,735	| IOT086 |	The stack let's have a
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:09,759	| IOT086 |	Hub
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,039	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,319	| IOT086 |	Screw in a lightbulb
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,647	| IOT086 |	And what happens is there's an ambient light sensor in there
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,928	| IOT086 |	There's a motion sensor
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:17,952	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,512	| IOT086 |	You basically when you walk in
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,072	| IOT086 |	The lights turn on and you can set the program
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,864	| IOT086 |	With these light bulbs to be like
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,400	| IOT086 |	Hey
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:29,216	| IOT086 |	I'm turning on at 100% or maybe I'm only turning on it
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,496	| IOT086 |	You know
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,032	| IOT086 |	5% because it's the middle of the day
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,824	| IOT086 |	So you can settle that way
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:36,384	| IOT086 |	What the schedule and date they learned your schedule over
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,152	| IOT086 |	OurTime
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,176	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:42,528	| IOT086 |	After a couple of days
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,576	| IOT086 |	Oh you know around this time
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:45,856	| IOT086 |	She reads a lot
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:46,880	| IOT086 |	Maybe I'll
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,416	| IOT086 |	Will not turn off the
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,184	| IOT086 |	The motion detector
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,208	| IOT086 |	Turn off the light bulbs
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,768	| IOT086 |	So these are pretty neat
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,840	| IOT086 |	I like them they're $89 for starter kit
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,936	| IOT086 |	Normal a19 bulb so that's to normal size bolts
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,496	| IOT086 |	Or $99 for a
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,264	| IOT086 |	30 kit
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:04,544	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:09,664	| IOT086 |	They don't work well in open floor plans but they do work well in laundry rooms bathrooms
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,944	| IOT086 |	Closets
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:11,968	| IOT086 |	Places like that
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:13,760	| IOT086 |	Griffin
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,064	| IOT086 |	Cool
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:22,720	| IOT086 |	Will speaking of if this then that and turning on your lights intelligently
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| IOT086 |	I'm going to recommend
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,048	| IOT086 |	For people who are interested in
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:29,376	| IOT086 |	Having your lights turn on when they get home
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,144	| IOT086 |	But without
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,168	| IOT086 |	Any interaction
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,216	| IOT086 |	Automatic Pro
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| IOT086 |	This is a little
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,568	| IOT086 |	ODB Port dongle you put in your car
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:43,200	| IOT086 |	The main intention of it is to get diagnostic data from your car but also
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,992	| IOT086 |	That's a crash alert
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| IOT086 |	System
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,784	| IOT086 |	So would you
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:52,160	| IOT086 |	Unfortunately do get in a crash it will paying the automatic Pro folks and they can reach out
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,720	| IOT086 |	How to emergency responders for you
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:23:01,632	| IOT086 |	You can keep track of where your car is located at all times with the app because again this has three
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,168	| IOT086 |	LG built-in just cool
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:07,264	| IOT086 |	And there's no subscription fee for 5 years without 3G so that's handy
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:12,896	| IOT086 |	You can't I answer if there's some that we're use of a bunch of different apps that are integrated so
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:16,736	| IOT086 |	You can say hey when I'm a half mile from the house on my way home
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:22,624	| IOT086 |	Automatic hate reach out to the nest or whatever thermostat and heat up the house cuz it's cold war
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,416	| IOT086 |	Turn on touch lights.
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,208	| IOT086 |	Not want to walk into a dark home
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:30,304	| IOT086 |	So 430 bucks it doesn't awful lot
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:33,120	| IOT086 |	Mini pottery places
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:37,728	| IOT086 |	Some of the car services that you can buy from dealers and such like OnStar and so on
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:43,360	| IOT086 |	It integrates nicely with a lot of Smart Home Products so I think $430 is not a bad deal
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,640	| IOT086 |	130 or
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,736	| IOT086 |	Not macro is 12995
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,248	| IOT086 |	Okay
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,856	| IOT086 |	All right
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,648	| IOT086 |	Let's see what else do we have
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,184	| IOT086 |	I have in the
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,952	| IOT086 |	Hit the button
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,256	| IOT086 |	Business because I love fun
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:06,144	| IOT086 |	So a lot of people are going to tell you like these flick buttons are great and they're not bad but they're Bluetooth
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,216	| IOT086 |	And I hate Bluetooth buttons because my phone is never where I think
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:09,984	| IOT086 |	I guess so
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,776	| IOT086 |	I spend
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,288	| IOT086 |	Speaker money
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,848	| IOT086 |	For the Logitech pop
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,360	| IOT086 |	Buttons
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,408	| IOT086 |	These are $99 a button
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,456	| IOT086 |	They're made from Logitech so
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,272	| IOT086 |	It's a legit company that we've all heard up
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,576	| IOT086 |	And you basically
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| IOT086 |	You assign
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:28,672	| IOT086 |	Tasks to a certain type of button press and then you
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,488	| IOT086 |	It works
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,792	| IOT086 |	That's all it does
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:36,608	| IOT086 |	You can do anything you can program
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,376	| IOT086 |	Which is kind of cool
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,656	| IOT086 |	Yeah so like
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,960	| IOT086 |	You can program it to turn lights on and off
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,264	| IOT086 |	And you can stick the button like on your bedside table
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:50,432	| IOT086 |	You can also have it connect to maybe like some sort of Health and Wellness tracker and every time you drink a glass of water you feel
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:52,480	| IOT086 |	Glass of water you can just leave it by the fridge
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:52,992	| IOT086 |	Puppet
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,064	| IOT086 |	With Addison that you can just say
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,856	| IOT086 |	Hey everytime I pop this this way
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,368	| IOT086 |	This happens
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:01,952	| IOT086 |	So there's a lot of like cool fun things
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,720	| IOT086 |	Basically
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,000	| IOT086 |	Just a button
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,792	| IOT086 |	You can tell it to do anything
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:08,608	| IOT086 |	I love in this is why I love buttons
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,400	| IOT086 |	Because I'm a very tactile person
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,424	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,960	| IOT086 |	That is a fun gift
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,984	| IOT086 |	Especially if you
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,496	| IOT086 |	Do you have someone in your life
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| IOT086 |	Quotes
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:22,944	| IOT086 |	So if you have people in your life who lose things all the time there are number Bluetooth
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,736	| IOT086 |	Tracking devices that you can get
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,552	| IOT086 |	And I got hooked up I think cuz you mentioned it
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,832	| IOT086 |	Yeah we have a CEO in our show
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:31,648	| IOT086 |	Exit the tractor folks right so
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:36,000	| IOT086 |	The trackr Bravo is is small it's like the size of a quarter
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,280	| IOT086 |	Probably twice the
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,072	| IOT086 |	The thickness of a quarter
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,632	| IOT086 |	Nothing more than a Bluetooth tracker
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,168	| IOT086 |	You can get
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:47,776	| IOT086 |	1 for $30 but I would say take a look at the five packs and they even have
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,056	| IOT086 |	Higher quantities as well
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| IOT086 |	5 pack
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,872	| IOT086 |	You can get them for $18 each
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,896	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,480	| IOT086 |	This you can attach the keys put in a wallet stick it in a
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:01,600	| IOT086 |	Purser a Gadget Bag and anytime you can't find whatever the item is
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:08,000	| IOT086 |	You know you're going to your Tracker app and then I can where might it be where was it last seen and if it's close by
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:13,376	| IOT086 |	And even have a Tracker make a sound so so yeah so the trackr Bravo you know again a 5-pack
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:18,496	| IOT086 |	You can stock up on him give one to everybody in your family and hopefully they will never lose anything again
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:24,896	| IOT086 |	So here's another little pro-tip for you can actually get your tracker Bravo's monogrammed
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,664	| IOT086 |	Weather
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,176	| IOT086 |	You get it
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,456	| IOT086 |	A laser
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:27,968	| IOT086 |	Is it laser printer
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,528	| IOT086 |	You guys are etched
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,832	| IOT086 |	Design or whatever on it so if you're like
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,624	| IOT086 |	You're thinking of like hosting
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:37,184	| IOT086 |	Maybe not party this is kind of an expensive party favor
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:46,400	| IOT086 |	But if you're looking for a gift
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,960	| IOT086 |	Here's a useful product
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:51,008	| IOT086 |	Maybe they'll be like the USB
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,056	| IOT086 |	2002
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,080	| IOT086 |	17
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,616	| IOT086 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:57,152	| IOT086 |	King of tracking
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,456	| IOT086 |	One of my gifts
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:26:59,968	| IOT086 |	Recommendation
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,784	| IOT086 |	Is the circle router
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:08,416	| IOT086 |	It's really not a router is a device you plug into your router is from Disney
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| IOT086 |	And basically
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:16,608	| IOT086 |	It's $99 and it lets you offer parental controls but not just like hey turn off this device
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:19,680	| IOT086 |	This time it actually let you see and control the apps your child
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,752	| IOT086 |	Warriors bow sight
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,032	| IOT086 |	I guess if they don't have a
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,544	| IOT086 |	Privileges
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,824	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,616	| IOT086 |	I think this is a really kind of
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:34,016	| IOT086 |	Compelling device for somebody who is really concerned about what their child is getting into online
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,296	| IOT086 |	Maybe it's just like you know what kid
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,600	| IOT086 |	You don't need to spend 9 hours a day
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,624	| IOT086 |	Instagram
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,928	| IOT086 |	Let's take it down a notch
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,512	| IOT086 |	It's really simple you just plug it into your Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,024	| IOT086 |	And it's
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,888	| IOT086 |	That's really all I have
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,400	| IOT086 |	How to say about that
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:53,472	| IOT086 |	Cool I have one last item it's not
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:58,080	| IOT086 |	Smart it's not connected but it is saved my bacon so many times
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,616	| IOT086 |	But I think it's worth
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,384	| IOT086 |	Mentioning
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:05,760	| IOT086 |	When we have we live in Northeast and we have storms we often have power outages and
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,320	| IOT086 |	No power is no fun so
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:12,160	| IOT086 |	Couple years ago I bought something and it's still available
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,696	| IOT086 |	It's actually cheaper now
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,488	| IOT086 |	It is a small
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,024	| IOT086 |	Solar
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,048	| IOT086 |	Battery
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,072	| IOT086 |	Set
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,352	| IOT086 |	That is
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:23,168	| IOT086 |	Useful as all heck in these kind of emergencies
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:28,288	| IOT086 |	Set of small 15 watt solar panel pretty minutes it's not big at all it's not the kind of solar panel you put on
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,848	| IOT086 |	It's kind of like putting a window or
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,872	| IOT086 |	But outside you know
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,688	| IOT086 |	I mean things probably 18 in wide
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,456	| IOT086 |	And foot
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,224	| IOT086 |	Deep
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,528	| IOT086 |	It plugs into this charging base
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:41,344	| IOT086 |	And in the charging base there's a 54 watt hour battery
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:44,160	| IOT086 |	Laptop charging base also has
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:49,024	| IOT086 |	Two USB ports as well as to other 12 volt Outlets
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:52,864	| IOT086 |	And the set also comes with an LED light that plugs into one of those Outlets
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,144	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:57,984	| IOT086 |	I constantly use the sun to keep the battery in the same charge
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:00,032	| IOT086 |	And anytime you have an outage
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:03,872	| IOT086 |	We plug-in phones we use the little LED light
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:08,480	| IOT086 |	It's just so handy to have and it's a hundred and fifty bucks I think I paid
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,272	| IOT086 |	229 4
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:13,856	| IOT086 |	It's actually it actually comes from a company called FedEx International
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,904	| IOT086 |	Any create Solar Products for
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,952	| IOT086 |	Regions of the world that just don't have
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:20,256	| IOT086 |	Electric infrastructure in Grid
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,840	| IOT086 |	So this is how they bring electricities places but again
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,864	| IOT086 |	I bought
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:25,888	| IOT086 |	For here because it just
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,192	| IOT086 |	It just made sense and it is
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:29,472	| IOT086 |	Easley paid for itself
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,520	| IOT086 |	A number of times so it's $150
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:34,080	| IOT086 |	Fenix readyset solar is the name of it
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,360	| IOT086 |	Nice
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,944	| IOT086 |	Here's a gift idea for a child
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,480	| IOT086 |	Because
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:41,248	| IOT086 |	We love children here
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,296	| IOT086 |	There's tons of robots in
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,856	| IOT086 |	Cool things out there I leave y'all to that but
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,416	| IOT086 |	If you really want to push your child
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:50,464	| IOT086 |	I'm going to recommend the Kano computer kit
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:56,608	| IOT086 |	I love this thing my daughter actually loves to sing this is a computer consisting of a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:58,912	| IOT086 |	And your kids basically build it themselves
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,704	| IOT086 |	Am I billed at themselves
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,984	| IOT086 |	Basically they plug in all the
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:07,616	| IOT086 |	They take the board they take the attached like the little speaker
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,128	| IOT086 |	Attachment
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,920	| IOT086 |	Is building it in
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,944	| IOT086 |	The most nominal size
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,504	| IOT086 |	That's the word but it's fun it lets kids
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,528	| IOT086 |	How to see how things work
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:20,416	| IOT086 |	And they get like this instant sense of accomplishment and then they can get on there and play Minecraft and learn to code
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,976	| IOT086 |	And you know do all kinds of fun things
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:28,096	| IOT086 |	So it is a Black Friday deal so it's 9999 right now
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,144	| IOT086 |	Sr850
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:31,680	| IOT086 |	Now
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,472	| IOT086 |	It doesn't come
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,520	| IOT086 |	With a monitor so you have to plug it into it
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,056	| IOT086 |	The TV your
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,592	| IOT086 |	An existing monitor that you have
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,128	| IOT086 |	If you want
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:43,712	| IOT086 |	They have a computer kit bundle that's $240
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,736	| IOT086 |	It does come with a monitor
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,016	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,088	| IOT086 |	It's a little storage case so they can
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:49,856	| IOT086 |	It's like there
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,368	| IOT086 |	A little laptop case
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:54,208	| IOT086 |	I love this my daughter really enjoyed it
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,232	| IOT086 |	I
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,048	| IOT086 |	Maybe it's cuz I'm a nerd but
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:00,608	| IOT086 |	I really like
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,216	| IOT086 |	Yeah sounds great
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:08,032	| IOT086 |	And I think that's it that's it
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,312	| IOT086 |	Did we consult gifts
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| IOT086 |	We said we did
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,664	| IOT086 |	Are there any other Black Friday deals we wanted
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:20,064	| IOT086 |	You shouldn't pay more than $200 for a nest 3rd generation
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:20,576	| IOT086 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,648	| IOT086 |	They're 199 all over the place
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,720	| IOT086 |	Keep an eye on that your Amazon Echo is
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,488	| IOT086 |	Is 140
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,024	| IOT086 |	At Best Buy
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:34,400	| IOT086 |	Sew-in I bet Amazon's going to have it cheaper Amazon currently also has
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,448	| IOT086 |	Tap on sale
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,728	| IOT086 |	For like 80 bucks
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,520	| IOT086 |	In tap is there little speaker that
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:46,176	| IOT086 |	You press the button down it's the battery power right it's not always listening I have one for outside usage on the deck I love it
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:46,688	| IOT086 |	There you go
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,480	| IOT086 |	Absecon
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| IOT086 |	A smoking deal on that
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,808	| IOT086 |	Also
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:57,696	| IOT086 |	Here's here's some fun other deals The Nest cam at Best Buy is going to be 150 so that's
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| IOT086 |	$50 less
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:58,976	| IOT086 |	This Is the End
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,560	| IOT086 |	And I'm excited about this one because
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,864	| IOT086 |	I actually have these in love them
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:06,400	| IOT086 |	The Arlo cameras
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,680	| IOT086 |	AR
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:10,752	| IOT086 |	34994 a four pack
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:16,640	| IOT086 |	At least they require you to have a hug
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,176	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:19,200	| IOT086 |	Do you know if your
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:19,712	| IOT086 |	If your Kevin
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,040	| IOT086 |	But everybody else will be happy
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:29,952	| IOT086 |	I don't like I've I've now suggested like for gifts that come with the Hub so
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:36,096	| IOT086 |	Buy switch to exactly
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:36,864	| IOT086 |	Maybe two
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,192	| IOT086 |	8 Port switch I like the TV
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:45,568	| IOT086 |	Okay so the Arlo's are normally 499 for a packet
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:48,384	| IOT086 |	403-4944
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,664	| IOT086 |	These are great
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:52,992	| IOT086 |	They do require batteries are low this year released
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,016	| IOT086 |	Rechargeable version
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,808	| IOT086 |	So if you're
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:33:00,928	| IOT086 |	Not wanting to if you really want the rechargeable version because saving $150 on these cameras
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:04,256	| IOT086 |	You know what then spending so much on batteries is not your thing that's cool
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,560	| IOT086 |	A word of advice
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,888	| IOT086 |	We suck one of our Arlo's up in a tree
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:13,984	| IOT086 |	Which was great from a visual perspective and getting a grape
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:18,592	| IOT086 |	In a bird's-eye view of the home it's terrible for having to replace or even recharge the batteries
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:19,872	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,896	| IOT086 |	Just keep that in mind
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:24,480	| IOT086 |	All right I think that's pretty good
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:25,760	| IOT086 |	That we've given people a lot of
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,296	| IOT086 |	Things to buy
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,832	| IOT086 |	Yes we have
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,880	| IOT086 |	So go go spend that money
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,184	| IOT086 |	Going to stop
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:36,256	| IOT086 |	Stay tuned for a message from our sponsor and after that
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,304	| IOT086 |	Stay tuned for vboo
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:42,400	| IOT086 |	Norbit who is the CEO of beta
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:48,800	| IOT086 |	Everyone this is Stacey Higginbotham breaking into this week's podcast with a word from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:49,312	| IOT086 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:54,176	| IOT086 |	With us today is Van Kruger who is VP of us operations at
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,200	| IOT086 |	Akasya Network
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:55,968	| IOT086 |	Fan
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,760	| IOT086 |	What is cassia do in
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,296	| IOT086 |	Why do you use Bluetooth
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,624	| IOT086 |	Casting Networks we make the first
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,928	| IOT086 |	Extended range Bluetooth router called the cassia hub
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,976	| IOT086 |	Really focused on making
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,768	| IOT086 |	Bluetooth better
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:12,864	| IOT086 |	And trying to help it become the ideal in a protocol for the internet
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:20,032	| IOT086 |	And the way that we're doing that are they were extending the range up to a thousand feet or also an eagle
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:23,360	| IOT086 |	Multiple devices to be controlled at the same time
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:26,176	| IOT086 |	22 devices at the same time or in broadcast
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:30,272	| IOT086 |	No draxie able to hear and listen to hundreds of devices at the same time
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:34,624	| IOT086 |	Brussels able to control those devices when we're not on the same local network
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,416	| IOT086 |	Still making
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:39,744	| IOT086 |	Bluetooth really the ideal protocol for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:41,792	| IOT086 |	Because you connect to so many things
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:43,584	| IOT086 |	I imagine the interoperability
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,096	| IOT086 |	Is very important
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:49,728	| IOT086 |	Most definitely that's another reason you know we work with the Bluetooth Sig and Bluetooth technology
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:52,288	| IOT086 |	Different sample in Ark SE
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,312	| IOT086 |	Consumer products
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:56,640	| IOT086 |	It lets you stay paired and connected up to 22 devices
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,920	| IOT086 |	Add an extended range
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:04,832	| IOT086 |	Which allows you to control your Bluetooth devices from your favorite spot in any room
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,880	| IOT086 |	You know in that language is Lucci
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,672	| IOT086 |	I mean along with cassia and
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:11,488	| IOT086 |	He also takes interoperability as seriously as we do
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:16,352	| IOT086 |	Are big on collaboration and you know as one of the 3000 member companies
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,400	| IOT086 |	Do we have the opportunity to share knowledge
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:22,752	| IOT086 |	Contribute to the development of the new Bluetooth features and functionality
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| IOT086 |	And why is that collaboration
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:32,224	| IOT086 |	You know working with the Bluetooth Sig and using Bluetooth technology
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:32,992	| IOT086 |	Apsara products
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:38,624	| IOT086 |	I guess it's the ability to shape the future of the smart home and you know smart Enterprises well
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:42,208	| IOT086 |	6 goal in which is our goal as well
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,512	| IOT086 |	Is to make the iot accessible to everyone
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:50,400	| IOT086 |	Unique features of Bluetooth you notes Ubiquiti interoperability and open structure
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,448	| IOT086 |	Make it possible for secret easy
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,472	| IOT086 |	Acure products forecast
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:57,568	| IOT086 |	Participating updates to technology units also important to us
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:02,688	| IOT086 |	And things like increase range speed broadcasting capacity you know Bluetooth 5
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,736	| IOT086 |	Eventually there will be standardized nest
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,016	| IOT086 |	As well
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:08,832	| IOT086 |	And you know really in a possibility are Limitless
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:10,624	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:14,720	| IOT086 |	Right now you know we're building some new Bluetooth router Cena specifically for the Enterprise
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:18,304	| IOT086 |	Yeah they're meant to connect even more devices in our consumer products
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,608	| IOT086 |	Applications like medical devices
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,376	| IOT086 |	Hospitals
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,424	| IOT086 |	Elderly Care Homes
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,264	| IOT086 |	You know or multiple speakers and spaces like restaurants and hotels

EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,136	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:47,904	| IOT086 |	Help them
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:51,232	| IOT086 |	Build some of the retail efforts on the softer side
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,000	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:55,328	| IOT086 |	Start learning about how difficult it is for
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,096	| IOT086 |	Bakers
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:58,144	| IOT086 |	You know our manufacturers people to make products
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,192	| IOT086 |	To get into stores
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,728	| IOT086 |	Madden stores
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:02,240	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,032	| IOT086 |	Provide a compelling
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:05,312	| IOT086 |	Experience for
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:08,128	| IOT086 |	Their product especially in Connect devices
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,664	| IOT086 |	Very strongly bad
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:10,432	| IOT086 |	The way to
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,456	| IOT086 |	Approached
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,992	| IOT086 |	Selling a
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:15,296	| IOT086 |	Hubbard Park today is to take out the box
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| IOT086 |	Provided MO
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,344	| IOT086 |	Tavistock member who has
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:24,256	| IOT086 |	The app on the device so they can show you how it works and so we felt like the best thing to do to solve this problem was actually go out
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:28,608	| IOT086 |	Stop round store we open one in Palo Alto about a year ago called Data V8
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:33,984	| IOT086 |	The number 80 a two more that we are launching this year in Santa Monica
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:38,080	| IOT086 |	And in University Village in Seattle
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,152	| IOT086 |	Put stuff in Egypt
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,944	| IOT086 |	Yes exactly
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:48,832	| IOT086 |	Sao Paulo x 80 products in the holiday season how about 90 and then our new stores are twice as big
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:53,952	| IOT086 |	Santa Monica have almost a hundred sixty connected products every store is different and it really depends on
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,280	| IOT086 |	What these makers believe is going to work in those locations
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:59,072	| IOT086 |	And for those of us who are not
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:38:59,840	| IOT086 |	Santa Monica
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,376	| IOT086 |	Or Seattle
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:01,888	| IOT086 |	Or Palo Alto
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:07,008	| IOT086 |	Wake me at Austin it sounds like you guys just did a deal where I might see some beta gear
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,520	| IOT086 |	In other place

EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,656	| IOT086 |	Unfortunately you still have to be in California to try and
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:37,984	| IOT086 |	Curses I'm shaking my fist at the sky in frustration
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,520	| IOT086 |	All right
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,032	| IOT086 |	One day
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,056	| IOT086 |	One day this is
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:44,128	| IOT086 |	There you go
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:45,408	| IOT086 |	So
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:48,736	| IOT086 |	I actually brought you here because this is our special Thanksgiving
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:51,296	| IOT086 |	Episode where we're going to be talking about
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,832	| IOT086 |	What should I give my loved ones for the holiday
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:58,208	| IOT086 |	I also wanted you to come on and talk about the future of retail and to give me a sense of what
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:03,072	| IOT086 |	Kind of Trends we can look forward to in the space because you probably see a lot of really neat stuff
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,096	| IOT086 |	Way ahead of the rest of us
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,400	| IOT086 |	Yeah I would be happy to
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:09,984	| IOT086 |	Well let's get started with kind of the future of retail so you guys
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:16,384	| IOT086 |	Have a very interesting business model and then you also have you use a lot of sensors and you understand pretty well how people are
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,408	| IOT086 |	Interact with the product
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:20,736	| IOT086 |	I'd love to know like is that something that would work beyond what you
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:23,808	| IOT086 |	One way to ensure conceptualize what we're doing is
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:25,856	| IOT086 |	Taking the same Concepts
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:28,416	| IOT086 |	Of iot and applying it to an entire
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:31,488	| IOT086 |	Physical store so you can think of our store is a big iot object
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,024	| IOT086 |	In the sense that it has sensors
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,840	| IOT086 |	It's connected to the internet at all times
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:38,912	| IOT086 |	And it's sort of a vehicle for picking up data and
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:42,496	| IOT086 |	And also being able to be manipulated
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:44,800	| IOT086 |	Free software absolutely we
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:47,104	| IOT086 |	You know we always thought retail
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:47,872	| IOT086 |	As a whole
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:52,480	| IOT086 |	Needed to change and not just for connect devices but we really like the space
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:54,016	| IOT086 |	Because our customers
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:41:00,416	| IOT086 |	And you rarely mention we have a different business model to our customers are actually the people who make products day it's a super simple business model
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,696	| IOT086 |	They subscribe
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:03,232	| IOT086 |	Two space in stores
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,024	| IOT086 |	And we send 100% of
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| IOT086 |	Sales tax
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,584	| IOT086 |	Tibet company.
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:08,096	| IOT086 |	Next
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:11,680	| IOT086 |	The challenge with retail today is not just that it's
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:15,008	| IOT086 |	Hard to get into if you're a very small company of Say You're Just a product off a
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:18,336	| IOT086 |	Kickstarter or Indiegogo it's that once you get into
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:20,640	| IOT086 |	The store if your product is sitting in a box
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,432	| IOT086 |	Kind of lifeless on a Shelf
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,200	| IOT086 |	And
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:27,040	| IOT086 |	This is by far the most common way that we still see every product
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:30,112	| IOT086 |	Merchandising. Customers are not going to
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,928	| IOT086 |	Interested and that was like the most basic
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:35,232	| IOT086 |	Something that we felt like every products
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:36,000	| IOT086 |	Needed
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:39,584	| IOT086 |	And you guys also give the data on sales
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,352	| IOT086 |	Back to
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,376	| IOT086 |	The customer so
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:45,472	| IOT086 |	The maker of the product knows like that X number of people got a demo on this in
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:45,984	| IOT086 |	Annex number
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:49,568	| IOT086 |	Which is actually pretty unusual in the space right
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:50,848	| IOT086 |	Yashow retail
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,128	| IOT086 |	Is changing really quickly
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:55,455	| IOT086 |	And when people coming to stores today they don't always walk out
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:56,223	| IOT086 |	With the Box
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,527	| IOT086 |	Read that moment you know we've all done this I do this
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:00,575	| IOT086 |	We walking to
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:06,719	| IOT086 |	Store and lock her name any names we see a product that we think is interesting and the first thing we do is we take the phone out of her pocket
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:08,255	| IOT086 |	And we load up Amazon
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:09,535	| IOT086 |	And WeChat
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,559	| IOT086 |	And see if the price
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:11,327	| IOT086 |	There is better
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:12,351	| IOT086 |	Oftentimes
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:15,679	| IOT086 |	It is sometimes more convenient to get the product
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:17,983	| IOT086 |	Assertive same-day delivery tour
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:21,055	| IOT086 |	Delivered in 2 days to your house or maybe you're buying it
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:23,359	| IOT086 |	Real still are stores or two monitors
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,639	| IOT086 |	Everything that's happening
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,151	| IOT086 |	Outside of
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,943	| IOT086 |	Justice sales with me also
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:28,479	| IOT086 |	Tracking UPS
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:31,039	| IOT086 |	Easy then what we want to understand is
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:36,159	| IOT086 |	How many people are actually learning about your product in the store are they engaging with it who is engaging with it
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,463	| IOT086 |	You know how it like you said how many demos are we
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:40,511	| IOT086 |	Providing of that product as well and
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:42,047	| IOT086 |	What categories are doing
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:44,607	| IOT086 |	Really well also has four categories
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:46,399	| IOT086 |	So we have connected home
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:47,167	| IOT086 |	We have
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:47,935	| IOT086 |	Connected play
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,215	| IOT086 |	We have
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:51,519	| IOT086 |	Future of Transportation which is
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:55,615	| IOT086 |	Maybe things like electric skateboards and bikes and we have sense
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:43:00,223	| IOT086 |	Which is a category of augmented reality wearables virtual reality
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:04,831	| IOT086 |	Are new stores launching actually have built-in audio and virtual reality
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:05,599	| IOT086 |	Rooms
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,367	| IOT086 |	So weird
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:12,767	| IOT086 |	We're going very deep into those categories want to make sure that people like you are trying the Oculus Rift for the first time or not bumping into other customers
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:15,071	| IOT086 |	Person like the chaos of a normal store Department
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,143	| IOT086 |	I think
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:18,911	| IOT086 |	Like all of
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:19,935	| IOT086 |	Retail it
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:20,703	| IOT086 |	Really depends
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:25,311	| IOT086 |	A lot on season if you look at our data from all year long
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:27,359	| IOT086 |	Connected play has been a really big
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:33,759	| IOT086 |	Deal for us and certainly in December last year we opened that was a really hot category I think we have a lot of
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:36,063	| IOT086 |	Adults who walk in and want to buy things for kids
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,855	| IOT086 |	In the summer we noticed
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:39,647	| IOT086 |	Connected home was doing very well
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,415	| IOT086 |	So I think
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,695	| IOT086 |	We've got like
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:44,767	| IOT086 |	I would say wearables what the Temptation is
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:45,535	| IOT086 |	Really
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,559	| IOT086 |	All year long
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,095	| IOT086 |	Certainly
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:52,447	| IOT086 |	Electric skateboards are going to sell the summer and maybe not in a cold place where people can't use them
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:55,007	| IOT086 |	But wearables are
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,543	| IOT086 |	I've done pretty well we're not
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,567	| IOT086 |	You'll have a whole
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:58,847	| IOT086 |	Pelota wearables today
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:02,943	| IOT086 |	I'm a lot of them are made by very large companies that we tend to focus on
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,503	| IOT086 |	The small ones who are getting the first cancer retail
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,271	| IOT086 |	Ibotta
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:07,807	| IOT086 |	I bought the spire
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:12,415	| IOT086 |	Been a lot of self-improvement devices and
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:15,231	| IOT086 |	Like anything there's no magic there you have to
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,255	| IOT086 |	Want to improve in
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:22,399	| IOT086 |	And actually be proactive and they can just help you keep you on track but certainly like was firing
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:27,007	| IOT086 |	Upright posture trainer which has been a hot seller for us you got to put in the effort the device can only catch
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,775	| IOT086 |	Pictures of horror
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:28,543	| IOT086 |	True

EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,439	| IOT086 |	$25 I think
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:47,487	| IOT086 |	We definitely SKU I think
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:52,607	| IOT086 |	C-products little bit more expensive than we do have some affordable options but a lot of the suggestions that I have
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,375	| IOT086 |	Today are
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,679	| IOT086 |	Between 200 and
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,447	| IOT086 |	$3,000
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:01,311	| IOT086 |	This is not a pipe

EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:07,967	| IOT086 |	All right will let's start with the most expensive just so I can
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:09,503	| IOT086 |	Level set here
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:10,783	| IOT086 |	Couple months ago
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:13,087	| IOT086 |	This is the part that we do not carry it beta unfortunately
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,927	| IOT086 |	We hope to hell months ago Microsoft made their hololens
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,463	| IOT086 |	Available
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:20,767	| IOT086 |	For anyone to buy a developer

EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:33,055	| IOT086 |	If I'm thinking about
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,335	| IOT086 |	Someone who

EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,551	| IOT086 |	I believe it's $3,000
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:45,855	| IOT086 |	And it's a headset that I put on and then I
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:47,903	| IOT086 |	Grar
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:50,719	| IOT086 |	Basically you put the headset on and
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:54,047	| IOT086 |	It's got this clear piece of glass that covers your eyes
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:55,839	| IOT086 |	You can still see the world and
