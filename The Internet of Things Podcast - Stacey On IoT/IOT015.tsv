EDL	00:00:03,840	00:00:10,240	| IOT015 |	Hey everybody is Stacy haiduk
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:11,008	| IOT015 |	Bothell man
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:14,848	| IOT015 |	Kevin tofel and you are listening to The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:19,712	| IOT015 |	And this week we are going to be talking about the first thread chips coming on the market
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:22,784	| IOT015 |	Beauty connecting oil wells in the Gulf
EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:24,064	| IOT015 |	And let's see
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:26,624	| IOT015 |	A brand new lighting project that I've got started
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:28,160	| IOT015 |	When did my house that you guys are going to love
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:29,952	| IOT015 |	It will have our guest
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:32,000	| IOT015 |	Who is Andrew Farah the CEO of
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:34,304	| IOT015 |	A company called density IO
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:36,352	| IOT015 |	Which is making a
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:37,120	| IOT015 |	People counting
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:40,704	| IOT015 |	So stay tuned for all of this and more
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:42,240	| IOT015 |	The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:45,824	| IOT015 |	Alright Kevin so how was your fourth of July
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:47,872	| IOT015 |	It was nice little
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:54,272	| IOT015 |	Quieter than usual for some reason to the neighbors decided not to light up things after 10:11 which is awesome
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:56,064	| IOT015 |	Really light up as in fireworks or light up
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,344	| IOT015 |	Set something on fire
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:59,648	| IOT015 |	Of Noah stay away from
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:04,512	| IOT015 |	Setting things on fire here but know the fireworks yeah usually don't go till midnight or what not
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:07,840	| IOT015 |	Are two cats in the dog goes crazy and whatnot but
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,376	| IOT015 |	No it's nice and quiet
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:12,960	| IOT015 |	You know I was looking at the videos of people sticking fireworks on drones
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:13,728	| IOT015 |	Switch
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,240	| IOT015 |	You know
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,800	| IOT015 |	It's a bad idea
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,080	| IOT015 |	Don't it does destroy your
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:21,920	| IOT015 |	You know there's a lot of connected
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,200	| IOT015 |	Fireworks
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:23,968	| IOT015 |	Kind of things out there
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:27,040	| IOT015 |	I was trying to think of what I could do related to
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:27,808	| IOT015 |	Connected
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:29,088	| IOT015 |	Devices fireworks
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:34,208	| IOT015 |	The best I could come up with was like chromecasting some some YouTube videos of
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,488	| IOT015 |	Cool firework shows
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:41,376	| IOT015 |	Yeah I can't see many opportunities there I should have thought about I should have powered up the Drone and it has it
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,704	| IOT015 |	Capture on video the fireworks here in the neighborhood
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:46,496	| IOT015 |	I'm a relatively safe distances
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,520	| IOT015 |	Calorie content to look at
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:51,360	| IOT015 |	So that would have been cool alright so aerial view of fireworks
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,408	| IOT015 |	From a relatively safe
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:53,920	| IOT015 |	Distance
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:56,224	| IOT015 |	So yeah
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:02:00,064	| IOT015 |	I say readers but listeners let us know if you can come up with any cool
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:05,952	| IOT015 |	Connected angles for the 4th of July maybe next year we'll do something along that line
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,464	| IOT015 |	Reasonable
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,488	| IOT015 |	And then say
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT015 |	I was like from a safety
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,328	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| IOT015 |	This week
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,632	| IOT015 |	We'll get started with some news bits
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,680	| IOT015 |	The Red Witch
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:18,240	| IOT015 |	For those of you guys who are unfamiliar with it which is
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,264	| IOT015 |	It's probably most of you
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:24,640	| IOT015 |	Thread is a new wireless protocol for the internet of things that nest
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,664	| IOT015 |	Silicon labs
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| IOT015 |	Freescale and
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:30,784	| IOT015 |	Big Ass Fans and some other companies have come up with
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:34,624	| IOT015 |	It is basically, it's a Mesh networking standard
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,648	| IOT015 |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,184	| IOT015 |	Well it uses the same
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| IOT015 |	Wireless layer is zigbee basically
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,024	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:47,424	| IOT015 |	That was going to introduce last year we've all been waiting to see what it's going to look like and what it's going to be like and
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:52,288	| IOT015 |	Creepy cat company that makes sippy chips that are in cable boxes
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,360	| IOT015 |	They've announced that they have a
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,920	| IOT015 |	Zigbee / thread compatible chip
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,456	| IOT015 |	That will be
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| IOT015 |	Sibling
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,784	| IOT015 |	And will be coming out
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| IOT015 |	In volume
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,112	| IOT015 |	Which means in large quantities
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,648	| IOT015 |	At the end of the third quarter
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,672	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:11,744	| IOT015 |	Sounds like we should start anticipating
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,024	| IOT015 |	Thread devices
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| IOT015 |	Very soon
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,816	| IOT015 |	Well actually not very soon
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,864	| IOT015 |	By the end of the year because
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,144	| IOT015 |	The Silicon is finally coming out
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:24,544	| IOT015 |	Very cool you know it's funny that you bring this particular news bit up because over the weekend I was thinking
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,616	| IOT015 |	About Smart Homes and connectivity particular
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,640	| IOT015 |	And let you know what
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,432	| IOT015 |	I went around my house and we
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:33,248	| IOT015 |	I'm just going to say that we have way too many TVs in this house
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,320	| IOT015 |	That's the only issue entirely for another show but
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:38,880	| IOT015 |	Isn't going around in like all these things have Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,928	| IOT015 |	Why could they not
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,000	| IOT015 |	Be like repeaters for my network and or
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,048	| IOT015 |	Contribute to a mesh Network for this morning
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,096	| IOT015 |	You know why not put these
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,656	| IOT015 |	Chips the zigbee chips and someone right in the TV is because
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,520	| IOT015 |	How many TVs do people have a man sure I'm not the only one that has you on multiple TVs in the house
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,312	| IOT015 |	I don't know I only have
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,640	| IOT015 |	But I know
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,152	| IOT015 |	Wechat
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,432	| IOT015 |	We're not like
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,992	| IOT015 |	Now that's a good thing
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,784	| IOT015 |	I only have three people in my
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,856	| IOT015 |	And you have like dogs cats chilled
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,136	| IOT015 |	I don't know
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:14,464	| IOT015 |	Are the kids all have their own TVs and then I'll be honest
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:18,815	| IOT015 |	The dog goes like to watch pets TV on FiOS but that doesn't mean to get this on TV
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,887	| IOT015 |	Poor poor abused puppy
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,191	| IOT015 |	So yeah that would be great
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,471	| IOT015 |	Except for Wi-Fi is not a mess
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,519	| IOT015 |	They don't have no no right
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,079	| IOT015 |	Wright would have to be an additional chip
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| IOT015 |	Protocol one
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,919	| IOT015 |	Communication methods such as big bang what's red so
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,991	| IOT015 |	So for those of you guys who were like sitting here is still going
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,271	| IOT015 |	Stacy your explanation
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,039	| IOT015 |	The thread did nothing for
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,623	| IOT015 |	It's basically Wilkins
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| IOT015 |	Repeat with
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,415	| IOT015 |	Zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:50,559	| IOT015 |	It is a Mesh networking standard the key to it the two things that are most important and all that thread is its
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:51,839	| IOT015 |	Low power
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,423	| IOT015 |	It is mesh which means it communicates like
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,983	| IOT015 |	Point to point to point to point as opposed to Lake
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,567	| IOT015 |	Well that's a terrible description of him
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,359	| IOT015 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,407	| IOT015 |	Which device talks to one another
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,991	| IOT015 |	How's that as opposed to going
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,503	| IOT015 |	From one device
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,623	| IOT015 |	Listen to Kevin I can see it in my head
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,439	| IOT015 |	Directly
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,487	| IOT015 |	To the internet using IPv6
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,559	| IOT015 |	Allure power version of IPv6 but that's
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,583	| IOT015 |	That's really what
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| IOT015 |	Importing those three things
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,143	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:30,239	| IOT015 |	Bluetooth actually is probably going to be but isn't yet the nearest
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,007	| IOT015 |	Competitor
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:31,775	| IOT015 |	The thread
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,311	| IOT015 |	And in the years ahead
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,615	| IOT015 |	That's what you're going to be looking for
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:41,247	| IOT015 |	Most companies who are building things for the smart home have already started referring to zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,551	| IOT015 |	Escort Legacy Networks
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:47,391	| IOT015 |	And they're looking for thread and Bluetooth mesh
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,671	| IOT015 |	To become kind of
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,951	| IOT015 |	The next gen thing
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:54,303	| IOT015 |	There you go that's your little 411
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:59,167	| IOT015 |	And the thread standard isn't actually even finalized yet so I'm amazed that there's going to be silica
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,935	| IOT015 |	And it's actually happy
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,447	| IOT015 |	But hey
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,495	| IOT015 |	That that happened with Wi-Fi
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,543	| IOT015 |	Why why not have it happened with
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,079	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,103	| IOT015 |	That's happening
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:12,735	| IOT015 |	Let's move on to other cool things little quick news brief is this week
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,247	| IOT015 |	Okapi
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:19,903	| IOT015 |	The ecobee3 that's homekit certified is actually selling an Apple Stores and on its website as of now
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,439	| IOT015 |	Today
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:24,255	| IOT015 |	That's worth noting because even though
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:29,375	| IOT015 |	Homekit devices record Encore announced last month or the month before actually this point
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,655	| IOT015 |	If it's July
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,703	| IOT015 |	Priori Kobe's are not home
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,775	| IOT015 |	Compatible we've established that I believe a few weeks ago right
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:39,359	| IOT015 |	Yes so if your ecobee cost 250 issues
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,895	| IOT015 |	249 99
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,455	| IOT015 |	That's your homekit certified ecobee look for it
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:48,063	| IOT015 |	But the cheaper 229 ecobee is probably not home
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:48,575	| IOT015 |	Get certified
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,647	| IOT015 |	So don't feel like you're getting a smoking hot deal
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT015 |	If you want
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,695	| IOT015 |	The home kitchen
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,487	| IOT015 |	Patient if you don't want this to homekit
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,511	| IOT015 |	The right ahead
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,815	| IOT015 |	So that
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| IOT015 |	That's kind of worth noting
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,655	| IOT015 |	What's the other little news bits I'm trying to think
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,191	| IOT015 |	I got nothing
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,983	| IOT015 |	So we'll go straight into kind of
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,543	| IOT015 |	A topic that has been weighing on my
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,639	| IOT015 |	It actually have news related to its over so we can sort of
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:15,199	| IOT015 |	Do a less graceful Segway now that I
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,759	| IOT015 |	Messed it up utterly
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,271	| IOT015 |	But
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,831	| IOT015 |	BP the oil and gas company
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,623	| IOT015 |	You may have heard of them
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:29,023	| IOT015 |	They are connecting there oil wells so this is an industrial internet-of-things application day of
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,303	| IOT015 |	Signed a deal with
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,327	| IOT015 |	GE
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,375	| IOT015 |	To connect oil rigs
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,911	| IOT015 |	Instrumentation
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,447	| IOT015 |	Kenneth are doing it so they can
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,007	| IOT015 |	Real-time monitoring and
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,543	| IOT015 |	Basically
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,103	| IOT015 |	GE is going to connect
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,407	| IOT015 |	650
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,479	| IOT015 |	British Petroleum RBP swells
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,503	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,063	| IOT015 |	Is part of the first pilot project
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:56,927	| IOT015 |	And as part on each well R4 all 650 these Wells they're going to have about five
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| IOT015 |	100000 sensors
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:02,303	| IOT015 |	And they're grabbing all the data they can
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,839	| IOT015 |	And they're going to update
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,143	| IOT015 |	From those centers every 15 seconds
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,679	| IOT015 |	So that's
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,215	| IOT015 |	4 times a minute
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,287	| IOT015 |	500000 sensors giving you
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:16,639	| IOT015 |	Half a million sensors giving you a lot of data 4 times a minute
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,735	| IOT015 |	It's mostly time series data so we'll think about things like
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,063	| IOT015 |	Temperature pressure inside the well so it's basically like
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,599	| IOT015 |	At this time temperature was X
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,903	| IOT015 |	Very small it's not Big Data
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:31,999	| IOT015 |	The total data that are thinking about is about 8 GB
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:37,375	| IOT015 |	It's a day so it's not huge but figuring out how to manage all that do something with it is kind of their neck
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:37,887	| IOT015 |	Next big challenge
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| IOT015 |	They're probably
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,727	| IOT015 |	Have been monitoring certain
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,031	| IOT015 |	Aspects of the oil rigs for forever
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:49,919	| IOT015 |	Son wondering where's the value in it yet I'm not sure I see it but that doesn't mean it's not worth while for them to do
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:57,087	| IOT015 |	The curious to see what they come up with on this so what they have done in the past is they've had their own homegrown software
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,647	| IOT015 |	We're monitoring there oil wells for the past 10 years
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,207	| IOT015 |	What they're doing now is there
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,767	| IOT015 |	Basically doing more of it more often
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:12,447	| IOT015 |	They're doing a pilot project with 650 Wells but by the end of next year they'll have 4,000 Wells so all of their way
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| IOT015 |	Wells connected
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,751	| IOT015 |	And the idea is
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,823	| IOT015 |	Make better decisions so
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,127	| IOT015 |	Maybe they'll see up in the
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,455	| IOT015 |	Off the coast of England and Norway
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,551	| IOT015 |	Pumping conditions are at this pressure
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,087	| IOT015 |	That's what you should strive for
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:33,439	| IOT015 |	So it'll help them make future decisions based on the historical data then
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,719	| IOT015 |	Yes and
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,535	| IOT015 |	Don't know how to react to things like in real-time like weather
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:39,583	| IOT015 |	You know
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| IOT015 |	Is this like the best time
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,703	| IOT015 |	And I don't know what chemicals they use to live
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| IOT015 |	Extract oil in house
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,567	| IOT015 |	But that you're not you're not a geophysics
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:52,127	| IOT015 |	Experteer I don't understand
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,783	| IOT015 |	She's a former geophysicist but I on the other hand
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,367	| IOT015 |	You weren't expecting that we're you Kevin
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:02,879	| IOT015 |	I was not
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,415	| IOT015 |	You got me on that one
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:08,255	| IOT015 |	So I think that's really fascinating because it is
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:13,119	| IOT015 |	I mean it's it's industrial use for the internet of things and we don't see a lot of
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,191	| IOT015 |	Use cases for that right now that people are really talking about
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,751	| IOT015 |	And I get a lot of
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:25,151	| IOT015 |	People who in this gets into my topic Dushore which is I got a lot of people who kind of downplay the value of the
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,687	| IOT015 |	The consumer Internet of Things
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| IOT015 |	Enter telling me that
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:28,991	| IOT015 |	Stacy
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,527	| IOT015 |	Why are you so
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,575	| IOT015 |	Freaking worried about
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,879	| IOT015 |	The smart Homer why are you so
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,183	| IOT015 |	Hot on researchkit in
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,207	| IOT015 |	The consumer Internet of Things
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,487	| IOT015 |	Because
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,023	| IOT015 |	Industry is where matter
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,351	| IOT015 |	I don't agree with that one but
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,655	| IOT015 |	It matters in books that at just to be clear
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,935	| IOT015 |	Exactly
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,983	| IOT015 |	Play so well and I agree so
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,823	| IOT015 |	But I think it's worth a discussion because I think there is a lot
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,919	| IOT015 |	There's a lot of value to be had in the industrial internet-of-things and there's a lot
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,735	| IOT015 |	If you look at the internet of things as a marketing term
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:04,063	| IOT015 |	Right so I was wonderful podcast about the internet
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,599	| IOT015 |	Things right Kevin
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,367	| IOT015 |	Video
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,927	| IOT015 |	And you know you could argue that that's just a marketing term
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,487	| IOT015 |	First like this hot topic that everyone's talking about
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,327	| IOT015 |	But we're really talking about freeing up data
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,863	| IOT015 |	From all
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| IOT015 |	Blocks of life that we haven't really
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:23,519	| IOT015 |	Had access to before so in BP's case it's the exact time
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:29,919	| IOT015 |	Temperature and pressure deep in the ocean for the oil wells and then again at the sensor in the ability to get that information
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,199	| IOT015 |	Every 15 seconds
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,503	| IOT015 |	And to do it basically really cheaply
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:34,783	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,599	| IOT015 |	When you have that what can you do with it
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,391	| IOT015 |	And that's really what the Internet of Things
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| IOT015 |	In the same thing is
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,999	| IOT015 |	Premier solar panels that is also General
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,047	| IOT015 |	Zebra showing me
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,351	| IOT015 |	At what what day did you get with real-time data
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:52,959	| IOT015 |	So I have a system called in Layton it's a little web server that
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:58,079	| IOT015 |	Gets information from all 41 of my solar panels in real-time over the power lines
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,383	| IOT015 |	And I can find out
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,919	| IOT015 |	To the second
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:07,039	| IOT015 |	How much energy is being produced by each individual panel of the panels all together
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,831	| IOT015 |	I can find out.
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,903	| IOT015 |	Historical basis how much reproduce today
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:15,743	| IOT015 |	I can see what how the weather affected the panels at various points in time
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,559	| IOT015 |	I'm so basically all that production data
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| IOT015 |	Steven
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,143	| IOT015 |	Just to take us all a step further say
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,167	| IOT015 |	Perhaps the best
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:26,239	| IOT015 |	Scenario for Internet of Things is the
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:29,311	| IOT015 |	Intersection of consumer and Industrial
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:32,383	| IOT015 |	So you take my solar panel data to see much I'm producing
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:36,735	| IOT015 |	You take the curb system which we looked at last week or you talked about last week that measures how much
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:40,063	| IOT015 |	Power is being consumed at the circuit breaker level
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,343	| IOT015 |	And perhaps the
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,647	| IOT015 |	Utility company can say hey we can
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| IOT015 |	Better
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:49,791	| IOT015 |	Put our mix power out there for certain people who aren't using lot of power now and so on and so forth
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,559	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,375	| IOT015 |	You got to have the consumer of all with that or it just doesn't work
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,655	| IOT015 |	And that is
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,679	| IOT015 |	Exactly my
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,007	| IOT015 |	I think there's a lot of value in the near-term
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,335	| IOT015 |	For connecting devices inside man
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:02,847	| IOT015 |	Manufacturing up
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,383	| IOT015 |	Industrial app
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,431	| IOT015 |	Operations and using that data
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:10,783	| IOT015 |	Just to make your performance more efficient so like exactly what we're talking about BP in GED
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,343	| IOT015 |	I think
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,903	| IOT015 |	Long-term in big picture
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,207	| IOT015 |	Something like taking your solar panel data
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,767	| IOT015 |	And time that back to you
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,047	| IOT015 |	Production even
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| IOT015 |	For these guys
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| IOT015 |	Well we just had
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:28,703	| IOT015 |	I don't know 700 new houses come online
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,007	| IOT015 |	This area of the country
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:35,359	| IOT015 |	Maybe we don't need to produce as much or even send as much you know
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:35,871	| IOT015 |	There
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:38,175	| IOT015 |	Those are the kind of things that
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:42,783	| IOT015 |	Will be made possible and you can only do that with connected consumer device
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,319	| IOT015 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,343	| IOT015 |	Exactly in fact
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:49,695	| IOT015 |	I was just thinking back to the curb day that you would show me right before the show because you got it installed now
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,743	| IOT015 |	You can see for example
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,303	| IOT015 |	Each individual client
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:14:00,703	| IOT015 |	Practically how much power is using at various points in the day how much it cost etcetera you give that data to the electrical
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:03,263	| IOT015 |	Company and they can be monitoring saying you know what
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:07,359	| IOT015 |	You might want to go and replace this particular Appliance because
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:11,967	| IOT015 |	I can bet you at least 5 to 10 years old is not energy star etcetera
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:15,039	| IOT015 |	And now you've actually got a feedback loop that says hey consumer
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:21,183	| IOT015 |	By giving us this day to you can we can give you smarter purchase decisions to save you money
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:26,303	| IOT015 |	Exactly now I'm not going to talk about the curb just yet I'm actually going to wait probably another week or two so
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| IOT015 |	Blisters
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:31,935	| IOT015 |	Hold up because I want to have this device to my house for a little bit longer and play with it and get
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,983	| IOT015 |	Can I have a little bit more used to it before I
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,543	| IOT015 |	Subject you to the thoughts on it
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:40,895	| IOT015 |	I spilled the beans I'm sorry
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,711	| IOT015 |	And then we'll talk about it a little bit
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:48,063	| IOT015 |	But yeah I'm actually excited because when I start reviewing gadgets I can actually
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| IOT015 |	Start telling p
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,879	| IOT015 |	Hey by the way this actually
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,927	| IOT015 |	According to my data cost
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,255	| IOT015 |	$0.50 a week to run
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,023	| IOT015 |	Which
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,047	| IOT015 |	You might be like
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,583	| IOT015 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:00,863	| IOT015 |	Yay
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,935	| IOT015 |	I don't care but what if something cost you know
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,471	| IOT015 |	What if I start looking at like
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:10,079	| IOT015 |	A bunch of you know connected cameras and one cost $5 a week
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,871	| IOT015 |	Iran versus the rest that are all
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,663	| IOT015 |	50 Cent
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:18,015	| IOT015 |	Or if you want to determine if it's worth the money to change out the lights in your house
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:22,367	| IOT015 |	Which is a great segue and we're going to
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,695	| IOT015 |	A Bissell Bissell actually brr
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,975	| IOT015 |	5 minutes
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| IOT015 |	Review
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,535	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,327	| IOT015 |	Because I am obsessed
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,399	| IOT015 |	And with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,423	| IOT015 |	Captain understatement
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,239	| IOT015 |	I have come by to my two favorite things
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,031	| IOT015 |	Into
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,591	| IOT015 |	Is Stacy
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,871	| IOT015 |	Lighting price
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,151	| IOT015 |	Voice activated lighting
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,431	| IOT015 |	Farragut
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,223	| IOT015 |	For those of you guys who don't
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:51,039	| IOT015 |	You can use the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:51,551	| IOT015 |	2
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,391	| IOT015 |	Control Philips Hue and WeMo products today
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:57,439	| IOT015 |	And I have
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:00,511	| IOT015 |	Had it controlling my Philips Hue Lights in my living room
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:04,607	| IOT015 |	But those who lights are $60 above for the
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,631	| IOT015 |	BR30
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,679	| IOT015 |	For the big BR30 flood light
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:12,031	| IOT015 |	But I have those globe lights throughout my house and I I just
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,567	| IOT015 |	I love being able to tell
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,847	| IOT015 |	The echo to turn off my
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:15,871	| IOT015 |	NetSpend
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:20,223	| IOT015 |	I've been waiting for Philips or
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,015	| IOT015 |	Anyone really
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| IOT015 |	To produce a
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,623	| IOT015 |	That's white light
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,927	| IOT015 |	And connected that would work with the Philips Hue system
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,719	| IOT015 |	And I found one
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,767	| IOT015 |	It is the GE
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:37,119	| IOT015 |	Link light bulbs that were designed to work with the wink system
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:44,287	| IOT015 |	So the GE link lights you guys may be familiar cuz the a19 came on the scene at $15 a bull which is like
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,055	| IOT015 |	Freaking
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,335	| IOT015 |	Low and unheard-of
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,615	| IOT015 |	So the
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,151	| IOT015 |	BR30
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,687	| IOT015 |	Are actually
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,711	| IOT015 |	$20
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,527	| IOT015 |	They also have some par38 flood
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,575	| IOT015 |	That are
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,599	| IOT015 |	$25 Apple
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,671	| IOT015 |	All much cheaper than the Philips
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:06,047	| IOT015 |	All much cheaper than what I would assume would be about $30 for a white only
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,607	| IOT015 |	BR30 from Philips but that does not
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:15,007	| IOT015 |	I went out I bought six of those to replace all the current lights in my kitchen
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT015 |	And so that is
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| IOT015 |	What does if you guys who
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,127	| IOT015 |	Are not great at math that's a hundred and twenty bucks
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:24,223	| IOT015 |	Witcher like holy moly Stacy all this for voice control
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| IOT015 |	I will tell you
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,527	| IOT015 |	It works
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,343	| IOT015 |	The steps to making this work
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,879	| IOT015 |	Install the light bulbs
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,159	| IOT015 |	Turn him on
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,439	| IOT015 |	You
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:35,743	| IOT015 |	Go to the shoe app you search for new lights
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,559	| IOT015 |	If found all of mine no problem
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,351	| IOT015 |	And then
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,911	| IOT015 |	Once those are in there you can name them whatever you want
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,215	| IOT015 |	And then you go to
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:45,727	| IOT015 |	Your Echo
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,543	| IOT015 |	And you say Alexa discover new
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:49,567	| IOT015 |	Devices
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,895	| IOT015 |	And then you hit the button on your Philips Hue Bridge
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:59,295	| IOT015 |	And then Alexa discovers them then you group them however you want a group binding to both the kitchen setting and then I grouped all of my life
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,319	| IOT015 |	Accentuate downstairs
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,623	| IOT015 |	And then
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,159	| IOT015 |	Your business
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| IOT015 |	That's all it takes
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:10,303	| IOT015 |	If that's that's pretty good that's a nice way to save some money but yet add the
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:14,143	| IOT015 |	Connected white bulbs here the link bulbs needed the wink
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,191	| IOT015 |	Cabin and RV label
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:22,847	| IOT015 |	They're so there's any bulbs that RHA 1.2 compliant which means they work with the huge cyst
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,127	| IOT015 |	Perfect
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,151	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| IOT015 |	I tested it out
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,479	| IOT015 |	Before I actually had
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| IOT015 |	And a night
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,551	| IOT015 |	Tensor normal-looking bulb
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,343	| IOT015 |	Hanging around so I tested out
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,111	| IOT015 |	Before I went outside
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| IOT015 |	120 buck
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:37,695	| IOT015 |	Sure but
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:41,535	| IOT015 |	So let's talk about the cost because with the curb
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:45,119	| IOT015 |	I was able to see that I was spending $0.04 an hour
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:48,191	| IOT015 |	On the 6 incandescent lights that I had
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,727	| IOT015 |	Old school belts
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| IOT015 |	Old school balls
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:57,151	| IOT015 |	And so that's not that much it's like $0.24 a day if you use them for 6 hours a day which is about what I would
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,223	| IOT015 |	Corte Madera
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| IOT015 |	But now
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,575	| IOT015 |	My usage is actually gone to zero
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,111	| IOT015 |	It's not even
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:07,903	| IOT015 |	Not even a
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:11,487	| IOT015 |	So I actually thought that was pretty cool
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,535	| IOT015 |	And I add my cost analysis
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| IOT015 |	It's going to take
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:17,631	| IOT015 |	If I assume 6 hours a day
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,935	| IOT015 |	The 365 days so every day of the year
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,239	| IOT015 |	It's like 88 bucks a year that I'm say
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:31,967	| IOT015 |	Pretty good and those and these are the bulbs that'll last me know 20 plus years I can take say 22.8 years based on 3 hours per day so
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,015	| IOT015 |	Even if you do 6ou
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,063	| IOT015 |	Half of that is 11.4 years so
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,087	| IOT015 |	They're going to be around forever
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,623	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,647	| IOT015 |	I can dim them
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,975	| IOT015 |	That's nice too
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,767	| IOT015 |	So all in all
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,047	| IOT015 |	I'm really satisfied
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,375	| IOT015 |	The only the minor quibble I will have in
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:51,167	| IOT015 |	People who are very design-conscious are going to
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:54,495	| IOT015 |	I don't know if you like this or not some people were probably like it
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,543	| IOT015 |	The GE Link light bulbs
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,591	| IOT015 |	Instead of having the opaque
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:01,663	| IOT015 |	Top to the light bulb frosted color
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,199	| IOT015 |	Frosted glass
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,735	| IOT015 |	They are totally
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,575	| IOT015 |	Clear they do look funky date they look a little funky I kind of like them
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| IOT015 |	But
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,391	| IOT015 |	My husband is kind of like
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,207	| IOT015 |	It's like a modern-day Edison bulb
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,743	| IOT015 |	It is and
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:19,839	| IOT015 |	You know you can see the little spots for the LED when
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:20,351	| IOT015 |	If you look up
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,887	| IOT015 |	They're very bright
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,447	| IOT015 |	I'd like the light quality
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:28,031	| IOT015 |	Victim very well in cleanly there's no flickering
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,055	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:33,151	| IOT015 |	I'm really sold I'm really excited so if anyone else is sitting there going
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:37,759	| IOT015 |	Man I really want to talk to more lights in my house but I don't want to spend 60 bucks a bulb
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,551	| IOT015 |	You don't have to you don't have to
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:43,391	| IOT015 |	You can spend 15 for the normal a19 the wink bulb
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:47,487	| IOT015 |	You could spend 30 for the Philips a19 in white
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,023	| IOT015 |	Or you could spend
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:52,351	| IOT015 |	What tea and get the floods from the GE wink
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,631	| IOT015 |	What are the GE link
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,911	| IOT015 |	Line
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:58,495	| IOT015 |	And this may actually push me to get that Echo after all cuz I was kind of
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:04,383	| IOT015 |	Moaning about that the new price
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,711	| IOT015 |	You know what don't get the
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:12,831	| IOT015 |	I want to see Echo wait till it works with insteon and then maybe you'll install
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,416	| IOT015 |	I'll probably be moved by then
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,952	| IOT015 |	Better then I'll mail you the app
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,768	| IOT015 |	Oh there we go
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| IOT015 |	I'll send you an egg

EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,824	| IOT015 |	Because you're basically
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,872	| IOT015 |	You're counting people
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,688	| IOT015 |	Inside public places is that a good way to think of it
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:14,528	| IOT015 |	Yeah we essentially are have people counter and an API
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:17,344	| IOT015 |	It's kind of that I think the simplest way to describe what density does
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:19,648	| IOT015 |	I'm going to I'm going to help you out a little bit
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,160	| IOT015 |	Because you
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| IOT015 |	You guys offer a sensor that
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,256	| IOT015 |	Is placed on Doors
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,536	| IOT015 |	Restaurants
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:29,120	| IOT015 |	Public places any sort of building that has a door week
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,400	| IOT015 |	Papa density sensor on a
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,424	| IOT015 |	And then
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,960	| IOT015 |	That data
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:33,984	| IOT015 |	Basically
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:37,824	| IOT015 |	What essentially make that available so what we work with
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,104	| IOT015 |	We recently installed
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,896	| IOT015 |	Indoor frames
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,200	| IOT015 |	To measure bi-directional movement in real time
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:47,808	| IOT015 |	Typically will partner with another tech startup like a point-of-sale system
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:51,392	| IOT015 |	What does distribution to these cafes restaurants and bars already
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,952	| IOT015 |	And we'll install the hardware for free
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,768	| IOT015 |	And then we'll license the real time
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,328	| IOT015 |	Put traffic data back to that point of sale system more
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,888	| IOT015 |	Or directory like Yelp or Foursquare
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,656	| IOT015 |	I like
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:05,216	| IOT015 |	You guys so much because I'm a huge believer
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,264	| IOT015 |	That when we have
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| IOT015 |	Access about
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,848	| IOT015 |	People in places we can do
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:13,920	| IOT015 |	Cool things like you guys launched a consumer Apple while back
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:18,016	| IOT015 |	It was like Hey are there too many people in this coffee shop or is now a good time to go
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,600	| IOT015 |	All the way up to hey is it a good time for me to go wait in line at the DMV
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,136	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:23,904	| IOT015 |	Excited
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| IOT015 |	But
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:28,768	| IOT015 |	You have the score thesis when you guys were developing density
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:31,840	| IOT015 |	He had four points and I'd like you to talk about those four points really
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,144	| IOT015 |	Sure
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,448	| IOT015 |	We really want to see the movement across the entire city
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:41,568	| IOT015 |	I just kind of just started with our favorite coffee shop we just wanted to see how busy our favorite coffee shop was
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,360	| IOT015 |	And we thought there was already
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,640	| IOT015 |	Technology to solve the problem
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,712	| IOT015 |	And there wasn't so that quickly became
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| IOT015 |	Well let's build something and then
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:53,344	| IOT015 |	It was well for your builder for this coffee shop why don't we build it for all of Tokyo
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,624	| IOT015 |	The problem with that is
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:57,696	| IOT015 |	In order to turn on Tokyo you have to figure out massive distribution
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,720	| IOT015 |	Intuit otherwise
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,000	| IOT015 |	Largely disconnected
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,512	| IOT015 |	Set up business
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:03,840	| IOT015 |	Cafes bars restaurants they don't all go to
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,912	| IOT015 |	Museums in or go to South by Southwest and then like adopt the ladies
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,192	| IOT015 |	Piece of software
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,728	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:12,544	| IOT015 |	This was a distribution problem as much as it was a
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,080	| IOT015 |	Hardware and
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:14,848	| IOT015 |	Signal processing
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:18,688	| IOT015 |	So instead of building a giant inside sales team
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,224	| IOT015 |	We essentially wanted to
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:22,528	| IOT015 |	Partner with companies who could do the distribution
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,808	| IOT015 |	On our behalf and we could help them
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,880	| IOT015 |	But in order to do distribution without public outcry
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,672	| IOT015 |	The system had to be
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,208	| IOT015 |	Real-time accurate
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:30,976	| IOT015 |	Anonymous
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,768	| IOT015 |	Cheap desert kind of r410a
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:37,888	| IOT015 |	It was too expensive it would be too hard to do distribution if it wasn't accurate the data wouldn't be relevant
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,680	| IOT015 |	And if it invaded someone's privacy
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,496	| IOT015 |	You know we we saw some some pretty interesting things happen
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,568	| IOT015 |	With Nordstrom and and they're pink
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,104	| IOT015 |	Euclid analytics provider
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,896	| IOT015 |	They're doing Mac address tracking
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:52,736	| IOT015 |	Consumer backlash and then the provider got ripped out of Nordstrom as a result
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:58,112	| IOT015 |	So we wanted to avoid that insofar people seem to be totally okay with an anonymous people counter
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:01,184	| IOT015 |	Sure I like the idea of an anonymous people count
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,744	| IOT015 |	And I'm kind of interested
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,048	| IOT015 |	It in this idea because
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:12,960	| IOT015 |	Do you think we are at a point given their like beacons are kind of coming into play so beacons are these Bluetooth
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,496	| IOT015 |	Choose kind of devices that
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,776	| IOT015 |	Retailers can put in
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,568	| IOT015 |	Their stores
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,360	| IOT015 |	The track people
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,896	| IOT015 |	Via an app on their phone
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:21,920	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:29,088	| IOT015 |	There's an argument to be made that if you install a Retailer's app on your phone your kind of opting into being trapped in the store
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,600	| IOT015 |	Buy pecans
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,136	| IOT015 |	Is that kind of a
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,696	| IOT015 |	Fair thing to do I know that's not what Nordstrom was doing
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,464	| IOT015 |	Euclid
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,768	| IOT015 |	So I think there's a couple things one is
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,304	| IOT015 |	Beacons are often
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,608	| IOT015 |	You know by virtue of downloading an application
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,144	| IOT015 |	And allowing Bluetooth
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT015 |	To work
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:45,216	| IOT015 |	On that phone or two notice begins
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:48,800	| IOT015 |	And then physically being in the store and leaving Bluetooth turned on
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,104	| IOT015 |	Those are all different points that you can
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,616	| IOT015 |	Opt out of the
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,408	| IOT015 |	I think the biggest concern
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,432	| IOT015 |	Right now
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,736	| IOT015 |	Tends to be in like the facial recognition
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:00,832	| IOT015 |	Side of things and a little bit lesson to Beacon and that's just because I can't
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:03,136	| IOT015 |	Turn off or stop
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:08,768	| IOT015 |	A video camera from recognizing my face and turning That Into You No data that gets consumed or 2 better marketing
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| IOT015 |	Oh you're jumping ahead CIA
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:19,008	| IOT015 |	If it's okay I was I was going to say our beacons preparing us for being tracked so getting us used to this idea
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| IOT015 |	Retailers in
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:25,152	| IOT015 |	Maybe people who own stadiums are tracking Us in public places in even getting us
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,200	| IOT015 |	Used to this idea of getting
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,528	| IOT015 |	Like a coupon or some sort of digital good
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:33,088	| IOT015 |	In exchange for giving up our location
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,160	| IOT015 |	Yeah I think it's interesting because
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,952	| IOT015 |	103 in short Navy
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,488	| IOT015 |	But I
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:44,352	| IOT015 |	Really think that Bluetooth is still struggling boo two companies are still struggling to figure out
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,632	| IOT015 |	Like the Great
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,168	| IOT015 |	Killer context-aware app
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,752	| IOT015 |	When you look at the Bluetooth like Beacon Market
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:53,312	| IOT015 |	And the startups in companies that are involved in that it
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:56,128	| IOT015 |	It's very heavily advertising marketing
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:56,896	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| IOT015 |	Retail dollars
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:01,504	| IOT015 |	Trying to drive coupons or discounts or whatever else.
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,296	| IOT015 |	Consumers to advertise to them better
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,856	| IOT015 |	And I assume
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:08,672	| IOT015 |	Amazing technology around the corner
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:12,512	| IOT015 |	Take a DNA but Bluetooth but I'm not quite sure that deacons have yet
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,536	| IOT015 |	Can I get on that
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:19,680	| IOT015 |	I don't I don't think coupons are red I mean do you have you hit head up Bluetooth coupon yet
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:20,960	| IOT015 |	I have not I mean
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,752	| IOT015 |	So I will confess
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:25,312	| IOT015 |	To everybody that I actually clip paper coupons
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:28,128	| IOT015 |	And still use them because it's
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:28,640	| IOT015 |	Easy and
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:35,040	| IOT015 |	My God sometimes it's like a whole dollar off when you're buying like toilet paper
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,088	| IOT015 |	Coyote
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| IOT015 |	I am digitally Savvy but I'd like
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,184	| IOT015 |	My God
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,208	| IOT015 |	It's like funny
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,744	| IOT015 |	Right there for the taking
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:47,072	| IOT015 |	But yeah I guess I've use like a Starbucks app kind of
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,352	| IOT015 |	Coupon but none of the
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,376	| IOT015 |	Bluetooth related
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,144	| IOT015 |	Unzip Safari
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,192	| IOT015 |	They're asking too much
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| IOT015 |	Quesadilla
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:53,984	| IOT015 |	42 little
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,008	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,288	| IOT015 |	Maybe that's
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:00,896	| IOT015 |	I got an example of one that I wish existed
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,944	| IOT015 |	Whitney's China internet
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,248	| IOT015 |	I want around the world with
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,016	| IOT015 |	Your Bhajan
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,808	| IOT015 |	Pretty consistently and I live in San Francisco
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:12,672	| IOT015 |	I don't have a car so I'm doing grocery shopping or I'm going to a restaurant to get something to eat
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,976	| IOT015 |	Sometimes I encounter a television
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,256	| IOT015 |	That the community
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,792	| IOT015 |	Lake behind the bar behind
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,328	| IOT015 |	You know whoever serving
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,888	| IOT015 |	It'll be like a newscaster
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,448	| IOT015 |	Are you a sports game or something like that and I'm listening to NPR
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:28,800	| IOT015 |	On my phone and I would love for my phone to recognize
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,824	| IOT015 |	That TV
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,896	| IOT015 |	And to be able to tune in briefly to the audio
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:35,200	| IOT015 |	I think that's like so cool but
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,992	| IOT015 |	It's going to take a long time before
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:37,760	| IOT015 |	As possible
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:40,832	| IOT015 |	I'll see if delineated actually worked out we could be
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,368	| IOT015 |	We could be living in that world
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,672	| IOT015 |	What is DLNA
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,208	| IOT015 |	DLNA was actually a
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,744	| IOT015 |	It was a
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:52,352	| IOT015 |	Standard for communications between consumer electronics goods from back in like
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:53,888	| IOT015 |	The late 90s
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,168	| IOT015 |	And it was
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,704	| IOT015 |	Failure because
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:03,360	| IOT015 |	Everyone implemented it their own way and know to DLNA devices work together the way they were supposed to and it was
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:04,896	| IOT015 |	Is a big sad thing
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,176	| IOT015 |	But
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:09,760	| IOT015 |	Basically the standard it just required everything to be a little too smart
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,528	| IOT015 |	And that was
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,040	| IOT015 |	Its downfall
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,064	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,624	| IOT015 |	But that's where things could have been enabled under
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:16,160	| IOT015 |	Fatso
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:19,744	| IOT015 |	Okay maybe we'll get all trying to do something like that.
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,768	| IOT015 |	That could possibly happen
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,304	| IOT015 |	Using like all play
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| IOT015 |	Okay yeah
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:24,864	| IOT015 |	I like that idea though
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,680	| IOT015 |	That the free idea guys
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:29,472	| IOT015 |	Somebody take it build it
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,264	| IOT015 |	Do it so let's go back to
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,568	| IOT015 |	Kind of this idea of privacy
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,848	| IOT015 |	Because you brought up facial Rec
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,616	| IOT015 |	Recognition
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,944	| IOT015 |	That is probably outside of beacons in Wifi track
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:45,088	| IOT015 |	Facial recognition feels like very much the future and I'm talking to a lot of startups that are offering
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:48,160	| IOT015 |	Computer vision on a chip basically
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:51,488	| IOT015 |	To do facial recognition and people counting
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,280	| IOT015 |	For public places
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,584	| IOT015 |	And this is true this does kind of freak people out a little
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,888	| IOT015 |	But it also feels
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,168	| IOT015 |	Inevitable
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:00,448	| IOT015 |	It does feel inevitable
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,216	| IOT015 |	Also
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,776	| IOT015 |	So explain to me kind of how you guys might
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:04,288	| IOT015 |	Compete against
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:08,128	| IOT015 |	Well I'll kind of economy uses the most energy
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:10,176	| IOT015 |	Christine startup in that space I think it's placemeter
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,760	| IOT015 |	I believe you actually may have written an article about them recently
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:21,952	| IOT015 |	The vehicle company they just released a new sensor I think it's called a sensor but I'm pretty sure it's a video camera
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,744	| IOT015 |	Start of a small video camera
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:28,352	| IOT015 |	And then they do the computer vision processing directly on the device and then send up
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:31,936	| IOT015 |	The raw data which is definitely a good way to avoid
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:34,496	| IOT015 |	Some of the issues of ministering faces
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,032	| IOT015 |	I think the issue though is
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:39,104	| IOT015 |	It's going to be tough to install a video camera in
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,920	| IOT015 |	Millions of bars cafes and restaurants
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,712	| IOT015 |	Museums in otherwise
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,480	| IOT015 |	NN have
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,808	| IOT015 |	Users any be okay with the fact that their faces are are
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,344	| IOT015 |	Constantly being tracked
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,136	| IOT015 |	That said
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,440	| IOT015 |	There is a market difference between
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:58,048	| IOT015 |	Being tracked online and being tracked in the real world and we've seen legislation already
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,328	| IOT015 |	Start to move towards
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:04,704	| IOT015 |	Really not being okay with tracking people in the real world and I think he recently the
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,216	| IOT015 |	BFF
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,240	| IOT015 |	Orem
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:08,288	| IOT015 |	Some in a major
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,312	| IOT015 |	Consumer advocate
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:10,336	| IOT015 |	Walk out of talk
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,384	| IOT015 |	With some of the companies that are using
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:18,784	| IOT015 |	Facial recognition technology to to drive advertising you know what I'm talking about Stacy there were several companies
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,832	| IOT015 |	Was the effd
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:23,136	| IOT015 |	Center for democracy and a couple of other
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:26,464	| IOT015 |	Groups walked out of it was at the Department of Commerce
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,488	| IOT015 |	Was holding kind of
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:31,840	| IOT015 |	Talks for industry self-regulation about using facial recognition
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,352	| IOT015 |	Take action
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:37,984	| IOT015 |	Did walk out because the basically felt like the industry wasn't
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,008	| IOT015 |	They weren't considering any
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,824	| IOT015 |	Right and I think it's that kind of
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,104	| IOT015 |	Damn the torpedoes
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,176	| IOT015 |	Concept that is going to make it hard for the technology to take hold
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:52,064	| IOT015 |	I personally don't want my face to be stored by whole bunch of sensors I think the technology is probably inevitable but
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,368	| IOT015 |	I think it's going to be hard to turn into a consumer product
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:57,952	| IOT015 |	Very soon because most of the buyers of that data are
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:59,744	| IOT015 |	Another big retail there
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:03,328	| IOT015 |	Their day researchers their financial technology firms
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,096	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,400	| IOT015 |	Consumers don't like it when their data gets to
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:08,704	| IOT015 |	To go to the prophet Civ of some larger Corp
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:11,520	| IOT015 |	So inept that picks up an interesting question though
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:14,080	| IOT015 |	Cuz there's there's a couple things that are interesting about
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,384	| IOT015 |	Using video or facial recognition
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,664	| IOT015 |	1 is
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,456	| IOT015 |	Wow
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:23,296	| IOT015 |	Placemeter sells a video sensor and then they have their algorithms
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,088	| IOT015 |	Or a video camera
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,624	| IOT015 |	You could argue that
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:32,256	| IOT015 |	Their distribution which is one of the things you're struggling with her you're attempting to do or to
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,048	| IOT015 |	That's a terrible word
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,144	| IOT015 |	Cure attempting to optimize with
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,680	| IOT015 |	Using
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,448	| IOT015 |	Achieve
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:43,008	| IOT015 |	Real-time accurate an anonymous kind of
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:43,776	| IOT015 |	People counter
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:46,336	| IOT015 |	They're already able to do because
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:49,152	| IOT015 |	Video cameras are kind of everywhere
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,968	| IOT015 |	So if you could find a way to
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:52,992	| IOT015 |	Create like an algorithm
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,528	| IOT015 |	The process data
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:57,856	| IOT015 |	Maybe on the sensor light placemeter
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,160	| IOT015 |	That's one place to do it but you could also do it
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:06,048	| IOT015 |	You know on premise or you can send it up to the cloud which would be a lot more bandwidth-intensive
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,864	| IOT015 |	Distribution could almost be taken care of for you
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,936	| IOT015 |	We're not at a point where things are open like that yet
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,240	| IOT015 |	That's also conceivable
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:18,336	| IOT015 |	Yeah I mean the infrastructure is certainly already there you have surveillance cameras in
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:21,408	| IOT015 |	The number of surveillance cameras that are in the United States is staggering
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,200	| IOT015 |	This point I think though
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:26,528	| IOT015 |	They initially began with just plug a sin
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:29,344	| IOT015 |	To when you're in techstars just plug it into your
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:32,416	| IOT015 |	You don't give us your feed your data feed
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:32,928	| IOT015 |	State UK
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:34,976	| IOT015 |	Video camera
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:40,352	| IOT015 |	Yeah and then also you can use like an Android phone and will pay you to put it in your window
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,888	| IOT015 |	But I think ultimately
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:45,472	| IOT015 |	It's going to be challenging to get really granular like in house
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:46,240	| IOT015 |	Data
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:47,776	| IOT015 |	And a lot easier to get
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:48,544	| IOT015 |	Like
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,824	| IOT015 |	City street data
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,616	| IOT015 |	I think you can make this point that
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:55,968	| IOT015 |	At some point the data inside of a room becomes a little bit more challenging to know
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,528	| IOT015 |	Which I think is kind of what we're focused on what we don't really
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,808	| IOT015 |	Count cars
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,368	| IOT015 |	Or people pedestrians walking pasta
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:05,440	| IOT015 |	The window dressing where we're more interested in capacity within a location
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,208	| IOT015 |	Until
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:06,976	| IOT015 |	But I don't know
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,512	| IOT015 |	I think there's room for both Technologies
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:12,096	| IOT015 |	I will also say though the market for a little bit different and thereafter
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:14,400	| IOT015 |	Larger retailers and researchers
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,192	| IOT015 |	And I think we're much more focused on
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,240	| IOT015 |	Distributions Tech startups
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,080	| IOT015 |	So let's talk about that because
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:25,152	| IOT015 |	I think in some of our previous conversations you
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,200	| IOT015 |	Kind of made a really good
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,736	| IOT015 |	Point that I think a lot of
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:32,064	| IOT015 |	Kind of connected device startups or Internet of Things startups
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,088	| IOT015 |	Miss
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,368	| IOT015 |	Witches
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,648	| IOT015 |	Your end audience
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,440	| IOT015 |	This isn't you're not selling a sensor
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,232	| IOT015 |	You're selling data
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:42,048	| IOT015 |	And in that changes your audience
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:42,560	| IOT015 |	Fundamental
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,376	| IOT015 |	Because the value you have isn't
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:47,680	| IOT015 |	Just for the singular restaurant
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,960	| IOT015 |	It's it's this platform play
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,544	| IOT015 |	When did you realize this
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,592	| IOT015 |	Did you did you know this going in
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,640	| IOT015 |	How does that change what your how you look at your
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:00,736	| IOT015 |	If we could at least this consumer at we just wanted people to see how busy
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:02,272	| IOT015 |	Another favorite places were
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:08,416	| IOT015 |	And we immediately. Calls asking for Innokin can I implement this technology Within
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,696	| IOT015 |	Our network of locations
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,744	| IOT015 |	And we must have had
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:12,512	| IOT015 |	Ken serious
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:15,072	| IOT015 |	Technology companies reach out and say
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,608	| IOT015 |	This could really improve
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:19,680	| IOT015 |	Are Baseline data to compare sales data
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:24,544	| IOT015 |	Too or to better understand or predict foot traffic in the future or to handle Staffing
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,848	| IOT015 |	Automate discounts
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,128	| IOT015 |	I mean it was
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,152	| IOT015 |	All over the place
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:32,480	| IOT015 |	So we decided to essentially Focus all of our distribution through
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,296	| IOT015 |	Other people that are data could be more useful to
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:42,208	| IOT015 |	Ultimately consumer application is only as good as the number of eyes that interact with it or the number of transactions that consumers
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:42,976	| IOT015 |	You through it
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,768	| IOT015 |	Ultimately we want that to be free
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,048	| IOT015 |	So
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:51,680	| IOT015 |	It seemed to make much more sense to be able to have one conversation with the head of product to the startup that has 5000 Plus locations
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:54,240	| IOT015 |	Get a green light knob sudden have
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:58,080	| IOT015 |	She was pipeline places in to be relevant to allow more consumers
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,872	| IOT015 |	And I think the last one that I would say is
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:01,408	| IOT015 |	The hardware can't matter
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,944	| IOT015 |	And we have to be agnostic to the hardware
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:07,552	| IOT015 |	And I think that that was unique to us mostly because we never built Hardware before
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:11,904	| IOT015 |	We weren't like experts at video surveillance and facial recognition software or
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:13,696	| IOT015 |	That type of of learning
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:19,584	| IOT015 |	So it was essentially like what is the cheapest way we can get a sensor into a door and this is it
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,352	| IOT015 |	And it's infrared
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,168	| IOT015 |	Is infrared distance sensors
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:23,936	| IOT015 |	Yes
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:24,960	| IOT015 |	We measure
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:26,752	| IOT015 |	Simply spikes in voltage
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:31,104	| IOT015 |	Then we look for shapes that help us determine whether or not it's an entrance or an exit
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:32,896	| IOT015 |	And so
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:35,968	| IOT015 |	Your sensors cost how much to put on the door today
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:37,248	| IOT015 |	Cost us
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,552	| IOT015 |	Yes in Swedish
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:42,112	| IOT015 |	Since we bear the burden of the hardware there
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,136	| IOT015 |	About sub
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,928	| IOT015 |	Sub $40 at this point
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:46,208	| IOT015 |	Congratulations
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:46,976	| IOT015 |	All right
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,512	| IOT015 |	And they should go lower
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:51,584	| IOT015 |	Yeah I really like him to be a $25 or less
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:55,936	| IOT015 |	And then installing them is that a big deal or is that just like
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,472	| IOT015 |	Double-sided tape gun
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,288	| IOT015 |	Yeah well we actually
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,824	| IOT015 |	Everything has been engineered to be
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,104	| IOT015 |	As
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:04,896	| IOT015 |	Fasting install as possible
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:06,176	| IOT015 |	But we run to a
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,200	| IOT015 |	To an outlet
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:09,760	| IOT015 |	Specifically so that it doesn't ever lose power
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,320	| IOT015 |	And I was about 15 minutes
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:13,856	| IOT015 |	But
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:17,696	| IOT015 |	A single person can do a whole bunch of installations very quickly
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:20,000	| IOT015 |	As long as they're not too far apart from one another so
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:23,328	| IOT015 |	I would say we start to make our money probably in
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,864	| IOT015 |	Interment 4 or so
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,680	| IOT015 |	That's better than the alarm company
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:31,008	| IOT015 |	I'm not sure what their their margins look like
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,056	| IOT015 |	Also this is
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,848	| IOT015 |	I should also say you know we charge
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,896	| IOT015 |	$25 / location
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,408	| IOT015 |	In 4 months
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,944	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,992	| IOT015 |	What I'm really excited about his once we have
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:44,064	| IOT015 |	Baseline data to then start doing interesting repackaging
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:48,928	| IOT015 |	Like what is the last two years of the financial district in San Francisco look like
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,720	| IOT015 |	Lingcod becomes really
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:51,232	| IOT015 |	Really cool.
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:54,816	| IOT015 |	That's true and then you could sell that Beyond just
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:58,912	| IOT015 |	Door custard-like the core customers like the merchants you can sell that too
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,960	| IOT015 |	Demographers to
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,264	| IOT015 |	Patisserie players
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:04,800	| IOT015 |	Gaso
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,104	| IOT015 |	That would be really exciting
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:08,128	| IOT015 |	And
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,152	| IOT015 |	Maybe then Google buys
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:16,064	| IOT015 |	Yeah I mean I think it's so interesting because I don't know what these larger companies are trying to accomplish but I think one of them
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,344	| IOT015 |	Points that you and I
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,880	| IOT015 |	Bounce around at one point was
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,696	| IOT015 |	We're just not going to wake up one day and sensors be everywhere
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,512	| IOT015 |	You have to figure out some kind of distribution in
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,024	| IOT015 |	Garza's
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:28,096	| IOT015 |	Is kind of straightforward but if it works
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:31,680	| IOT015 |	I think it'll on Earth all sorts of really interesting data about how cities get used
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:35,264	| IOT015 |	I think you're right and so I will look forward to you
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,080	| IOT015 |	I mean I can see you guys signing deals
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,664	| IOT015 |	Payment providers so a belly
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,456	| IOT015 |	A square
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:48,064	| IOT015 |	MasterCard any of those guys I know that you're talkin primarily to Tech startups but
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,856	| IOT015 |	You don't think big
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,160	| IOT015 |	Hopefully hopefully someone in a large payment process
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:55,744	| IOT015 |	Keyshia Cole
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:00,608	| IOT015 |	I do think it's crucial to get data about where people are
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,632	| IOT015 |	Inside cities
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,448	| IOT015 |	Not just inside commercial establishment
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,472	| IOT015 |	Butt public
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,496	| IOT015 |	Establishment
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,264	| IOT015 |	Send
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,544	| IOT015 |	That's not going to happen
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,056	| IOT015 |	Until
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,872	| IOT015 |	You guys get much broader distribution
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:12,640	| IOT015 |	Because
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:16,224	| IOT015 |	Yeah I Miss Polly is not going to be like oh I really want better customer service
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,016	| IOT015 |	Sure
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:20,832	| IOT015 |	Maybe that's what I mean we've had
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:22,880	| IOT015 |	It certainly like universities have reached out
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:27,232	| IOT015 |	And inside you know we'd love to be able to provide this to our students we've had some interest from
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:29,792	| IOT015 |	City planners who work for like City governments
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,840	| IOT015 |	You are interested in putting it in public spaces
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,120	| IOT015 |	Larger
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:38,240	| IOT015 |	The top-tier financial institutions have reached out about some of their their marketing efforts to be able to see
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,520	| IOT015 |	Not just
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:41,568	| IOT015 |	Transaction when someone uses their
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,592	| IOT015 |	Visa or
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:43,616	| IOT015 |	MasterCard
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,176	| IOT015 |	But all of the physical for traffic that goes into location
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,712	| IOT015 |	So I think
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:50,784	| IOT015 |	You know if it works well it works the way that we like it too
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,576	| IOT015 |	Hopefully this will be integrated into
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,392	| IOT015 |	A lot of everyday companies that they you and I
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:56,672	| IOT015 |	Use Eno regularly
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:59,232	| IOT015 |	I hope so I really think this could be like
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:00,512	| IOT015 |	6 biggest waves
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,560	| IOT015 |	Oh thank you that would be
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,608	| IOT015 |	Spectacular we would love to be as big as Waze
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:08,448	| IOT015 |	See there you go all right what Andrew thanks so much for coming on the show I really appreciate it
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:11,264	| IOT015 |	Certainly certainly thanks so much for having me Stacy
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:17,408	| IOT015 |	Well that's it for this week show so I hope you come back for next week and thanks for listening
