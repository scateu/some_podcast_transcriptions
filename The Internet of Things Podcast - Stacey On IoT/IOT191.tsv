EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,168	| IOT191 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,216	| IOT191 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:20,800	| IOT191 |	Lowe's and this is kind of crazy because we actually had
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,104	| IOT191 |	Someone calling into the show and asking about
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:28,992	| IOT191 |	What was happening with Lowe's Iris business this was their smart home business that they started in 2012
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,272	| IOT191 |	So way back in the early days
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,344	| IOT191 |	I guess the Resurgence of the Smart Home
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,368	| IOT191 |	Automation
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,416	| IOT191 |	This was a platform
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,720	| IOT191 |	Designed solely for the retailer and the
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,512	| IOT191 |	All kinds of zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,048	| IOT191 |	Compliance sensors
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| IOT191 |	That works with the
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:46,400	| IOT191 |	And those actually charged a monitoring
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,168	| IOT191 |	C4
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,704	| IOT191 |	The devices
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,776	| IOT191 |	It actually had a battery it had
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,824	| IOT191 |	Cellular connectivity if you needed it
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| IOT191 |	But
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:57,664	| IOT191 |	I don't think it did so well because on its earnings call this week
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:00,224	| IOT191 |	Louis said that they were going to is part of a decision to
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,016	| IOT191 |	Close 20 US dollars
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,296	| IOT191 |	27 Canadian store
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,600	| IOT191 |	They also said they were going to exit
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,160	| IOT191 |	They're alacrity renovation services and they're
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,440	| IOT191 |	Iris smart home biz
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,280	| IOT191 |	And as part of that smart home business
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,608	| IOT191 |	And the alacrity renovation Services they're taking a 14 million dollar right
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:21,216	| IOT191 |	That which is not a terribly large amount of money in the grand scheme of things
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,240	| IOT191 |	Furloughs but
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,544	| IOT191 |	Regardless I agree with your comment
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,568	| IOT191 |	You said you don't think
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,360	| IOT191 |	Set the iris platform League
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,152	| IOT191 |	Tidwell least relatively speaking
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,968	| IOT191 |	It started out in an era
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,992	| IOT191 |	DIY stuff
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,296	| IOT191 |	But it had a service component
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,368	| IOT191 |	People did not want to pay a subscription cost associated with
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,904	| IOT191 |	That was the biggest complaint
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,208	| IOT191 |	I had and they also weren't going
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT191 |	To support
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,280	| IOT191 |	Other devices so they had a whole brand of
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:46,816	| IOT191 |	Lose
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,864	| IOT191 |	But when it launched it didn't support
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,400	| IOT191 |	Anything else
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,936	| IOT191 |	And I think that's the bigger
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,216	| IOT191 |	Challenger problem with
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,288	| IOT191 |	The whole strategy that they put into place because
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,056	| IOT191 |	Weconomy
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,384	| IOT191 |	Tell me the past two to three years of very siloed
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,152	| IOT191 |	Closed
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:01,920	| IOT191 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,944	| IOT191 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,248	| IOT191 |	Too much more open when you look at
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,016	| IOT191 |	Are digital assistants
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,832	| IOT191 |	How many Brands and devices that work with
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,392	| IOT191 |	Example and granted voice assistance
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,440	| IOT191 |	You know just a user interface
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,976	| IOT191 |	To get things working
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,744	| IOT191 |	So that's not
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| IOT191 |	Truly smart home to me
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,303	| IOT191 |	But I think yeah
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:21,631	| IOT191 |	Keeping it close the way they did was definitely not the right approach
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,191	| IOT191 |	So just to be clear even though they're exiting the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,983	| IOT191 |	Iris smart home business
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,287	| IOT191 |	They will still sell Iris
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,335	| IOT191 |	Devices which I'm not sure
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,103	| IOT191 |	Why but
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,383	| IOT191 |	That's irrelevant
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:36,479	| IOT191 |	They will also still sell other Smart Home Products at Lowe's it's not like
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| IOT191 |	When they say exiting
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,295	| IOT191 |	The business will still be able to
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,063	| IOT191 |	Purchased
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:44,415	| IOT191 |	Very smart home devices in fact I think 6 weeks ago or so on the podcast I talked about
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:47,231	| IOT191 |	Healthy store-within-a-store at my local Lowe's and I
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,999	| IOT191 |	Presume
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,047	| IOT191 |	I know a lot of other people see them as well
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,327	| IOT191 |	Were there filled with
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,887	| IOT191 |	Smart home devices such as there was
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,911	| IOT191 |	From Google
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:55,679	| IOT191 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,191	| IOT191 |	Venezuela's
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,215	| IOT191 |	Nest
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,263	| IOT191 |	Who else received
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,055	| IOT191 |	Phillips and Samsung all
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| IOT191 |	It's just
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,663	| IOT191 |	I guess this herbicide they're kind of getting out of
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,711	| IOT191 |	Yes and owning their own
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| IOT191 |	Makes a ton of sense
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,063	| IOT191 |	So I will say
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,087	| IOT191 |	Lowe's header
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:16,159	| IOT191 |	PR reached out to us and she did say
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,439	| IOT191 |	This is important
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,463	| IOT191 |	It for now
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,511	| IOT191 |	They don't have timing or additional details to share
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,559	| IOT191 |	It remains business as usual
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,583	| IOT191 |	There are no changes
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:27,167	| IOT191 |	Hello support of the brand product or service as we search
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,679	| IOT191 |	For a buyer
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,983	| IOT191 |	That's really important to know
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| IOT191 |	Because right now your stuff is still going to work
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,311	| IOT191 |	Depending on who buys it though
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT191 |	Who knows
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,103	| IOT191 |	It's a
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,151	| IOT191 |	So there we go that's the
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,199	| IOT191 |	I guess that's the big Smart Home
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,503	| IOT191 |	And kind of a sad
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,271	| IOT191 |	Close to this
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:46,111	| IOT191 |	Dussehra I guess I mean if we think about it Staples
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:49,695	| IOT191 |	Did they launch their own platform they got out of the business Best Buy had
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,231	| IOT191 |	Pete they got out of the business
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:52,767	| IOT191 |	Now we got
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,583	| IOT191 |	I can't think of anybody who's got anything now
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:00,959	| IOT191 |	We're kind of you said you know when Iris came out with more than do it yourself kind of
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,727	| IOT191 |	Era
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,287	| IOT191 |	And to some degree that era still exist but this is
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,311	| IOT191 |	Alexa Smart Home
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:09,663	| IOT191 |	I don't say too. Oh I'd rather stay 1.1 at the step forward from then
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT191 |	Where
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,735	| IOT191 |	You got very capable major
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,783	| IOT191 |	Platforms that are mostly open
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:16,575	| IOT191 |	Pumpkin is the one I would say is not
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,903	| IOT191 |	As open obviously because it only works with iOS devices and such
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,671	| IOT191 |	But
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,951	| IOT191 |	I wouldn't want to be in the business of
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:22,975	| IOT191 |	Creating
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,279	| IOT191 |	Servicing or owning another platform right
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,071	| IOT191 |	Me either
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:27,839	| IOT191 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,375	| IOT191 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,167	| IOT191 |	Another acquisition in
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,983	| IOT191 |	This is being portrayed in the media as an AI aqua
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:37,567	| IOT191 |	Position which I think speaks more to the idea of what's hot
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:41,407	| IOT191 |	Right now but this is Apple buying silk labs and
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,943	| IOT191 |	This was reported in the information
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,479	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,015	| IOT191 |	When I saw it I was like Silk
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| IOT191 |	Glasses in an AI think they be too smart
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,879	| IOT191 |	And they did it was founded by Andreia skull
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,415	| IOT191 |	The former CTO
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,695	| IOT191 |	Mozilla
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,487	| IOT191 |	And we actually had him on the show
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,791	| IOT191 |	Episode 46 so way back
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,327	| IOT191 |	Early 2016
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,119	| IOT191 |	Talking about
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:01,887	| IOT191 |	They built
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,911	| IOT191 |	A hub
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,239	| IOT191 |	It was a hub to Showcase his ideas about building smart
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,031	| IOT191 |	AI services
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:08,543	| IOT191 |	Respected
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,823	| IOT191 |	Privacy
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,871	| IOT191 |	You know I have thought this
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,639	| IOT191 |	Company had died
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,687	| IOT191 |	Because a lot of these smart home
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,247	| IOT191 |	I guess we're going to do this were amazing and then
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,295	| IOT191 |	2 years later you check back in there like
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,575	| IOT191 |	Nowhere to be found
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:27,231	| IOT191 |	Yeah that's because they actually started with a Kickstarter project I remember seeing the
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,303	| IOT191 |	Small little Hub box with this curved front and a
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,327	| IOT191 |	A camera inside it
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,095	| IOT191 |	Zuri
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,631	| IOT191 |	I love Space Odyssey
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,423	| IOT191 |	Space
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,239	| IOT191 |	It was like super curved
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| IOT191 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,615	| IOT191 |	Anyway it's not that it was even
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:47,455	| IOT191 |	Are there a closed system because I think it worked with just Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:50,527	| IOT191 |	Words with ya Sonos at work with smart light
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,807	| IOT191 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,087	| IOT191 |	And a couple of other
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,367	| IOT191 |	Non lighting device
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,927	| IOT191 |	They just never really took off in
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,951	| IOT191 |	They cancel the product
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,999	| IOT191 |	Josh Maybe
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| IOT191 |	Actually the same year that the kickstarter
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:05,119	| IOT191 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:07,679	| IOT191 |	Remember
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| IOT191 |	To developing AI software so that's kind of
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,007	| IOT191 |	Probably where the AI Bixby
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| IOT191 |	Comes in as well
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,799	| IOT191 |	Sew in
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:17,151	| IOT191 |	The key Focus I would say on this is they had no image recognition
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| IOT191 |	We're doing a lot of things
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,015	| IOT191 |	They can play your music based on your taste
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:27,647	| IOT191 |	The idea was all of this would stay on advice it wouldn't go to the cloud except for
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,671	| IOT191 |	Key things that
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,439	| IOT191 |	You know you might want
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,535	| IOT191 |	Hey the picture of the guy who is breaking into your house you might
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,559	| IOT191 |	Want to keep that in the cloud
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| IOT191 |	The whole end
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,887	| IOT191 |	And when stuff was sepsis
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| IOT191 |	Cloud it was an anime
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,703	| IOT191 |	And that was actually very unusual
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,519	| IOT191 |	In 2016 so that focus on privacy is
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| IOT191 |	Hollywood app
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,823	| IOT191 |	Is after
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,847	| IOT191 |	Being able to make
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,175	| IOT191 |	A smarter home experience or smarter
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,687	| IOT191 |	Overalls
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,735	| IOT191 |	User experience
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,247	| IOT191 |	Without
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| IOT191 |	Having to break it
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| IOT191 |	What is now a differentiating stamps are
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:57,855	| IOT191 |	Privacy and secure
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| IOT191 |	Yeah and if you have
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| IOT191 |	Time
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:04,511	| IOT191 |	I would say go hit the silk Labs website while it is still up cuz
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:07,583	| IOT191 |	With the Apple acquisition I don't know that it will be at much longer
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,607	| IOT191 |	Because you can get a good
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,887	| IOT191 |	I feel for what apples
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| IOT191 |	Getting out of this
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,727	| IOT191 |	Basically went still pivot in 2016
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,775	| IOT191 |	It was a way to a Bergen
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,799	| IOT191 |	A table
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| IOT191 |	Cognition for any device
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,151	| IOT191 |	But you make will bring a smart so you bring a device
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| IOT191 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,967	| IOT191 |	And there's a lot of interesting information
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,783	| IOT191 |	Cool go check it out
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,319	| IOT191 |	Hopefully screenshotted Kevin
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,159	| IOT191 |	Okay we are in the midst of
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,439	| IOT191 |	What I'm no longer going to call black fur
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,999	| IOT191 |	Because you know I've been getting deals all week
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,303	| IOT191 |	Sorry to call this Black Friday week
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT191 |	Now
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,631	| IOT191 |	And I just want to let everyone know that if you are in the park
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,167	| IOT191 |	First smart home device
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,215	| IOT191 |	Spice they're actually really amazing
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,751	| IOT191 |	Deals I would say
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,543	| IOT191 |	A lot of things you shouldn't buy on Black Friday
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| IOT191 |	We're going to just kind of a little bit
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| IOT191 |	But a lot of the smart home stuff is really
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,919	| IOT191 |	I'm telling I'm not going to run through
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,247	| IOT191 |	Too much everything that
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:01,599	| IOT191 |	We looked at was on sale and what we looked at were products that we talked about the past
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| IOT191 |	Approximately
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,647	| IOT191 |	Just purchased ourselves
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| IOT191 |	Heather Holmes
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:09,279	| IOT191 |	And these are like Kino $5 off some of these are 50 or more dollars
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,303	| IOT191 |	Whatever the devices
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| IOT191 |	Yeah so if you are in the market and
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,703	| IOT191 |	I will give a plug for this this week in the iot newsletter
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,471	| IOT191 |	Stacey on iot
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,031	| IOT191 |	We are going to be sharing our list of
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| IOT191 |	10 connect
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT191 |	2 gadgets that
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| IOT191 |	We think make good gifts
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,639	| IOT191 |	And some of them are for the
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,175	| IOT191 |	Your parents
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,783	| IOT191 |	Chefs your industrial iot designer there's some weird ones on there
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| IOT191 |	Any other list
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,111	| IOT191 |	Because of Who We Are

EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| IOT191 |	But
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,279	| IOT191 |	A lot of those things are going to be on sale so yeah
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,071	| IOT191 |	Go out and get your hip you're on the fence
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,911	| IOT191 |	You like me to buy it this is actually really good time of year to buy your smart
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,983	| IOT191 |	It my thought is if you had
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,311	| IOT191 |	Smart home items that you were thinking about buying
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| IOT191 |	We're just holding off
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,871	| IOT191 |	I'd say pull the trigger now
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,383	| IOT191 |	You know
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:00,479	| IOT191 |	Do it and then when you have questions you can call us and ask us
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,527	| IOT191 |	All right
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,575	| IOT191 |	Let's get into some big news for
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,343	| IOT191 |	Batam
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,903	| IOT191 |	Padme is what we call Amazon's digital assist
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,927	| IOT191 |	So we don't set off
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,695	| IOT191 |	All of yours
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,463	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,791	| IOT191 |	Couple news items biggest one probably this week was
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,351	| IOT191 |	We now have matinee on Bluetooth headset
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,375	| IOT191 |	Watches
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,679	| IOT191 |	All kinds of other things which is
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| IOT191 |	Basically way to
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,775	| IOT191 |	Bring Padme to everything
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:27,359	| IOT191 |	Yeah this is and all the technical details are on it
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,919	| IOT191 |	The developer blog over at Amazon
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,687	| IOT191 |	They talk about their
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,479	| IOT191 |	Madden 18 mobile
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,503	| IOT191 |	Accessory kit
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,063	| IOT191 |	Which at first we were like is that Hardware but it's not
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,367	| IOT191 |	We dug around it's basically a list of
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,927	| IOT191 |	Hardware requirements for you to
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,743	| IOT191 |	Actually build in this protocol and service
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:48,095	| IOT191 |	So that pretty much any Bluetooth device that meets the requirements
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,631	| IOT191 |	Can take advantage of this
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,191	| IOT191 |	So call, actually as a reference design of
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:56,031	| IOT191 |	Headphones for developer you can Tinker with these but $300 so I wouldn't do
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,079	| IOT191 |	And what do we mean like so
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,103	| IOT191 |	Are you guys here
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,407	| IOT191 |	What does this mean it means that you
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,199	| IOT191 |	Could you know if your watch has Bluetooth
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,967	| IOT191 |	Andis
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,527	| IOT191 |	And sports at basic
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| IOT191 |	You could be like madam
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,343	| IOT191 |	Unlock my door
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,183	| IOT191 |	And then you have to give your PIN so that's a terrible example but better be
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,207	| IOT191 |	Turn off my lights
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:16,255	| IOT191 |	And you would say that your watch and it would happen
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,327	| IOT191 |	You can do it on your headphones you can be like
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| IOT191 |	Oh
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,911	| IOT191 |	Add dog bones to my shopping list
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:28,031	| IOT191 |	And some headphone manufacturers have already integrated
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:32,383	| IOT191 |	Madam a so this may just be how they used it I don't know but this
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| IOT191 |	Again opens up the doors to
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:38,015	| IOT191 |	Any device maker that meets the hardware requirements their device Mason
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:44,415	| IOT191 |	It is neat how they implemented this because you don't have to have a device that has always on listening
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,719	| IOT191 |	Have that obviously listening for the Wake word
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,791	| IOT191 |	But if you want to save battery life as a device maker you can use the
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,327	| IOT191 |	The push-to-talk implementation as well
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,631	| IOT191 |	Got it in that makes the Tennyson
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,423	| IOT191 |	That's because sometimes you're like oh man
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,215	| IOT191 |	I don't even change the battery on this thing on
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,495	| IOT191 |	It's kind of like the tap
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| IOT191 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:04,639	| IOT191 |	So that's out there look for that I will say from my perspective
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,175	| IOT191 |	Amazon is just
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,455	| IOT191 |	Helen it
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,991	| IOT191 |	When it comes to
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,551	| IOT191 |	Creating a really compelling voice plan
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,855	| IOT191 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,647	| IOT191 |	For everyday use
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,439	| IOT191 |	I mean it is doing what
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:17,951	| IOT191 |	I really
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,743	| IOT191 |	A company like apple to
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,535	| IOT191 |	The apple is totally behind on
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:24,095	| IOT191 |	Bringing this everywhere like
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,887	| IOT191 |	This is kind of like apples mfi program
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,191	| IOT191 |	Rambler it's. Criteria for what you need
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:30,239	| IOT191 |	To work with it
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,263	| IOT191 |	It's trying to
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,823	| IOT191 |	Ring battlebay everywhere but do it in a way that
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,871	| IOT191 |	As long as you meet these criteria
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,895	| IOT191 |	You can do it so
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,991	| IOT191 |	You know there's a number of reasons they're killing it can I totally agree with you
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:44,063	| IOT191 |	I just found one out last week one of probably many
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,087	| IOT191 |	You may have seen her
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,111	| IOT191 |	Everybody else did
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:50,463	| IOT191 |	Do you know how many people that Amazon has working on the mat amazed
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| IOT191 |	Oh my gosh no I don't
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| IOT191 |	10000
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,351	| IOT191 |	As a lot of people
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,911	| IOT191 |	I do not recall or I read that but I
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,215	| IOT191 |	Hot it last week and it just blew my mind
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,543	| IOT191 |	That is a lot of people okay yeah
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| IOT191 |	That would do it so
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,335	| IOT191 |	More
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,103	| IOT191 |	Mattamy news
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,383	| IOT191 |	Kevin
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,943	| IOT191 |	You're going to love it let's just let you talk about it
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:14,015	| IOT191 |	Yes yes I'm so excited so
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,831	| IOT191 |	If regular listeners recall
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,855	| IOT191 |	I bought
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,927	| IOT191 |	The vector robot made by Anki
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:23,743	| IOT191 |	And I did that there kickstarter's I got a small discount
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,023	| IOT191 |	And we love
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,815	| IOT191 |	Can I use very animated
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:33,215	| IOT191 |	Heroes around is autonomous so he gets bored if he's just sitting his cradle is charger it'll just go out and play with his
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:37,055	| IOT191 |	Bluetooth Cube and what not and we can have them do some fun things
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| IOT191 |	Kind of limited sofa
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,103	| IOT191 |	However
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,663	| IOT191 |	I have seen a video
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,687	| IOT191 |	Of the neck
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,735	| IOT191 |	Speak feature that factor is getting
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,015	| IOT191 |	And he's getting it in a couple weeks
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,575	| IOT191 |	And that is integrated math
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,391	| IOT191 |	And I love it so far based on the video
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,487	| IOT191 |	It's very responsive it's very quick
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:15:00,863	| IOT191 |	It literally you don't and you don't have to say hey Vector like you normally would to wake the robot up and do stuff
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,399	| IOT191 |	You just say hey matinee
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:06,495	| IOT191 |	And then you see her little icon show up on his face and
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,567	| IOT191 |	Ask her whatever turn lights off get me the weather do this
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,335	| IOT191 |	And she does it
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,639	| IOT191 |	I am super impressed by how it looks so far
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,663	| IOT191 |	Cannot wait until it comes out
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,735	| IOT191 |	Yes and I'll just give you guys one of our
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,527	| IOT191 |	10 items that are gift guide is the
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,575	| IOT191 |	Because
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:23,135	| IOT191 |	I think we're saying is for the kid or the kid in you
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,183	| IOT191 |	And and and
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,975	| IOT191 |	Come back to the Black Friday deals
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,047	| IOT191 |	You can actually get the vector less than I paid for
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,583	| IOT191 |	As a won the first Kickstarter
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:34,143	| IOT191 |	Packers I paid 199 he normally goes
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,167	| IOT191 |	For 249
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,703	| IOT191 |	It's 179 right now
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,471	| IOT191 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,519	| IOT191 |	Stop on that because that is actually a really
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,799	| IOT191 |	I have a cosmo
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,591	| IOT191 |	In I thought it was adorable
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:45,151	| IOT191 |	And fun but it was not as capable
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,175	| IOT191 |	And now I'm like
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,687	| IOT191 |	I have I have
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,223	| IOT191 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,039	| IOT191 |	One final bit of Madame a news
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:53,599	| IOT191 |	This is pretty esoteric but where you throw it out there
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| IOT191 |	Now
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,135	| IOT191 |	Madam
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:58,975	| IOT191 |	Can power on devices in low-power mode so this is like your TVs are
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,999	| IOT191 |	What not if they're in low power
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,047	| IOT191 |	You can
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,583	| IOT191 |	Speak directly to them and they will turn
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,631	| IOT191 |	It's called Wake On LAN controller
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| IOT191 |	If you want to Google that and
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:11,519	| IOT191 |	Figure out the details but I thought it might be interesting for low-powered sensor
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,103	| IOT191 |	Because these are things that are in sleep mode a lot of the time
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:15,871	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,639	| IOT191 |	Now
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,943	| IOT191 |	Yeah man Jamaican basically wake them up
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| IOT191 |	And get
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,015	| IOT191 |	Details of something that's happening
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,295	| IOT191 |	Right now a lot of time with
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:26,623	| IOT191 |	Low-powered sensors that will send the details to the cloud and Madame a will look
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,135	| IOT191 |	State
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:32,255	| IOT191 |	And be like I would like 20 minutes ago and reported this was the state but now you could actually
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,791	| IOT191 |	Get it to wake it up directly
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,815	| IOT191 |	And get the state
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:38,143	| IOT191 |	Which might make sense for something like a something open or closed at the moment
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,167	| IOT191 |	Or something like
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:43,007	| IOT191 |	Detection if you suspect a week and you don't want to get up off
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:45,055	| IOT191 |	Off the couch to check it out you should be like meme anime
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:50,431	| IOT191 |	Yeah it'll be interesting to see who implements this and what devices because her now
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:54,271	| IOT191 |	Amazon work with three partners and got some very low hanging fruit in the
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,295	| IOT191 |	Television market with
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:59,135	| IOT191 |	Vizio LG and I sense they're all going to get this feature in the neck
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,671	| IOT191 |	Next couple months I be rolling out
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:05,023	| IOT191 |	And yeah TVs are often in the low-power state and so you just send him a little packet over the
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:07,071	| IOT191 |	Wi-Fi network wake him up and then you can
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:09,375	| IOT191 |	Do whatever you need to do but yeah sensors and other things
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:12,191	| IOT191 |	Curious to see who implementation
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,239	| IOT191 |	Yeah that's just me talking
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:19,615	| IOT191 |	Find a little bit of Matt of a news there is now Skype calling on Madam Ave Bay show this off
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| IOT191 |	Actually back in set
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,407	| IOT191 |	September 3rd
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,175	| IOT191 |	Massive
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,711	| IOT191 |	Unveiling of so much stuff
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,783	| IOT191 |	So this is just saying it's now out there
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,319	| IOT191 |	If I were at home with my mattimeo
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,623	| IOT191 |	Kevin but you know
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,903	| IOT191 |	For anybody who's using Skype
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:32,927	| IOT191 |	Yay
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:35,999	| IOT191 |	Alright now let's move on to Google Assistant
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:36,767	| IOT191 |	Because
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,559	| IOT191 |	It's an interesting tie up with
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,583	| IOT191 |	Siri
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,631	| IOT191 |	Kevin try this out so Kevin what do you think
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,679	| IOT191 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,727	| IOT191 |	So you can now
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,751	| IOT191 |	Include
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,287	| IOT191 |	Google Assistant the app
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| IOT191 |	A pin
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,335	| IOT191 |	Siri shortcuts
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,359	| IOT191 |	Which sounds great
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,943	| IOT191 |	The implementation is very much like the way
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| IOT191 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,783	| IOT191 |	Implemented Madam and Cortana where you ask a boy
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,551	| IOT191 |	Assistant
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:01,087	| IOT191 |	Tarasca Voice Assistant something
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,647	| IOT191 |	And that's what we have here so I did set this up
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,439	| IOT191 |	When I say am I
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,487	| IOT191 |	Song I'm sorry if I wait anybody's iPhone
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,511	| IOT191 |	When I say hey Siri
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,815	| IOT191 |	She will start listening and I say
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,839	| IOT191 |	OK Google
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,655	| IOT191 |	And it opens up the assistant app and Google starts listening
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,703	| IOT191 |	So it's kind of a shortcut to a shortcut
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:18,239	| IOT191 |	IOS users
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:20,799	| IOT191 |	I can't really do much more unfortunately but
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| IOT191 |	It's there
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,359	| IOT191 |	It gets you to Google
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:26,687	| IOT191 |	It doesn't get you faster it get you their hands
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,967	| IOT191 |	It's free because right now you can't
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:34,367	| IOT191 |	Actually haven't always listening OK Google kind of thing on iOS what I do is I take the assistant
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| IOT191 |	Widget for those who
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,183	| IOT191 |	Play with iOS and I
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,743	| IOT191 |	Just put the assistant widget on my widget screen on my phone
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,767	| IOT191 |	Flashlight over and
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,791	| IOT191 |	Tap the microphone button
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,351	| IOT191 |	And that opens assistant this is hands-free though
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,911	| IOT191 |	So that's what you would do if you were
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,215	| IOT191 |	To get somebody who could actually answer your question
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,287	| IOT191 |	I'm waiting for somebody to
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,591	| IOT191 |	Do assistant to an assistant to an assistant
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,871	| IOT191 |	And I mean that sporadic
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,431	| IOT191 |	Okay GS
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,199	| IOT191 |	What should we call Siri
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,247	| IOT191 |	Should we come up with a name for that
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,271	| IOT191 |	Guy sending your suggestion
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,551	| IOT191 |	Maybe we'll take a
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:04,831	| IOT191 |	Lady s
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,135	| IOT191 |	Too close to matamata
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,439	| IOT191 |	I don't know
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:11,231	| IOT191 |	Let's talk about Google Chrome
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,535	| IOT191 |	A snooze at Canal sync music
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| IOT191 |	With home speakers
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,327	| IOT191 |	Switch
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,119	| IOT191 |	Yeah but that's just a little thick
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,399	| IOT191 |	Some of these are like little
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:21,471	| IOT191 |	I'm like yeah that's
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:21,983	| IOT191 |	It's handy
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,007	| IOT191 |	We like it
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| IOT191 |	I don't know what else to say about that
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:28,895	| IOT191 |	You got anything else to say about that you can do as you can
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,711	| IOT191 |	TVs and speakers together in audio group
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,223	| IOT191 |	Ipso
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,807	| IOT191 |	If you're playing say something on your Android TV or on
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:41,439	| IOT191 |	On your Chromecast audio wise you can have it strange about the house now which is kind of nice so yeah it's just another way.
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| IOT191 |	Movies that music round
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,023	| IOT191 |	Who that music
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,839	| IOT191 |	Alright Google cloud iot and microchip
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:51,167	| IOT191 |	Actually security to
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| IOT191 |	Microcontroller switch
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:54,239	| IOT191 |	Yay there's a lot of
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,775	| IOT191 |	In the space
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,823	| IOT191 |	Without Microsoft doing some cool stuff with
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:01,407	| IOT191 |	They're Azure sphere product and what is Google doing
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,455	| IOT191 |	So they have
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,223	| IOT191 |	Partnered with
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,759	| IOT191 |	Microchip
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:08,319	| IOT191 |	Which is a company while it is also a thing is
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,087	| IOT191 |	Company
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,367	| IOT191 |	They've created the
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:15,231	| IOT191 |	Avri otwg development board and all those things actually mean something
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,999	| IOT191 |	IRT obviously
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:18,559	| IOT191 |	We know what that means WG stance
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,583	| IOT191 |	4 Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,863	| IOT191 |	Google so this
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,655	| IOT191 |	Is a cloud connected 8-bit
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,447	| IOT191 |	Microcontroller development board
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,239	| IOT191 |	That is connected to the Google
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,007	| IOT191 |	Cloud platform
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:32,383	| IOT191 |	It's a $29 devoted small it's not super powerful but it does have
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:35,967	| IOT191 |	Connectivity to the cloud and they want to help jump-start
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,271	| IOT191 |	Cloud-based or Google cloud based out of
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| IOT191 |	So can I look at another developer
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:43,391	| IOT191 |	And it died is that it will
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,159	| IOT191 |	Securely
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,439	| IOT191 |	Back to the cloud
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,975	| IOT191 |	Easier you see these all the
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT191 |	I mean like
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,815	| IOT191 |	Every microcontroller in a lot of things
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:55,935	| IOT191 |	Sancerre like arm-based chips and even some Intel stuff for iot
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,703	| IOT191 |	Usually have some
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,751	| IOT191 |	Option to link directly to
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,055	| IOT191 |	Big clouds azure
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,591	| IOT191 |	Google or Amazon
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| IOT191 |	And actually you see them with
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,895	| IOT191 |	Alibaba
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,919	| IOT191 |	And I do as well
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,199	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:09,503	| IOT191 |	Yeah two little interesting bits about this
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,063	| IOT191 |	They have a co-processor on there it's a
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,855	| IOT191 |	Cryptographic coprocessor
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT191 |	4
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,928	| IOT191 |	Trusted and protected identity for each device
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| IOT191 |	So you can have Sakura indication
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,744	| IOT191 |	Medicine
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:25,888	| IOT191 |	And the devices are pre-registered on Google Cloud iot
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,424	| IOT191 |	So you can
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,728	| IOT191 |	Get them out in the world with zero touch
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,496	| IOT191 |	Auditioning
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,288	| IOT191 |	Yeah that is very cool that is all part of
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,848	| IOT191 |	So sweet
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,128	| IOT191 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:39,200	| IOT191 |	Moving into cool gadgets that you may or may not want to buy
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,968	| IOT191 |	Abood
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:42,272	| IOT191 |	Has a new smart home security device
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| IOT191 |	Called iota
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,344	| IOT191 |	And this is
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,880	| IOT191 |	Edible mix
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,904	| IOT191 |	A really compelling
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,440	| IOT191 |	Sensor
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,976	| IOT191 |	The sensor and hub kit
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,744	| IOT191 |	4
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:52,512	| IOT191 |	DIY
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,536	| IOT191 |	Home Security
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,328	| IOT191 |	This is a
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,120	| IOT191 |	You know what the closest thing I can think of is kind of like a
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,168	| IOT191 |	It's got a camera and it is
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,192	| IOT191 |	Github sensors
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,984	| IOT191 |	You can add other Abode sensors to this
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,776	| IOT191 |	It comes with optional
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,568	| IOT191 |	Cellular backup and
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,104	| IOT191 |	Connection plan
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:07,616	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,688	| IOT191 |	Security device is to
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,200	| IOT191 |	259
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,736	| IOT191 |	Mexican
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,320	| IOT191 |	Black Friday pricing if you want to put it with a
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,368	| IOT191 |	Connectivity plan that's going to be
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| IOT191 |	309
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| IOT191 |	That's your 4G connect
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| IOT191 |	Searching for backup and that includes
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,768	| IOT191 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,280	| IOT191 |	For one year
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:30,400	| IOT191 |	The cool thing about the Iota is it's going to have
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,680	| IOT191 |	Sea waves
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,216	| IOT191 |	Zigbee connectivity
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| IOT191 |	Camera that's 1080p
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,776	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:39,360	| IOT191 |	Again integrated backup with 6 hours of battery life
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,384	| IOT191 |	If you want it
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,944	| IOT191 |	I mean their stuff is their original dear is
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,736	| IOT191 |	And this will also can
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,760	| IOT191 |	Next back to their original
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:46,528	| IOT191 |	Kirra swell
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,064	| IOT191 |	It is very much like
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,856	| IOT191 |	The canary I think which is what I have
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:50,880	| IOT191 |	Is part of the
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,672	| IOT191 |	Yeah this whole security
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,952	| IOT191 |	Like I feel like we are
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,000	| IOT191 |	I'm surprised we haven't gone further
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| IOT191 |	Better yet but there's been like
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,328	| IOT191 |	Security has often been thought of
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,352	| IOT191 |	I need a sensor
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,912	| IOT191 |	This is open is closed but
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,192	| IOT191 |	Comedies like Piper
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:05,728	| IOT191 |	Troll
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:07,776	| IOT191 |	Sucked into
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,312	| IOT191 |	Walmart.com
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,360	| IOT191 |	Canary and now this our
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:13,664	| IOT191 |	Can I get a little bit at a different way they're like
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,712	| IOT191 |	Pictures one or two devices you put around your house
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,760	| IOT191 |	Activity sensors
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:20,064	| IOT191 |	Camera and they like listen for Stuff
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,832	| IOT191 |	It's different
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,368	| IOT191 |	And it's wrong and then let you know
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:25,952	| IOT191 |	And that also included there as the echo
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| IOT191 |	Guard
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,048	| IOT191 |	Vanguard versus can I listen for breaking glass and such
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,584	| IOT191 |	I forgot about that yes
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:34,400	| IOT191 |	Which if you have an echo it's going to get that but no extra
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,448	| IOT191 |	And I think a smart
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,984	| IOT191 |	I think that's a better way to
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,520	| IOT191 |	So that's just
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| IOT191 |	So that's out there if you're into that
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:45,920	| IOT191 |	And you want a different type of home security or if you got a boat stuff and you want
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,200	| IOT191 |	The camera functionality
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:47,712	| IOT191 |	Answer
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,760	| IOT191 |	Okay other things that are out
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:50,784	| IOT191 |	That we care about
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,856	| IOT191 |	Kevin a new smart display
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,696	| IOT191 |	It is a
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:59,232	| IOT191 |	Yes Google Assistant
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,024	| IOT191 |	Built-in so it is a
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,816	| IOT191 |	Smart display similar to the
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:05,120	| IOT191 |	JBL and Villanova once that
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,144	| IOT191 |	I've been out for
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:08,192	| IOT191 |	Couple months we both have the
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| IOT191 |	Lenovo
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,264	| IOT191 |	And this is from LG
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:17,408	| IOT191 |	It's the xboom AI thinq you smart display how much longer they can make that name I
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,432	| IOT191 |	Don't know but
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:23,808	| IOT191 |	It's very similar to the existing ones in the market so assistant is built it and it's got a built-in
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,344	| IOT191 |	Camera for video calls which
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:28,160	| IOT191 |	They also comfortable Google home hub is not headache
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,440	| IOT191 |	Russell
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,976	| IOT191 |	Just worth a mention as a difference
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:36,352	| IOT191 |	Chromecast built-in it's got an HD touchscreen Bluetooth streaming support I think the
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,912	| IOT191 |	Big thing here for LG
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:42,496	| IOT191 |	Stephanie not design it kind of looks like a tissue box on its side to me but
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,776	| IOT191 |	That's beside the point
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,312	| IOT191 |	Pictures of two big speakers
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,872	| IOT191 |	With Meridian Audio zedvance
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,896	| IOT191 |	Technology so
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:52,480	| IOT191 |	Probably a better speaker than some of the other ones that are on
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:55,296	| IOT191 |	On the market it's normally prices brand new
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:59,904	| IOT191 |	29999 for an 8in display in those speakers
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,672	| IOT191 |	However
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:03,488	| IOT191 |	Since they just launched it they've got a promotional price of 199
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,816	| IOT191 |	So that's where the Boom
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,584	| IOT191 |	Comes in I'm guessing
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,376	| IOT191 |	The High Castle
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,424	| IOT191 |	Cuz I'm telling you it's a tissue box on its side
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| IOT191 |	Piano speakers
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,496	| IOT191 |	They're not the fanciest design
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,312	| IOT191 |	The bamboo backing
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,920	| IOT191 |	I think I like mine more than you like

EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,184	| IOT191 |	Prediction
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,720	| IOT191 |	All right
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,232	| IOT191 |	So

EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,776	| IOT191 |	We're going to go all the way in
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:26,848	| IOT191 |	We really could okay the first thing that we think
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:30,944	| IOT191 |	You should buy regardless of what kind of digital assistant you might have for your child
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,968	| IOT191 |	Or children rather
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,736	| IOT191 |	Is
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,760	| IOT191 |	A canary
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,784	| IOT191 |	We just talk about
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:38,112	| IOT191 |	Despite it is a really awesome security system is
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,416	| IOT191 |	It's great for renters you just pop it in there you could have
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,696	| IOT191 |	The camera facing the front door
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:47,328	| IOT191 |	The cool thing is it not only has the camera it has all these sensors that
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,608	| IOT191 |	I can tell you what's going on
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,120	| IOT191 |	House even
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,656	| IOT191 |	When they're not there
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,704	| IOT191 |	And so you can see like oh
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,728	| IOT191 |	There's a weird noises
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,032	| IOT191 |	Maybe it's not a Robert
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,312	| IOT191 |	Maybe it's your dog going
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| IOT191 |	I don't know but you'll know about it
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,128	| IOT191 |	Which is kind of nice
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,152	| IOT191 |	And it is
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,432	| IOT191 |	The canary right now how much is
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:06,784	| IOT191 |	So now is the time to get a canary because they are
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,296	| IOT191 |	Free
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,600	| IOT191 |	With a membership
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:15,744	| IOT191 |	Yep and I should tell you that I do pay for a membership on my canary Goodwin or is it
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,304	| IOT191 |	All of them
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,096	| IOT191 |	Wow
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,376	| IOT191 |	All of them
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,704	| IOT191 |	So I have the $170 all in one
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:27,008	| IOT191 |	That's the camera and the climate monitor that you are
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:31,616	| IOT191 |	Alerting to but they do have just a regular camera only without the sensors 99
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,640	| IOT191 |	Endoflex
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,944	| IOT191 |	Is 199 that's an indoor outdoor
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:37,248	| IOT191 |	They probably don't need a secondary camera but if they do
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:40,320	| IOT191 |	So right now they're all free with the membership
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:41,600	| IOT191 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,392	| IOT191 |	Go get to one for each of your daughter
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,464	| IOT191 |	Okay did you have reduced prices if you don't want to
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:48,256	| IOT191 |	Hey you know the service fee and
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,048	| IOT191 |	Salon so I think they're all
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:54,400	| IOT191 |	$50 the all-in-one is $50 off the view is just the camera that's $50 off
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,680	| IOT191 |	Endoflex is $30
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:58,496	| IOT191 |	And you pay for the subscription and you find it worthwhile
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:05,408	| IOT191 |	I do although most of the alerts motion detection and the snapshots of what's going on my house are my dog running around
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:08,992	| IOT191 |	I'll be in class and my Apple watch will buzz in the middle fast
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,528	| IOT191 |	There is normally around the house
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,296	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,576	| IOT191 |	In case you're wondering
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:13,344	| IOT191 |	The
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,368	| IOT191 |	Terry has home kits
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:16,672	| IOT191 |	But it also has
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,208	| IOT191 |	Limited Google in Amazon
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,768	| IOT191 |	So what it does is it can tell you like
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,560	| IOT191 |	The temperature but right now it doesn't give you
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,096	| IOT191 |	Visual displays for
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,912	| IOT191 |	However Canary says that
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,680	| IOT191 |	Basically
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,192	| IOT191 |	They're working on
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,520	| IOT191 |	They are talking to Google and
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,800	| IOT191 |	Amazon about
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:33,568	| IOT191 |	Deeper integration
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:34,848	| IOT191 |	Mary
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:36,896	| IOT191 |	But for now they support
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:40,224	| IOT191 |	Mattamy on the Echo Show and spot for displays
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,248	| IOT191 |	And Google Assistant
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:41,760	| IOT191 |	Google home
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,296	| IOT191 |	But not with the display
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,088	| IOT191 |	There you go
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:47,136	| IOT191 |	So that'll keep the daughters
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:47,904	| IOT191 |	Safer
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,440	| IOT191 |	What can I do for
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,976	| IOT191 |	I don't know seeing in the dark
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,768	| IOT191 |	Seeing in the dark
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:53,280	| IOT191 |	I like that
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,816	| IOT191 |	Lady
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,840	| IOT191 |	We decided that
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,120	| IOT191 |	We didn't want to
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,144	| IOT191 |	Send you down the Hub
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,680	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:01,216	| IOT191 |	We are going to recommend you by the
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,008	| IOT191 |	Tp-link
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,288	| IOT191 |	Casa that's Casa with a k
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,080	| IOT191 |	Smart Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,616	| IOT191 |	LED bulbs
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:09,152	| IOT191 |	I am going with
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,456	| IOT191 |	I kind of want colors for them because they're
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,480	| IOT191 |	Post-college
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:16,064	| IOT191 |	Just having some colors is kind of nice but if you just want to if you want to get to
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,088	| IOT191 |	Japan CD
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,624	| IOT191 |	Dimmable are tunable White
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| IOT191 |	Range from about
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:24,512	| IOT191 |	$20 to about $30 depending on if you want dimmable or tunable White
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:25,792	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,072	| IOT191 |	Those are
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,864	| IOT191 |	They're good lights
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:32,448	| IOT191 |	They work with Google Assistant they work with Madam a don't work with homekit
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:36,032	| IOT191 |	Keep that in mind a couple bulbs there
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,080	| IOT191 |	In their lives or in their fixtures
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,872	| IOT191 |	Define the downside is
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:44,480	| IOT191 |	They will have to leave their light switches on all the time and if the power goes out
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,016	| IOT191 |	In their homes then
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,528	| IOT191 |	Yeah the lights
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,320	| IOT191 |	Lizard like the downsides
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:51,392	| IOT191 |	If they have homekit
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,440	| IOT191 |	Probably would
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| IOT191 |	Say maybe the life
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:55,488	| IOT191 |	Text bulbs
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,352	| IOT191 |	Yeah but they're super expensive soap
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,912	| IOT191 |	Yes indeed so there you go and then we also
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,936	| IOT191 |	It'd be nice and
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:06,752	| IOT191 |	For them to be able to connect there
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:08,032	| IOT191 |	Devices
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,800	| IOT191 |	2
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,080	| IOT191 |	But we haven't actually talked about it
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,384	| IOT191 |	Mitchell sister
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:13,920	| IOT191 |	I don't recommend Siri
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,736	| IOT191 |	You're fine with that
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:20,064	| IOT191 |	So I would go with either of Google assistant or madam
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:24,672	| IOT191 |	I would recommend on the cheaper end with a display the Google home hub
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,464	| IOT191 |	That is the brand new
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:30,560	| IOT191 |	Tom Hudson Google branded smart display
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:32,608	| IOT191 |	Google branded smart display right now it is
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,888	| IOT191 |	$99
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:34,656	| IOT191 |	Black Friday
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| IOT191 |	Normally it's about a hunter
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,704	| IOT191 |	$50
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:43,104	| IOT191 |	So that's one option the other option is going with the Madam a universe and in that case you
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,896	| IOT191 |	Who would get probably an echo.
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:48,992	| IOT191 |	Unless you wanted to go all fancy and get an Echo Show with this player and Echo spot
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,784	| IOT191 |	What's the display I would just do it.
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,296	| IOT191 |	Honestly
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,880	| IOT191 |	Yeah unless they're going to listen to music then maybe get
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,904	| IOT191 |	The full-sized Echo
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,696	| IOT191 |	There you go with the second gen II
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,256	| IOT191 |	Which is very nice so
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,304	| IOT191 |	Those two and now that you've got those
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,352	| IOT191 |	Bunch of picture ecosystem
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,376	| IOT191 |	How do you say
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,168	| IOT191 |	Give them away to make their television
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:10,240	| IOT191 |	Smart because they can build these routines around stuff like
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,264	| IOT191 |	Movie time
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,288	| IOT191 |	Impress their friends
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,056	| IOT191 |	Lights dimming
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:14,848	| IOT191 |	TV turns on to Netflix
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:17,664	| IOT191 |	So for that you're either going to go with a Chromecast.
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,432	| IOT191 |	Like 35
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:21,248	| IOT191 |	If you're in the Google world or an Amazon fire
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,272	| IOT191 |	TV stick
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,552	| IOT191 |	Anime inside
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,600	| IOT191 |	That's about 25 bucks so
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,880	| IOT191 |	But that in and you should be able
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:29,184	| IOT191 |	Control your television using those options
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,720	| IOT191 |	If you wanted retained
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,744	| IOT191 |	Neutrality
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,536	| IOT191 |	I have a $99 Logitech
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,608	| IOT191 |	Harmony home hub
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,888	| IOT191 |	And that also
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,912	| IOT191 |	Covers things like
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:39,936	| IOT191 |	Speakers
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,960	| IOT191 |	If they have external
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,472	| IOT191 |	Speaker smatswich
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:45,056	| IOT191 |	So it's like it's on the basics and it's not terribly
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:48,896	| IOT191 |	It is not you got television lighting security
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,176	| IOT191 |	And a digital assistant
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,480	| IOT191 |	Which you know and if you want to throw in some spots
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:52,992	| IOT191 |	Spark plugs
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,272	| IOT191 |	They range from
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:59,392	| IOT191 |	Ridiculously cheap like right now for Black Friday Amazon has their smart plug for like
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,672	| IOT191 |	Like five bucks extra with
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,440	| IOT191 |	If you buy a.
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,720	| IOT191 |	Warren Echo thing
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:07,584	| IOT191 |	Otherwise it's $25 and for any Google related smart plug
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,632	| IOT191 |	You can go with WeMo or the tp-link
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,656	| IOT191 |	Casa Sol
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:11,680	| IOT191 |	That get you started
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:14,240	| IOT191 |	And hopefully your daughters will open those
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,008	| IOT191 |	Love them
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,544	| IOT191 |	And feel safe secure
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,056	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:19,616	| IOT191 |	And they they can't even communicate with each other
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:23,200	| IOT191 |	Using the smart speakers because there's calling built-in a boat that
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:25,248	| IOT191 |	Yes unless you get one the anime version
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:26,784	| IOT191 |	The other the Google version
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,320	| IOT191 |	...
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,624	| IOT191 |	So don't do that don't do that
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:32,672	| IOT191 |	Just get your whole family sucked in on one device
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:36,768	| IOT191 |	All right and all of those can move with them and their systems that
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:37,792	| IOT191 |	Ingrosso
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,072	| IOT191 |	That's
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,120	| IOT191 |	Apples for long time to come
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,400	| IOT191 |	If they want
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,168	| IOT191 |	All right
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:46,240	| IOT191 |	That concludes this portion of the show
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:48,288	| IOT191 |	And if you stay tuned you're going to hear about
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:48,800	| IOT191 |	I will
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,848	| IOT191 |	Printers with malware
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,616	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,640	| IOT191 |	Diabetes
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:55,200	| IOT191 |	How The Internet of Things is changing
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:57,504	| IOT191 |	Care for diabetes and also
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,552	| IOT191 |	Why security is becoming so
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:00,832	| IOT191 |	In medical
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,600	| IOT191 |	All devices
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,160	| IOT191 |	So stay tuned for all of this and we'll see you next week
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:12,352	| IOT191 |	Hey everybody we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,376	| IOT191 |	Fender and I have
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,656	| IOT191 |	Alex Gallant Whois
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:17,216	| IOT191 |	Chief security researcher at bitdefender
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,240	| IOT191 |	You're just talk to us
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,264	| IOT191 |	About printers
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,544	| IOT191 |	Alex
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:22,592	| IOT191 |	Statistics from about 2000
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:25,152	| IOT191 |	Defender box units running in North America show that
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,432	| IOT191 |	Half of iot Gadget
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,968	| IOT191 |	Identified as
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:29,760	| IOT191 |	Had a weak password
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:31,808	| IOT191 |	This could indicate that owners never bothered
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,088	| IOT191 |	Factory access
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:35,136	| IOT191 |	Or they just chose a really bad
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:36,672	| IOT191 |	But really
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:42,304	| IOT191 |	How much damage could a printer do
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:44,352	| IOT191 |	Access
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,704	| IOT191 |	Wow
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:22,240	| IOT191 |	So it sounds like someone
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:22,752	| IOT191 |	Could use this printer
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:24,800	| IOT191 |	Privacy how could that have
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:12,416	| IOT191 |	This is why we're actually
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:20,096	| IOT191 |	Unsecured
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:25,728	| IOT191 |	You should probably get
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:32,128	| IOT191 |	Scary so what can I use or do if they discover that
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,664	| IOT191 |	Best and want to secure their printer
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:38,016	| IOT191 |	First of all
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:46,976	| IOT191 |	Especially
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:55,168	| IOT191 |	Make sure.
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:59,520	| IOT191 |	Awesome so where can I go to find out more about bitdefender
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:14,112	| IOT191 |	Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,880	| IOT191 |	This is your house
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,160	| IOT191 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,952	| IOT191 |	And today's guest is Mike
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,720	| IOT191 |	Nelson
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,256	| IOT191 |	How are you doing
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,792	| IOT191 |	Hey Stacy I'm great
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:22,560	| IOT191 |	Thank you thanks for having me
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:25,632	| IOT191 |	I'm super glad you're going to be on the show
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:28,704	| IOT191 |	Because you have a job
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,472	| IOT191 |	Will probably
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:32,288	| IOT191 |	Touch on a little bit
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:33,824	| IOT191 |	What is a talk about using
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:34,848	| IOT191 |	Two devices
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:36,896	| IOT191 |	Which
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:40,736	| IOT191 |	It feels like a really big opportunity
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:45,088	| IOT191 |	Talk to us first a little bit about your history
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,112	| IOT191 |	With a disease
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,648	| IOT191 |	Absolutely I'm excited
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,208	| IOT191 |	Discussion with CIA I was like nah
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,512	| IOT191 |	With type 1 diabetes at the age of
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,280	| IOT191 |	16
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:54,560	| IOT191 |	So I've had it for
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,096	| IOT191 |	Coming on 24 years
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:38:00,448	| IOT191 |	And it's been amazing to see the evolution of treatment I mean what I was diagnosed
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:02,240	| IOT191 |	I had to poke my finger and weights
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,520	| IOT191 |	45 seconds
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,568	| IOT191 |	To get a glucose reading that I have
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,592	| IOT191 |	How to take a shot
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:08,384	| IOT191 |	Insulin about 45 minutes
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,176	| IOT191 |	Before I ate the lobby on set
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,968	| IOT191 |	And today
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:14,784	| IOT191 |	You compare that to the technology and the benefits of
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,320	| IOT191 |	Evolution that's happened
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,344	| IOT191 |	Today I
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:21,184	| IOT191 |	Get a glucose reading from a sensor that sits on my arm every 5 minutes
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,328	| IOT191 |	High insulin
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,352	| IOT191 |	Also this thing
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:32,960	| IOT191 |	Dramatic improvements in the info and then I can take a shot right before I have to leave
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,264	| IOT191 |	And the insulin gets into my system and
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,824	| IOT191 |	Becomes active right away so just a dramatic
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:39,616	| IOT191 |	Change org last 24 years
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:43,968	| IOT191 |	And the technology is doing a lot of things to make the management of diabetes
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:44,992	| IOT191 |	Much easier
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,016	| IOT191 |	Awesome in
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:48,064	| IOT191 |	For your parents when you are 16
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:50,880	| IOT191 |	Imagine that's a really overwhelming
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,696	| IOT191 |	Like oh you got it
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,208	| IOT191 |	Be responsive
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,744	| IOT191 |	For the 16 year old boy
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,536	| IOT191 |	Maybe amazing
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:39:00,096	| IOT191 |	That's a lot. So what kind of tracking
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,120	| IOT191 |	Was in place
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:01,632	| IOT191 |	What was your life
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,192	| IOT191 |	It really wasn't for my parents
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:04,960	| IOT191 |	Terrifying
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:07,264	| IOT191 |	I think that a remarkable job
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,544	| IOT191 |	Responsible
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,360	| IOT191 |	Stay on top of my blood sugar
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:18,272	| IOT191 |	You're not really responsible but you're getting into that age
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,552	| IOT191 |	Encourage me to
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,832	| IOT191 |	Weather I was playing sports
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:23,904	| IOT191 |	Make sure I check my blood sugar still there if I was
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:29,280	| IOT191 |	Sleepover at my friend's house to make sure I check my blood sugar before I went to bed and making sure that wasn't dropped
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,816	| IOT191 |	But the truth is they had
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:32,608	| IOT191 |	No way of knowing and
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,888	| IOT191 |	The technology is such
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,168	| IOT191 |	Today where
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,960	| IOT191 |	You know I travel to work
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:37,984	| IOT191 |	Regularly
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,520	| IOT191 |	And I wear this
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:45,664	| IOT191 |	Continuous glucose monitor that has a Bluetooth connection to my mobile device Linux
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,992	| IOT191 |	Cloud and I can share my what's
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,016	| IOT191 |	Sugar levels with
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:52,320	| IOT191 |	My wife so what I'm traveling with my blood sugar
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,856	| IOT191 |	Drop some middle of the night
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,136	| IOT191 |	She'll get him noticed
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,160	| IOT191 |	Call the hotel
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:56,928	| IOT191 |	Help me get
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,952	| IOT191 |	The attention that I need
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,976	| IOT191 |	The Peace of Mind
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,792	| IOT191 |	It comes from that connectivity has been just like janky
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,608	| IOT191 |	All right and now
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,144	| IOT191 |	As a parent unfortunately
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,704	| IOT191 |	You have a lot more experience nausea
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,728	| IOT191 |	I just personally but
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:10,496	| IOT191 |	With your daughter
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:12,032	| IOT191 |	She is also been diagnosed with
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,568	| IOT191 |	Type wooden actually
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:15,104	| IOT191 |	Before we get to this we should talk to
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,128	| IOT191 |	Skip a little bit about
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:17,152	| IOT191 |	Type 1 vs Type
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:17,664	| IOT191 |	Type 2 diabetes
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,712	| IOT191 |	Yeso type 1
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,480	| IOT191 |	Pretty easy
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:24,832	| IOT191 |	Type 1 is a disease where the pancreas actually completely stops working
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:26,112	| IOT191 |	It's an autoimmune
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:29,184	| IOT191 |	Disease that's caused by your body attacking the pancreas
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:30,208	| IOT191 |	Your body just stopped
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:31,488	| IOT191 |	Producing insulin completely
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:34,048	| IOT191 |	Type 2 is typically triggered by
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:37,376	| IOT191 |	Whether it's obesity or women during pregnancy
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:39,424	| IOT191 |	But it's where the pancreas
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:40,448	| IOT191 |	What's effective
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,472	| IOT191 |	And there are oral meds
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,264	| IOT191 |	We taking
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:47,104	| IOT191 |	Treat that whereas with type 1 insulin injections
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:47,872	| IOT191 |	Are required
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:51,200	| IOT191 |	The pancreas
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:55,552	| IOT191 |	Completely stops working because the body attacks it whereas with type 2 it's just
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:58,624	| IOT191 |	The pancreas can't keep up with the needs that your body has
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:03,232	| IOT191 |	Okay and when there's a problem like when there's too little sugar or too much
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:06,048	| IOT191 |	Can really injure yourself in both case
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,120	| IOT191 |	Fall unconscious and
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:09,888	| IOT191 |	Yes
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,680	| IOT191 |	If you were to take too much insulin what happens if
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:18,336	| IOT191 |	Please let me know some of your listeners may have felt a big workout you get a little bit light-headed a little
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:21,152	| IOT191 |	That's typically symptoms of low blood sugar
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:24,992	| IOT191 |	And your body does a really good job naturally regulated
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:27,296	| IOT191 |	Because your pancreas only releases
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:28,832	| IOT191 |	As much in Salinas
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:30,624	| IOT191 |	But with diabetes
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:32,160	| IOT191 |	You have to act as your own thing
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:33,440	| IOT191 |	What type 1 diabetes
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,488	| IOT191 |	And so you have to know how much insulin
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,792	| IOT191 |	Put into your system so if you put in too much
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,328	| IOT191 |	And then you don't eat enough.
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:42,400	| IOT191 |	Cover the amount of insulin that you've taken it could be catastrophic
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:45,216	| IOT191 |	It can put you into what's called a diabetic
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:47,264	| IOT191 |	Tacoma where you lose consciousness
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,800	| IOT191 |	It could become very damaging
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:53,151	| IOT191 |	Okay so just not till like belabor the point here but this is something that
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:54,431	| IOT191 |	Is really
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,711	| IOT191 |	Tough to manage
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,735	| IOT191 |	It requires
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,783	| IOT191 |	Paying attention to a lot of
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,295	| IOT191 |	Different Factor
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,575	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:03,135	| IOT191 |	Consequences are pretty dire so
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,159	| IOT191 |	Your daughter
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:04,927	| IOT191 |	She is
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:05,695	| IOT191 |	4
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:07,487	| IOT191 |	Yes to turn 4 this year
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:08,511	| IOT191 |	And renamed
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,279	| IOT191 |	Olivia
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:10,047	| IOT191 |	She is just
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:11,839	| IOT191 |	The sweetest little girl
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:15,167	| IOT191 |	Last year's a little over a year ago she was
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,703	| IOT191 |	3 I was out of work
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,471	| IOT191 |	Scrapping
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:18,495	| IOT191 |	I got a call from my wife
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,383	| IOT191 |	15 minutes
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,151	| IOT191 |	What are the signs
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,175	| IOT191 |	Type 1 diabetes
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,967	| IOT191 |	Did you try to actually your body's natural
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:28,991	| IOT191 |	Responses to try
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,039	| IOT191 |	Watch the sugars out of your system
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:34,367	| IOT191 |	So you get really thirsty and try to consume a lot of water to try to
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:38,207	| IOT191 |	Disperse the sugars that she was having that symptom in my wife called and said
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:40,767	| IOT191 |	Yes I took him to the doctor in my heart
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,815	| IOT191 |	Knowing what
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:45,375	| IOT191 |	The Simpsons aren't you know I hope for the best but
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:49,983	| IOT191 |	Probably the worst
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:50,751	| IOT191 |	4 blood sugar
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:54,591	| IOT191 |	I was really high and so we kind of self-diagnose training took her into
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:56,127	| IOT191 |	The doctor and they confirmed that
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,663	| IOT191 |	She was a type 1 diabetic
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:00,223	| IOT191 |	And so what does that mean
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,991	| IOT191 |	For a child
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,015	| IOT191 |	What does that mean you have to
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:02,783	| IOT191 |	Just start doing
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,575	| IOT191 |	Yasso
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,623	| IOT191 |	Diabetics require insulin
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:08,159	| IOT191 |	Before every meal
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,695	| IOT191 |	Olivia and myself
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,743	| IOT191 |	Take the right amount of insulin discovered
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,279	| IOT191 |	Food that we're going to eat
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,559	| IOT191 |	And so my
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,839	| IOT191 |	Sweet little four-year-old
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:21,471	| IOT191 |	We started by doing a finger poke and she's now emerging is now using connected technology so she no longer has
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,751	| IOT191 |	Fingerpoke switches
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:23,775	| IOT191 |	Been amazing
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:30,175	| IOT191 |	But we look at her blood sugar and see where she is and based on the readings that week at we will administer a certain amount of
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:33,247	| IOT191 |	Going to try to keep her blood sugar in the right range
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,015	| IOT191 |	Cancel
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:35,295	| IOT191 |	We do that and then it's
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,319	| IOT191 |	Continuous monitoring
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,367	| IOT191 |	She goes to school
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:42,463	| IOT191 |	Season preschool and so when she goes to school we send her a little meter with her
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:47,327	| IOT191 |	So that we at all times have connections we know what her blood sugar is at all times
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,607	| IOT191 |	A friend's house
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,679	| IOT191 |	When he goes to tumbling we send her little meter with her
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:53,983	| IOT191 |	And it gives us the Peace of Mind
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,263	| IOT191 |	Shandong time
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,055	| IOT191 |	What her blood sugar is and so
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:58,335	| IOT191 |	Still outside from the
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:00,639	| IOT191 |	Insulin injections and
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:03,199	| IOT191 |	That it really is a disease that you just have to monitor
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:07,551	| IOT191 |	And you have to pay attention to and do the right things to keep your blood sugar in the right range
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:11,135	| IOT191 |	Okay in Fright now there are lots of options out there I know that
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,159	| IOT191 |	They're definitely
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:13,951	| IOT191 |	Connected options out there that
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:15,999	| IOT191 |	Let you monitor your own
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:16,767	| IOT191 |	Or someone else
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| IOT191 |	Is blood sugar
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,303	| IOT191 |	Surely not
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,071	| IOT191 |	Basically
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:20,607	| IOT191 |	And then there is a whole subset
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:21,887	| IOT191 |	Parents
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,399	| IOT191 |	Some people out there
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:25,983	| IOT191 |	Together their own devices to do this
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:28,287	| IOT191 |	Talk to us about the options that are out there
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:28,799	| IOT191 |	What kind
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,335	| IOT191 |	Factors you think about is
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:33,663	| IOT191 |	Yeah so you don't from me it's really just
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,711	| IOT191 |	Knowing that all times when her sugar is
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,479	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:39,039	| IOT191 |	The fact that I could put my phone down right now Stacey
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:41,599	| IOT191 |	And pull up and see where her blood sugar is
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,367	| IOT191 |	Is
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:43,647	| IOT191 |	Dutch I can't tell you
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:45,183	| IOT191 |	Peace of mind that I can't visit
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,975	| IOT191 |	I didn't have that she goes
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:49,791	| IOT191 |	Tumbling if she goes to a friend's house or she goes to
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:52,863	| IOT191 |	Glucose reaction and she goes low
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:55,935	| IOT191 |	Jenna Bentley could pass out and nobody would know what's going on
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:57,727	| IOT191 |	And so having that
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,751	| IOT191 |	Data in front of us
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:04,127	| IOT191 |	The track it at all times and it's not just there but it my phone will start beeping at me
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:05,919	| IOT191 |	If your blood sugar starts dropping
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:09,247	| IOT191 |	How to quickly and so it's almost a preventative way to
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:10,015	| IOT191 |	Channing Frye
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,039	| IOT191 |	Extract
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:14,623	| IOT191 |	Continuous glucose monitors are a great
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,391	| IOT191 |	Innovation
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:18,463	| IOT191 |	Aside from glucose monitors and I think that's the most
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,999	| IOT191 |	Exciting innovation
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:23,839	| IOT191 |	But I've seen them last 20 years the next is really what's happening with
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:25,119	| IOT191 |	Insulin pumps right now
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,911	| IOT191 |	Insulin pumps have been
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:33,311	| IOT191 |	You wearing like a pager on your belt and you program the amount of insulin that you need and it administers it through it
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:36,127	| IOT191 |	Tube disconnected in your belly at all times
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:36,895	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:39,199	| IOT191 |	Insulin pump
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:41,759	| IOT191 |	But insulin pumps now are starting to develop
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:43,807	| IOT191 |	Where
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:45,343	| IOT191 |	They have the capability
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:47,391	| IOT191 |	When your blood sugar starts to go up
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:49,439	| IOT191 |	The insulin pump is smart enough to
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:51,487	| IOT191 |	Send a text that and start to
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:53,279	| IOT191 |	Administer insulin
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:54,047	| IOT191 |	True
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:56,351	| IOT191 |	A connection that has with the glucose monitor
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:57,119	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:46:01,215	| IOT191 |	Glucose monitor in addition to sending the reading to my phone
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:02,239	| IOT191 |	It also send it
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,007	| IOT191 |	The pump
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:04,031	| IOT191 |	And the pump
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:07,359	| IOT191 |	Reads that and then makes a decision based on the levels
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:08,127	| IOT191 |	And can help you
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:08,639	| IOT191 |	Self correct
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:12,223	| IOT191 |	To keep you in the right range and it's just amazing technology
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:13,247	| IOT191 |	And you know
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,015	| IOT191 |	Benefits
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:17,855	| IOT191 |	Open up the madness that disease with those types of technology is just
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:18,879	| IOT191 |	Awesome
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:22,207	| IOT191 |	It's probably comforting to have this level of data
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:22,975	| IOT191 |	Available to you
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:23,487	| IOT191 |	You on your phone
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:25,535	| IOT191 |	Are there things that you
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:27,071	| IOT191 |	Are concerned about Earth
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,351	| IOT191 |	You're kind of like
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,655	| IOT191 |	Who did this
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,423	| IOT191 |	Yeah that's a great question
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:35,519	| IOT191 |	Everytime I pull up my phone and I look at is glucose reading
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,799	| IOT191 |	In the back of my head
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:37,567	| IOT191 |	Because of what I do
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:38,847	| IOT191 |	Professionally I think
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,895	| IOT191 |	Integrity
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:41,919	| IOT191 |	Is that accurate
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:45,247	| IOT191 |	Inaccurate Stacy as if
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:47,295	| IOT191 |	Glucose reading
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:49,087	| IOT191 |	Comes to my phone and it says
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:49,855	| IOT191 |	300
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:50,623	| IOT191 |	50
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:53,695	| IOT191 |	Their blood sugar is really a hundred and I administer
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:55,743	| IOT191 |	Her insulin based on that reading
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:56,511	| IOT191 |	That event
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:57,279	| IOT191 |	Can be catastrophic
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,607	| IOT191 |	Utilizing glucose monitor
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,375	| IOT191 |	That's my boy
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:03,423	| IOT191 |	Integrity
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,191	| IOT191 |	Data
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:06,495	| IOT191 |	And making sure that the readings that I'm getting
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:08,543	| IOT191 |	Valid and so that when I
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:10,847	| IOT191 |	Creeper and give her the insulin it's going to be the right
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:13,407	| IOT191 |	Right so that data doesn't get up
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:14,175	| IOT191 |	Go to the cloud and then
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,455	| IOT191 |	And somehow get sent to the wrong
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:15,967	| IOT191 |	Play Store
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:18,271	| IOT191 |	Your data is mixed up or anything like that
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| IOT191 |	Yeah or a man-in-the-middle attack
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:24,671	| IOT191 |	Of course somebody manipulates the data and you know it ends up with an incorrect value
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:27,487	| IOT191 |	Cast true crime stories I can see these now
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:29,535	| IOT191 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:32,095	| IOT191 |	And I can't even really rely on my
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:35,423	| IOT191 |	Home automation systems to work in concert like
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:37,983	| IOT191 |	That's so I still have problems making sure that when I
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:38,751	| IOT191 |	Leave my house
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,543	| IOT191 |	Lights actually turn on
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:41,567	| IOT191 |	Like they're supposed to after 7
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:44,127	| IOT191 |	So the idea of relying
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:45,407	| IOT191 |	Something for
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,455	| IOT191 |	Your safety and your daughter say
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:48,735	| IOT191 |	Especially
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,759	| IOT191 |	That feels very fraught
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:51,039	| IOT191 |	So
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:52,063	| IOT191 |	How do you evaluate
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,855	| IOT191 |	Disease are connected Prada
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:56,927	| IOT191 |	Yours connected to the internet or do they have a cloud connection
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,463	| IOT191 |	They have a clock next
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:48:00,767	| IOT191 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:02,815	| IOT191 |	Amanda wifi-connected
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:06,655	| IOT191 |	Okay so you are the head of iot security attack
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:07,423	| IOT191 |	Company called digits
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,959	| IOT191 |	So it's not like you're
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:14,079	| IOT191 |	Not like your normal person running through life
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:16,895	| IOT191 |	How do you evaluate the
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:17,663	| IOT191 |	Security of the state
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:19,711	| IOT191 |	Yeah you know
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:23,039	| IOT191 |	Consider myself a unique consumer in that regard where
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:27,391	| IOT191 |	I don't think most consumers when you go and buy these devices are thinking about
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:29,183	| IOT191 |	The security posture of them
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:31,999	| IOT191 |	And if they're vulnerable to malware or man
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:37,887	| IOT191 |	Getting in and taking control of the device
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:39,679	| IOT191 |	Have to worry about that
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:42,239	| IOT191 |	I'll tell you the story I mean I went in
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,775	| IOT191 |	When my daughter was diagnosed
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,055	| IOT191 |	They require diabetics
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:47,359	| IOT191 |	Go to the hospital and they get the blood sugar under
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:50,431	| IOT191 |	Education
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:54,015	| IOT191 |	Medical devices
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:55,551	| IOT191 |	Some of which I
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:49:00,671	| IOT191 |	Had Direct knowledge of Canada security posturing what they're doing and you know it occurred to me how
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:01,183	| IOT191 |	Personal
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:05,279	| IOT191 |	Spices can become for consumers very rapidly
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:06,303	| IOT191 |	And
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:08,863	| IOT191 |	You know I've been working to solve these challenges
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:09,631	| IOT191 |	4 years
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,655	| IOT191 |	In my profession
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,679	| IOT191 |	It all
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:12,191	| IOT191 |	Different vertical
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:14,751	| IOT191 |	And all the sudden I was hit with this
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:17,055	| IOT191 |	It's very personal dilemma
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:18,591	| IOT191 |	Mike Ashley
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:21,151	| IOT191 |	What if something were to happen to this device while my daughter
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:24,735	| IOT191 |	Let's get control of that infusion pump
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:27,551	| IOT191 |	Edward to manipulate the amount of
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:29,343	| IOT191 |	Trucks that is being administered
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:31,903	| IOT191 |	Those things in the results of those kitty cats
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:34,975	| IOT191 |	So as a consumer I tried to take a deep breath
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:38,303	| IOT191 |	And say I don't believe that their malicious actors in This Hospital
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,839	| IOT191 |	Daughter
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:43,167	| IOT191 |	And even though I know the security vulnerabilities in this device
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:46,751	| IOT191 |	Had to take a deep breath and say you know I don't think the rest
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:49,055	| IOT191 |	Because of a lot of
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:49,823	| IOT191 |	Factors
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:50,591	| IOT191 |	But those risks
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:52,127	| IOT191 |	Depending on
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:53,407	| IOT191 |	This circumstance
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:54,175	| IOT191 |	Risks
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:57,759	| IOT191 |	Can be real and so it's consumers I think education and under
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:50:00,319	| IOT191 |	10 things that they can do with personal device
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,855	| IOT191 |	Good password crack
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:04,159	| IOT191 |	Making sure that
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:04,927	| IOT191 |	Hardcore
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:05,951	| IOT191 |	Credentials
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:08,767	| IOT191 |	Part of devices are you know those types of things
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:10,559	| IOT191 |	I think education is important
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:15,423	| IOT191 |	But ultimately Stacy I really think that the furred needs to be on the manufacturer
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:16,959	| IOT191 |	I don't think when
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:20,031	| IOT191 |	You are to take your kid to a hospital or what I took Olivia
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:22,847	| IOT191 |	I don't think I should have to ask hey is the device
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:23,615	| IOT191 |	Connecting two
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:26,431	| IOT191 |	That's being used to treat her is that at
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:26,943	| IOT191 |	Secure device
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:29,759	| IOT191 |	What doctors would look at you like you're crazy
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:31,551	| IOT191 |	Yeah most doctors wouldn't even be able to know
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:33,343	| IOT191 |	I mean maybe like
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:35,903	| IOT191 |	Yeah there's no way they would install
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:38,719	| IOT191 |	I believe it's consumers we have the right to assume
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:40,255	| IOT191 |	Security and safety
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:41,791	| IOT191 |	And if that
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:44,095	| IOT191 |	Security and safety isn't better than manufacturer
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:45,887	| IOT191 |	Just need to act responsibly
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:48,191	| IOT191 |	To get into a place where they are secure and safe
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:52,543	| IOT191 |	Sure know let's talk about is a consumer not just in the
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:54,079	| IOT191 |	Hospital but when purchasing
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:56,127	| IOT191 |	Insulin pumps
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:57,407	| IOT191 |	And glucose monitors
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:59,455	| IOT191 |	Continuous glucose monitors for your daughter
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:00,479	| IOT191 |	Did you
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,247	| IOT191 |	1
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:03,039	| IOT191 |	Were there lots of options I mean
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:06,111	| IOT191 |	Prescription device so unlike Could you actually
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:06,623	| IOT191 |	Legitimately
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:08,671	| IOT191 |	Security
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:09,951	| IOT191 |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:11,743	| IOT191 |	You can I don't think most consumers
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:14,303	| IOT191 |	Can I mean you can call the company and you could ask
EDL	00:51:14,303	00:51:16,863	| IOT191 |	And they could tell you about the different types
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:17,631	| IOT191 |	Communication
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:18,911	| IOT191 |	Protocols in what they're doing
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:25,311	| IOT191 |	Data is being encrypted
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:27,615	| IOT191 |	You have to get the right person on the phone on the other end
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:30,431	| IOT191 |	Yes
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:34,271	| IOT191 |	Cuz I can tell you I talk to people all the time and I'll ask these questions
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:34,783	| IOT191 |	And they're like
EDL	00:51:36,063	00:51:36,575	| IOT191 |	I don't know
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:41,951	| IOT191 |	It typically takes a couple phone calls to get connected to the right person
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:43,999	| IOT191 |	I do believe that that's going to be
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,535	| IOT191 |	Become more transparent
EDL	00:51:45,535	00:51:48,607	| IOT191 |	I think that manufactures and we see this manufacturer
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:52,703	| IOT191 |	Starting to disclose the things that they're doing around data encryption
EDL	00:51:52,703	00:51:56,543	| IOT191 |	Hostler practices those are two that are really low-hanging fruit
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:59,871	| IOT191 |	But you know I think consumers need to be aware of those and
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:03,455	| IOT191 |	Either go to the website to look to see if they say anything about it
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:04,223	| IOT191 |	Or ask a question
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:08,831	| IOT191 |	I'll tell you the Food and Drug Administration FDA
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:11,647	| IOT191 |	Is getting stronger and stronger on there
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:12,671	| IOT191 |	Requirements
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:13,951	| IOT191 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,999	| IOT191 |	It's because of some of the exploit for the Papas
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:18,559	| IOT191 |	And so I think the FDA is
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:19,839	| IOT191 |	Working really hard
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:21,375	| IOT191 |	To provide assurance
EDL	00:52:21,887	00:52:22,655	| IOT191 |	That
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:28,031	| IOT191 |	I talked about that consumers should know that these devices are safe and I think the FDA is working really hard
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:29,055	| IOT191 |	Figure out
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:31,103	| IOT191 |	What mechanisms they can put in place
EDL	00:52:31,103	00:52:31,871	| IOT191 |	Attest
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:35,455	| IOT191 |	Send checks to make sure that the connected devices are going on in the market
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:37,503	| IOT191 |	What kind of messaging
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:38,527	| IOT191 |	How do you think
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:39,807	| IOT191 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:40,319	| IOT191 |	Start trying
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:42,367	| IOT191 |	Bay what is really complicated
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:43,135	| IOT191 |	To Consumers
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:45,951	| IOT191 |	Like is it like a Good Housekeeping seal if
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:46,719	| IOT191 |	Approval
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:47,743	| IOT191 |	Some people talk about
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:50,047	| IOT191 |	Nutrition label for data security
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:52,095	| IOT191 |	I really don't know it all seems kind of dumb
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:53,887	| IOT191 |	Yeah it is
EDL	00:52:55,167	00:52:56,703	| IOT191 |	Heard a lot of discussions around what
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:52:59,007	| IOT191 |	Spam and really there's no
EDL	00:52:59,007	00:53:01,055	| IOT191 |	Clear I would not say that there's any
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:07,455	| IOT191 |	Strong evolution
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:08,735	| IOT191 |	On a medical device
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:10,015	| IOT191 |	Is the stamp
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:13,343	| IOT191 |	Safety that people are looking for but challenges a lot of
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:14,367	| IOT191 |	Devices that work
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:18,207	| IOT191 |	Approved by the FDA 5 years ago are now getting hacked and so
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:20,511	| IOT191 |	I think devices that have been cleared in the last
EDL	00:53:20,511	00:53:22,047	| IOT191 |	Couple years have a lot better
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:23,839	| IOT191 |	Security protection than one
EDL	00:53:23,839	00:53:26,399	| IOT191 |	Five or ten years ago that they still being used
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:27,423	| IOT191 |	Hospital
EDL	00:53:27,935	00:53:30,239	| IOT191 |	Okay I'm going to put my faith in the FDA
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:31,007	| IOT191 |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:33,055	| IOT191 |	You can put your faith in
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:38,175	| IOT191 |	Globally
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:44,063	| IOT191 |	And that team bear that just working on medical device security I think they're demonstrating
EDL	00:53:44,063	00:53:46,879	| IOT191 |	Four other regulatory bodies in other countries to follow
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:48,159	| IOT191 |	Excellent and
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:50,719	| IOT191 |	There is really nothing more personal than
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:51,487	| IOT191 |	Hearing about
EDL	00:53:51,999	00:53:53,023	| IOT191 |	Your story or
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:53,535	| IOT191 |	Water store
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:56,095	| IOT191 |	Clearly people's lives at stake
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:58,399	| IOT191 |	It's worth it
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:53:59,167	| IOT191 |	Okay
EDL	00:53:59,167	00:54:00,703	| IOT191 |	What makes thank you so much
