EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:27,136	| IOT205 |	Is a big deal this week
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:29,440	| IOT205 |	On its PSA security platform
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:30,720	| IOT205 |	And programs at work
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,000	| IOT205 |	Talk about
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:35,072	| IOT205 |	Kevin has a story for the smart home all about gestures
EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:37,888	| IOT205 |	It actually ties into Microsoft newconnect
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:38,656	| IOT205 |	Camera
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,168	| IOT205 |	For business
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:40,704	| IOT205 |	Free to talk about
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:44,800	| IOT205 |	Using a matinee in the Amazon Echo in hospitals
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,104	| IOT205 |	We got some new chips out
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:49,408	| IOT205 |	Matter of a capabilities
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,432	| IOT205 |	Discuss
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:50,944	| IOT205 |	And
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:54,016	| IOT205 |	We asked the question who should enforce
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:55,040	| IOT205 |	Federal Privacy Law
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:56,576	| IOT205 |	If we get one
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:03,232	| IOT205 |	Then we're going to run down some industrial iot news from both embedded world and Mobile World Congress that have
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,512	| IOT205 |	This week
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,024	| IOT205 |	Plus
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:10,400	| IOT205 |	Our Guest this week is Beth Carlin who is the CEO and founder of this sea change
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:10,912	| IOT205 |	Institute
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:14,496	| IOT205 |	We're going to be talking about how utilities are
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,776	| IOT205 |	Looking at the Smart Home
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,544	| IOT205 |	I'm going to
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:17,312	| IOT205 |	Control
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,336	| IOT205 |	Energy consumption
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:22,176	| IOT205 |	And we'll hear from our sponsor urbanex in
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:25,248	| IOT205 |	And what are their startups in the construction space so
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,528	| IOT205 |	All of this is
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:28,320	| IOT205 |	Coming at you in just a moment
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:31,648	| IOT205 |	Let's hear from another one of our sponsors
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:38,048	| IOT205 |	Western Digital Western Digital builds Data Solutions that enable the world to solve is bigger
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:44,448	| IOT205 |	Is challenges introducing their most advanced flash storage solution
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,216	| IOT205 |	511
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:49,056	| IOT205 |	It is built it power 5G mobile devices
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:52,896	| IOT205 |	You can play more games save more memories and binge
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:59,040	| IOT205 |	More videos so get ready for your 5G future at Western Digital.
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:04,160	| IOT205 |	Onan Kevin we are going to be talking about 5T later on the show
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,440	| IOT205 |	Woohoo
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,720	| IOT205 |	Jennifer topic
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,512	| IOT205 |	So get your jargon hat
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,328	| IOT205 |	The first
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,352	| IOT205 |	Let's talk about arm
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,888	| IOT205 |	Teechip licensing
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,936	| IOT205 |	Capri that is basically the heart of a
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,472	| IOT205 |	Every smartphone out there
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:19,008	| IOT205 |	Has a really big vision
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:20,800	| IOT205 |	OT
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,824	| IOT205 |	The chairman of SoftBank
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:26,688	| IOT205 |	Has his vision of a trillion connected devices by
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,968	| IOT205 |	2025
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,784	| IOT205 |	And I don't know if we're going to get there
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:34,624	| IOT205 |	If we do we're going to have to improve security
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,648	| IOT205 |	Holier than
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,952	| IOT205 |	Catholic Church
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| IOT205 |	Church
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,512	| IOT205 |	What arm is doing
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,280	| IOT205 |	Is
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,304	| IOT205 |	Usher at
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,840	| IOT205 |	Attack on the announcing they called the
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| IOT205 |	The PSA
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,144	| IOT205 |	And that is their security platform
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,728	| IOT205 |	What the channel is created a certification program
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:56,128	| IOT205 |	For it and apis make it easy for non semiconductor Engineers to enable the security
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,896	| IOT205 |	Elements
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,664	| IOT205 |	So
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:00,224	| IOT205 |	If you want something that security at the device level
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,760	| IOT205 |	You have to have
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,784	| IOT205 |	Some sort of
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,808	| IOT205 |	Hardware isolation
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT205 |	Hardware-based root of trust
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,880	| IOT205 |	And
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,904	| IOT205 |	A place for life
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| IOT205 |	Cryptography and Key Management
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,512	| IOT205 |	And if all those words meant nothing to you
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,048	| IOT205 |	Basically imaginative
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:17,120	| IOT205 |	A little separate room on a chip
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,912	| IOT205 |	It allows you to put all your secrets in there
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,192	| IOT205 |	And you
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,496	| IOT205 |	Can understand if someone's actually tried
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,008	| IOT205 |	Guided access
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,544	| IOT205 |	It's also
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,080	| IOT205 |	A place that can generate
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,360	| IOT205 |	Typography
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,384	| IOT205 |	So generate
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,432	| IOT205 |	Code for more secrets
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:36,320	| IOT205 |	It will boot up on its own without talking to anything else in the chips with the rest of the chip is infected
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:36,832	| IOT205 |	This area
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,928	| IOT205 |	There's more to what they've done I are going to
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,952	| IOT205 |	Talk about it
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,488	| IOT205 |	Remind me
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,536	| IOT205 |	Is partially out of something I said
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:46,816	| IOT205 |	Couple months ago
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,680	| IOT205 |	Everyone has a trusted platform module
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,216	| IOT205 |	And that
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:58,080	| IOT205 |	Chip basically verifies that the firmware on the device in this case a Chromebook
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,104	| IOT205 |	Has not been tampered with
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,664	| IOT205 |	This does more than that
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:04,224	| IOT205 |	But it is very similar
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,016	| IOT205 |	Yes so
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,552	| IOT205 |	This is design
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,320	| IOT205 |	Anythink
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:08,832	| IOT205 |	And
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:13,696	| IOT205 |	Tiny tiny MCE use big smartphone platforms
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,464	| IOT205 |	All of the above
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,000	| IOT205 |	This sort of
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| IOT205 |	Little secret room on a chip
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:22,143	| IOT205 |	Has been around for awhile to calm trusted execution environments or trusted
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:26,751	| IOT205 |	Execution modules tm30 he's chipmakers have been putting them on their silicon
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:27,775	| IOT205 |	While
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,567	| IOT205 |	The challenge has been
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,871	| IOT205 |	If you don't know how to engineer
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,151	| IOT205 |	Silicon
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:39,807	| IOT205 |	If you're just like this normal person who's but you don't have the budget to hire like a hundred really smart people
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| IOT205 |	2
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| IOT205 |	Develop your bored
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,927	| IOT205 |	What happens as you don't actually usually enable
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:48,255	| IOT205 |	Secure element so it's their butt
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:48,767	| IOT205 |	You don't actually have
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,095	| IOT205 |	It really doesn't have any security if you don't use it
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:52,863	| IOT205 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,679	| IOT205 |	I got this awesome room in my house if we never go into it
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:00,799	| IOT205 |	So what they've done is they've added apis that make it really easy for you to like
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,847	| IOT205 |	Open up the door to that room and start playing
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,383	| IOT205 |	With those tools in a way that is familiar
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:10,527	| IOT205 |	And now it's actually leverage some of the stuff I can learning in my Java class
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,855	| IOT205 |	So there's encapsulated all of this functionality
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,135	| IOT205 |	And the data
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:18,463	| IOT205 |	Accessible
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:22,047	| IOT205 |	Harbin manufacturer arrest actually add software to the product to make it work
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:27,167	| IOT205 |	Can mess around with us they have access to it to use it and beef up security
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,679	| IOT205 |	But in a
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,983	| IOT205 |	Controlled way
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| IOT205 |	So this is good
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,567	| IOT205 |	And even better is
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:37,151	| IOT205 |	They basically set different levels
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:37,663	| IOT205 |	A certification
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,527	| IOT205 |	At level 1 you can most basic security
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,807	| IOT205 |	Level two
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,135	| IOT205 |	Little fancy rat takes about a month to get your level 2 certification
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:52,255	| IOT205 |	We don't even know what it is yet it's super super fancy and
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,815	| IOT205 |	It's going to take a while nobody has that yet but
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:06:00,447	| IOT205 |	Cypress microchip Nordic nxp
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT205 |	St micro silicon labs
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,591	| IOT205 |	Taiwanese company called new vote on all of those guys are implemented
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| IOT205 |	Best so
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,711	| IOT205 |	Most of them will have level 1 certified chips out on the market
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,527	| IOT205 |	They're going to beat that up as time goes on
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,879	| IOT205 |	It also this whole platform that arm is introduced with
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,647	| IOT205 |	PSA
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,927	| IOT205 |	Is also
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,279	| IOT205 |	Ties into other security efforts likes UL has their own security
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,071	| IOT205 |	This fits in with
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:27,583	| IOT205 |	So
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,631	| IOT205 |	What we're seeing is both
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:33,983	| IOT205 |	The ability to standardize some basic good security practices for
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,751	| IOT205 |	Hardware level
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,847	| IOT205 |	Cross a bunch of different standards organizations which should help
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,127	| IOT205 |	Pool industry
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:44,223	| IOT205 |	And they're making it easier for application developer
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,503	| IOT205 |	Actually
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| IOT205 |	So this is a big deal
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| IOT205 |	Really promise
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,367	| IOT205 |	I'm very excited
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:56,767	| IOT205 |	It is it's very good we heart on security for iot devices all the time for good reason
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,047	| IOT205 |	There is a downside
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,327	| IOT205 |	And that is
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,351	| IOT205 |	Tell me the towns
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:03,423	| IOT205 |	None of the devices you have or capable of this today
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,543	| IOT205 |	So you're going to have to buy a new devices it
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,079	| IOT205 |	You want this type of security
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,151	| IOT205 |	And you do you want this type of security
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| IOT205 |	Alright well
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,759	| IOT205 |	After Kevin has Rain on My Parade with
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,599	| IOT205 |	To let him get you all excited about something
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,879	| IOT205 |	Fresh poke and
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:27,999	| IOT205 |	At Mobile World Congress lots of news about gesture
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,535	| IOT205 |	Based phones
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,071	| IOT205 |	And Automotive
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:32,863	| IOT205 |	Even
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,143	| IOT205 |	Camera for Enterprise
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,679	| IOT205 |	Rochester
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:42,591	| IOT205 |	I do talk about gestures and yes this is listen to that funky loopy space that I often find myself in as unforward
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,895	| IOT205 |	You would mention some of the announcements it
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:50,527	| IOT205 |	Mwc the sweet BMW for example with showing off their natural interaction
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:53,599	| IOT205 |	Platform which is expected in 2021
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,439	| IOT205 |	It uses voice capabilities as most new cars do today either
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:00,511	| IOT205 |	Natively or through a f****** cuz I see you can answer the car
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:04,351	| IOT205 |	They're going to add gesture controls as well and I love that because
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:08,703	| IOT205 |	I'm driving I-90 to say change the radio
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,239	| IOT205 |	Station of do something
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| IOT205 |	Take me to look away
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,287	| IOT205 |	That's bad
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,335	| IOT205 |	So which gestures you can
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:18,431	| IOT205 |	Potentially at your radio and maybe flip your finger up and we go to the next
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,991	| IOT205 |	Channel for example so that is cool
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:24,319	| IOT205 |	It also adding smarts to it will see if they deliver on this but
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,599	| IOT205 |	You'll be able to actually
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,647	| IOT205 |	Point at things that you're driving past
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,975	| IOT205 |	System recognize your gestures
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,743	| IOT205 |	Winter
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:35,071	| IOT205 |	To that thing the cars have cameras and other sensors
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,351	| IOT205 |	GPS as well
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:40,447	| IOT205 |	Anyconnect tell you about the place
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,799	| IOT205 |	Additionally
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,847	| IOT205 |	Images phones and LG
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| IOT205 |	Announce their G8
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,151	| IOT205 |	Thank you
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,711	| IOT205 |	That's their new flagship phone
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:56,319	| IOT205 |	And they have a time of flight sensor in there and they're not the first to do this but
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,135	| IOT205 |	They are the latest to do this and what that allows them to do is
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,719	| IOT205 |	Touchless gestures to the phone interface
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,255	| IOT205 |	It can even skam
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,559	| IOT205 |	Home of user a few inches away
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,095	| IOT205 |	Unlock the phone so
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:12,703	| IOT205 |	Wishing all these new applications for these type of sensor
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,007	| IOT205 |	Camera Caesar more of
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,287	| IOT205 |	The Jetsons
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,079	| IOT205 |	Exactly
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| IOT205 |	Exactly
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,383	| IOT205 |	It's basically like
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| IOT205 |	Radar
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,431	| IOT205 |	Plus math
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:26,015	| IOT205 |	So get a time of flight sensory there they're sending out
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| IOT205 |	The signal
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,063	| IOT205 |	It bounces back
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:31,135	| IOT205 |	They do math to see how it fits within the map Thief
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,647	| IOT205 |	Created of the road
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:36,511	| IOT205 |	It's a very cool things the same technology that was actually the lighthouse cameras
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,047	| IOT205 |	We talked about a while back
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,327	| IOT205 |	Heather CEO
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,119	| IOT205 |	Podcast talking about the sensors
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,911	| IOT205 |	Unfortunately lighthouses now
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:48,799	| IOT205 |	Business but the fact that these are going to be in smartphones and possibly in cars
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,591	| IOT205 |	These are things that sell
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:56,735	| IOT205 |	A lot of devices which means the cost of this technology in the number of people who can develop against it will expand
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| IOT205 |	Which makes it more accessible
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,855	| IOT205 |	When other use cases so that's
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,367	| IOT205 |	Harry Potter
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,975	| IOT205 |	And that's where it would be interesting to see in the home because today
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:11,327	| IOT205 |	Is home control is done through voice and make sure there's apps as well that
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,607	| IOT205 |	Why are we buying all these
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,143	| IOT205 |	Smart speakers oleana
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,167	| IOT205 |	Control things with our voice
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,239	| IOT205 |	Once you start having lower-cost sensors
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:23,359	| IOT205 |	Do other things such as determine or read gestures and interpret them
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,663	| IOT205 |	That was a whole new level of
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| IOT205 |	Interaction
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,479	| IOT205 |	Pizza possibilities
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,039	| IOT205 |	For it so with a lower cost of these sensors
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,879	| IOT205 |	Wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,159	| IOT205 |	Quieter Smart Home
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,927	| IOT205 |	Where you could
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:41,279	| IOT205 |	Maybe somebody sleeping next to you is your
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,303	| IOT205 |	Reading a book
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,351	| IOT205 |	You want to turn the heat up
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,375	| IOT205 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,959	| IOT205 |	And then maybe a gesture to raise the Heat or lower it whatever
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:55,871	| IOT205 |	If there's a world of possibilities here so it's kind of interesting and an early precursor to all this with the Xbox
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| IOT205 |	Connect
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:00,735	| IOT205 |	Which had a duct sensor is an IR sensor in an RGB camera
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,527	| IOT205 |	You actually work it just
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,599	| IOT205 |	The application for with gaming obviously but
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,647	| IOT205 |	To do my Disco
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,463	| IOT205 |	And I could not figure out
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,487	| IOT205 |	Easy way to like
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,023	| IOT205 |	Establish that gesture
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,303	| IOT205 |	Connect it to my
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| IOT205 |	Smart home stuff so
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,655	| IOT205 |	PartyLite the Hue Lights would go on for Disco Night
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:25,567	| IOT205 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,591	| IOT205 |	Make the connection
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:30,431	| IOT205 |	Into there is not and never will be a disco night at my house
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:38,367	| IOT205 |	But Microsoft is bringing the Kinect back
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,183	| IOT205 |	This ties back to something I saw last year
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| IOT205 |	If they were seated
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:51,423	| IOT205 |	Start a ticket was crazy so I'm
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| IOT205 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,703	| IOT205 |	Like how that's going to be
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:58,847	| IOT205 |	I'd like to follow that and see how successful it is because that condemned translate into what we might see in the home
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,871	| IOT205 |	And I'll just leave
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,943	| IOT205 |	Everybody hanging with one last thought because it
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,991	| IOT205 |	It's not just about jesters
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,015	| IOT205 |	And control
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:09,343	| IOT205 |	It's also about adding more smarts and context through the home
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,135	| IOT205 |	Yes cuz otherwise you're going to get
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT205 |	Crazy false positive
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,487	| IOT205 |	Like I can't believe it something
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,511	| IOT205 |	Assume
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,047	| IOT205 |	My dog
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,327	| IOT205 |	I know I'm weird
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,655	| IOT205 |	I wave to people in my house I wave to people on Skype
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:26,239	| IOT205 |	I can vouch for that
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:28,031	| IOT205 |	There's going to be some development
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,543	| IOT205 |	It needs to take
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| IOT205 |	Never Say Never
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| IOT205 |	Right
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,943	| IOT205 |	Let's see what are we
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| IOT205 |	We have
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| IOT205 |	Madam
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:44,927	| IOT205 |	This is a really interesting article I read over at Gizmodo there's about a hundred patient rooms
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,743	| IOT205 |	At Cedars-Sinai Hospital
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,327	| IOT205 |	They're equipped with Madame a echo devices
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:54,399	| IOT205 |	There's a Madam a Power Platform of the hospital called Ava
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| IOT205 |	And this allows
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,775	| IOT205 |	Patience to say matinee change the channel
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| IOT205 |	Matinee tell the nurse I need
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,919	| IOT205 |	To use the bathroom
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| IOT205 |	So
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:11,807	| IOT205 |	It's an easier way for patients to communicate either with the nurses or directly with
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,599	| IOT205 |	Items in their room
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,671	| IOT205 |	And I just never thought of it that way
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:20,255	| IOT205 |	Matinee in hospital room
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,047	| IOT205 |	Concerns that
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:27,167	| IOT205 |	What are the questions is how do you bring voice
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| IOT205 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,727	| IOT205 |	And still follow the rules of particular
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:35,103	| IOT205 |	In hospitals you can have to pick about HIPAA I have to think about a device that is
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| IOT205 |	Either protected from germs
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,943	| IOT205 |	Weird stuff that happens
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| IOT205 |	Hospitals
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,759	| IOT205 |	In an Enterprise you're going to have to take
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,783	| IOT205 |	Victaulic Edmonton
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,807	| IOT205 |	Information rights
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,831	| IOT205 |	Access
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:52,511	| IOT205 |	If that's all figured out and I don't know that it is or isn't my scene like terms of service or anything here
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:57,119	| IOT205 |	It really opens up additional possibilities in fact there are already using some of them
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| IOT205 |	Sofa
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,935	| IOT205 |	Patient says I need
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,215	| IOT205 |	Painkillers example
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| IOT205 |	Said that to their Echo
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,543	| IOT205 |	A nurse would actually get that request
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,591	| IOT205 |	If
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:11,199	| IOT205 |	It's some other requests perhaps especially
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| IOT205 |	Coming to a checkup
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:15,295	| IOT205 |	Southern
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| IOT205 |	That also provides
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,879	| IOT205 |	The cloud with some
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| IOT205 |	Personal
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,415	| IOT205 |	Patient information
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:27,071	| IOT205 |	Well speaking of which this is how we refer to
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,863	| IOT205 |	Amazon's digital assistant
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,143	| IOT205 |	So it's not to set off
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,703	| IOT205 |	Yours there are two chip announcement
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| IOT205 |	It's worth mentioning
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| IOT205 |	1
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,823	| IOT205 |	Nxp is come out with a microcontroller that has
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,359	| IOT205 |	ABS which is
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,639	| IOT205 |	Is madam a voice services
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,199	| IOT205 |	And this is really
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| IOT205 |	Meet
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,247	| IOT205 |	This is
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,015	| IOT205 |	Basically
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,319	| IOT205 |	I didn't see you as fairy
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,599	| IOT205 |	Low-power very dumb
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,159	| IOT205 |	Kind of devices inside a list sensors
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,207	| IOT205 |	For a while
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,999	| IOT205 |	Microwave
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:58,303	| IOT205 |	Washing machines have MCU
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,095	| IOT205 |	Hardcore embedded chips
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| IOT205 |	What's interesting here
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,007	| IOT205 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,055	| IOT205 |	Makeup on
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,591	| IOT205 |	MCU
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,359	| IOT205 |	Which
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,383	| IOT205 |	Well that means
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,199	| IOT205 |	How to make glitter everywhere
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| IOT205 |	It's a little disconcerting
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:24,415	| IOT205 |	So a little obviously a little chip microcontroller
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:24,927	| IOT205 |	Centimeter Square
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,207	| IOT205 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,719	| IOT205 |	Impressive
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,511	| IOT205 |	The internet
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,279	| IOT205 |	The connection back to the
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:29,791	| IOT205 |	Giant brain
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:33,119	| IOT205 |	The other
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,399	| IOT205 |	Haven't found this in Sin City
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT205 |	Tyson
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,727	| IOT205 |	We talked about
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,031	| IOT205 |	Qualcomm is doing a reference design
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,055	| IOT205 |	Amazon
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| IOT205 |	Chip with
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| IOT205 |	CVS
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,687	| IOT205 |	Voice services
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:50,783	| IOT205 |	Isn't that funny because I think somebody wrote an article about
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| IOT205 |	Disa
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:55,647	| IOT205 |	Smart speakers really should be integrated use as mesh
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,439	| IOT205 |	Points
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:02,815	| IOT205 |	Qualcomm has it smart audio development kit for Amazon AVS
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,583	| IOT205 |	It's
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:07,423	| IOT205 |	Far more than that microcontroller we just talked about this is an actual
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:11,519	| IOT205 |	CPU that might be used inside Halo and smartphone insulin
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:15,103	| IOT205 |	Seems to be the Snapdragon 410 series
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,943	| IOT205 |	Based on the information at Qualcomm has provided in what ways, to do so
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:23,551	| IOT205 |	It's got everything I can drive up to 720p on display
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:27,647	| IOT205 |	It has obviously has Wi-Fi 8 or 2:11 AC
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,719	| IOT205 |	It has Bluetooth it has
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,487	| IOT205 |	The kitchen sink
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:36,607	| IOT205 |	It's all in there
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:40,447	| IOT205 |	Can playback high definition audio music do you have a GPU
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:44,543	| IOT205 |	Quick Charge support which is interesting enough that will ever be used
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,079	| IOT205 |	Terminado de Wi-Fi
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:55,295	| IOT205 |	Exactly exactly but I mean this could lead to what I was thinking a natural all in one
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,343	| IOT205 |	Smart speaker /
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:04,255	| IOT205 |	Access points we can start reducing the number of things that we have to plug in and connect to her house
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,279	| IOT205 |	Could be something like a
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:09,119	| IOT205 |	But it wouldn't be that because this is
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,679	| IOT205 |	Echo Show
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:14,751	| IOT205 |	720 which is in
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,543	| IOT205 |	Awesome but you know a small
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,567	| IOT205 |	Echo spot
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| IOT205 |	So something like that
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| IOT205 |	Teal screen
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,967	| IOT205 |	Wi-Fi access point
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,247	| IOT205 |	Judicial assistant
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,343	| IOT205 |	Lots of news out of
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:32,671	| IOT205 |	Congress will talk a little bit more about some other bits
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,743	| IOT205 |	But ask
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,255	| IOT205 |	A question
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:45,727	| IOT205 |	He asked question which is who should enforce a federal Privacy Law
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| IOT205 |	Us
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:51,359	| IOT205 |	And the idea here is if the US gets a gdpr
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:51,871	| IOT205 |	Privacy
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,663	| IOT205 |	What agency
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,455	| IOT205 |	Wood and
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,759	| IOT205 |	I had assumed it would be the f
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| IOT205 |	HTC button
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:04,927	| IOT205 |	Much like the FTC doesn't actually have
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,951	| IOT205 |	Penalties against
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,767	| IOT205 |	And that's kind of something
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| IOT205 |	Make it hurt
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:13,119	| IOT205 |	GPR charges up to 4%
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,399	| IOT205 |	That's crazy
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:18,239	| IOT205 |	So the FCC does want this job they have done some privacy
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,519	| IOT205 |	Cases usually
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,567	| IOT205 |	Not as effectively there's some
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,335	| IOT205 |	Weird Regular Show
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,383	| IOT205 |	Blocks in place for
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| IOT205 |	But
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| IOT205 |	They do have some experience
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:29,247	| IOT205 |	The other option would be State Attorneys General
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:34,623	| IOT205 |	And we see that a lot the downside to something like that is if you don't get
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:36,927	| IOT205 |	California or New York basic
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,207	| IOT205 |	2
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,023	| IOT205 |	Estate attorneys
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,095	| IOT205 |	So
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,119	| IOT205 |	You'll have to have
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,655	| IOT205 |	Stateline
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:50,239	| IOT205 |	If North Dakota does this I can see someone being like you
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:53,823	| IOT205 |	Need to sell in North Dakota
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:55,871	| IOT205 |	Sorry
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,967	| IOT205 |	That's something to think about
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,575	| IOT205 |	I tend to hate the idea of creating a whole new agency
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,855	| IOT205 |	We have so many agencies already
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:08,159	| IOT205 |	The Privacy folks are actually
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,183	| IOT205 |	Kind of excited about that
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,231	| IOT205 |	I think new agencies maybe have
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,535	| IOT205 |	Few years of Effectiveness before there
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:17,631	| IOT205 |	They're suffering from regulatory capture something
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| IOT205 |	Impro FTC
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,727	| IOT205 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:24,031	| IOT205 |	They have to change the ftc's
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:28,127	| IOT205 |	Scope of power nuts could lead to other issues
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,919	| IOT205 |	I hate to say it but a new agency
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:34,015	| IOT205 |	For this and related things may be a good thing because
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,063	| IOT205 |	All these agencies are created well before
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:39,135	| IOT205 |	Internet little on the edge of IRT
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| IOT205 |	I hate to say it but
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,975	| IOT205 |	Maybe the best thing
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,023	| IOT205 |	Agencies
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,583	| IOT205 |	That is a fight that
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:49,119	| IOT205 |	What happened in Washington
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,399	| IOT205 |	If we ever get Federal
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,447	| IOT205 |	Cell
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,983	| IOT205 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| IOT205 |	Let's go to California in
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,287	| IOT205 |	And their law that should go to
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,591	| IOT205 |	All right
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,687	| IOT205 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,991	| IOT205 |	We'll start with new world
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,879	| IOT205 |	Yeah we've talked before.
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,415	| IOT205 |	Google Cloud iot
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:15,231	| IOT205 |	Which is Google's platform to
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:18,047	| IOT205 |	Manage devices they now have
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:20,351	| IOT205 |	A cloud iot device SDK
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,167	| IOT205 |	And that will allow
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,727	| IOT205 |	Product makers and developers to connect
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:30,847	| IOT205 |	Embedded iot devices to the Google Cloud iot Core so that
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,127	| IOT205 |	Makes things easier
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,663	| IOT205 |	If you want
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,943	| IOT205 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:38,015	| IOT205 |	If you want to use Google platform
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,319	| IOT205 |	They don't mention a specific
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,135	| IOT205 |	MC use they're saying a wide array
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:47,231	| IOT205 |	Will be able to use them across various real-time operating systems such as
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:51,071	| IOT205 |	Arm mbed OS free are pots and mortar
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,095	| IOT205 |	So
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:56,703	| IOT205 |	They're looking at ways to make it easier for the really small chips to get connected to their
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,983	| IOT205 |	Iot platform
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,543	| IOT205 |	That's good I mean Microsoft
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,871	| IOT205 |	Catching up again
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,455	| IOT205 |	Alright Wind River
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:10,527	| IOT205 |	Which they've been in the bed of software forever
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:14,879	| IOT205 |	Until
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,696	| IOT205 |	Didn't I was like nevermind
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,976	| IOT205 |	Wood River has done
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,536	| IOT205 |	SMU software for embedded iot systems
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,816	| IOT205 |	All the helix
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,328	| IOT205 |	Platform
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:26,400	| IOT205 |	Basically this is designed to give you a call
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,728	| IOT205 |	Systems that need to be high-risk are high lyrics
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,776	| IOT205 |	Avionics
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,544	| IOT205 |	Industrial
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,568	| IOT205 |	Utilities
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,848	| IOT205 |	We're seeing a lot of stuff
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,128	| IOT205 |	About
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT205 |	This
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,688	| IOT205 |	Is going to use when rivers are toss real time
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:42,016	| IOT205 |	The song
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| IOT205 |	Another
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,088	| IOT205 |	4
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,136	| IOT205 |	Industrial iot
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:49,696	| IOT205 |	A company that has been in space
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,048	| IOT205 |	Sap
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,584	| IOT205 |	Has announced that
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,608	| IOT205 |	They are
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,400	| IOT205 |	Boosting their Leonardo
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:01,472	| IOT205 |	Toolcat Leonardo was something they announced
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,264	| IOT205 |	Probably 2 years ago
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:06,848	| IOT205 |	Everytime I hear Leonardo I think of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle stuff
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| IOT205 |	Different people
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:16,064	| IOT205 |	Basically the sap Leonardo iot Suite is going to let you
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,600	| IOT205 |	Use sap
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,368	| IOT205 |	On your iot
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,928	| IOT205 |	So you going to be able to pull your iot data
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,720	| IOT205 |	Old school staff into essay
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,768	| IOT205 |	Easy
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,816	| IOT205 |	As if he also did a deal with Microsoft
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:27,584	| IOT205 |	They're going to
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,888	| IOT205 |	Net use azure iot
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,424	| IOT205 |	Hub azure

EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,312	| IOT205 |	Settings down at the edge going to be able to do this
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:37,824	| IOT205 |	I'm assuming
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,616	| IOT205 |	Bastille also makes it
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,896	| IOT205 |	Easier cuz right now it's not
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:44,736	| IOT205 |	It's very easy to use Microsoft Azure iot hub
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,272	| IOT205 |	At the age
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,832	| IOT205 |	I know that Microsoft says it's super easy but they haven't
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,368	| IOT205 |	Mtt super robust
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,160	| IOT205 |	Are people so adding this sap
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,440	| IOT205 |	Leonardo
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:53,952	| IOT205 |	Might make that
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:54,976	| IOT205 |	Easier
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| IOT205 |	Set sap
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:01,120	| IOT205 |	Leonardo news Microsoft has announced the release of Windows server iot
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,656	| IOT205 |	2019
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,192	| IOT205 |	Yay
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,984	| IOT205 |	So this is
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:09,568	| IOT205 |	What Microsoft calls the binary equivalent to Windows server
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:15,712	| IOT205 |	What's notable here is support
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:19,296	| IOT205 |	Insiders extended support giving you a whole whopping 10 years
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,064	| IOT205 |	I support
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,832	| IOT205 |	Figure iot
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,112	| IOT205 |	Devices
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,136	| IOT205 |	Deal
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:30,304	| IOT205 |	Most companies don't want to support things that long but in my
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,840	| IOT205 |	20 years
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,352	| IOT205 |	But so far they
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:38,240	| IOT205 |	Things change so much in 10c the 20
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:42,080	| IOT205 |	Makes temperature
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,848	| IOT205 |	Industrial
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,992	| IOT205 |	It makes sense because there a fee if it isn't broke
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,016	| IOT205 |	Don't fix it
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:55,904	| IOT205 |	Set because they
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:58,208	| IOT205 |	Because he got to get that certified
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,744	| IOT205 |	FAA analysis
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:03,072	| IOT205 |	And basically this is a big
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,584	| IOT205 |	Shiftboard
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:06,400	| IOT205 |	And we don't really talk about that a lot
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,168	| IOT205 |	But it's worth
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:10,496	| IOT205 |	And then at Mobile World Congress
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:13,056	| IOT205 |	Bausch and Qualcomm teamed up for
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:15,872	| IOT205 |	Industrial iot for
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,896	| IOT205 |	5G NR
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,432	| IOT205 |	Henry
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT205 |	Heather like what
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,784	| IOT205 |	Is the next generation
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,552	| IOT205 |	Release
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:25,344	| IOT205 |	The standard for 5G on
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:28,416	| IOT205 |	Mobile networks is set by a group called The 3gpp
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:33,024	| IOT205 |	And those guys are looking at how we can use 5G in industrial Empire
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,584	| IOT205 |	Couple things you're going to need
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,144	| IOT205 |	Are doing that in industrial environments
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,936	| IOT205 |	One of them is the ability to
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:43,008	| IOT205 |	Have deterministic networking so basically
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,568	| IOT205 |	Let certain packets go through if they have to
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,872	| IOT205 |	We talked about this a little bit in the newsletter
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,664	| IOT205 |	This is things like
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:52,224	| IOT205 |	Hey if you're streaming a Netflix video
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,504	| IOT205 |	And
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,040	| IOT205 |	You got to control system
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| IOT205 |	Industrial
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,832	| IOT205 |	Cement mixer
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,624	| IOT205 |	Those systems
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| IOT205 |	Chapelle
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:24:59,904	| IOT205 |	Before your
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT205 |	Make sense
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,976	| IOT205 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,488	| IOT205 |	They call it
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:09,888	| IOT205 |	Communications or urllc
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:13,728	| IOT205 |	Yeah exactly so we're not going to say that
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,264	| IOT205 |	We're just going to say hey
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,568	| IOT205 |	You got to prioritize your safety stuff
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,336	| IOT205 |	In
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,616	| IOT205 |	Control system stuff
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,640	| IOT205 |	Head of your Netflix
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| IOT205 |	Which I don't know why you're watching it
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,480	| IOT205 |	Puts on the factory floor anyway
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,272	| IOT205 |	I do not know
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:30,624	| IOT205 |	They also are going to be looking at factories which is really crappy
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,648	| IOT205 |	Happy Radio environment
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,952	| IOT205 |	There's a lot of metal machinery
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| IOT205 |	It's moving around
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:39,328	| IOT205 |	There's liquids slurries and things like that that will attenuate Wireless signals
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,632	| IOT205 |	So they're actually looking at how to
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT205 |	Create
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,704	| IOT205 |	A wireless signal that works in that have iron
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,752	| IOT205 |	Liability
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:53,152	| IOT205 |	So if you're curious just cuz you like acronyms if you're wondering what the NRA is
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,432	| IOT205 |	It is 5G
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,456	| IOT205 |	New radio
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,528	| IOT205 |	Yep which is really odd
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,576	| IOT205 |	Corset new radio
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,344	| IOT205 |	The new technology
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,880	| IOT205 |	So that
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:07,488	| IOT205 |	Lots of other World Congress
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:11,840	| IOT205 |	Embedded world but we thought we were excited
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,632	| IOT205 |	Or maybe just
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,960	| IOT205 |	Can I get excited about industrialized
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:17,984	| IOT205 |	I sure can
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,008	| IOT205 |	Kevin's light
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,056	| IOT205 |	You talk about that
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| IOT205 |	Yes exactly
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:25,664	| IOT205 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,968	| IOT205 |	Now it is time to

EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:13,024	| IOT205 |	I don't know what we're giving away yet but I'll figure it out
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,048	| IOT205 |	Let's hear
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:15,584	| IOT205 |	From this week's color about his
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| IOT205 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,960	| IOT205 |	Hi Kevin Spacey I have a quick question for you
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,008	| IOT205 |	I used to use a ring
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:23,520	| IOT205 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:27,104	| IOT205 |	For some reason it just wasn't working out for me so I switched over
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:29,152	| IOT205 |	Too late that's hello video doorbell
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:32,224	| IOT205 |	One thing I liked about the ring doorbell was I could put remote
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,528	| IOT205 |	Is various areas of the house
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,600	| IOT205 |	I don't see the nest
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| IOT205 |	Hello alternate capability
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:43,744	| IOT205 |	Do you know of any work around or is there any kind of a remote chime
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,536	| IOT205 |	For the best hello doorbell
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,560	| IOT205 |	Appreciate it thanks bye
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:50,656	| IOT205 |	I actually had the system setup in my house so this is easy
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,448	| IOT205 |	Basically in
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,984	| IOT205 |	Nest does not have an extra
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,520	| IOT205 |	Turn off chime but what you can do
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,848	| IOT205 |	Is go out and buy a $39 Google mini or
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,384	| IOT205 |	Spotify subscription
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,152	| IOT205 |	OK Google
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,432	| IOT205 |	I don't know
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,480	| IOT205 |	Buy lots of things and get a Google mini
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:08,832	| IOT205 |	So upstairs
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,368	| IOT205 |	In the settings section
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:12,928	| IOT205 |	Where he will enable voice announcements is what it's
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,208	| IOT205 |	Then
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:18,048	| IOT205 |	Magically when your doorbell rings not what emotion
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:18,816	| IOT205 |	It's triggered
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,352	| IOT205 |	Just when someone pushes the button
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:23,168	| IOT205 |	It will do an announcement that says summer
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:23,936	| IOT205 |	Mine is at the door
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,008	| IOT205 |	You have face recognition enabled
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:30,336	| IOT205 |	In the person is recognizable actually tell you
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,384	| IOT205 |	Sophia is at the door
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:39,552	| IOT205 |	It is kind of cool but there's a catch as we found out this morning before the show when I double checked
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,624	| IOT205 |	The setup in my home as well
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:45,440	| IOT205 |	I got a couple minis around the house and I have several
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:47,232	| IOT205 |	Smart displays as well
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,304	| IOT205 |	And when I went to the setup steps
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,608	| IOT205 |	It was not working for me
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,912	| IOT205 |	However
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:57,984	| IOT205 |	We researched and it appears that you need to have
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:01,312	| IOT205 |	Personal results on in your Google
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:03,104	| IOT205 |	Home / assistant settings
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:09,504	| IOT205 |	So that's it it's not working for you when you go through the setup steps you'll want to enable that once
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,552	| IOT205 |	I had that set up everything
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,088	| IOT205 |	Chimed in my house and
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:16,928	| IOT205 |	Video showed up on my Smart displays when I tested the doorbell ringing
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:21,536	| IOT205 |	Just be aware that you may need to turn personal results on
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,304	| IOT205 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:25,888	| IOT205 |	And for those of you have a question I realized I did not tell you
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:27,936	| IOT205 |	The secret number you should call it is 512
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:31,008	| IOT205 |	62374
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,288	| IOT205 |	As what you're going to call
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,080	| IOT205 |	To leave us a voicemail
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,104	| IOT205 |	Asking your question

EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:37,408	| IOT205 |	Dimmer switch
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:40,224	| IOT205 |	Now if y'all will stay tuned
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:44,320	| IOT205 |	We're going to have fun who is the CEO and founder of the sea change Institute
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,880	| IOT205 |	Talk about how utilities are
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:48,928	| IOT205 |	Trying to control
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,464	| IOT205 |	Energy usage in the Smart Home
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:53,792	| IOT205 |	And how Amazon Google and whatnot
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:58,144	| IOT205 |	So
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:04,544	| IOT205 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,824	| IOT205 |	Alter is urban X
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:11,968	| IOT205 |	It is an accelerator for startups reimagining the city light and we have one of the participants in the program
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:13,248	| IOT205 |	Ralph Lauren
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:15,808	| IOT205 |	Who is the co-founder and CEO of
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,088	| IOT205 |	Versatile natures
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:21,952	| IOT205 |	Let's get started with just a quick understanding of what versatile Natures does
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:28,352	| IOT205 |	Transform construction sites into a smart data collection field
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:31,680	| IOT205 |	Allowing for detailed analysis
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,216	| IOT205 |	Phone the project status
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:36,544	| IOT205 |	Well actually dramatically improving on-site safety
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,336	| IOT205 |	We installed a box
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:41,152	| IOT205 |	Ohio T sensors on the hook
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,944	| IOT205 |	Of the crane on the job site
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:45,248	| IOT205 |	Giving a view of the entire fight
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,528	| IOT205 |	The collected data
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,808	| IOT205 |	Is actually an alive
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,600	| IOT205 |	To provide real-time insights
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,880	| IOT205 |	Helping to improve
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:53,184	| IOT205 |	Not only productivity buzz on my side
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,464	| IOT205 |	Safety as well
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:58,816	| IOT205 |	Our proprietary crane view system is the most non invasive
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,608	| IOT205 |	The system in the market today
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| IOT205 |	Annie's very much
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,912	| IOT205 |	Roi positive
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,704	| IOT205 |	Excellent
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,240	| IOT205 |	With the Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:08,032	| IOT205 |	How do you think the world of construction
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,848	| IOT205 |	From our perspective
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,384	| IOT205 |	Utilizing what is
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:16,224	| IOT205 |	Technically industrial iot we're doing that from the heart
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:16,992	| IOT205 |	Of the job site
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:22,624	| IOT205 |	Controlling a data stream understanding 24/7 of
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:25,440	| IOT205 |	Pretty much everything going on on the job site
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:29,280	| IOT205 |	Enable learning and understanding I look at
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,560	| IOT205 |	Any other
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,632	| IOT205 |	Manufacturing industry and if you think about it this is
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,680	| IOT205 |	It's just not
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,216	| IOT205 |	Connected today
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,240	| IOT205 |	Is fragmented
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:42,848	| IOT205 |	And no structured but if you still look at it from a factory perspective
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,664	| IOT205 |	It will run closer to
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,688	| IOT205 |	What's a did
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:50,528	| IOT205 |	BMW 5 series or Intel where most of my team comes from
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:54,880	| IOT205 |	I believe that's where construction should and is heading
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,952	| IOT205 |	And why did you decide to join the urban Expo
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:31:59,744	| IOT205 |	Openx
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:03,072	| IOT205 |	Was actually one of the best decisions
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:07,680	| IOT205 |	We graduated about a year ago on what Drew us into the program was
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:13,824	| IOT205 |	Incredible value proposition what comes to entrepreneurs and residents helping with design
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:18,432	| IOT205 |	Hardware and even though some of the software effect
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:23,040	| IOT205 |	BMW Mini and old enough or extremely synergetic and that proves
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,576	| IOT205 |	To be extremely valuable
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:28,160	| IOT205 |	I would gently recommend it to anyone
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,952	| IOT205 |	What he's thinking about applying
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| IOT205 |	Excellent
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:35,072	| IOT205 |	All right and where can we go to learn more about versatile natures
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:38,912	| IOT205 |	And how to apply for urban axes program
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:43,776	| IOT205 |	Oh you could definitely live with us but versatile. AI
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:47,104	| IOT205 |	For Almanac you should check out Orban -

EDL	00:32:56,576	00:33:02,464	| IOT205 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,744	| IOT205 |	Is Beth Carlin
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:06,048	| IOT205 |	Who is the founder and CEO of
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,584	| IOT205 |	Of the sea change Institute
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,120	| IOT205 |	Hi how are you
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,936	| IOT205 |	I'm doing great how are you Stacy
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,752	| IOT205 |	I am excellent so let's get it started
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,032	| IOT205 |	Quick question on what is
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,568	| IOT205 |	The sea change
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,080	| IOT205 |	Institute
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,640	| IOT205 |	Teachings is a research institute
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:23,456	| IOT205 |	I'm a research psychologist by training and work
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,224	| IOT205 |	Comprised of
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,760	| IOT205 |	Various primarily
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:31,904	| IOT205 |	A scientist that have decided that we wanted to leave the Ivory Tower and conduct science on
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,208	| IOT205 |	Change program for
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,232	| IOT205 |	Social and environment
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,560	| IOT205 |	Okay and if I met Beth
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:41,888	| IOT205 |	A couple years ago when she was working with a large utility
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,960	| IOT205 |	Trying to figure out does the smart home actually help
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:49,056	| IOT205 |	The answer to that was it depends
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:55,456	| IOT205 |	A little bit about that and a little bit about the utilities think about the smart home and then probably something while
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,992	| IOT205 |	Crazy just a surprise assault
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,784	| IOT205 |	Last time we talked
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:33:59,808	| IOT205 |	We talked about
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,832	| IOT205 |	How to Smart Home
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,624	| IOT205 |	May help reduce energy
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:05,184	| IOT205 |	After years of looking at that do you think it does
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,488	| IOT205 |	I think as you said
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,024	| IOT205 |	I think it's a pain
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,816	| IOT205 |	It started getting into this work
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:14,144	| IOT205 |	Before we even had a smart home as smart as we
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,192	| IOT205 |	Did you now I was starting my doctor
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,216	| IOT205 |	About
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,496	| IOT205 |	12 years ago
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,264	| IOT205 |	And
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:20,288	| IOT205 |	At that time
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,056	| IOT205 |	Google
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,080	| IOT205 |	Had just put out
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:25,664	| IOT205 |	Way before we had any smart thermostat they just put out something called the power meter
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,784	| IOT205 |	If people had information
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,552	| IOT205 |	About
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,880	| IOT205 |	The energy used in their home they could use it to change their behavior
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:41,280	| IOT205 |	Right now if you think about when you get a monthly bill you get one number that tells you how much energy
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,304	| IOT205 |	Higher home use
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:44,608	| IOT205 |	Entire month is not broken down by day
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,144	| IOT205 |	The hour or by the sea
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,680	| IOT205 |	Can your house not broken down by television
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,728	| IOT205 |	Computer versus refrigerator
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,776	| IOT205 |	It's like if you went to the grocery store and you can
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,616	| IOT205 |	Fujitsu take food and you got a bill from Trader Joe's
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,640	| IOT205 |	In the context
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,968	| IOT205 |	You give people information they can change their behavior
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,504	| IOT205 |	And the answer the truth is
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,320	| IOT205 |	Yes they can't that doesn't mean they will
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,856	| IOT205 |	Graeter's nutritional information
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,904	| IOT205 |	On the back of all of our food
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,440	| IOT205 |	People still eat Oreo cookies
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:12,256	| IOT205 |	Even though they're too saturated grams of fat
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,792	| IOT205 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:14,560	| IOT205 |	Combine
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,584	| IOT205 |	Information
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,120	| IOT205 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:21,216	| IOT205 |	With a second affordance which is control
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,496	| IOT205 |	Information about energy
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,520	| IOT205 |	You being used in our home
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| IOT205 |	MC
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,056	| IOT205 |	When are you
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,640	| IOT205 |	Which might help us
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:29,152	| IOT205 |	Make better decisions
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,432	| IOT205 |	If we want
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:35,808	| IOT205 |	A smartphone
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,672	| IOT205 |	Should I turn off the lights when I left
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:43,744	| IOT205 |	Can chat and turn them off so there's all of this
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,072	| IOT205 |	Does not save
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:48,864	| IOT205 |	So the answer is
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:49,888	| IOT205 |	Yeah if
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,400	| IOT205 |	People shoes
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,704	| IOT205 |	I will say
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:54,496	| IOT205 |	That I have tried a lot of
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,312	| IOT205 |	Connected devices that are supposed to help me with my energy
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:03,712	| IOT205 |	She is starting with smart thermostats which was kind of nice but ultimately because I work from home and I don't want to work in an hour
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:06,784	| IOT205 |	Office that's 80 degrees during the summer it didn't save me that much
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:09,344	| IOT205 |	And then the next level was
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:11,136	| IOT205 |	Putting this device
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:14,720	| IOT205 |	On my circuit breaker box and having it tell me like hey
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:18,304	| IOT205 |	Your TV is used as much energy and your ovens use this much energy
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:21,888	| IOT205 |	But again after a certain point it's not like I could swap out my oven
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,680	| IOT205 |	To get something more energy efficient
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:28,032	| IOT205 |	And so is there a way for me to really start changing how I use energy
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,312	| IOT205 |	Based on the
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:29,824	| IOT205 |	Information again
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,616	| IOT205 |	I think you're getting at the right
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,152	| IOT205 |	It's about the incent
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:36,480	| IOT205 |	It is possible to use the current product
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:37,248	| IOT205 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:41,088	| IOT205 |	To save energy in for people who are
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,624	| IOT205 |	Even your cooking it
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,392	| IOT205 |	Example
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:43,904	| IOT205 |	Could
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,696	| IOT205 |	Really wanted
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,464	| IOT205 |	Optimized for cookie
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,000	| IOT205 |	You could cook
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,792	| IOT205 |	A small thing like a chicken or a
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,816	| IOT205 |	Morning waffles
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:52,352	| IOT205 |	Inure
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,400	| IOT205 |	And then in a smaller convection oven
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,680	| IOT205 |	And if you have that data
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,960	| IOT205 |	Wow
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:03,360	| IOT205 |	If something doesn't need use a large oven when I cook it in a smaller convection oven it does use a lot less energy and I care so much
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,664	| IOT205 |	About that small amount of savings a Time
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:09,248	| IOT205 |	Start cooking in that small convection oven
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,272	| IOT205 |	Need to go to that amount
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,576	| IOT205 |	Oh dear I already know that
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,560	| IOT205 |	It's not worth it
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,096	| IOT205 |	Energy is largely inelastic
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:29,472	| IOT205 |	Because our energy bills not huge were not always as motivated as we might be
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:31,008	| IOT205 |	If it was something like
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:37,408	| IOT205 |	Calories and weight as an analogy a lot like
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:40,224	| IOT205 |	Behavioral changes in the way we eat based on the data about
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:41,248	| IOT205 |	Nutritional information
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:43,296	| IOT205 |	When we care about either
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,064	| IOT205 |	Losing weight
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:45,088	| IOT205 |	Getting fat
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,368	| IOT205 |	Running a mile in under sea
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,904	| IOT205 |	6 Minute whatever it is
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,952	| IOT205 |	Because energy is largely in
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:50,976	| IOT205 |	Inexpensive a lot of
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,816	| IOT205 |	Changes to a very little money and so it doesn't
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,840	| IOT205 |	Seem like it's worth it
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,888	| IOT205 |	And it also depends on
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:58,912	| IOT205 |	There are
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,680	| IOT205 |	People for
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,216	| IOT205 |	I'm getting a smart thermostat
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:02,496	| IOT205 |	Because they used to just
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,032	| IOT205 |	Leave the heater on
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:07,104	| IOT205 |	Used to leave their heat on all the time they had a programmable thermostat
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:08,384	| IOT205 |	Never programmed it
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,176	| IOT205 |	So they just had it set to
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:12,480	| IOT205 |	72 the entire winter
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,040	| IOT205 |	And now they've learned because they put in a smart thermostat
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,320	| IOT205 |	When they go to bed at night
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:20,416	| IOT205 |	It can actually go down a little bit when they wake up in the morning it's okay when they leave the house
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,184	| IOT205 |	It's fine
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,208	| IOT205 |	If it gets much
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,488	| IOT205 |	Cooler until they get home
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,280	| IOT205 |	For someone who is already program in their throat
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,072	| IOT205 |	Very little
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,864	| IOT205 |	Name for someone who wasn't
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,632	| IOT205 |	They might be more
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,680	| IOT205 |	So it depends on
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,216	| IOT205 |	Motivation
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,496	| IOT205 |	And the replaced
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:36,544	| IOT205 |	What were you doing before
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,336	| IOT205 |	If you were already eating really healthy
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,384	| IOT205 |	And you cut out
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,408	| IOT205 |	One additional item
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,712	| IOT205 |	Pretty healthy
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:46,016	| IOT205 |	Can you just cut out that one afternoon cookie
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,552	| IOT205 |	You might not lose weight
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:49,600	| IOT205 |	If you were eating a lot of fast food
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,136	| IOT205 |	Completely
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,440	| IOT205 |	Please tired or something else
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,720	| IOT205 |	You might see more weight
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:56,256	| IOT205 |	And it's the same thing with energy
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:01,376	| IOT205 |	Got it in that makes sense so it feels like maybe the incentives are not on the
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,936	| IOT205 |	Consumer side so I can't do much
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,984	| IOT205 |	If I do want to do something it's pretty hard
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:08,288	| IOT205 |	I probably not going to rip out all my old appliances
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,616	| IOT205 |	It might be less energy-efficient although I don't feel like
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:12,128	| IOT205 |	Dick Hannah Subaru
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:13,152	| IOT205 |	Efficient
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:18,272	| IOT205 |	So then maybe we should be talking about what utilities
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,040	| IOT205 |	Because
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:20,576	| IOT205 |	How did they look at this
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,856	| IOT205 |	Space and idea concert
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:25,184	| IOT205 |	Yeah it's a really interesting question be
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:28,512	| IOT205 |	Because Bratayley is not a single household Write Your Average
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,560	| IOT205 |	Utility has thousands tens of thousands
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,936	| IOT205 |	A lot of people don't realize this but most energy
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:36,704	| IOT205 |	Utilities
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:38,240	| IOT205 |	Want their customers
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,008	| IOT205 |	Use less electricity
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:43,104	| IOT205 |	It's hard to imagine a company that wants to sell you less of what they're selling
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,640	| IOT205 |	Super energy utilities
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:45,664	| IOT205 |	Almost all
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,480	| IOT205 |	1
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:49,248	| IOT205 |	They're large
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:50,784	| IOT205 |	Publicly reggae
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,576	| IOT205 |	So our energy
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,856	| IOT205 |	Utilities there are
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:56,928	| IOT205 |	Municipal so they're either provided by the government or their regular
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,208	| IOT205 |	By the government
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:00,000	| IOT205 |	Because energy electricity
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,024	| IOT205 |	At this point
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:02,304	| IOT205 |	In our modern era
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:02,816	| IOT205 |	Considered
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,376	| IOT205 |	Something that should be offered
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:14,336	| IOT205 |	Because we have a lot of if not at the national level and most of our state and cities
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,616	| IOT205 |	Climate regulations
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:19,456	| IOT205 |	In place to reduce emissions that is often
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:22,272	| IOT205 |	From the city or state level passed along
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:24,320	| IOT205 |	Judy's Beauty utilities
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:26,112	| IOT205 |	Aggressive Target every year
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,392	| IOT205 |	That are given to utilities
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:30,208	| IOT205 |	And their authorized
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,488	| IOT205 |	Spend
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,024	| IOT205 |	Some of our rape hair
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,048	| IOT205 |	Money
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,816	| IOT205 |	Wepay on her

EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,400	| IOT205 |	Message back to us
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,168	| IOT205 |	And provide things like
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:44,288	| IOT205 |	Rebates and incentives for energy-efficient products of Smart Home Products
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,824	| IOT205 |	They will be talk using lesson
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:51,968	| IOT205 |	The one reason is another is that our utilities are trying to stabilize the
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,016	| IOT205 |	Seeking grid stabilization
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,296	| IOT205 |	If you think the route
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:55,808	| IOT205 |	Good day
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,344	| IOT205 |	And throughout the year
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,368	| IOT205 |	The amount of energy
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,416	| IOT205 |	Suffused on average
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:02,208	| IOT205 |	Changes based on the weather
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:06,304	| IOT205 |	And if you think that most utilities have their own sources of either
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:09,888	| IOT205 |	Cool nuclear power plants solar Farms that they provide
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,424	| IOT205 |	If you think that when energy
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:14,496	| IOT205 |	On that really really hot day in July
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:15,776	| IOT205 |	You want to open up a new
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:19,616	| IOT205 |	200 million-dollar nuclear plant for 4 to 12 hours a year
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:21,408	| IOT205 |	Do they have to end up paying
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:22,688	| IOT205 |	Hydrate
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:23,200	| IOT205 |	Third party
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:29,856	| IOT205 |	When I have a more stable grid table during the day and stable during the year
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,624	| IOT205 |	Rosemead
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,392	| IOT205 |	Internally
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,672	| IOT205 |	For those reasons
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:34,464	| IOT205 |	Utilities are strongly encouraged
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,232	| IOT205 |	Incentivize
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:36,768	| IOT205 |	Both financially and
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,816	| IOT205 |	MR2
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,584	| IOT205 |	Try and get
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,096	| IOT205 |	People to use
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:42,144	| IOT205 |	Less energy at all times
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,424	| IOT205 |	And use more

EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,032	| IOT205 |	Energy
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:51,616	| IOT205 |	What are the ways they've been doing this is demand response
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,687	| IOT205 |	And I've been part of a demand response program for
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,271	| IOT205 |	Why isn't a decade I don't know a really long time
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,551	| IOT205 |	And my utility
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:00,831	| IOT205 |	Peak demand
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:07,231	| IOT205 |	Hey we're going to stop your air conditioner for a while if I don't want
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:07,999	| IOT205 |	Sr utility
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,791	| IOT205 |	That's where we've been for a while
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:12,351	| IOT205 |	I talked to people and they're like
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,887	| IOT205 |	Hey maybe
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:15,423	| IOT205 |	It'll be involuntary
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:19,519	| IOT205 |	Or maybe it'll be like will just automatically throttle everything back
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:23,871	| IOT205 |	That we can like hot water heaters are can hbac those kind of things
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,663	| IOT205 |	And then you can opt back in
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:28,479	| IOT205 |	Some people talk about like instead of Isaac based on pricing
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:33,343	| IOT205 |	If I want to do my dryer dry my clothes during that time it's going to cost a lot more
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,367	| IOT205 |	How do you think
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:38,207	| IOT205 |	Those sorts of programs will evolve as more and more things become
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,999	| IOT205 |	Connected to the internet
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:42,047	| IOT205 |	And have you know a lot of work
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,071	| IOT205 |	Computing capabilities
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,375	| IOT205 |	They are.
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,143	| IOT205 |	Something about right now
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:48,959	| IOT205 |	You were just talking about this time of you
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,519	| IOT205 |	Becoming more and more prevalent
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,847	| IOT205 |	So like I said I'm in California and California were switching right now
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| IOT205 |	Daily demand response
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:42:59,711	| IOT205 |	As opposed
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:01,759	| IOT205 |	The programs you're talking about
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:02,783	| IOT205 |	Dorothy
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:05,599	| IOT205 |	Have not been daily so that I can return your
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,391	| IOT205 |	Down
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,439	| IOT205 |	Now we're moving
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,487	| IOT205 |	Let's try and stem it almost every
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:13,279	| IOT205 |	3 day and a lot of this is from a good thing
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:18,143	| IOT205 |	Because we're moving some more renewable sources so as we rely more and more
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:19,423	| IOT205 |	On solar
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,471	| IOT205 |	We see that solar has provided the most
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:23,007	| IOT205 |	During the day
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:25,311	| IOT205 |	And then if electricity is used the least
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:27,871	| IOT205 |	Higher average household at night
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,151	| IOT205 |	Sleeping so there's this
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:32,223	| IOT205 |	I'm stopping her for to the doctor but you look better
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:33,247	| IOT205 |	The daily load
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:38,111	| IOT205 |	In the utility looks a lot like
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,927	| IOT205 |	Depending on the region
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,463	| IOT205 |	And that's also when we're getting
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:44,255	| IOT205 |	Amount of solar
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,279	| IOT205 |	Rate solar starting
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,327	| IOT205 |	Houston starting to increase
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:50,655	| IOT205 |	And so what utilities want is for you to use less optional energy
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:53,727	| IOT205 |	Doesn't mean don't do anything it means like you said
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,007	| IOT205 |	Maybe dry your clothes after
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,799	| IOT205 |	Baby Charger car
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:58,847	| IOT205 |	What we're seeing as
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:03,199	| IOT205 |	Is introduces like car charging right if we really can Electrify and we get off coffee
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,271	| IOT205 |	Stop going to increase our electric to me
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:07,807	| IOT205 |	And we don't want every
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,575	| IOT205 |	Ricard America
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,087	| IOT205 |	Start charging
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:13,439	| IOT205 |	People that charge maybe at 10
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:18,303	| IOT205 |	When you get home is when you want to plug it in so utilities are looking for ways to allow you
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:20,095	| IOT205 |	To put the clothing in the dryer
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:20,863	| IOT205 |	You think about it
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,655	| IOT205 |	Plug in the car when you think about it
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:23,935	| IOT205 |	But have the energy start
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,215	| IOT205 |	You win
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:28,031	| IOT205 |	The most beneficial to the grid and then
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:32,127	| IOT205 |	Either rewarding you depending on how you look at it for doing that or
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:32,895	| IOT205 |	Punishing you
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,687	| IOT205 |	You don't
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| IOT205 |	I feel like my utility has had
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,039	| IOT205 |	Time of day but it's been
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,319	| IOT205 |	Very blunt
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,087	| IOT205 |	As an instrument
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:43,135	| IOT205 |	Till like after 9 at night
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,415	| IOT205 |	Till 6 in the morning
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:48,511	| IOT205 |	Between 10 in the morning
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,535	| IOT205 |	It's cheaper
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,071	| IOT205 |	Kilowatt per hour
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:51,839	| IOT205 |	Our bases
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:54,143	| IOT205 |	What I am hearing from people is
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:58,495	| IOT205 |	It may start making sense during a demand response event or
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:01,823	| IOT205 |	Maybe just to modulate certain devices to certain
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:04,383	| IOT205 |	Times of day there's a lot of talk about
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:06,431	| IOT205 |	Doing something like that or even having
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:11,039	| IOT205 |	If it's connected product even when I turn on my washing machine or my dryer
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:13,599	| IOT205 |	It'll say if you wait 2 hours
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:14,879	| IOT205 |	It'll cost you this much to run
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:16,671	| IOT205 |	Yeah
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,207	| IOT205 |	The few ways
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:18,975	| IOT205 |	We think about
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:19,999	| IOT205 |	The control
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,279	| IOT205 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:22,559	| IOT205 |	Smart Home Products
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:24,607	| IOT205 |	You can think of it in a few kind of bucket
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:26,143	| IOT205 |	The one is
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:26,655	| IOT205 |	User base
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:28,703	| IOT205 |	Control right through that mean
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:32,543	| IOT205 |	I'm going to give you information about whether your lights are on
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:33,311	| IOT205 |	Hair dryers running
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,591	| IOT205 |	And allow you
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:36,127	| IOT205 |	To manually turn it on or not
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:38,431	| IOT205 |	I'm just going to either give you the data
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:40,479	| IOT205 |	Worth available on a grass Bird app
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:41,247	| IOT205 |	And you can
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:42,783	| IOT205 |	Control your phone
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,807	| IOT205 |	A second
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:44,831	| IOT205 |	Is Ruby
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,599	| IOT205 |	Or schedule
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:49,183	| IOT205 |	Older programmable
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,719	| IOT205 |	Stop so you can say
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| IOT205 |	You know what don't run my dishwasher
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:57,119	| IOT205 |	Press the button that says turn on my dryer
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:58,399	| IOT205 |	But don't turn it on until 10
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:00,959	| IOT205 |	Is third party
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:03,519	| IOT205 |	And that's like this demand response
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,287	| IOT205 |	Smart
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:06,079	| IOT205 |	Programs like you were talking about
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,103	| IOT205 |	Free utility says
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:08,383	| IOT205 |	Will you allow us
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,663	| IOT205 |	When we really need
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,431	| IOT205 |	Stabilized
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:12,479	| IOT205 |	The grid will you let us kind of go in
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:15,807	| IOT205 |	And turn your thermostat up or down a degree or two
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,343	| IOT205 |	If you don't like what we're doing
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:18,879	| IOT205 |	You can override it but you're allowing
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:19,391	| IOT205 |	Third party
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:21,695	| IOT205 |	And then the force is algorithm
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:23,487	| IOT205 |	I'm not what we're seeing in
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,767	| IOT205 |	Things like nest
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:26,559	| IOT205 |	Swear it just starts
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,327	| IOT205 |	The word
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:29,375	| IOT205 |	Machine learning algorithm
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,143	| IOT205 |	Your habit
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:31,679	| IOT205 |	You don't have to put in rules
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:33,471	| IOT205 |	Stay at 10
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,751	| IOT205 |	Turn the thermostat from
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,031	| IOT205 |	71
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:37,055	| IOT205 |	266
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,079	| IOT205 |	Because I'm going to bed
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:40,383	| IOT205 |	I just started learning that when you go to bed you go
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,151	| IOT205 |	Turn it down
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:43,199	| IOT205 |	And it starts figuring out when you go to work and when you
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,735	| IOT205 |	You come home and buy this algorithm
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,015	| IOT205 |	Start becoming more
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:51,135	| IOT205 |	And do the utilities want to get into this or do you think they'll
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:53,183	| IOT205 |	Outsource some of this to maybe
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:56,511	| IOT205 |	Google are the Amazon or maybe a completely different provider
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:58,815	| IOT205 |	The answer to both of those Quest
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,095	| IOT205 |	Yes
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:00,863	| IOT205 |	The energy in
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:04,447	| IOT205 |	Do you want to get into this and the way they are getting in
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:08,031	| IOT205 |	Is typically through 3rd party vendor LED program
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:09,055	| IOT205 |	Most
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:10,335	| IOT205 |	Utility offering
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:12,639	| IOT205 |	They're provided by Sia
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,919	| IOT205 |	Utility staff
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,199	| IOT205 |	Through a third party
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:16,479	| IOT205 |	Operator
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:18,783	| IOT205 |	Common
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:21,599	| IOT205 |	So historically for example you know for
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:23,647	| IOT205 |	Years they've been incentivizing
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:24,927	| IOT205 |	Energy efficient
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:25,695	| IOT205 |	Light bulb
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:27,231	| IOT205 |	And dishwashers and washing
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:28,511	| IOT205 |	Machines and fridges
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:30,815	| IOT205 |	But utilities weren't getting in the business of selling
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:33,887	| IOT205 |	They were just providing a pricing
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:36,447	| IOT205 |	The pricing signal
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:40,031	| IOT205 |	As well as if they're also mailing
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:42,847	| IOT205 |	You might consider
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,895	| IOT205 |	I'm more energy efficient fridge if you buy one
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,967	| IOT205 |	It will give you $50 off if you buy one of the one
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:52,319	| IOT205 |	As they're moving into this new world
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,599	| IOT205 |	Not just
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,367	| IOT205 |	Let me look at
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:56,159	| IOT205 |	Going from an energy efficient
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:58,207	| IOT205 |	Dryer which is just one where
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:59,743	| IOT205 |	When you dry it
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:00,767	| IOT205 |	The dryer itself
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:03,327	| IOT205 |	Uses less energy regardless of anything
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:04,351	| IOT205 |	You do or don't do
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,631	| IOT205 |	It's just a more efficient
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:07,167	| IOT205 |	Model
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:10,239	| IOT205 |	The only thing they need to get you to do is buy the dryer and then they're done
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,775	| IOT205 |	I can pop and stuff on the back
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,055	| IOT205 |	Good job
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,871	| IOT205 |	Time for lunch but if you buy a smart dryer
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,407	| IOT205 |	It doesn't necessarily
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:18,175	| IOT205 |	I mean that
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:19,967	| IOT205 |	You have to wash out
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:20,479	| IOT205 |	After 10 p.m.
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:22,015	| IOT205 |	You have the option
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:24,063	| IOT205 |	To set those settings right
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:24,575	| IOT205 |	You can buy
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:27,647	| IOT205 |	A smart thermostat and keep your house
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,415	| IOT205 |	It's not going to stop
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:32,511	| IOT205 |	It's just going to give you the tools with which to make more energy efficient
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:35,583	| IOT205 |	He's so cute and so now you
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:36,863	| IOT205 |	The new world
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,679	| IOT205 |	We can't just offer the rebate and then
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:40,447	| IOT205 |	Go to lunch
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:43,775	| IOT205 |	Once they get the thermostat or the smart washer
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:46,591	| IOT205 |	We have to figure out how to
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:48,127	| IOT205 |	Motivate
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:48,895	| IOT205 |	An able
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,431	| IOT205 |	Encourage engaged
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:51,711	| IOT205 |	Customers
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:52,991	| IOT205 |	To use those products
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:53,503	| IOT205 |	Efficiently
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,295	| IOT205 |	Because in and of themselves they are
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:58,879	| IOT205 |	And I'll tell you right now we're also trying
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:48:59,647	| IOT205 |	Figure it out
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:00,415	| IOT205 |	That part
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,719	| IOT205 |	Because we do not live in a country
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:03,999	| IOT205 |	Foremost
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:04,767	| IOT205 |	People want
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:05,791	| IOT205 |	Their utility
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:07,583	| IOT205 |	To be telling them how to use that
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:09,887	| IOT205 |	Right I pay for it I can
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:11,167	| IOT205 |	Can use it however I want
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:11,679	| IOT205 |	I'm paying
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:13,471	| IOT205 |	Don't tell me how hot or cold
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:15,263	| IOT205 |	Yeah we love our
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:22,431	| IOT205 |	I wanted to have Sidetrack you just a little bit and ask about this idea of as we put more
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:26,271	| IOT205 |	More connected things in our homes and I actually got a question about this on Earth
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:28,063	| IOT205 |	Which was
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:33,183	| IOT205 |	Hey I've been stalling my SmartThings today but their Wi-Fi connections
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:34,463	| IOT205 |	Require more energy
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:36,767	| IOT205 |	And I was just curious if
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:39,583	| IOT205 |	If you guys have done research on that or thought about things like
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:41,375	| IOT205 |	I've got connected light bulbs that got to come
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:44,703	| IOT205 |	Connect washer dryer increase my energy
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,775	| IOT205 |	Yeah it's a great question and the answer is
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:52,127	| IOT205 |	Yes of course I mean anything that uses plug load is going to be using
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:53,407	| IOT205 |	Thumb Electric
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:54,943	| IOT205 |	It's a small amount
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:57,503	| IOT205 |	So adding a hob and that's also why they're just
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:49:59,295	| IOT205 |	Connective protocols
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:03,647	| IOT205 |	You bought that smart lights to minimize that they have a hub
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:05,183	| IOT205 |	Connecting the light by us
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:06,975	| IOT205 |	Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,999	| IOT205 |	Enter WiFi zone
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,303	| IOT205 |	So we are looking
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:11,839	| IOT205 |	More and less
EDL	00:50:11,839	00:50:12,607	| IOT205 |	Efficient
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:15,679	| IOT205 |	Communication protocol for Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:17,215	| IOT205 |	Bluetooth which is going to be slightly more
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:21,567	| IOT205 |	It does use a small amount of things
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,591	| IOT205 |	You have plugged in
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:23,871	| IOT205 |	To your home
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:24,639	| IOT205 |	Drawing electricity
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:26,431	| IOT205 |	The more electricity you will be
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:28,223	| IOT205 |	They do not use
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:28,991	| IOT205 |	Largemouth
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:30,015	| IOT205 |	Official
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:31,039	| IOT205 |	Cincy is Jane
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:32,319	| IOT205 |	Baia
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:35,391	| IOT205 |	Changes in Behavior those changes in Behavior
EDL	00:50:35,391	00:50:36,927	| IOT205 |	You should more than make up
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:38,207	| IOT205 |	For the increase efficiency
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:39,743	| IOT205 |	Also it depends on what your replaced
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:41,279	| IOT205 |	If you replace
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:45,375	| IOT205 |	An old-school incandescent light bulb or a CFL light bulb
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:46,911	| IOT205 |	With the smart light
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,191	| IOT205 |	Smart light bulbs
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:52,287	| IOT205 |	I'm pretty sure 100% of the time I've never seen a smart light bulb it's not
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:53,823	| IOT205 |	A very high efficient LED
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:57,919	| IOT205 |	So just the Energy Efficiency of that light bulb
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:59,455	| IOT205 |	It's going to use Life Energy
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:00,479	| IOT205 |	Then if you connect
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,759	| IOT205 |	For five of those
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:03,807	| IOT205 |	That one Hub disconnecting them
EDL	00:51:03,807	00:51:06,367	| IOT205 |	Is going to take off a small amount of energy
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:08,927	| IOT205 |	But the light bulbs are more efficient and if you
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:09,951	| IOT205 |	You use that
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:10,975	| IOT205 |	2 then
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:17,375	| IOT205 |	Keep the lights in the house on for the first hour you leave the home and then turn them off or something where you would have left them on all night or
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,143	| IOT205 |	All day
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:18,655	| IOT205 |	Then you're going to see
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:20,447	| IOT205 |	Increase in efficiency
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:21,727	| IOT205 |	If you use the light
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:24,031	| IOT205 |	Exactly as you use your old life
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:24,799	| IOT205 |	Then you only
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:28,895	| IOT205 |	Decrease in energy use is going to be just by the efficiency of the bulb itself
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:31,711	| IOT205 |	That's kind of along the lines of what I thought
EDL	00:51:32,479	00:51:33,503	| IOT205 |	I'm like oh man
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:35,039	| IOT205 |	I'm kind of sad now that I
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:35,807	| IOT205 |	Think about all the
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:41,439	| IOT205 |	Things I plugged into my house okay we are a bunch of Gadget heads over here so I have to ask
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:43,999	| IOT205 |	If my focus is energy conservation
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:45,535	| IOT205 |	Saving money or just saving energy
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:48,351	| IOT205 |	What is probably the best item
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:49,375	| IOT205 |	Nectar Gadget
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:50,143	| IOT205 |	I could buy
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:51,679	| IOT205 |	Mosto
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:52,447	| IOT205 |	Home
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:53,983	| IOT205 |	The largest use of energy
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:54,751	| IOT205 |	DNR home
EDL	00:51:54,751	00:51:55,775	| IOT205 |	Is related to Heating
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:57,311	| IOT205 |	Super Bowl
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:51:59,359	| IOT205 |	Anything related to
EDL	00:51:59,359	00:52:00,895	| IOT205 |	Your thermostat
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:02,431	| IOT205 |	Home Heating and Cooling
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:04,479	| IOT205 |	Is going to be the most important thing
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:05,247	| IOT205 |	To replace
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:06,015	| IOT205 |	Really
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:06,783	| IOT205 |	I think
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:07,807	| IOT205 |	Another way of thinking
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:09,343	| IOT205 |	Think about it is to look at your
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:11,135	| IOT205 |	Dial M for
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:12,159	| IOT205 |	Household thermite
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,951	| IOT205 |	Did you travel a lot
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:14,975	| IOT205 |	It's so
EDL	00:52:14,975	00:52:15,743	| IOT205 |	Think about your
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:16,255	| IOT205 |	Travel bag
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:19,839	| IOT205 |	You can go when I go out
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:21,119	| IOT205 |	How am I
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:22,655	| IOT205 |	Burning off as many things of ice
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:25,471	| IOT205 |	And that's where the smart home really helps
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:28,031	| IOT205 |	If we have a family where we all leave during the day
EDL	00:52:28,543	00:52:31,103	| IOT205 |	Is are we really getting our base load of lowest cost
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:34,687	| IOT205 |	I'm so when you look at whatever you're setting up
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:36,479	| IOT205 |	Really look at your lifestyle and dope
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:39,039	| IOT205 |	When do I think I'm using things that I don't
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:40,831	| IOT205 |	Meet or don't even know I'm using
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:42,111	| IOT205 |	And how can this Markle
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:44,159	| IOT205 |	Ecosystem help me see that better
EDL	00:52:44,159	00:52:44,671	| IOT205 |	And get rid
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:46,463	| IOT205 |	The weather at
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:49,279	| IOT205 |	A dollar or $100 a month
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:52,351	| IOT205 |	Those little things like we said when you think about everyone in the
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:53,887	| IOT205 |	Country can really add up
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:53:01,055	| IOT205 |	Awesome alright well thank you so much for coming on the show today
