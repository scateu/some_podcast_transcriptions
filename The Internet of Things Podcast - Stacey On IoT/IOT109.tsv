EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,248	| IOT109 |	Surprise purchase
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:04,416	| IOT109 |	Oh sure we can do that so West folks know the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,696	| IOT109 |	Officially became available
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:07,488	| IOT109 |	On Friday last week
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,328	| IOT109 |	Did not expect to buy one
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:14,912	| IOT109 |	My main SIM card has been in an iPhone 7 plus for quite some time
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:18,752	| IOT109 |	And I've had various other Android phones for my project fi Sim
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:22,592	| IOT109 |	But my main send is now in a galaxy S8 Plus
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,104	| IOT109 |	It's the big one
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:28,736	| IOT109 |	Didn't expect like I said to get one but I made the mistake of going to BestBuy just to look at that nice
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,552	| IOT109 |	Mostly bezel-less display and
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:36,160	| IOT109 |	I was sold her that and some HDR video just sold me on this phone
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,440	| IOT109 |	So
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:39,488	| IOT109 |	Snagged on a Friday night
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,280	| IOT109 |	Thank you T-Mobile because
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,072	| IOT109 |	State paid $600
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:48,960	| IOT109 |	Gave me a $6 promo card when I ported phone numbers over back in January so which I didn't pay a lot of pockets
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:52,032	| IOT109 |	Overall I know we're not a phone charger say overall the phone is
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,336	| IOT109 |	Really really impressive a beautiful screen
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:59,456	| IOT109 |	The immersive news of that near bezel-less display really does make a tremendous difference
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:04,576	| IOT109 |	And just about everything that you do and Samsung I have to give him credit they've done a great job
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,368	| IOT109 |	Getting apps to work with that
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:09,440	| IOT109 |	Funky new aspect ratio of 18.52
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,256	| IOT109 |	So it's very tall that
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,792	| IOT109 |	Not so wide phone
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,608	| IOT109 |	R2r Shore two things
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,680	| IOT109 |	When is Bixby witches
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,192	| IOT109 |	There
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,240	| IOT109 |	Version I would say of
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,776	| IOT109 |	Almost like a Google Now
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:29,664	| IOT109 |	And 2 is the fact that this phone works with the SmartThings and such
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:36,576	| IOT109 |	Now I do not have a SmartThings Hub ideas people probably know from listening the past I went with a wink Hub but
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:40,672	| IOT109 |	Stacy you test a lot of things and I think you do have a SmartThings Hub yes
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,768	| IOT109 |	I do and I'm actually one of the reasons that in New York
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,120	| IOT109 |	At this event with Honeywell smart thing
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| IOT109 |	Skybound
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,496	| IOT109 |	Business Development
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,264	| IOT109 |	You showed me
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| IOT109 |	The Galaxy S8
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,384	| IOT109 |	You showed me the new
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,176	| IOT109 |	Integration
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:03,200	| IOT109 |	Call home
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,272	| IOT109 |	Holy mackerel
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,040	| IOT109 |	It is
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| IOT109 |	Gorgeous
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:12,160	| IOT109 |	Automatically discovers everything on your WiFi
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,720	| IOT109 |	This is actually an update that SmartThings
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,256	| IOT109 |	So if you
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:23,679	| IOT109 |	When you download the app it looks Infuse everything it can it can on your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,471	| IOT109 |	But it automatically pops
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| IOT109 |	Wichita
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,919	| IOT109 |	You will have to manually add your
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,687	| IOT109 |	Things that I can't see
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,735	| IOT109 |	But
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,527	| IOT109 |	It's also
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,551	| IOT109 |	In this house
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:42,623	| IOT109 |	Stomach really nice shot at the Dairy Queen design
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,903	| IOT109 |	Really nice job
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:45,695	| IOT109 |	Can quitting Lake
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,999	| IOT109 |	Where things are
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| IOT109 |	Obelisk
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| IOT109 |	Smart home so anything on
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:56,447	| IOT109 |	When you when you bring this phone into your house and you should actually maybe try this
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:00,287	| IOT109 |	See if you can get with discover some of your wifi-based
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:00,799	| IOT109 |	Divisive
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,615	| IOT109 |	So in essence
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,527	| IOT109 |	Do you still even need a SmartThings Hub if you have this phone I guess that's one of my questions cuz I don't have the Hub but from what
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,855	| IOT109 |	You're saying I might be able to use the phone
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,879	| IOT109 |	In lieu of a hub
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,183	| IOT109 |	Yes for Wi-Fi device
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,719	| IOT109 |	That is my
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:23,839	| IOT109 |	And that would make sense because this thing doesn't have Z-Wave this phone doesn't having all the different radios at the Hub would have
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,887	| IOT109 |	That makes total sense
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,655	| IOT109 |	So
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:31,775	| IOT109 |	You said you had to download the app and I just checked the app and see if is pre-installed it is not
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT109 |	OK Google device
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:38,175	| IOT109 |	So I probably have to go into the Samsung apps app and download this app which is fine
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,015	| IOT109 |	You also noticed that the design of it is
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,807	| IOT109 |	Pretty nice and I haven't seen it
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,879	| IOT109 |	But I can't say for folks who have shied away from Samsung
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:49,439	| IOT109 |	Devices in the past because they have the TouchWiz
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,743	| IOT109 |	User interface over top of Android
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,791	| IOT109 |	This is now called
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,631	| IOT109 |	The Samsung Experience it is no longer called TouchWiz and it is very less
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,679	| IOT109 |	I don't have a lot to say almost
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:02,495	| IOT109 |	I find TouchWiz gaudy
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,031	| IOT109 |	I find it Gotti
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,615	| IOT109 |	What does Samsung Experience
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,151	| IOT109 |	Find job redesigning us
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,991	| IOT109 |	Leaving I kept the phone with me to Google New York City yesterday
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:18,623	| IOT109 |	Where I work I should disclose that that I work in the devices and Mobility group for make money for marketing
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:24,255	| IOT109 |	They were all impressed with the redesign of the software in general so you know I'm a
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,559	| IOT109 |	I made download this app and
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:30,655	| IOT109 |	Play with some of my Wi-Fi devices with the phone I have multiple ways to control them now but
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,191	| IOT109 |	I'd like to see what Samsung is done here
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,495	| IOT109 |	That is B
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,799	| IOT109 |	Latest news on Batman
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:42,175	| IOT109 |	I did mention there two things in one is Bixby
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:52,159	| IOT109 |	I think I think Bixby will be forgotten in the near future by many people
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,743	| IOT109 |	You forget about it because they have a dedicated Hardware button on the
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:59,583	| IOT109 |	As you hold the phone in your hands on the left side of the screen is you looking at it
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,375	| IOT109 |	Hit that button and Bixby open
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,167	| IOT109 |	The Voice interact
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| IOT109 |	Infer Bixby
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:04,703	| IOT109 |	Is not
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| IOT109 |	Available yet
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,543	| IOT109 |	However you can use the
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:12,383	| IOT109 |	Bixby cards if you are familiar with Google Now
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| IOT109 |	Swipe right
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:18,015	| IOT109 |	On a Google phone that has Google now you'll get your Google Now cards
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:21,343	| IOT109 |	Contextual Karzai show maybe traffic and weather and
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:24,927	| IOT109 |	Information that you're interested in and Dixie does that now which is
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,231	| IOT109 |	But
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,767	| IOT109 |	It's not
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:35,679	| IOT109 |	I'd say fully baked yet it's pulling in information and putting it on cards for apps that installs hitches
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,959	| IOT109 |	Play CNN
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,287	| IOT109 |	So show me interesting CNN stories
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| IOT109 |	March
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,847	| IOT109 |	And I don't really care about those anymore
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:43,871	| IOT109 |	So
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:50,783	| IOT109 |	There are some good things about Bixby there are some not-so-good things about Bixby I would say it's a work-in-progress I would not buy this
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,319	| IOT109 |	Phone for Bixby
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,903	| IOT109 |	Because Bixby is a promise that is not yet been capped
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| IOT109 |	It's probably the best way to say it
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,487	| IOT109 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| IOT109 |	Unveiling
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| IOT109 |	Avalanche Ranch
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:08,703	| IOT109 |	That's correct. They're still working on the Voice interaction bit so I use then this phone obviously because of
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:13,567	| IOT109 |	Has Android 708 has Google Assistant built-in so I basically been using them
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:18,687	| IOT109 |	Amanda and I just use a Google shortcut to tap and then I get my Google Now cards so I'm
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:22,527	| IOT109 |	I've done some workarounds to get the functionality that I want but you're actually correct
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,319	| IOT109 |	Samsung headset at launch
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,343	| IOT109 |	The Voice
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,159	| IOT109 |	Peace is not very red
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,951	| IOT109 |	The cars that will improve over time as well
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,023	| IOT109 |	Internet
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,399	| IOT109 |	Come back to you later Kevin
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,679	| IOT109 |	All right
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,215	| IOT109 |	Since we're talking about Google which way
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,775	| IOT109 |	Because you work there
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,847	| IOT109 |	Let's talk about the other news
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,663	| IOT109 |	Google home
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,199	| IOT109 |	Google
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,735	| IOT109 |	Is it Google home or Google Assistant
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:58,623	| IOT109 |	Basically what we say voice recognition we're saying voice recognition for multiple people
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:04,767	| IOT109 |	Right start this is so here's what's the idea here is up to six different
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,839	| IOT109 |	Recognize
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,911	| IOT109 |	And unfortunately I have not tried this
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,447	| IOT109 |	Out of town
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,287	| IOT109 |	Can I have a Google home
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,079	| IOT109 |	Write an integer
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:23,711	| IOT109 |	It is it is exciting it in sores I know it is specific to Google home not Google assistant on your phone
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:27,807	| IOT109 |	And that that actually makes sense to me because your phone has your information
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,087	| IOT109 |	You might share it
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,647	| IOT109 |	Calendars and other information with other people but
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,415	| IOT109 |	You don't want
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:37,791	| IOT109 |	Other people making calendar appointments using your phone on their account and that's busy with this.
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT109 |	This is
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,095	| IOT109 |	Allowing
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,607	| IOT109 |	Multi
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| IOT109 |	Account
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:48,287	| IOT109 |	And user access to Google home and I have not tried it I've seen some people say it works great at seeing some videos show
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,615	| IOT109 |	I seen some people saying it's not working great for us
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,639	| IOT109 |	So
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,199	| IOT109 |	There might have to be some tweaks involved in terms of this
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,783	| IOT109 |	It's hard to say I don't have one so you're right I can't say
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:05,695	| IOT109 |	Start in a little bit
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| IOT109 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| IOT109 |	Basically I'm excited because
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:12,351	| IOT109 |	Idea of being able to have my husband say
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| IOT109 |	Versus mine is awesome
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| IOT109 |	And it also
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,055	| IOT109 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,847	| IOT109 |	Which I really thought would have better
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,639	| IOT109 |	Voice recognition
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:25,919	| IOT109 |	Baidu
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:30,783	| IOT109 |	But I mean think about
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:36,927	| IOT109 |	About being able to say that I'm not sure I'd want to do that cuz I don't know how closely aligned
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,487	| IOT109 |	We have to eat in Minecraft
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| IOT109 |	That that's one of my Baker
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| IOT109 |	Concerns on the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,887	| IOT109 |	There is a passcode
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,727	| IOT109 |	Right so I think
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:56,127	| IOT109 |	You're right in some sense this puts Google home ahead of the echo ecosystem for now
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:11:02,271	| IOT109 |	At least in this Regard in general I find the echo to be ahead of Google and many other areas in this product
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:02,783	| IOT109 |	Category
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,063	| IOT109 |	But
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,855	| IOT109 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,415	| IOT109 |	Curious to see if Amazon responds
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:15,583	| IOT109 |	I like the idea that yes you can like I can check my calendar maybe my wife went to check her traffic on her way to work
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| IOT109 |	Our way to work
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:21,471	| IOT109 |	Baby the kids want to order a video on Amazon Prime for their account
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:27,615	| IOT109 |	So there's a lot of different usages and that's really what we want in a home assistant unless you live at home by yourself
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:30,431	| IOT109 |	You want everybody to be able to use this product otherwise
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:34,527	| IOT109 |	You spent a lot of money just for a single person's usage nuts
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| IOT109 |	It's not ideal you know
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:39,647	| IOT109 |	Idle by washing machine for myself and one for my wife and one for my kids right
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,487	| IOT109 |	Set point
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,511	| IOT109 |	Chest pain
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,047	| IOT109 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,559	| IOT109 |	So
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:54,239	| IOT109 |	Yeah well we're talking about Echoes and Holmes notice I just got an email from Amazon yesterday
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:12:00,639	| IOT109 |	That Amazon Dash buttons for a really good deals going through midnight on May 2nd
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,479	| IOT109 |	If you buy one dash button you get two free and
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,759	| IOT109 |	You still get the
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:11,391	| IOT109 |	499 credit $4.99 credit when you purchase make your first purchase so basically
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:13,695	| IOT109 |	You getting all three for free once you use the first button
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:19,839	| IOT109 |	I already added to my card I'm going to add a third I don't have a dash button so it will be new for me I got to find a third pie
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,447	| IOT109 |	Gatorade G2
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:28,287	| IOT109 |	I look for coffee I couldn't find coffee that I wanted and greenies for Norm
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,591	| IOT109 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,871	| IOT109 |	Yeah I was hoping
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,407	| IOT109 |	I still don't have the
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,431	| IOT109 |	Flashlight
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| IOT109 |	Brush my dog
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,551	| IOT109 |	I have a virtual one on my Amazon
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,623	| IOT109 |	Web page do I just go to the web page node like
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,255	| IOT109 |	Which is almost equally
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,303	| IOT109 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,607	| IOT109 |	Actually I can
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,655	| IOT109 |	I was talking to the Honeywell people
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,959	| IOT109 |	And hopefully sometime around
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| IOT109 |	They're planning on releasing
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,847	| IOT109 |	Immigration
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,455	| IOT109 |	Whitney
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,759	| IOT109 |	You can actually honor thermostats
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,319	| IOT109 |	The day that you changed your
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:17,439	| IOT109 |	They'll just basically automatically reorder your air filters
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT109 |	From Amazon
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,255	| IOT109 |	Nice
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,839	| IOT109 |	Which is actually really nice
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,887	| IOT109 |	One of those things where you like
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,263	| IOT109 |	It actually
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:39,199	| IOT109 |	I think I don't think about it a lot but I do think about it four times a year with the change of seasons Every
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,479	| IOT109 |	Official first day of
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,503	| IOT109 |	Spring summer winter fall
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,039	| IOT109 |	That's when I
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:48,671	| IOT109 |	Change my filter so I kind of have reminder set my calendars to reorder or go to the store
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:52,767	| IOT109 |	Yeah they're not to work around this would be ideal to have a meeting with the replenishment service built in
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,583	| IOT109 |	I was just about to
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,351	| IOT109 |	Make fun of my husband
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,239	| IOT109 |	If you can
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,263	| IOT109 |	But
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,823	| IOT109 |	But now I think you're a jerk
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,639	| IOT109 |	It's there
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:13,247	| IOT109 |	So the cooking there isn't just that it is a
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,551	| IOT109 |	I slept around for people who are not
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,831	| IOT109 |	On top of things
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,855	| IOT109 |	Reminder Center calendar
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:22,463	| IOT109 |	I keep making money on their connected
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,767	| IOT109 |	It keeps ending
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:27,327	| IOT109 |	A portion of Revenue Paraguay
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,607	| IOT109 |	The cost of having a
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,447	| IOT109 |	This is something we talked on a lot
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,775	| IOT109 |	When you device
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,847	| IOT109 |	Money everyday that you got that device
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,407	| IOT109 |	Money in your development cost
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,759	| IOT109 |	Custom Construction
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,695	| IOT109 |	Call down or something
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,023	| IOT109 |	Not going to call and get back up
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:00,095	| IOT109 |	If you're hooking up when you haven't started
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,935	| IOT109 |	How to support that device over the Long Haul
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,799	| IOT109 |	Start
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,079	| IOT109 |	One of your subscription
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| IOT109 |	It may be like
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,663	| IOT109 |	Punishment
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,039	| IOT109 |	Those things are
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,063	| IOT109 |	There we go
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,135	| IOT109 |	But I'd also I'd also add
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:26,207	| IOT109 |	All kidding aside the what Andrew and I do
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,487	| IOT109 |	4
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:30,815	| IOT109 |	Nerve manual replenishment attracting these kind of things
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:34,399	| IOT109 |	It's actually smarter to have a device do it because a thermostat can see
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,543	| IOT109 |	If the usage has been super high in a given time. Maybe if it needs a filter sooner as a result of that right
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,847	| IOT109 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,383	| IOT109 |	You have to trust
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,175	| IOT109 |	They're just not trying to like
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:50,015	| IOT109 |	Questions I should make an extra Buck Uber with it
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,391	| IOT109 |	Nope nope they're trying to get more money out of me I know it
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:57,951	| IOT109 |	Honeywell
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| IOT109 |	All right
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,279	| IOT109 |	Hitting a little
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:03,071	| IOT109 |	Shift because I read something
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:06,143	| IOT109 |	So excited I read in fortune
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| IOT109 |	Spotify
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,239	| IOT109 |	Fortune medicine that's not funny
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,287	| IOT109 |	Spotify
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,591	| IOT109 |	Hiring for someone to make
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,103	| IOT109 |	Suffice
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,943	| IOT109 |	What are the stars will remember that
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,735	| IOT109 |	Really excited when
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,015	| IOT109 |	The Pebble watch
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:25,087	| IOT109 |	That they were going to make a tiny little device
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| IOT109 |	Store Spotify songs
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,695	| IOT109 |	So when you're on a run
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,207	| IOT109 |	Something without
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:31,999	| IOT109 |	You have
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| IOT109 |	So this is what I want
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,727	| IOT109 |	We don't know what
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,031	| IOT109 |	Idea is
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:44,799	| IOT109 |	You need a device
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,639	| IOT109 |	You're happy about this I totally get why
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:52,223	| IOT109 |	I shook my head no no no when I saw the story
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| IOT109 |	Because
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,295	| IOT109 |	Hardware is hard
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:17:01,183	| IOT109 |	And it has become the downfall of many good service companies who have try to do things like this
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,463	| IOT109 |	I don't
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:09,119	| IOT109 |	Personally think it's worth the risk to Spotify to try and do this and I'm saying this of course without knowing what it is they're making
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| IOT109 |	However
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,679	| IOT109 |	You know
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,727	| IOT109 |	You got a great service out there
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:17,567	| IOT109 |	You got a lot of subscribers and a lot of money flowing in through the service
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:20,895	| IOT109 |	And you can integrate with a lot of existing and then future Hardware
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,687	| IOT109 |	Do you really want to make your own
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:27,039	| IOT109 |	Hope they do well with whatever it is they do
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,575	| IOT109 |	I'm leery
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,087	| IOT109 |	That's all I'm going to say
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,183	| IOT109 |	Directions
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,719	| IOT109 |	You work better with their part
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:38,047	| IOT109 |	What yeah that would be ideal because we've seen so many different
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,607	| IOT109 |	Wearables another device we have
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,911	| IOT109 |	Spotify on this and then you go to use it
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:48,287	| IOT109 |	And it's like well it's really just a controller for Spotify on your phone that's not Spotify on my wearable devices
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,103	| IOT109 |	And it was actually I had a Samsung
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,919	| IOT109 |	Wearables I forget which switchgear
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:58,527	| IOT109 |	I had but that was the one of the big things at lunch it's got Spotify cool
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| IOT109 |	And yet
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:05,951	| IOT109 |	It was just a controller for Spotify on the phone and I don't run with my phone so now I can't listen to Spotify
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,231	| IOT109 |	I'm tracking my running
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,559	| IOT109 |	Kind of feel like oversold and underdelivered there
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,863	| IOT109 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,935	| IOT109 |	Yes if anyone out there comes across
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,471	| IOT109 |	Tiny little device
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,287	| IOT109 |	Is it my phone
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,055	| IOT109 |	Spotify
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,335	| IOT109 |	Glass now
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,895	| IOT109 |	Why does it why does it have to be Spotify for you I'm just curious
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,735	| IOT109 |	Because that's that's what I
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,367	| IOT109 |	Music onto
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,439	| IOT109 |	Flash
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:44,095	| IOT109 |	A flash drive but if you subscribe for example to Apple music or Google play music
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,167	| IOT109 |	That's fine that's fine
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:51,263	| IOT109 |	But if you do don't forget our people who do use Apple products we can we know that
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,871	| IOT109 |	Google play music using Android phone Android
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:58,687	| IOT109 |	Those will sink over music from those
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:02,271	| IOT109 |	Services that you subscribe to to that way you locally
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,319	| IOT109 |	Carry those chains on a wearable device
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,135	| IOT109 |	And then go run exercise and stream
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,695	| IOT109 |	Over Bluetooth just like you would
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:12,767	| IOT109 |	With the nails that don't have to be manually
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:17,119	| IOT109 |	Pushing MP3 files over and then that whole complicated process if there's
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,167	| IOT109 |	There's options out there I was just curious that's all
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,471	| IOT109 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:22,751	| IOT109 |	I would like
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,799	| IOT109 |	Spotify Spotify
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:32,479	| IOT109 |	Yeah no and I mean I was a Google Play music subscriber until the whole family went and got iPhones and they're like
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,759	| IOT109 |	Apple music
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:38,111	| IOT109 |	So I I subscribed as a family plan to Apple music
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:46,303	| IOT109 |	Luckily Apple music works on some few things Apple makes it worse on Android so
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,583	| IOT109 |	I can you know
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,095	| IOT109 |	Stream stops
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,375	| IOT109 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| IOT109 |	All right
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,983	| IOT109 |	Picking up devices and Hardware
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,519	| IOT109 |	Idevices
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:20:00,127	| IOT109 |	Which is a company that is very popular
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,711	| IOT109 |	Open acquired by Hubbell
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,759	| IOT109 |	It is not the telescope
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,367	| IOT109 |	Anna and I thought it was humble at first in like a little figurines
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:13,951	| IOT109 |	Yes also not that I'm so Hollow
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,487	| IOT109 |	For people who don't know what it is
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| IOT109 |	Is a 3.5
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,327	| IOT109 |	Billion dollar
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,095	| IOT109 |	Company picnic
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,143	| IOT109 |	Electronic products

EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:31,359	| IOT109 |	This is an interesting purchase that because idevices is very consumer e
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,919	| IOT109 |	Yes now that they have
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,503	| IOT109 |	No they don't if it's
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,783	| IOT109 |	Non-residential residential
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:40,831	| IOT109 |	The forgetting
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,367	| IOT109 |	Show me a picture of
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:47,999	| IOT109 |	I hope this makes a lot of homekit accessories such as they have a thermostat
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,631	| IOT109 |	I don't even know what to think about this maybe it's because
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:56,703	| IOT109 |	It is actually gaining popularity in builders
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:59,775	| IOT109 |	When are taking over actually building houses
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:12,063	| IOT109 |	Purina products for new residential buildings and such and maybe even commercial bills I I guess it's
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,879	| IOT109 |	Just seems like I don't know what they paid for everything but
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,952	| IOT109 |	It just it just seems like
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,768	| IOT109 |	It's a very specific application of
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,048	| IOT109 |	The products and
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,864	| IOT109 |	I will see
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:30,752	| IOT109 |	Everyone knows that I'm not Super Soul.
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,032	| IOT109 |	I'm not loving
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,592	| IOT109 |	I didn't love my
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,616	| IOT109 |	Testing of it
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,384	| IOT109 |	Second love
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:41,504	| IOT109 |	I don't like the fact that it's only Apple in the device universe is so limited
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,296	| IOT109 |	Add more than user experience
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,832	| IOT109 |	Behind
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,904	| IOT109 |	You are stuff that's out there in terms of like
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,184	| IOT109 |	Helping
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,464	| IOT109 |	Pinecrest
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:58,912	| IOT109 |	I like I would not buy a home if I was out buying a new home and it had a home kit
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,728	| IOT109 |	Absolutely new
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,776	| IOT109 |	No value to me whatsoever
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,432	| IOT109 |	How about
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| IOT109 |	Weymouth
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,272	| IOT109 |	Yasso
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:19,904	| IOT109 |	This is so ironic that this news just hit because last weekend I was in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,952	| IOT109 |	And we saw
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:25,280	| IOT109 |	On the same day in two different areas of town may have been the same car
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:27,584	| IOT109 |	A Chevy bolt EV all electric
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:31,936	| IOT109 |	With lighter on top of it so is when I go self-driving Bolt
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| IOT109 |	What's up with that
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:35,520	| IOT109 |	And then I get home and then a couple days later
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:40,128	| IOT109 |	Which is a Google company
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,224	| IOT109 |	Announce that citizen testing is gone live in Phoenix
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:49,088	| IOT109 |	They have 500 looks like minivans I'm not
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,416	| IOT109 |	500 vehicles that are equipped for self-driving
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,696	| IOT109 |	They are
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| IOT109 |	Signing
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:57,536	| IOT109 |	People up in the Phoenix area so if you live there
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,328	| IOT109 |	Good for you cuz I love it there
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:02,400	| IOT109 |	But secondly you can sign up to be a an actual tester
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,936	| IOT109 |	How's the self-driving cars and
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,216	| IOT109 |	There's a
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:11,616	| IOT109 |	Maybe we can let you in the show notes the way most site that shows a video of one of the first testers it's a family like five or six people and
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:18,528	| IOT109 |	That size family with kids that are at activities
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:22,368	| IOT109 |	Running the kids to friends house to activities to school to whatever
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,488	| IOT109 |	You just get in the car
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,560	| IOT109 |	Robert needs to go where they need to go just go as soon as
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:32,864	| IOT109 |	So it's saving them already time and
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,400	| IOT109 |	Effort and
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,168	| IOT109 |	Less traffic
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,448	| IOT109 |	I'm so
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:41,824	| IOT109 |	It's kind of interesting I saw this this is happening quicker than I thought I did not expect to wake up public
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,384	| IOT109 |	Testing of waymo this soon
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,920	| IOT109 |	Is it
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:48,224	| IOT109 |	The car drives itself with there still a person
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:48,992	| IOT109 |	Sitting in this
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,016	| IOT109 |	Behind the wheel
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:56,672	| IOT109 |	It's ready to take you should say that because as I was sharing the video with people at work yesterday
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:58,208	| IOT109 |	They asked the same question
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| IOT109 |	And unlike it doesn't show that the video I'm like
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,792	| IOT109 |	That's probably because they don't
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:05,888	| IOT109 |	Really want you to see that in the video but I suspect it still required
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,680	| IOT109 |	Right so they're trying to show that
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,960	| IOT109 |	Excel driving you don't need it
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:13,056	| IOT109 |	Benihana Wheeling song by Sting for a regulatory standpoint a safety standpoint
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:16,128	| IOT109 |	Somebody probably a licensed driver still needs to be behind the wheel
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,920	| IOT109 |	That would be awesome
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,200	| IOT109 |	You were like a kid she can be like
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,552	| IOT109 |	Eventually I could see The Happening
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,856	| IOT109 |	Yes it probably won't look as much like a
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,136	| IOT109 |	I don't know
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:34,560	| IOT109 |	We are also going to be for this next item in the show notes which is a semantics
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:35,840	| IOT109 |	Surely report
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:39,168	| IOT109 |	Hold on it really great information

EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,544	| IOT109 |	Routers network DVR
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| IOT109 |	Five or six years ago
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,664	| IOT109 |	Most connected devices
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,432	| IOT109 |	They do not have
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,456	| IOT109 |	Password
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,760	| IOT109 |	Did you allow for over the air update
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,832	| IOT109 |	Stop
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,368	| IOT109 |	From the report
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,720	| IOT109 |	Besides attacks against a Honeypot
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,744	| IOT109 |	Today's setup
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,256	| IOT109 |	Where I am
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:12,096	| IOT109 |	Much of the attacks were coming from China
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,144	| IOT109 |	And the United States
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,936	| IOT109 |	Coming from
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,960	| IOT109 |	China
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,240	| IOT109 |	Got a quarter
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,008	| IOT109 |	China
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| IOT109 |	17
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:25,664	| IOT109 |	So this is actually got kind of surprised
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,712	| IOT109 |	It's not that
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,480	| IOT109 |	USF
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:32,064	| IOT109 |	The passwords that were used
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,368	| IOT109 |	Spices
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,904	| IOT109 |	37%
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,416	| IOT109 |	Batman
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,976	| IOT109 |	3% use route
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:41,792	| IOT109 |	And others the rest use some variation
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,072	| IOT109 |	5
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| IOT109 |	Text
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,168	| IOT109 |	I suspect
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:51,008	| IOT109 |	You know it was a leopard surprising to me that 17.7% of the
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,032	| IOT109 |	Attacks
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,080	| IOT109 |	Honeypot attacks were from the US
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:27:01,504	| IOT109 |	I'd look at it as we probably have a higher density of devices connected devices than many many other
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,272	| IOT109 |	Trace
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:06,112	| IOT109 |	So it's just a matter of having the device population more than anything in my
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,672	| IOT109 |	Oh that's a smart thing to think
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,488	| IOT109 |	Is coffees working today
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:20,960	| IOT109 |	If you like sitting here going home
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,472	| IOT109 |	Talk about this
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| IOT109 |	Here's some things
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,592	| IOT109 |	Disable telnet login and use SSH
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:30,944	| IOT109 |	You should
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,712	| IOT109 |	Use on your network
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,528	| IOT109 |	Actually just wrote a little bit about Healthcare
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,576	| IOT109 |	Episode
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:40,672	| IOT109 |	Healthcare iot I'm shocked to find out that a lot of people
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:44,768	| IOT109 |	Actually have any idea what's on your network
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,888	| IOT109 |	You should know what time your dad
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,424	| IOT109 |	And
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:54,240	| IOT109 |	You know change your default credentials on all of your devices
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,520	| IOT109 |	Wifi router
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:28:01,920	| IOT109 |	Are camera everything it should be one of the first things you do when you install it
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,224	| IOT109 |	Yes I am
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,552	| IOT109 |	Those are kind of the big takeaways
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,088	| IOT109 |	Thai soccer
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,392	| IOT109 |	I don't know if you saw anything else that you
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,672	| IOT109 |	Oh yes
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:16,000	| IOT109 |	Now there's this thing is chock-full of information on
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:21,632	| IOT109 |	Security online security in general there's a whole section on iot which we hit some of the highlights so
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:25,216	| IOT109 |	This is definitely worth a read I think it's almost 80 Pages this report
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,800	| IOT109 |	But like I said
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,592	| IOT109 |	Afterwards you'll know how much you need to pay
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,480	| IOT109 |	All right
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,760	| IOT109 |	Quite a bit of news for people
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:39,552	| IOT109 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,320	| IOT109 |	They did
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,976	| IOT109 |	Products including iot
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:48,768	| IOT109 |	Which year
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:54,400	| IOT109 |	Microsoft Azure is there their infrastructure-as-a-service offering for everyone
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:57,472	| IOT109 |	They also have a coyote which is a wafer
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:58,752	| IOT109 |	People who
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,312	| IOT109 |	To configure
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,080	| IOT109 |	Iot
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,920	| IOT109 |	About iot Suite
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,856	| IOT109 |	Call Microsoft
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,880	| IOT109 |	I need some
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,904	| IOT109 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,184	| IOT109 |	We don't have a payment
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,840	| IOT109 |	That don't want
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,632	| IOT109 |	Get Smart
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,400	| IOT109 |	I understand
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,360	| IOT109 |	Cities in other places
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:35,872	| IOT109 |	They're trying to
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,712	| IOT109 |	So I think this is a really smart
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,760	| IOT109 |	Yeah I would agree
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:47,136	| IOT109 |	You know when you're offering a whole package not just an iot product I think we offer package that you want to
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:53,792	| IOT109 |	You're going to find some businesses Enterprises that find it compelling because they don't have to manage all that stuff
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:57,120	| IOT109 |	So obviously Azure is Microsoft's big cloud play
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,656	| IOT109 |	In addition to
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:03,008	| IOT109 |	They also announced Azure time series insights
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,824	| IOT109 |	Which brings you the whole manage data latex
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:09,664	| IOT109 |	Analytic storage visualization so you can you know Annalise
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,992	| IOT109 |	The tons of events that all these are two devices
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,784	| IOT109 |	We presently create so
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:19,648	| IOT109 |	You know about that Insight how do you actually apply the information that these devices catcher
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:24,768	| IOT109 |	So really smart play buy buy Microsoft and this is kind of minor but
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:30,912	| IOT109 |	I never knew that they had an iot blog which is where they have been announcing this news so I'm just out of this to my feed reader
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,472	| IOT109 |	Take an Internet of Things blog didn't know that
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:36,288	| IOT109 |	Baidu
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,312	| IOT109 |	People who
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:39,872	| IOT109 |	Probably
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:43,200	| IOT109 |	This is a big deal for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,992	| IOT109 |	The time series data is basically
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:46,528	| IOT109 |	Time
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,832	| IOT109 |	Temperature
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,368	| IOT109 |	Time in States
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,648	| IOT109 |	Time in anyting
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:59,840	| IOT109 |	But if you're and iot if you're dealing with Device data
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:05,216	| IOT109 |	Amazon
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,264	| IOT109 |	Actually don't know what's going on
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:17,248	| IOT109 |	So now that Microsoft has something that's awesome
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,576	| IOT109 |	A couple other things
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,088	| IOT109 |	They're worth
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,368	| IOT109 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:26,720	| IOT109 |	Battery operated soap reconfigured
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,792	| IOT109 |	Basically this is again
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,584	| IOT109 |	Already done for
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:36,192	| IOT109 |	Accompany
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,728	| IOT109 |	Call Microsoft
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,312	| IOT109 |	It's because they care that works with everything
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,848	| IOT109 |	Pretty awesome
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,152	| IOT109 |	Microsoft are actually doing some really awesome
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,456	| IOT109 |	And now
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:50,272	| IOT109 |	The show
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| IOT109 |	Eventually
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,112	| IOT109 |	Which is Our Guest
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:56,160	| IOT109 |	Jason Shepherd to his
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:56,928	| IOT109 |	With gel
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:32:00,768	| IOT109 |	Discussing the edge boundary which is something Joe
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,816	| IOT109 |	Announce this week with the Linux Foundation
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,888	| IOT109 |	It's basically like middleware for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,216	| IOT109 |	Really cool
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:12,544	| IOT109 |	Iot scale
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,848	| IOT109 |	Shave him for that
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,384	| IOT109 |	Before we go there
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:26,112	| IOT109 |	Hey everyone this is Stacy breaking into this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,136	| IOT109 |	Where is it
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:30,208	| IOT109 |	And this week I'm talking with Mark space who is the head of
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,512	| IOT109 |	Product for home automation at Google
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:35,328	| IOT109 |	People kisses on Google Wi-Fi and integrating it with if
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,376	| IOT109 |	So hey Mark how you doing
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:42,240	| IOT109 |	Good thanks for super excited so why don't you get started and tell us
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,288	| IOT109 |	Why you guys chose to integrate with
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:50,176	| IOT109 |	So we decided it was on the reading platform
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:53,504	| IOT109 |	We want to make sure that we gave
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,040	| IOT109 |	Consumers
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,856	| IOT109 |	Connected to any device
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:59,904	| IOT109 |	And that let us do you seem
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,720	| IOT109 |	Great new features that we had never thought would happen
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:08,864	| IOT109 |	And also being able to allow users to do things like schedule causing devices their schedule
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,240	| IOT109 |	So now you've been on the platform for a year
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,520	| IOT109 |	What type of success
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,032	| IOT109 |	Have you seen
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,296	| IOT109 |	Excited about that
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,576	| IOT109 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:30,880	| IOT109 |	We had a couple teachers that we didn't launch
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:34,208	| IOT109 |	When we release the router and things like being able to
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:34,976	| IOT109 |	Schedule
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,792	| IOT109 |	Prioritizing devices schedule
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,560	| IOT109 |	And
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:42,400	| IOT109 |	Are you just turn into a stew lever step platform for those features as well
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:44,704	| IOT109 |	What do you love that Google WiFi can do
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,008	| IOT109 |	The one of my favorite
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:50,336	| IOT109 |	Examples is there the engineer who came up with an athlete that
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| IOT109 |	Allows a user
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,408	| IOT109 |	When your device connect to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,712	| IOT109 |	Start to play music
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:34:02,624	| IOT109 |	And the entry music
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:06,464	| IOT109 |	So far really use some good entry music I like it
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,768	| IOT109 |	What else can you do with your if denigration
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:14,912	| IOT109 |	Well you know what we saw a lot lizard became one of the number one use case it's so being able to connect
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:18,752	| IOT109 |	Lighting connected to your thermostat
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:23,616	| IOT109 |	That people were asking us to integrate with because if you think about the signals that Google wife ideas
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,408	| IOT109 |	My device connects and disconnects
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,224	| IOT109 |	It sounded great signals for when I get home
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:32,320	| IOT109 |	And we saw a lot of people leverage to connect disconnect signal

EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:57,664	| IOT109 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,432	| IOT109 |	Katie Higginbotham
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,712	| IOT109 |	And today's guest
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:02,784	| IOT109 |	Is Jason Sheppard director strategy and Partnerships
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,808	| IOT109 |	Adele
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,344	| IOT109 |	Hi Jason how are you today
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,112	| IOT109 |	Good
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,136	| IOT109 |	Good morning thanks for having me
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:10,464	| IOT109 |	Good morning I am excited to have you because
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,744	| IOT109 |	Several months ago
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:14,560	| IOT109 |	You talk to me about something that wasn't called project
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,608	| IOT109 |	That job was working on
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:24,288	| IOT109 |	It is no longer called project use is now called
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,056	| IOT109 |	Ajax
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:25,568	| IOT109 |	Foundry
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:26,848	| IOT109 |	Alright so
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,384	| IOT109 |	Edgex Foundry
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,712	| IOT109 |	It's a big name but it's
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,480	| IOT109 |	It's just a name
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,552	| IOT109 |	First off why don't you start telling us
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,088	| IOT109 |	What it is
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:37,856	| IOT109 |	Is that you guys are
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,392	| IOT109 |	Trying to solve
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:40,928	| IOT109 |	The big problem right now and
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,952	| IOT109 |	And IRT is this
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,720	| IOT109 |	Fragmentation
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,512	| IOT109 |	I mean this Market is
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,328	| IOT109 |	It's always going to be heterogeneous there'll always be
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:52,960	| IOT109 |	You're different standards for connectivity all kinds of different domain experience required
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,312	| IOT109 |	It's really important that you partner on new Solutions
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,104	| IOT109 |	Very important that we push standards
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:04,480	| IOT109 |	But that the challenges there will never be a single standard there will never be a single choice for operating
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:07,040	| IOT109 |	You always need to partner
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,064	| IOT109 |	Promise to mean Experian
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,856	| IOT109 |	And so
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:13,184	| IOT109 |	What's needed is something that drives more interoperability and in
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,976	| IOT109 |	I'm cooperation between all of the
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:17,280	| IOT109 |	Different things that are inherently a problem with
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,048	| IOT109 |	Feeling anxiety
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,096	| IOT109 |	Scale is important
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,120	| IOT109 |	Cuz
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,424	| IOT109 |	An example I use all the time
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,776	| IOT109 |	Scale the cost $1,000 to connect
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,848	| IOT109 |	Matt's basically the market right now and it is it
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,896	| IOT109 |	It's really fragmented
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,968	| IOT109 |	And how LD Solutions come together and it's great that there's a lot of
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:40,064	| IOT109 |	True a different diocese out there.
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,600	| IOT109 |	Technology spiders in general
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,624	| IOT109 |	Services providers
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:44,160	| IOT109 |	I work with them every day but
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| IOT109 |	Defragment
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,256	| IOT109 |	So together we need to get to wear it
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:51,840	| IOT109 |	It's more of a consistent foundation so then we can go solve real problems
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,632	| IOT109 |	Analytics
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,144	| IOT109 |	Services
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:37:00,800	| IOT109 |	All right and this is design for the industrial internet or kind of Enterprise iot this is not something for the
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,312	| IOT109 |	Consumer
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:04,384	| IOT109 |	Yeah yeah it's definitely focused on Industrial
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| IOT109 |	You make it industrial-grade
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:09,760	| IOT109 |	You really fit the bill for commercial and Industrial use cases
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:13,600	| IOT109 |	Say people won't use it and consumer. Definitely interest on that side
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:16,160	| IOT109 |	It's built from the ground up to the industrial grape
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,976	| IOT109 |	All right and the focus is at the edge so
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:21,024	| IOT109 |	The idea here is that I can bring in
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,560	| IOT109 |	Any type of radio standard
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:28,192	| IOT109 |	I can have all these different sensors out there I just need to add a driver kind of to this platform
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,752	| IOT109 |	And it is going to
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:33,312	| IOT109 |	It's a framework for me to build to that like
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,616	| IOT109 |	Lets me insert all this extra other stuff on
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:37,408	| IOT109 |	So it's just kind of this middle layer
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,432	| IOT109 |	And now
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,224	| IOT109 |	We're going to delve into what
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,272	| IOT109 |	The components of this middle layer
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,040	| IOT109 |	Cuz it's pretty
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,832	| IOT109 |	What are we really focused on
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,600	| IOT109 |	With Ajax found
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,416	| IOT109 |	I'll start at the end of a high-level are good
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,184	| IOT109 |	Text
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:52,000	| IOT109 |	It's similar to Cloud Foundry
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,560	| IOT109 |	Super popular for building
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:55,584	| IOT109 |	Platform-independent
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:58,912	| IOT109 |	Scale Solutions cloud-native principles
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:02,752	| IOT109 |	Loosely coupled microservices you've done through open source
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,032	| IOT109 |	Your polyglot
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:05,312	| IOT109 |	Which means that I can run it
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:11,456	| IOT109 |	You like and run a python service right next to a Java service right next to a JavaScript you any number of applications
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:12,992	| IOT109 |	Slot together with d
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,272	| IOT109 |	Containers
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:16,320	| IOT109 |	You can deploy on a device
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,392	| IOT109 |	Or spread out across the
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT109 |	Devices
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:25,280	| IOT109 |	You all communicating with one another so that's that Loosely coupled nature is very important here
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,072	| IOT109 |	Because I have 2 solutions
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:31,680	| IOT109 |	Going to spread out all over the place at the edge of the network so he's anything that's not the cloud
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,216	| IOT109 |	Whether it's
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,264	| IOT109 |	The Datacenter or down to the various things
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:38,336	| IOT109 |	Call spread out this is designed to run on
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:43,712	| IOT109 |	Gateway's so the device you're talking about specifically it's like a little bit computer hanging out somewhere
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,016	| IOT109 |	In a factory
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:51,904	| IOT109 |	The devices would you typically connect to a Gateway at the edge especially if they can't talk to the internet native
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:56,000	| IOT109 |	If it's a legacy system like that communicates over
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,024	| IOT109 |	Mudbuster
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:02,656	| IOT109 |	Bacnet or Canvas OR propane at or whatever that you can't natively talk to it
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,936	| IOT109 |	Navigate
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,984	| IOT109 |	People also use Gateway
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:11,104	| IOT109 |	Ways to do local analytics you like that they want to filter data that's coming off of all these sensors
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,664	| IOT109 |	And then you'll see the like normalized
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:16,480	| IOT109 |	Results of the most important data up to
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:18,528	| IOT109 |	You're the backend whether it's a server or
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:21,600	| IOT109 |	The Cloud everything can go to the cloud substrate key to
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:23,392	| IOT109 |	Our strategy at Delavan
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:29,536	| IOT109 |	The industry of people talking about the edge not so yes it's designed to run on the Gateway
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:32,608	| IOT109 |	But that really just any device at the edge that does kind
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,888	| IOT109 |	Computing for
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,168	| IOT109 |	Sings
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:35,936	| IOT109 |	Bringing data
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:38,240	| IOT109 |	Make it interoperate with other data
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:41,056	| IOT109 |	Do some local transformation of the data and push it out of the box
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:44,384	| IOT109 |	You for your choice of protocol soon as your kind of icky layers
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,664	| IOT109 |	In architecture
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,456	| IOT109 |	Loosely coupled with a
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:50,016	| IOT109 |	I can run on a single and what
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:53,344	| IOT109 |	Are the things you talked about it bringing in the data
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,368	| IOT109 |	You talked about
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,672	| IOT109 |	I think it is Data normalization but that may be the wrong way.
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:59,232	| IOT109 |	Yeah that's basically
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| IOT109 |	Your normalizing
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,048	| IOT109 |	You pick your standard
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:05,376	| IOT109 |	Nothing it's very important here to understand that this is not trying to Creighton
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:07,936	| IOT109 |	Talk about it
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:08,960	| IOT109 |	With people there like
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:11,264	| IOT109 |	Oh man you're solving the standards
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:13,312	| IOT109 |	Your fragmentation problem with another stand
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:16,896	| IOT109 |	No that's not that's not the goal here in the goal is to solve the problem with a
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,408	| IOT109 |	Really sucks
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:22,016	| IOT109 |	That makes it all work together so that's that's
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,064	| IOT109 |	Generalization is basically
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,600	| IOT109 |	You know what that lower layer does
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,904	| IOT109 |	I can come to talk to you about a little bit
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:28,672	| IOT109 |	Go for it
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:30,720	| IOT109 |	We're at that spot you should talk through it
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,232	| IOT109 |	All right
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:32,512	| IOT109 |	Start at the bottom
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:33,536	| IOT109 |	So basically you have all these
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:36,864	| IOT109 |	Things that communicate over a variety of different standards
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,632	| IOT109 |	So
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,680	| IOT109 |	If I'm in a an existing
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:41,216	| IOT109 |	Situation at brownfields
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:41,984	| IOT109 |	Situation
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:44,032	| IOT109 |	I'm kinda told what protocol I need to talk
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:46,848	| IOT109 |	Maybe I'm in the building and I'm talking to bacnet
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:47,872	| IOT109 |	Ormond bus
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,920	| IOT109 |	You're the problem today going back to
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,944	| IOT109 |	The fragmentation problem
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:54,016	| IOT109 |	I mean there's literally if you left it a hundred different plots
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:54,528	| IOT109 |	Storms out there
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,832	| IOT109 |	They basically all right
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:57,856	| IOT109 |	At the application
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,904	| IOT109 |	The device interface
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,952	| IOT109 |	No for that particular bacnet
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,976	| IOT109 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,512	| IOT109 |	Where that particular modbus
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,560	| IOT109 |	Flow meter for note for the water
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,608	| IOT109 |	Be alright the drivers different
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,400	| IOT109 |	So even though modbus
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:10,912	| IOT109 |	The standard
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,448	| IOT109 |	At the Opera
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,472	| IOT109 |	Json layer
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:15,008	| IOT109 |	Kind of like your keyboard driver
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,288	| IOT109 |	Everyone treats a differently
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,848	| IOT109 |	Because I just kind of writing drivers to make it work
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:20,128	| IOT109 |	Just to get the data so then
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,896	| IOT109 |	Analytics
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:22,688	| IOT109 |	The platform
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,224	| IOT109 |	Really have a hundred different
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,784	| IOT109 |	Drivers for that modbus
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,296	| IOT109 |	Water phlegm
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:31,136	| IOT109 |	That's the fragmentation that makes it really hard to scale
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,160	| IOT109 |	So what are jets fans
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:35,488	| IOT109 |	Is it provides you a common way to write
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:36,000	| IOT109 |	Drivers
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,024	| IOT109 |	Devices
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,072	| IOT109 |	Is done through enough
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:42,656	| IOT109 |	BK for the device services and so each device service is a
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,168	| IOT109 |	The container
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:45,984	| IOT109 |	You can point through Docker or anime
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:48,544	| IOT109 |	Turn to snap you to play a service kind of like
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,056	| IOT109 |	The keyboard driver
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:50,336	| IOT109 |	It's done
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,616	| IOT109 |	You about the OS
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:57,247	| IOT109 |	But it's also agnostic that's another key part of this architecture is its platform-independent
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,271	| IOT109 |	Both in terms of
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,551	| IOT109 |	Hardware
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:01,599	| IOT109 |	So any CPU arm or x86
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:06,463	| IOT109 |	Even though we're doing it through the Linux Foundation of course it runs on Linux
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:09,535	| IOT109 |	Windows keep running on Macos
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:11,071	| IOT109 |	So that device servicenow
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,607	| IOT109 |	How can run on your choice of cyst
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,655	| IOT109 |	You write the driver once
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,447	| IOT109 |	4 using the SD
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,215	| IOT109 |	Hey
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,495	| IOT109 |	And now it works
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:20,799	| IOT109 |	With the core services in the edge X architecture
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,591	| IOT109 |	Common way
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,127	| IOT109 |	So I do not modbus
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:24,639	| IOT109 |	Driver once
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,943	| IOT109 |	I do the bacnet driver once for that
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:28,735	| IOT109 |	Device
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:30,271	| IOT109 |	And I can start to build a library
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:31,551	| IOT109 |	Consistent
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,087	| IOT109 |	And once that libraries
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:34,623	| IOT109 |	In all application
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:36,159	| IOT109 |	Topside
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,951	| IOT109 |	And use a common
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,719	| IOT109 |	What
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:43,071	| IOT109 |	And the chief for years that you get a bunch of companies involved and you put it through open sores
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,351	| IOT109 |	So that
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:49,983	| IOT109 |	There's a very consistent way and in terms of how these device drivers are so I can be back Matt and modbus
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:52,287	| IOT109 |	Zigbee temperature for energy
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,079	| IOT109 |	Gtt or some sort of
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,663	| IOT109 |	Coyote protocol any number of
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:58,431	| IOT109 |	Choices
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:59,967	| IOT109 |	It could even be a proprietary
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:01,759	| IOT109 |	Standard
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:05,599	| IOT109 |	As long as you use the device service SDK to write in
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,623	| IOT109 |	Consistent format
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:09,439	| IOT109 |	Alfie the protocol support plasty
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,975	| IOT109 |	Metadata above that
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:11,743	| IOT109 |	Describes
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:15,583	| IOT109 |	The details of that particular device the core of the architecture knows how to talk to
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,119	| IOT109 |	Right it's like
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:18,399	| IOT109 |	Crowdsourcing the one ring
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:19,423	| IOT109 |	Everything can talk
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:20,959	| IOT109 |	Yeah
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:24,287	| IOT109 |	So the middle is the secret decoder ring
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,567	| IOT109 |	That allows you to
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:27,359	| IOT109 |	You talk to that. Devices
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:29,407	| IOT109 |	Okay
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,687	| IOT109 |	This is a Dell
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:31,967	| IOT109 |	Created
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:35,295	| IOT109 |	Project but it is open-sourced we talked
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:38,623	| IOT109 |	You were about to basically.
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,671	| IOT109 |	Hey we're doing
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,951	| IOT109 |	So what has the result
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,767	| IOT109 |	At this point we've engaged with
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:45,791	| IOT109 |	Hundreds and hundreds
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:48,863	| IOT109 |	The companies that are interested in using this this code
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,911	| IOT109 |	As a foundation
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:51,935	| IOT109 |	Further
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,703	| IOT109 |	There is clots
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:56,031	| IOT109 |	You said they build a Gateway platform today
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:56,799	| IOT109 |	Even if you
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:44:00,639	| IOT109 |	You do those device interfaces today out of necessity to get the data
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:03,199	| IOT109 |	We have a lot of companies are like you know what
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:03,967	| IOT109 |	I'd rather
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:04,735	| IOT109 |	Drop what I've done
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,783	| IOT109 |	Necessity and use this
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:10,367	| IOT109 |	That's a Sunday since we've got lots and lots of companies are interested in doing that
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:14,719	| IOT109 |	And the other important thing is that there's a lot of companies that build things like
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:17,279	| IOT109 |	Complex event processing engine
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:19,327	| IOT109 |	For a Gateway for the edge Analytics
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,863	| IOT109 |	Security service
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,399	| IOT109 |	That can run at the edge
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:25,983	| IOT109 |	System management tools with backend console
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:29,055	| IOT109 |	Databases you any kind of value out around
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:31,103	| IOT109 |	The data ingestion
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,383	| IOT109 |	A lot of people are struggling to
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:36,735	| IOT109 |	There's no center of gravity to attach it to that that's kind of industry adopted
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:40,831	| IOT109 |	Unit in the tangible way and so that's why we're getting so much interest
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,111	| IOT109 |	Not only do we have
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:42,623	| IOT109 |	Hundreds of
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:47,231	| IOT109 |	You're when we launched the project last week
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:49,279	| IOT109 |	You we had right around 50
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,583	| IOT109 |	Your founding members for the project
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:52,863	| IOT109 |	Lots of people that want to
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:55,423	| IOT109 |	The code is amateurs and open source
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:45:01,823	| IOT109 |	You'll never go from there so it's a big launching and we're looking forward to it now being you cannot truly 8/8
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:03,103	| IOT109 |	A community effort
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:07,455	| IOT109 |	I'm going from there you guys are signed up companies such as Google sap
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,479	| IOT109 |	And others
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,527	| IOT109 |	And what I'd like to know is
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:11,551	| IOT109 |	Why are they getting info
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:14,367	| IOT109 |	Companies of all sizes
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:19,743	| IOT109 |	Are really just looking for a way to focus their time on invaluable
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:22,303	| IOT109 |	And so so rather than Reinventing
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:23,071	| IOT109 |	You know
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:25,119	| IOT109 |	For The Hundreds or so times
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:27,167	| IOT109 |	A single type of device
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:30,751	| IOT109 |	Let's all use a more common way of inner operating
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,031	| IOT109 |	Sensors
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:33,311	| IOT109 |	Systems
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:36,127	| IOT109 |	And then let's go build value-add on top
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,663	| IOT109 |	So those those types of companies
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,943	| IOT109 |	I see it as a way to really
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:40,223	| IOT109 |	You prioritize
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:40,991	| IOT109 |	Timeout
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:41,503	| IOT109 |	On the real value
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:44,831	| IOT109 |	Your analytics and services and
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:48,415	| IOT109 |	Security in system management tow companies
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,695	| IOT109 |	A large like like
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:51,487	| IOT109 |	You Google an SAT and
EDL	00:45:51,487	00:45:53,791	| IOT109 |	Electric lighters like Chronicle
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:56,351	| IOT109 |	We've got a smaller startup
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:46:00,447	| IOT109 |	Doing really good stuff in it that it's actually built a lot of this time
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,983	| IOT109 |	Kind of stopping their own platform
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:05,311	| IOT109 |	It'd be much better use of my time to use a common
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,615	| IOT109 |	Core and then focus on value so
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:09,919	| IOT109 |	People like Kimi lacity and
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:10,431	| IOT109 |	Henry layer
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:12,223	| IOT109 |	Docker Networks
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:15,039	| IOT109 |	Edge analytics company called foghorn
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:17,599	| IOT109 |	Home security providers like no Kana
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:19,135	| IOT109 |	Device Authority
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:20,927	| IOT109 |	Forgerock
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:22,719	| IOT109 |	All coming together
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,255	| IOT109 |	Go to
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,279	| IOT109 |	Add their value
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:27,071	| IOT109 |	Around this common
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,095	| IOT109 |	Foundation
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:28,863	| IOT109 |	Got it
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:31,167	| IOT109 |	And you kind of answered one of my questions was
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:33,471	| IOT109 |	Which was about will this hurt others that have
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,519	| IOT109 |	Really built a business around kind of
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:37,823	| IOT109 |	Bringing all the stuff together and it sounds like
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:40,383	| IOT109 |	Most of those companies would rather not
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:43,455	| IOT109 |	Spend some of these extra things
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:45,503	| IOT109 |	So let's talk about these extra things
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:46,783	| IOT109 |	I think it's worthwhile
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,575	| IOT109 |	You have a vision
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:49,343	| IOT109 |	Where
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:53,951	| IOT109 |	You got the score use the estoque and then various apis and you can plug like
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:54,975	| IOT109 |	Your security
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:57,791	| IOT109 |	Efforts and your data analytics what else can you
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:58,303	| IOT109 |	Bring to the spa
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:01,119	| IOT109 |	No system management so
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:06,751	| IOT109 |	Example like I'm trying to manage a bunch of sensors yuan in their firmware updates
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,031	| IOT109 |	Youku
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:11,359	| IOT109 |	Connecting two gateways or just a network in general
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:14,175	| IOT109 |	It's really different difficult to do because of
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,199	| IOT109 |	Yours all those different
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:17,759	| IOT109 |	Standard so this provides a center of gravity for those types
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| IOT109 |	Play I'm a database
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:22,879	| IOT109 |	Provider and I offer like a time-series database
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:26,975	| IOT109 |	You collect data on a Gateway and then I do it like a really good fashion
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,743	| IOT109 |	Preston
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,023	| IOT109 |	Oakley
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:33,631	| IOT109 |	Send out the stuff that matters to my business and pay for it over the network
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:35,167	| IOT109 |	Yeah you could be that type of swim-bladder
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:37,215	| IOT109 |	We've even got company
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:38,751	| IOT109 |	Interesting
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,287	| IOT109 |	It's the so much value the
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,055	| IOT109 |	We added
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:41,823	| IOT109 |	Around the wheel
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:45,151	| IOT109 |	Companies that are starting to
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:46,175	| IOT109 |	You add
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:47,711	| IOT109 |	Training services around it
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:52,575	| IOT109 |	Your dad will be a certification program in the Linux foundation and we thought
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:53,599	| IOT109 |	Your certification
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,367	| IOT109 |	Houses
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:55,903	| IOT109 |	Instant signing app
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:58,207	| IOT109 |	I'm speaking about extension of
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:59,487	| IOT109 |	Part of it
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:02,303	| IOT109 |	Does a company is companies that do kind of logging
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:04,607	| IOT109 |	Services for letting an 18 attached to it
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,399	| IOT109 |	It's got a framework on
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:08,959	| IOT109 |	On the top side of that. Interoperability layer
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:11,263	| IOT109 |	Describes how data comes up and comes back down
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:13,055	| IOT109 |	To those devices
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:14,591	| IOT109 |	It's got a bunch of
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,871	| IOT109 |	Place holders that are all reference
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:18,687	| IOT109 |	They all communicate through exercising
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:19,199	| IOT109 |	On the platform
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,479	| IOT109 |	Your rules engine
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,551	| IOT109 |	And there's a database in there it's mongodb
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:26,879	| IOT109 |	Oh you don't like that database you can replace it with your own
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:28,159	| IOT109 |	Does reference services
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:29,951	| IOT109 |	Give you something that works out of the box
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:31,999	| IOT109 |	But all these different types of
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:32,511	| IOT109 |	It providers
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:33,535	| IOT109 |	Can
EDL	00:48:34,047	00:48:35,583	| IOT109 |	Commercialize their versions
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:37,887	| IOT109 |	News about the platform in their plugin
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:39,167	| IOT109 |	Alternates that they sell
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,727	| IOT109 |	Okay and then
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:46,847	| IOT109 |	How does this fit in with some of the other efforts out there like there's project quora
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:49,151	| IOT109 |	From the eclipse Foundation
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:53,503	| IOT109 |	I don't know if some of the other kind of standards are going to try to get into here
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,783	| IOT109 |	There's kind of some
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:58,367	| IOT109 |	Reference architecture efforts for The Internet of Things Consortium
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:49:01,951	| IOT109 |	So how does this fit in with that kind of wider ecosystem of trying to make the world
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:05,279	| IOT109 |	Yeah so we
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,559	| IOT109 |	Yeah that was that's part of the
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:10,911	| IOT109 |	Alignment that we've been working on all this time over the past
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:13,215	| IOT109 |	A few years that we've been building the project is
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:17,311	| IOT109 |	I don't want to reinvent standards there's plenty of really good standards
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:18,335	| IOT109 |	No we don't want to
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:22,687	| IOT109 |	Dell New Consortium like where we want to align with them the Kura project we've been
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:24,223	| IOT109 |	Indirect contact with
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:25,247	| IOT109 |	Eclipse Foundation
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:27,039	| IOT109 |	It is overlapped
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:28,575	| IOT109 |	I was Sakura project
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:31,391	| IOT109 |	We seriously consider joining prayer with think it's a great project
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:37,279	| IOT109 |	We saw the market needed something that had a little bit more flexibility in terms of being Loosely coupled
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,815	| IOT109 |	Your polyglot I eat
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:44,447	| IOT109 |	It's not just Java you can run all these different code bases together which is important when you're trying to unify partners
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:46,751	| IOT109 |	Developers cuz they all have different preferences
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:47,519	| IOT109 |	That's why I
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:48,799	| IOT109 |	What's the different architecture
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:52,895	| IOT109 |	But actually you could take a career based Gateway and plug it into a jack
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:55,455	| IOT109 |	Infina K10 you can have a service that.
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:58,271	| IOT109 |	Gateway to Gateway so you actually think that they
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:50:01,343	| IOT109 |	Play some good collaboration potential with a variety of different
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:02,879	| IOT109 |	You open source projects that is
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:06,719	| IOT109 |	Solving similar needs in different ways
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:13,119	| IOT109 |	In terms of Standards we've already got folks like you Ellie and notion signed up for working
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:19,519	| IOT109 |	Foundation on a on a liaison agreement there so if you're in manufacturing opc-ua is a very important
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:21,823	| IOT109 |	That we want to promote
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:22,847	| IOT109 |	Call ideas
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:24,639	| IOT109 |	Use good standards
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:26,175	| IOT109 |	You know if you don't have an opinion
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:29,759	| IOT109 |	But if you have to use something at least use a common way to write to it
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:30,783	| IOT109 |	Talk to it
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:33,087	| IOT109 |	So and we're working on
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:39,487	| IOT109 |	Just invited to Malaysia open connectivity Foundation we're building a liaison agreement
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:40,255	| IOT109 |	We've been
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:41,791	| IOT109 |	You working with IC
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,839	| IOT109 |	Two same thing
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:45,375	| IOT109 |	About the liaison agreement
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:51,775	| IOT109 |	I actually last week when we are there we showed the edge x one of the demos was part of an iic security test bed
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:53,567	| IOT109 |	Bunch of people at participating
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:55,615	| IOT109 |	Open fog Consortium
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:51:02,015	| IOT109 |	If you read the reference architecture that was put out recently it's actually very similar to an infant
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:03,039	| IOT109 |	A lot of the elements
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:05,087	| IOT109 |	To the edge X Andre architecture
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:08,671	| IOT109 |	Yes we were founding member of openfox or working with a bunch of different
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:12,511	| IOT109 |	Shapewear
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:16,863	| IOT109 |	Edgex Foundry can be used as an ingredient in open smog test pek
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,911	| IOT109 |	We've really been trying to
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:23,263	| IOT109 |	Bridge to all these different efforts
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:25,823	| IOT109 |	And we get this kind of PC model
EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:26,591	| IOT109 |	4
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:28,639	| IOT109 |	Industrial internet-of-things are just
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:29,663	| IOT109 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:32,223	| IOT109 |	How much time do you think this could save
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,015	| IOT109 |	People trying to
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:34,527	| IOT109 |	Implement
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:37,599	| IOT109 |	Connected battery is connected hospitals connected
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:44,511	| IOT109 |	Yeah minutes time-factor there's also a security Factory with you not going to talk to a couple things but you just in terms of time
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:47,327	| IOT109 |	And I'm going to start by saying imagine if
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:50,655	| IOT109 |	If 50% of the brain power give or take wasn't
EDL	00:51:50,655	00:51:53,727	| IOT109 |	You focus on reinvention today in the market writing device service
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:58,591	| IOT109 |	If you need to write new protocol support I can take weeks to months to do it
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:00,639	| IOT109 |	You depending on what platform you are working in
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:01,919	| IOT109 |	Some of the best
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:03,967	| IOT109 |	Glassdoor the proprietary platform
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:07,295	| IOT109 |	Once you know a little bit about a protocol you can do it very quickly
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:08,575	| IOT109 |	So
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:10,111	| IOT109 |	You know it's not like it's saving you.
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:13,439	| IOT109 |	Time for say you compared to maybe the best in class
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:14,463	| IOT109 |	Silent protocol
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:17,279	| IOT109 |	But I have to redo it for every pot for
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:18,047	| IOT109 |	Form out there
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:22,143	| IOT109 |	Hear it saves time because once I do a device service I can reuse it
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:24,703	| IOT109 |	With anybody's application on the back end so maybe I want to
EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:26,239	| IOT109 |	Connect to
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:31,103	| IOT109 |	Your thing works in a deal in one case and then I went to connect to sap Hana
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:34,943	| IOT109 |	You know or or IBM Watson or relayer or
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:37,759	| IOT109 |	Any laxity any number of different providers
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:39,807	| IOT109 |	I can do the work once
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:42,111	| IOT109 |	Are the prime factors is
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:43,135	| IOT109 |	You way better
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:44,927	| IOT109 |	Everything is just
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:46,207	| IOT109 |	Trying to sell
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:47,999	| IOT109 |	It takes a lot of
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:49,279	| IOT109 |	Time to sell
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,047	| IOT109 |	Embedded Solutions
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:53,631	| IOT109 |	And the challenge today is when customers look at the market they're like
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:55,423	| IOT109 |	Man there's a lot of platform
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:58,495	| IOT109 |	Literally search you iot platform
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:52:59,007	| IOT109 |	Google
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:01,055	| IOT109 |	Incredible number of
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:04,895	| IOT109 |	A lot of people adding a lot of value but also a lot of reinvention
EDL	00:53:06,175	00:53:07,967	| IOT109 |	Fuses Customer Center
EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:08,991	| IOT109 |	Time to revenue
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:11,039	| IOT109 |	Customers are like
EDL	00:53:11,039	00:53:16,927	| IOT109 |	I don't know if I want to make the wrong decision especially at the edge where you have to update it
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:18,207	| IOT109 |	Because I made a mistake on my
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:19,999	| IOT109 |	I'm rolling a truck out there today
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:20,767	| IOT109 |	Will fix it
EDL	00:53:23,071	00:53:23,839	| IOT109 |	Should I said
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:25,119	| IOT109 |	And everything
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:26,655	| IOT109 |	This time on development
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:27,679	| IOT109 |	Time to revenue
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:30,751	| IOT109 |	Not only because of the it on the time but also because of the
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:32,287	| IOT109 |	Decision time for customers
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:34,847	| IOT109 |	You're not looking at so many choices
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:36,383	| IOT109 |	That are very confusing
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:38,687	| IOT109 |	Did the security side to you very important
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:40,479	| IOT109 |	I would argue that
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:42,271	| IOT109 |	Impossible to really
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:43,039	| IOT109 |	Shell
EDL	00:53:43,039	00:53:47,135	| IOT109 |	You like smart city solutions or anything that kind of crosses public and private boundaries
EDL	00:53:47,647	00:53:48,927	| IOT109 |	Or even
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:49,439	| IOT109 |	Private surprise
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:51,231	| IOT109 |	Businesses sharing data
EDL	00:53:51,743	00:53:53,279	| IOT109 |	Without some sort of
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:55,583	| IOT109 |	Trusted openkore that everyone
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:57,119	| IOT109 |	And take a look at
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:53:58,655	| IOT109 |	Everyone
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:01,983	| IOT109 |	Godzilla Security Administration pass
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:03,775	| IOT109 |	And also if you're trying to share data between
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:04,799	| IOT109 |	Three different companies
EDL	00:54:04,799	00:54:06,591	| IOT109 |	Difference a public and private entities
EDL	00:54:07,103	00:54:08,639	| IOT109 |	Having that open Trust
EDL	00:54:08,639	00:54:10,175	| IOT109 |	Corvette
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:12,991	| IOT109 |	Exchanges data between things and applications
EDL	00:54:12,991	00:54:15,295	| IOT109 |	It is really important that we think it'll actually help
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:16,319	| IOT109 |	You there as well
EDL	00:54:17,343	00:54:18,367	| IOT109 |	Ip true internet
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:21,695	| IOT109 |	We always dress start
EDL	00:54:21,695	00:54:22,975	| IOT109 |	With your your things
EDL	00:54:22,975	00:54:25,279	| IOT109 |	Start with with a small and a domain
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:29,631	| IOT109 |	And then it'll be like a series of increasingly larger Intranet
EDL	00:54:30,143	00:54:35,519	| IOT109 |	You saying everything's going to talk with everything is probably a bit of a misnomer but you're having that open crust and core
EDL	00:54:38,847	00:54:41,919	| IOT109 |	I love it I never thought I could spend so much time talking about drivers
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:44,735	| IOT109 |	I can keep going
EDL	00:54:46,015	00:54:46,783	| IOT109 |	You
EDL	00:54:46,783	00:54:48,319	| IOT109 |	I've done a great job Jason
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:49,599	| IOT109 |	Thank you so much for
EDL	00:54:49,599	00:54:50,111	| IOT109 |	For coming on the show
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:57,535	| IOT109 |	Thanks for having me at this might either well that's it for another episode of The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:55:03,679	| IOT109 |	Please join us next week when we have another amazing show for you and if in the meantime you are
