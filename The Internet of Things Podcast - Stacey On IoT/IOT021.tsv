EDL	00:00:15,616	00:00:16,640	| IOT021 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:18,688	| IOT021 |	And today show is going to be
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:22,016	| IOT021 |	How to say mostly about the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:00:22,016	00:00:23,296	| IOT021 |	We will call her
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:24,576	| IOT021 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:25,856	| IOT021 |	Because
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:32,256	| IOT021 |	I turn her microphone off so she can't hear me which is good but you're right today it's a it's a veritable potpourri of small
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:32,768	| IOT021 |	Smart home discussion
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:35,584	| IOT021 |	Indeed why was he better other
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:37,376	| IOT021 |	Our listeners who might be
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:39,680	| IOT021 |	They might also have
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:40,448	| IOT021 |	An echo
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:43,520	| IOT021 |	Oh yes yes
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,056	| IOT021 |	Or email sessions
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,360	| IOT021 |	Emails from people who are like
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,384	| IOT021 |	Nevermind
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:50,176	| IOT021 |	Turn down my echo
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:50,944	| IOT021 |	Knock it off
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:54,272	| IOT021 |	Will try really hard but you never know
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:56,064	| IOT021 |	I catch my husband actually all the time
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,112	| IOT021 |	Whatever
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:03,488	| IOT021 |	I do the same thing
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:05,792	| IOT021 |	It's okay people you can say thank you
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:07,840	| IOT021 |	Is it shows you're polite
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:08,864	| IOT021 |	Even to our robot
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:10,144	| IOT021 |	6
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:13,216	| IOT021 |	So this week's big news was that SmartThings
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:13,728	| IOT021 |	Which
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:17,568	| IOT021 |	Listen to the show you know that I am a huge fan of SmartThings
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:20,128	| IOT021 |	SmartThings support has come to the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:21,664	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:22,432	| IOT021 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,456	| IOT021 |	I
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:26,016	| IOT021 |	Promptly when I saw it hooked it up
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:28,320	| IOT021 |	And have been playing with it and
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,880	| IOT021 |	I'm going to say it was a bit of a let-down
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:34,720	| IOT021 |	Show that build up and it was just a little
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:38,304	| IOT021 |	Why what's the matter say I don't have any smart things stuff here
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:41,888	| IOT021 |	So I will say I live in a smart home divided
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:42,400	| IOT021 |	Because this
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:46,240	| IOT021 |	So I have already moved over all of my lights
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:49,056	| IOT021 |	To the wink Hub because the wink had been
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:49,568	| IOT021 |	Hooked into the app
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:52,128	| IOT021 |	So I've been playing with my lights
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,920	| IOT021 |	For the last couple weeks
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:54,944	| IOT021 |	I'm
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,992	| IOT021 |	So I had no lights on
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,528	| IOT021 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,088	| IOT021 |	So when I moved
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:04,928	| IOT021 |	My SmartThings stuff over I was really curious like what would actually show up
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,976	| IOT021 |	In the answer was
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,256	| IOT021 |	My Sonos
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,328	| IOT021 |	Valley Vet because
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,632	| IOT021 |	Right now
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,168	| IOT021 |	The echo doesn't suck
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,216	| IOT021 |	Support a lot of the sensors
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:17,728	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,032	| IOT021 |	Z-Wave switches
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,080	| IOT021 |	That I have
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:24,896	| IOT021 |	In my smart my SmartThings gear is mostly
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,688	| IOT021 |	Motion detectors
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,016	| IOT021 |	Samsung smartthings multi-sensor
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,296	| IOT021 |	My zwave locks
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:32,576	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,880	| IOT021 |	Z Wave automated blinds
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,976	| IOT021 |	And I didn't I meant to hook up my Z-Wave
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:43,072	| IOT021 |	Outlets to see if I could turn the coffee pot on and off from it but I did get a chance to
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,864	| IOT021 |	So say to next
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,656	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,704	| IOT021 |	None of them showed up
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,240	| IOT021 |	And there's actually a really
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,520	| IOT021 |	Good reason for this
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,544	| IOT021 |	Well for some of it
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:57,920	| IOT021 |	Amazon decided that you know maybe it's a bad idea if you say something like
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,200	| IOT021 |	Alexa
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,016	| IOT021 |	Open the back door unlock the back door
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,088	| IOT021 |	There's no like password or anything
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,160	| IOT021 |	Associated with that so you know anyone could just like
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:15,072	| IOT021 |	Turn open window shop for the echo to unlock your back door that's okay that's a fair point
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,888	| IOT021 |	So it was kind of a security
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,680	| IOT021 |	Concern
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| IOT021 |	Maybe that's why
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,240	| IOT021 |	See that
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| IOT021 |	Coming anytime soon
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:23,776	| IOT021 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,848	| IOT021 |	The downside is you can't do something like
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,128	| IOT021 |	Alexa
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,408	| IOT021 |	Go to bed
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:29,920	| IOT021 |	Or
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| IOT021 |	Get upset your house
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,480	| IOT021 |	Good night
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,040	| IOT021 |	Make a scene
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,064	| IOT021 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,112	| IOT021 |	Don't make a scene
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,160	| IOT021 |	She will not be making any seeds
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,024	| IOT021 |	In what I send you the locks which I actually
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,608	| IOT021 |	We just installed you will find that I actually put one on the wink
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,912	| IOT021 |	Just to see if the wink would actually
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,704	| IOT021 |	Except the
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,008	| IOT021 |	Z-Wave locks as well it doesn't
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,544	| IOT021 |	Oh now.
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| IOT021 |	You're gone but you're still getting the locks
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| IOT021 |	Deal with it
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,176	| IOT021 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,480	| IOT021 |	So that is
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:05,760	| IOT021 |	That is what I learned
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT021 |	Interesting
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,576	| IOT021 |	Well guess what's this
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:13,696	| IOT021 |	It's funny because a blog post on the SmartThings blog Ashley went live
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:18,559	| IOT021 |	Before Amazon officially announced it and then the block was pulled because
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:24,447	| IOT021 |	Amazon I guess was ready to announce it so we knew this was coming last week and then shortly after
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,239	| IOT021 |	Ibloom we we found out
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,031	| IOT021 |	But there weren't a lot of details on what
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,567	| IOT021 |	What SmartThings
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,663	| IOT021 |	Devices where I should support you says the Hub and some devices
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:37,247	| IOT021 |	And I'm still digging on Amazon site can't find it
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:40,319	| IOT021 |	I did just want something very interesting though it's interesting
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| IOT021 |	Yay but also disappointing boo
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:49,279	| IOT021 |	Brightness control is now support on the osram a19 bulb which is bulbs that I bought because those are the ones that are color
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,303	| IOT021 |	Tunable color temperature
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,607	| IOT021 |	Shoe Carnival
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:56,191	| IOT021 |	Connect to the osram a19 bulb Astra actual blood
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:02,591	| IOT021 |	They spell it wrong on their website vlug
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:05,663	| IOT021 |	Means require SmartThings Hub so even with my wink hub
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,199	| IOT021 |	I have the right pelvis but not the Hub
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,247	| IOT021 |	Who is getting frustrating now
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| IOT021 |	Oh well
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:16,927	| IOT021 |	It's okay because at the end of September it looks like SmartThings is going to have a new
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:19,999	| IOT021 |	Hub as a SmartThings consumer I got an email
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,279	| IOT021 |	Last week
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,559	| IOT021 |	I want to say
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,607	| IOT021 |	Let me
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| IOT021 |	Pre-order a new hub
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,423	| IOT021 |	From SmartThings
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,983	| IOT021 |	That would be out by the end of
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:36,383	| IOT021 |	Two things here and moon is going to be a step back just I know it meant to SmartThings before I just want to
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,967	| IOT021 |	Real quick to the history this is the
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:43,295	| IOT021 |	Brand that went on Kickstarter 2 or 3 years ago
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,831	| IOT021 |	One of the earliest brands
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,367	| IOT021 |	In this market I think
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:49,951	| IOT021 |	And was later purchased by Samsung so everytime we say smart things
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,767	| IOT021 |	What time does Samsung own property to show folks know that
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:56,351	| IOT021 |	And secondly my question is for what is the new Hub going to bring
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,655	| IOT021 |	Okay I knew you were going to ask
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,703	| IOT021 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,287	| IOT021 |	I'm allowed to make a scene
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,335	| IOT021 |	Okay so
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,871	| IOT021 |	I was testing SmartThings
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,895	| IOT021 |	In my house
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,663	| IOT021 |	Sign June 23rd
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,479	| IOT021 |	So that's what that's how old the hub's a Time
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,247	| IOT021 |	Currently running
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,807	| IOT021 |	I know it's like ancient
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| IOT021 |	Old man
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,391	| IOT021 |	Now the new hub
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,951	| IOT021 |	I talked to Alex Hawkinson
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,767	| IOT021 |	The CEO of SmartThings
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| IOT021 |	Back at CES
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,863	| IOT021 |	And he told us it was going to have
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,911	| IOT021 |	Couple new radios in it
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,703	| IOT021 |	Mostly to keep it
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:36,543	| IOT021 |	Online so right now if my SmartThings Hub goes
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,567	| IOT021 |	Loses power
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:41,151	| IOT021 |	And internet access it goes offline
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,455	| IOT021 |	And it won't do anything
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,223	| IOT021 |	I think so
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| IOT021 |	Now it gets
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| IOT021 |	A full-on brain
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| IOT021 |	Naked cellular backup
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,063	| IOT021 |	If I want it
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,111	| IOT021 |	If I want it
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,135	| IOT021 |	I don't need it
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| IOT021 |	Cost a lot more extra
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,767	| IOT021 |	In the Hubble add Bluetooth smart
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:57,791	| IOT021 |	Now
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:01,631	| IOT021 |	This was all back at CES that they talked about this
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,399	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| IOT021 |	It was supposed to launch in May
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,751	| IOT021 |	But I think what happened was
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:10,079	| IOT021 |	Adding support for homekit kind of push this back of the
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,871	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,735	| IOT021 |	I think what's what we're seeing again is that that delayed homekit kind of
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT021 |	Time frame
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,343	| IOT021 |	I'm expecting that will hear more from smart
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| IOT021 |	Things very soon
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,183	| IOT021 |	I've reached out to them hopefully
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:25,951	| IOT021 |	Willard Moore
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,231	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,535	| IOT021 |	I know that I will probably be in line to
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,583	| IOT021 |	Order myself a brand new SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,655	| IOT021 |	In keeping with that house divided theme
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:39,519	| IOT021 |	So back to the Echo and kind of the SmartThings integration because people with
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,055	| IOT021 |	A Sonos
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,591	| IOT021 |	Might be interested to discover
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| IOT021 |	How this works
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,687	| IOT021 |	Yeah I'm curious I don't have a Sonos
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:49,247	| IOT021 |	And I probably won't get my meds so curious how they integrated
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,343	| IOT021 |	Sonos through SmartThings is known as a lab
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,415	| IOT021 |	Which means it is not officially supported
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,207	| IOT021 |	Because Sonos doesn't officially
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,487	| IOT021 |	Support anybody's
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| IOT021 |	We're all very hopeful
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,071	| IOT021 |	All of us being
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,583	| IOT021 |	Domino's Pizza
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,655	| IOT021 |	So what it does is right now
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,215	| IOT021 |	You can use your Sonos
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:12,031	| IOT021 |	Speakers is basically like the voice of your smart home
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,543	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,615	| IOT021 |	You can also play a existing playlist
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| IOT021 |	So if your Sonos
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,943	| IOT021 |	Is currently playing
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,759	| IOT021 |	My Sonos one or any one of my Sonos
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,575	| IOT021 |	Sonos is always playing one of my daughters like
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,111	| IOT021 |	Top 40 pop hits playlist
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,647	| IOT021 |	Anyone
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,463	| IOT021 |	So now I can tell Alexa
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,279	| IOT021 |	Sorry I
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,839	| IOT021 |	Just wake up everybody staying as a bad person
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,375	| IOT021 |	I can tell the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,399	| IOT021 |	Play
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| IOT021 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,983	| IOT021 |	Oh no I have to say turn on
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,495	| IOT021 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:43,775	| IOT021 |	Sonos
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,359	| IOT021 |	Cuz that's in my in my SmartThings
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,407	| IOT021 |	It is labeled kitchen Sonos
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,967	| IOT021 |	Okay and you have to use the same nomenclature
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,527	| IOT021 |	Sure is the same keywords kind of
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| IOT021 |	As
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,855	| IOT021 |	Lights turn on kitchen Sonos turns it on
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:01,951	| IOT021 |	And it plays wherever it stopped playing last
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,975	| IOT021 |	Only place that playlist
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,279	| IOT021 |	And then I can say turn off
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,119	| IOT021 |	The only things you can do
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,167	| IOT021 |	Turn up the volume you cannot fast forward
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:18,335	| IOT021 |	So it's a very minimal it's an on-off switch essentially by voice at this point which is very similar to some of my lights even though they
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,615	| IOT021 |	They are dimmable I can't
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,151	| IOT021 |	Use the brightness controls got so
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,199	| IOT021 |	It's interesting that it was straight
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,247	| IOT021 |	Even though we're getting these integration
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:27,295	| IOT021 |	Since we're getting them piecemeal innocence and
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| IOT021 |	Eminem
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,623	| IOT021 |	Probably okay for most people
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:33,439	| IOT021 |	There for you and I've been doing this kind stuff for several years
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,719	| IOT021 |	Anthony a little frustrating
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:39,327	| IOT021 |	Yeah the only thing basically the only thing I can do with the echo
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,863	| IOT021 |	Is lighting related
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,399	| IOT021 |	And DeSoto
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:42,911	| IOT021 |	Narcissus
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| IOT021 |	I know it's Sonos
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:49,567	| IOT021 |	Don't make a scene
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,151	| IOT021 |	So that is
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,175	| IOT021 |	That is what we've discovered
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,711	| IOT021 |	Now I got
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,991	| IOT021 |	I want to say
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:01,087	| IOT021 |	15 or 16 devices now hooked into
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,599	| IOT021 |	The wink hub
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,623	| IOT021 |	Across
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,927	| IOT021 |	Sorry no
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:08,767	| IOT021 |	15 or 16 devices into my Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,071	| IOT021 |	If I count the hue
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:11,583	| IOT021 |	As a hub
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| IOT021 |	I've got it
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,375	| IOT021 |	3 hubs
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:16,191	| IOT021 |	Sonos devices are now
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| IOT021 |	Going into the echo
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,055	| IOT021 |	Which allows me voice control basically
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,847	| IOT021 |	Of all of the lights
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,359	| IOT021 |	But I have Kinect
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,407	| IOT021 |	Which is actually pretty
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| IOT021 |	Cuz now I have
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,735	| IOT021 |	Have a group for outside lights
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,783	| IOT021 |	Have a group for downstairs
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,807	| IOT021 |	Which turns off every light down
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,111	| IOT021 |	And I have a group
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,391	| IOT021 |	Kitchen living
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,159	| IOT021 |	Dining
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:39,231	| IOT021 |	Pizza Patron basically a group right
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,767	| IOT021 |	It's okay
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,303	| IOT021 |	You know I'm liking it
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,071	| IOT021 |	I think it's fine
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,095	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| IOT021 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:49,983	| IOT021 |	Blunt one other question I suspect your setup is similar to mine and that
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,799	| IOT021 |	You have one Amazon Echo not multiple units
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,591	| IOT021 |	You probably also have it
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,407	| IOT021 |	Either in your bedroom or your office or somewhere near that
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,687	| IOT021 |	I actually have
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,199	| IOT021 |	Have my downstairs
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:04,319	| IOT021 |	Oh okay well then it's opposite because I have mine right next to me in the home office
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,855	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:09,183	| IOT021 |	I kind of feel like I'm missing out because I when I'm downstairs
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,951	| IOT021 |	Not working
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:14,815	| IOT021 |	You know I'm basically using my smartphone apps to play with the lights and so on and so forth order on timers and such
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,119	| IOT021 |	You also have the remote
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:21,727	| IOT021 |	We do have the remote and we it's it's sitting on
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,775	| IOT021 |	It's actually in my bedside table drawer
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:27,359	| IOT021 |	And we don't actually use it because the Bluetooth in the remote
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| IOT021 |	Because of the distance
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,455	| IOT021 |	I have a little dodgy
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,295	| IOT021 |	It works sometimes but
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,831	| IOT021 |	We're just kind of like
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:40,927	| IOT021 |	I've had good luck with Bluetooth radios and devices in my house
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,695	| IOT021 |	However
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,487	| IOT021 |	I'm still hurt
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:48,863	| IOT021 |	That I like the concept of the remote I'd rather maybe be Wi-Fi then if it can't be Bluetooth
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,655	| IOT021 |	Been up for training purposes
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| IOT021 |	The moon Portland
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,703	| IOT021 |	Just put the
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,983	| IOT021 |	Microphone
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,543	| IOT021 |	Voice Control in the Amazon
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,567	| IOT021 |	Echo app
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,639	| IOT021 |	Your phone already has a microphone built into it
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| IOT021 |	That's true and that would be
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,199	| IOT021 |	Actually
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:09,599	| IOT021 |	And I shall correct myself it is no longer the Amazon Echo app don't know if you noticed this when they have to SmartThings stuff
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,415	| IOT021 |	Elsa updated the app and is now called the Amazon
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| IOT021 |	You know who rap
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,999	| IOT021 |	Oh it is I did not realize it was this
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,559	| IOT021 |	Who shall not be named
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| IOT021 |	Yes Baltimore
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,375	| IOT021 |	Oh I should also say
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,399	| IOT021 |	Another thing
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,471	| IOT021 |	The things you cannot control via the echo
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,775	| IOT021 |	You cannot control
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,287	| IOT021 |	Finesse
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,871	| IOT021 |	In the Chamberlain so I have those hooked in through the wink
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,151	| IOT021 |	Same here
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,175	| IOT021 |	Can't control those
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,943	| IOT021 |	Nope
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,503	| IOT021 |	And I also I have the ecobee
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,783	| IOT021 |	My downstairs ecobee
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,319	| IOT021 |	Fear the SmartThings
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,391	| IOT021 |	And that is also not so anything that I
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,951	| IOT021 |	Lake-Link through an email
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,767	| IOT021 |	Assuming most of these are via a lot
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,047	| IOT021 |	Those don't
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,583	| IOT021 |	Tie into
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,423	| IOT021 |	I'm sure they will at some point just gets back to my point that
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,751	| IOT021 |	Our people have been waiting on this for so long
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,031	| IOT021 |	Piecemeal
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,847	| IOT021 |	Sure and I can't I can still control my
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,383	| IOT021 |	Nest through
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,991	| IOT021 |	Redeemable there
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,295	| IOT021 |	If I guess if I wanted a voice
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,319	| IOT021 |	Control thermostatic
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,087	| IOT021 |	Could have gone with the
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,599	| IOT021 |	Honeywell lyric
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,647	| IOT021 |	I just miss
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| IOT021 |	Speaking of wings
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:22,303	| IOT021 |	I actually discovered my my issue that we talked about a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,327	| IOT021 |	With my
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,631	| IOT021 |	Inability to make a robot
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:31,263	| IOT021 |	That works with the wink system when calls their recipes for home automation robots
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:34,335	| IOT021 |	To make it so when my garage door opened that my porch light
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:34,847	| IOT021 |	Turned on
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,127	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:39,199	| IOT021 |	I finally had to break down and call the wink helpline beak
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| IOT021 |	Because I
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:40,991	| IOT021 |	Figure out why
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,551	| IOT021 |	Sure and it's a known glitch with
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:46,879	| IOT021 |	Oh so anybody who's out there
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:51,231	| IOT021 |	With the wink system and is trying to do anything with the schedule
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:51,999	| IOT021 |	It runs
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,791	| IOT021 |	Overnight into the next day
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,863	| IOT021 |	It is having problems this is a tip for you
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:00,447	| IOT021 |	We don't do it doesn't do that
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,495	| IOT021 |	Don't do it because it doesn't work
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:06,079	| IOT021 |	And that explains why I have not had a problem with my wink Hub because
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,871	| IOT021 |	My robot to schedules
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:11,455	| IOT021 |	Never go past midnight or from one night into the next day
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:16,319	| IOT021 |	They just added you things like checks to see if the lights are on at 10:45 or 11 p.m. and shut them all off
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:19,135	| IOT021 |	They never go into the next day so that makes sense
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,927	| IOT021 |	Cinderella
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,719	| IOT021 |	After midnight it turns into a pumpkin
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:25,023	| IOT021 |	Kids so I had wanted to have my
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,047	| IOT021 |	When my garage door open
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,095	| IOT021 |	I wanted my porch lights
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:33,215	| IOT021 |	To turn on and I wanted to do it when it was dark so between the hours of like 8:15 at night and
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| IOT021 |	6 in the morning
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,031	| IOT021 |	And it it just wouldn't work
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,567	| IOT021 |	Tell me why
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,079	| IOT021 |	It didn't work
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,359	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:41,407	| IOT021 |	I called them and they explain that
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,175	| IOT021 |	And so what I did is
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:47,551	| IOT021 |	I now have it go away I have two robots one that goes from 8:15 at night till 11:59
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,087	| IOT021 |	And then another
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,599	| IOT021 |	Echoes from
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,927	| IOT021 |	It's a good worker and I mean it's not
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,951	| IOT021 |	Ideal core
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,743	| IOT021 |	But you can do what you wanted to do now
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,047	| IOT021 |	Yes I mean as long as there's a workaround
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,327	| IOT021 |	I won't complain
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,607	| IOT021 |	Slightly and
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,703	| IOT021 |	Do you like the only set up these robots a schedule one time
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,495	| IOT021 |	Basically so to me it's
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:10,079	| IOT021 |	That's a very minimal bit of effort for this work around
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,103	| IOT021 |	Flawless at work
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| IOT021 |	It's very convenient
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,663	| IOT021 |	So gay on that
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,199	| IOT021 |	And we should get to
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| IOT021 |	Will get to the new products
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:22,623	| IOT021 |	First up SEC filings show that there might be a new Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:26,463	| IOT021 |	We know very little about that butter buddy Dave's that's over at zatznotfunny
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,535	| IOT021 |	Man lives in the FCC database
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,559	| IOT021 |	Closet I'm guessing
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,607	| IOT021 |	I think he's a clerk for them it doesn't tell anybody
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:39,519	| IOT021 |	Seriously it is it's possible so he discovered that he actually also saw a new filing for it
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,311	| IOT021 |	An August Smart Lock that
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,591	| IOT021 |	May actually have a keypad
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| IOT021 |	I know
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,967	| IOT021 |	I like to keep ads cuz they're good backup
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,759	| IOT021 |	Entry Point Casino
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:55,903	| IOT021 |	So those were two like worthwhile things that he found and then we should also talk about a brand new product that's out from Phila
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| IOT021 |	It's a new product for their huge line
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,255	| IOT021 |	Is there Wireless dimmer kit
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,327	| IOT021 |	Which goes for 3995
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,351	| IOT021 |	It is
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT021 |	Going to be on sale
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| IOT021 |	Next month
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,679	| IOT021 |	So September
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,215	| IOT021 |	And I have
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,751	| IOT021 |	I tested one
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| IOT021 |	It's actually in my back
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,311	| IOT021 |	Right now
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:20,735	| IOT021 |	Don't even ask I was just going to say I don't know why you're doing lights in the bathroom with whatever you do is your business
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,271	| IOT021 |	Wake up when I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,647	| IOT021 |	I guess so keep lights down low he and I just thought you were running out of room to Stew
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,951	| IOT021 |	You know testing this is also a problem
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,023	| IOT021 |	So the dimmer switch
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,047	| IOT021 |	So what this is
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,071	| IOT021 |	The kid
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,863	| IOT021 |	It comes with a Phillips
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,631	| IOT021 |	Lux
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,959	| IOT021 |	Light which is there white dimmable light that
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,751	| IOT021 |	Is Kevin pointed out is it
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,263	| IOT021 |	27
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,567	| IOT021 |	That's correct
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,359	| IOT021 |	Best soft white 2700
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,127	| IOT021 |	Calvin's
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,151	| IOT021 |	And it's it
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT021 |	Sunny and warm
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:59,135	| IOT021 |	And it comes with a remote control that affixes to a wall mount via
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,927	| IOT021 |	A magnet I'll cook it for you guys
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,487	| IOT021 |	Interesting
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,023	| IOT021 |	Click
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,047	| IOT021 |	Very high-tech
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,607	| IOT021 |	It basically has four buttons on it
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,631	| IOT021 |	On off
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,911	| IOT021 |	And then a brighter and a dimmers
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,447	| IOT021 |	And
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,215	| IOT021 |	I didn't like this product
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,031	| IOT021 |	Glad to hear
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,335	| IOT021 |	It's not laggy it works as advertised
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,359	| IOT021 |	It's just
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,383	| IOT021 |	As someone who
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| IOT021 |	Has Lutron lighting
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,735	| IOT021 |	This did not behave like I wanted
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,527	| IOT021 |	A dimmer switch to be high
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,063	| IOT021 |	First of all
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,647	| IOT021 |	You can't start you can't turn the light on
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,927	| IOT021 |	Crumb
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:36,255	| IOT021 |	The dimmer position so you can only turn it on for the on position
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,815	| IOT021 |	And it remembers the last
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,887	| IOT021 |	You can turn it off from
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,191	| IOT021 |	Spot does that make sense
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:49,055	| IOT021 |	So does that mean this is a switch that turns the light on in office what was Tims it right or no
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,079	| IOT021 |	Yes but
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,871	| IOT021 |	In most dimmer switches you can
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,431	| IOT021 |	You can hit the dimmer switch
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,199	| IOT021 |	All the way down
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,015	| IOT021 |	Okay I see what you're saying
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:01,855	| IOT021 |	Here you hit the dimmer switch and it goes to as dim as it can go and then
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:04,415	| IOT021 |	But it's still on right now
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:04,927	| IOT021 |	Understood
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,719	| IOT021 |	I didn't know how to
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,767	| IOT021 |	But you did
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,559	| IOT021 |	I got there eventually
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,863	| IOT021 |	So that's that was
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:18,751	| IOT021 |	What kind of issue with it the other is that it just doesn't feel elegant the remote control is
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,519	| IOT021 |	A little thick
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,567	| IOT021 |	It's
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,103	| IOT021 |	If you wall mounted
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:23,871	| IOT021 |	The magnet
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,151	| IOT021 |	It's not tight so
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,687	| IOT021 |	Kind of cookie like
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:29,247	| IOT021 |	Here it is wall-mounted and when I
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,527	| IOT021 |	Punching it it kind of wobbles
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,599	| IOT021 |	Here when I do hear it wobbling
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,135	| IOT021 |	Yasso
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,415	| IOT021 |	So all of those things just
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,743	| IOT021 |	It is it feels cheap and it is
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,815	| IOT021 |	I mean the light the light
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,583	| IOT021 |	Is $20
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,375	| IOT021 |	Right
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,679	| IOT021 |	The switch and remote is $20
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,703	| IOT021 |	Basically
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,263	| IOT021 |	What I thought was in
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,031	| IOT021 |	Interesting two things
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,359	| IOT021 |	Is the Phillips Phillips's first remote
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,663	| IOT021 |	And it's the first thing that works without the
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,175	| IOT021 |	The bridge
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:02,271	| IOT021 |	Yeah I was going to say you know this doesn't tie into that goes directly to the light
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,319	| IOT021 |	No it can't work with
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,367	| IOT021 |	Okay you can breathe
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| IOT021 |	The bridge but if you want
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| IOT021 |	Buy this off
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,183	| IOT021 |	The Shelf
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| IOT021 |	An atom
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| IOT021 |	Dimmable light
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:18,911	| IOT021 |	Yeah so how do you link the the to the light bulb and the and the dimming switch
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,215	| IOT021 |	Contagious
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,495	| IOT021 |	Best work right out of the box
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,031	| IOT021 |	They're already prepared okay
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:30,175	| IOT021 |	3 - paired
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,247	| IOT021 |	Okay you could buy
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,015	| IOT021 |	That
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,575	| IOT021 |	And then a bunch of other Hue Lux lights and then boom
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,855	| IOT021 |	Your business
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,647	| IOT021 |	Would it work with the
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,927	| IOT021 |	Hue color bulbs or no
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,719	| IOT021 |	It will
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,767	| IOT021 |	I think when you add it to the app
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| IOT021 |	I haven't
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,327	| IOT021 |	Play it around I haven't had a
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:49,631	| IOT021 |	Enough time with Bridge
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:53,215	| IOT021 |	I was going to say that probably requires the bridge anyway
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,007	| IOT021 |	Sugar so I haven't
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,031	| IOT021 |	I haven't done that yet
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:59,103	| IOT021 |	Cuz when you have disco night at your house you can dim the lights and what not
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:00,639	| IOT021 |	I guess so
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,711	| IOT021 |	Again I'm still waiting for extra settings to like
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:07,807	| IOT021 |	Get the bridge although I did download a new app so maybe we'll have hue
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,599	| IOT021 |	Shoe app date
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,879	| IOT021 |	Talk about some fun apps
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,159	| IOT021 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,719	| IOT021 |	All right so that's a lot that we talked
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,511	| IOT021 |	I knew this was going to be a lot
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:19,071	| IOT021 |	But I feel like we've done a lot
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| IOT021 |	Good things
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:20,607	| IOT021 |	Guess
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,143	| IOT021 |	Yes and we haven't made a scene
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,423	| IOT021 |	I feel like I made it
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:24,959	| IOT021 |	That's okay
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,775	| IOT021 |	I'm too overly dramatic when
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,567	| IOT021 |	I acknowledge it
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,407	| IOT021 |	All right so I think that's
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:37,247	| IOT021 |	That's it for this week so stay tuned for our guest
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,271	| IOT021 |	Who is Claire Rowling
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,599	| IOT021 |	Who is the author of Designing connected products
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,623	| IOT021 |	Read to talk about
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,159	| IOT021 |	You at
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:47,743	| IOT021 |	User experience for the Internet of Things specifically
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:48,767	| IOT021 |	Consumer
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:55,679	| IOT021 |	And we talked about all kinds of fun stuff even things you may not have thought about you problems you have not experienced
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:21:01,823	| IOT021 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:10,015	| IOT021 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest we have
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,551	| IOT021 |	Claire Rowland
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:15,135	| IOT021 |	Who is the author of a book called designing connected products
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,440	| IOT021 |	Actually she's the lead author on this
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,464	| IOT021 |	Many others
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,256	| IOT021 |	Lots of them
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,304	| IOT021 |	And hi Claire how are you doing
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,864	| IOT021 |	I am doing very well thank you and you
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,680	| IOT021 |	Super well so you're in London where it's raining so if you guys
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,192	| IOT021 |	Start to feel
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,008	| IOT021 |	Sleepy during the podcast that is not us that is
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,800	| IOT021 |	Soft
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| IOT021 |	Spits of rain
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,336	| IOT021 |	Polygon clear
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:37,920	| IOT021 |	But hopefully it will keep you engaged
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,432	| IOT021 |	This is a great topic
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,968	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,248	| IOT021 |	Clear in writing this book
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,040	| IOT021 |	What
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,552	| IOT021 |	Surprise YouTube
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,088	| IOT021 |	Oh well
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,624	| IOT021 |	So I guess
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:52,256	| IOT021 |	One of the things that inspired me to write this book Quizlet was things that I had learned at surprise me
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:56,096	| IOT021 |	Ux design of research shows
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:59,168	| IOT021 |	The Prototype S&M I previously been working in
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:03,008	| IOT021 |	What happened mobile inside and software answer
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,544	| IOT021 |	Cross-platform services
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,104	| IOT021 |	I'm going to start working in commercial iot
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:14,016	| IOT021 |	They remember things that this would have jumped out at me as the CDs at these are things I have not to think about before these are things only
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,368	| IOT021 |	Hadn't anticipated speed to be having to deal with tutu quite the expense
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,160	| IOT021 |	And I think I lost it then why
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:24,512	| IOT021 |	Alabama technical issues
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,048	| IOT021 |	Copesan white background but it was
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,328	| IOT021 |	It was things like
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,120	| IOT021 |	So the impact of
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,400	| IOT021 |	Things like networking
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,680	| IOT021 |	On wheel wells
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:36,288	| IOT021 |	What happens when you are trying to control a thing in the real world
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:40,896	| IOT021 |	And you I know and suddenly it might take the seconds to respond to you
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,688	| IOT021 |	So it might not respond at all
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:45,760	| IOT021 |	I know you saw those aren't there's a quiet visit
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:51,392	| IOT021 |	Things we take for granted I guess one way when were using the other what happened
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,000	| IOT021 |	Turn screen sometimes they're all these delays and failures
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,816	| IOT021 |	Are we supposed Rising but we we know what to do about this thing
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,120	| IOT021 |	Listen to Real World objects
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,424	| IOT021 |	Consult to feel quite broke
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:06,240	| IOT021 |	What is a mass-market
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,776	| IOT021 |	Consumerism scary things like
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:12,384	| IOT021 |	Turn the lights on and it takes 30 seconds to respond and sometimes it just doesn't respond
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:15,712	| IOT021 |	Sometimes Vamps having you a lights on when I say it's off
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:17,504	| IOT021 |	I know this is a really really weird things
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:23,904	| IOT021 |	But I think you know this is kind of every doctors at this time we supposed to type ground say but Ashley doesn't quite strange
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,416	| IOT021 |	Pocket uses
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:28,000	| IOT021 |	So that was that was nice I guess that was the kind of
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,816	| IOT021 |	The challenges of eventually making the stuff work
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,864	| IOT021 |	Reliably is
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,912	| IOT021 |	Pea flour market expected to
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,984	| IOT021 |	And then I was also
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:42,080	| IOT021 |	I think the other technical complexity so things like interoperability and just the
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,616	| IOT021 |	Another fight but we have to
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:49,760	| IOT021 |	I think it is designed as a kind of tend to approach this the stuff with disability lies vision of you know all this stuff just going to talk to each other when
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,856	| IOT021 |	That point yet
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| IOT021 |	On the wrong reasons
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,672	| IOT021 |	Why
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:58,208	| IOT021 |	We might not be at that point
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,976	| IOT021 |	For example
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:04,096	| IOT021 |	Connected devices my run on batteries they may not be constantly connected to the network
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:11,008	| IOT021 |	So actually instead of one kind of great big system in which everything you know is what's best website and everything that is everything else is doing
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:13,056	| IOT021 |	San Francisco Museum
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:19,968	| IOT021 |	I think that the kind of states that license say the reliability the intro fertility in the kind of discontinuity Takashi
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:24,320	| IOT021 |	Really which I guess is this another suppose down to what happens when you put the network
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| IOT021 |	Can things
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:30,720	| IOT021 |	Didn't work quite the way perhaps I'd expected it to I'm not cool to some really interesting issues design
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| IOT021 |	Okay so
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,280	| IOT021 |	This for you is like
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,048	| IOT021 |	Wow
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:36,096	| IOT021 |	This is really broken so it's
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,608	| IOT021 |	The challenge
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:44,544	| IOT021 |	Yeah I mean I think that's the thing that I don't say it's entirely broken but I think that there are sesame some chili
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,568	| IOT021 |	Challenges in
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:50,688	| IOT021 |	Bringing it to a mass-market Williams Show cyanotic particularly in the home which is a
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:53,504	| IOT021 |	And I really wish people really don't want you breaking my things
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:25:00,160	| IOT021 |	I know probably raising somebody watching the book was that I wasn't saying that you wasn't seeing some of these challenges being told about else by
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:01,952	| IOT021 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,536	| IOT021 |	How pretty is the internet of things for consumer
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,608	| IOT021 |	The way you're talking about it it feels like
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,120	| IOT021 |	Maybe it's
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,656	| IOT021 |	Not that ready
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,704	| IOT021 |	I think it will get better
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:15,008	| IOT021 |	I think it's behind snots
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,312	| IOT021 |	I think it's in the process of guessing that
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| IOT021 |	I think there are
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,128	| IOT021 |	Challenges in making
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| IOT021 |	King sings work
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,688	| IOT021 |	As well as
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| IOT021 |	Staplehouse
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:26,784	| IOT021 |	It never stops my smoke it wouldn't synthetic spice
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,808	| IOT021 |	I think probably won't
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,624	| IOT021 |	Say is it in the in the case of certain products
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:34,720	| IOT021 |	Conductivity out in connectivity outside and go intelligence will make
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:39,072	| IOT021 |	Perfect sense within the context of a product with a ready welder signs
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| IOT021 |	Function
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:43,680	| IOT021 |	So something I can do about something I can.
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,216	| IOT021 |	8 mics
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| IOT021 |	Perfect sense
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:52,640	| IOT021 |	To be able to wants to be able to access those things while you're
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,688	| IOT021 |	Leasing a car
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,712	| IOT021 |	Strong
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| IOT021 |	I think
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,784	| IOT021 |	Will probably take more time to take off
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,064	| IOT021 |	Is
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,832	| IOT021 |	Thesaurus
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:03,136	| IOT021 |	Vision of lots of interconnected systems
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:07,232	| IOT021 |	So are all systems out by which which which which which
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:11,328	| IOT021 |	Security which one of these things or these things still together
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,608	| IOT021 |	But I think
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,400	| IOT021 |	It's going to be awhile before
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:20,288	| IOT021 |	I think right now when I was at the point where we can make those things into quite well and it's it's not just a question of
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:26,432	| IOT021 |	Tell us a question of Designing Common Sense things for bicycle bicycle denied and keeping the
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,552	| IOT021 |	Let's talk about that because
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,832	| IOT021 |	I am so done
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:36,672	| IOT021 |	In most people look at me like I have grown a third head when I start
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,720	| IOT021 |	I always say
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:39,488	| IOT021 |	And it's really a second
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,560	| IOT021 |	The second head is probably what would drive
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,096	| IOT021 |	The third head
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:50,240	| IOT021 |	So I drove my second had a dealer like you're so crazy about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:53,568	| IOT021 |	Talk about why this is compelling
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,592	| IOT021 |	Because
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:58,944	| IOT021 |	I tried to explain to people you don't demand response and how being able to
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| IOT021 |	Control like
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:05,088	| IOT021 |	Electrical use in being able to space out you know my washer and my dryer
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:17,888	| IOT021 |	Let's find use cases where maybe it's systemic but let's get people excited about
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:18,912	| IOT021 |	Home automation
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,192	| IOT021 |	The internet
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,728	| IOT021 |	Because
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:24,032	| IOT021 |	You know again this is very exciting to me
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:27,616	| IOT021 |	So what's exciting about it to you what's the positive why are you do
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:33,248	| IOT021 |	I think it's about giving people more control over their wealth over their environments
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:35,296	| IOT021 |	About knowing what's happening
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,576	| IOT021 |	I think it's
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,880	| IOT021 |	About making less environment
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,952	| IOT021 |	Small so that it can it can do some of the
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:46,048	| IOT021 |	The kind of work that that we don't really want to have to do
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,328	| IOT021 |	I think it's
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:53,728	| IOT021 |	You know I have a I have a kind of have another thing as well that I kind of like the five of those computers and stuff in there talking to each other enough
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:59,616	| IOT021 |	What are the challenges at the moment is that it's really hard for people who are not
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,408	| IOT021 |	You don't have a programmatic mindset
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:08,064	| IOT021 |	Ashley to Tucanos to do go to the specific configuration involves systems that that do
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,880	| IOT021 |	Handle coordination between
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,672	| IOT021 |	Multiple things like Kenobi.
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:16,000	| IOT021 |	Counter stools and lighting and Security in
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,792	| IOT021 |	Ion safety Systems
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:21,632	| IOT021 |	Anticipating how old are those things should coordinate with one another
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,424	| IOT021 |	If you push up bad moms
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:29,824	| IOT021 |	It's going out to people to do that until I will let you know of course I want my I want my sprinklers to come on when I
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:36,224	| IOT021 |	Looking out the window
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,016	| IOT021 |	I want to come take you to schedule
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:44,416	| IOT021 |	I'm not scraping social condition some ass tonight then I don't have to worry about watching the god
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,952	| IOT021 |	You forgotten that not things running
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:49,024	| IOT021 |	Exceptional
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:55,680	| IOT021 |	There are always the problem is that realized I'm taking home I think he is quite is quite messy
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:29:00,288	| IOT021 |	I'm particularly if you if you live in Ohio weather alerts of people coming
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:06,688	| IOT021 |	Those rules inside but I always want this thing, never want this thing happen
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:10,528	| IOT021 |	Until you stop casting to get what I want this thing to happen but not when X y&z
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:12,320	| IOT021 |	And then before you know it
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:17,184	| IOT021 |	So many exceptions and so many rules, things talking to a coordination how things
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:20,512	| IOT021 |	It's very easy to select again. New situation where you actually lost
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,304	| IOT021 |	Control rather than gain more of it
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:27,424	| IOT021 |	So I think that's one of the reasons aside I think Anna Anna in commercial and Industrial settings
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:34,080	| IOT021 |	It's often very much easier to to codify how things are supposed to be working until identify what's an exception is
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:36,896	| IOT021 |	What something is that that require someone's attention
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:43,296	| IOT021 |	And what's not to know when should an alarm one of the things I will continue to research with
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,832	| IOT021 |	People around security systems
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,880	| IOT021 |	One of the problems that people with teenagers have
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:50,720	| IOT021 |	Is the Titanic unassembled Hive it was tonight
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:54,048	| IOT021 |	I forgot that folks I forgot to phone spy forget
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:55,840	| IOT021 |	I forgot the code
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:30:00,192	| IOT021 |	Who is always true always triggering alarms in a lot B long shouldn't
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:02,496	| IOT021 |	Identify
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:07,872	| IOT021 |	Turn off someones that he shouldn't be bad but actually got somebody
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:10,432	| IOT021 |	But it really hurts what's it to identify the difference
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,200	| IOT021 |	Because you called
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:15,296	| IOT021 |	Will oil not person to be able to identify themselves through the conventional mean
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:19,392	| IOT021 |	I think that's why I say that I think the home is particularly complicated
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:22,976	| IOT021 |	But I take it you didn't trust me because it's a sizable challenge
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,024	| IOT021 |	I agree
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,584	| IOT021 |	Listen to I adjust written a story
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:30,400	| IOT021 |	And if we talked about this actually and why am I smart
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:36,544	| IOT021 |	And someone actually so I talked about reasons being social
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,360	| IOT021 |	And being like a lack of good AI
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:41,664	| IOT021 |	And kind of a lack of Interest
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,432	| IOT021 |	Stability but
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:44,224	| IOT021 |	Someone actually looks like
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,736	| IOT021 |	LCC
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:51,392	| IOT021 |	Why do you want your home to be that automated this idea that you want your home to know this much about you
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:53,184	| IOT021 |	Maybe that's just not the way to go
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,000	| IOT021 |	You know he has a point
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:31:01,632	| IOT021 |	And maybe it wasn't she I don't I don't remember who it was but you know this person had a very good point where
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:04,192	| IOT021 |	I'm envisioning like my home really having
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:08,544	| IOT021 |	A wonderful sense of who I am and who is in the home
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,824	| IOT021 |	And being able to react
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,336	| IOT021 |	Accordingly
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:11,616	| IOT021 |	And I know that's
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:15,968	| IOT021 |	I know we're not because I actually live with all these devices and I know how dumb
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:17,760	| IOT021 |	I love them anyway
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:20,576	| IOT021 |	But I recognize that most people will not want to
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,368	| IOT021 |	Deal with that
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| IOT021 |	I got to pick him like wokasch why do I want
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:27,232	| IOT021 |	Is it because I really hate turning on
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,000	| IOT021 |	Light switches
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,280	| IOT021 |	Is that so hard
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:36,960	| IOT021 |	I think in my case there is a passive and it's going to sound like
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:41,824	| IOT021 |	Does a bit of techno utopianism. I really wanted to be like that
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:48,736	| IOT021 |	Elias I want the United States to me that they won't survive all that just doesn't let just tell the boring stuff.
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,504	| IOT021 |	So I don't have to
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,040	| IOT021 |	I think it's
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:53,600	| IOT021 |	There is that kind of berries that kind of dream
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,672	| IOT021 |	It's just a you know I think that fool
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,976	| IOT021 |	Mainstream consumer right now
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:02,048	| IOT021 |	If you put it turns on
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,072	| IOT021 |	Cortisol
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:08,448	| IOT021 |	Sing is a nest of all star system is 100% reliable
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,496	| IOT021 |	And if you have something that's
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,568	| IOT021 |	Some of these systems only works maybe 90% of the time
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:18,944	| IOT021 |	Open maps know it's telling you I saw a real review of a of a connected X system
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,224	| IOT021 |	We shall remain nameless
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:23,808	| IOT021 |	I was just lost him masturbating Tuesday istick but Seth has
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:28,416	| IOT021 |	Vice versa
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:31,744	| IOT021 |	But it's okay cuz you were in the room at the same time so you can see whether the lights on or off
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:37,632	| IOT021 |	This is why we put the internet
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:44,544	| IOT021 |	Let's switch gears just a little bit and talk about in your book you have this this fun kind of chapter on
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,824	| IOT021 |	Different types of
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,360	| IOT021 |	Interactions that people
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:51,200	| IOT021 |	Can have and that's that's one of my favorite things to think about it because
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:53,504	| IOT021 |	I think when you're thinking about
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,320	| IOT021 |	We've had
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,600	| IOT021 |	Computers you had
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| IOT021 |	Keyboards
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:04,000	| IOT021 |	Wow
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,792	| IOT021 |	Touch screen
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,352	| IOT021 |	Another category
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,424	| IOT021 |	And now we got voice and that's that's
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,984	| IOT021 |	Excited and thinking about the different ways you can interact
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:18,080	| IOT021 |	Other things really with wearables
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,384	| IOT021 |	Skin kind of
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,432	| IOT021 |	Talk to things you got the ability to lie
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,968	| IOT021 |	You know there's this
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:25,760	| IOT021 |	90
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,808	| IOT021 |	The thing that measures your heart rate
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,344	| IOT021 |	There's all kinds of ways you can
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:33,184	| IOT021 |	Stop so let's talk about some of the interactions out there
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:33,952	| IOT021 |	What did
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:34,976	| IOT021 |	Possible because
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:35,744	| IOT021 |	Dang it
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,768	| IOT021 |	I don't think we did that in
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:37,792	| IOT021 |	Beyond
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:43,168	| IOT021 |	It started to talk to me and respond
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:44,960	| IOT021 |	It's so
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:47,776	| IOT021 |	But ticket Beyond things like touchless
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,568	| IOT021 |	Let's talk about plausible you eyes for
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,104	| IOT021 |	Ashley lets slip
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,152	| IOT021 |	Straight to the weird Crazy Ones
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:56,224	| IOT021 |	Let's talk about what you think is probably
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,504	| IOT021 |	The top you eyes for the
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:58,784	| IOT021 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:01,600	| IOT021 |	Wow I think he is very much about
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:07,232	| IOT021 |	What about what's appropriate for what you're trying to do and that will be different for different types of system so
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:10,304	| IOT021 |	Think that one of the things I would hope
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:13,120	| IOT021 |	That we can do as much as possible as trying to
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:16,192	| IOT021 |	Alex light. During the Yuan question but I think
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,008	| IOT021 |	Is learn as much about contacts
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:20,800	| IOT021 |	Possible
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:25,920	| IOT021 |	Just as a kind of exhausting longest wooden it be nice if you can if you can do a fixative like
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:32,320	| IOT021 |	Gesturing to the audience to bring on all your
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,344	| IOT021 |	Hyman's timer system
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,464	| IOT021 |	In front of gas stove
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:42,560	| IOT021 |	Be quite fun on your I bet it would be kind of embarrassing in front of gas on its also
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,096	| IOT021 |	Just deserve it
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:49,216	| IOT021 |	Awesome whatever problems I think they're the kind of waving at the nest protect thing from in a year-and-a-half ago I think
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:53,824	| IOT021 |	People do when they're actually on fire
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,104	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:57,152	| IOT021 |	Yeah that's that's that's it.
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,432	| IOT021 |	Challenge invoices
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,480	| IOT021 |	Voice is kind of an interesting one because that's the
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:11,232	| IOT021 |	It can be quite noisy that can be call me to call 2 to get right it means that you've got to
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,768	| IOT021 |	People can hear what you doing
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:15,328	| IOT021 |	Which plants s area waste waste want
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:20,704	| IOT021 |	So I think that was the something about 70 something about devices being able to
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,216	| IOT021 |	Descendants
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:25,056	| IOT021 |	When you need them and infer from my contacts
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:31,968	| IOT021 |	I don't know if you've seen this the Concord Towers fixing who used to be a frog who produced a concept design for summer
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:35,296	| IOT021 |	Roommate
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,368	| IOT021 |	Jared and
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,904	| IOT021 |	Mark Rolston
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| IOT021 |	Quesadilla
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,256	| IOT021 |	When they were frog that they invited me over
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,280	| IOT021 |	It was in Austin
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,448	| IOT021 |	Add a camera
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,056	| IOT021 |	And I believe it
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:02,432	| IOT021 |	It is interesting about Rumi was it Wilson spouse
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:06,528	| IOT021 |	August things go to Voice interface this thing has a gestural interface
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,576	| IOT021 |	You notice things using using
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,112	| IOT021 |	Tactile output
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,952	| IOT021 |	Breakdown for 8 it was about it was a combination of two message
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,000	| IOT021 |	So that you could point out alarm
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,536	| IOT021 |	On-site turn on
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,816	| IOT021 |	Stop Islam pea
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,608	| IOT021 |	Whatever it was
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:23,680	| IOT021 |	And between the combination of the cameras on invoice
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,728	| IOT021 |	Assistant
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:29,824	| IOT021 |	You you wanted to turn on my lamp and which lamp it was that you that you want to turn on
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:33,664	| IOT021 |	I think it's it's combining it's the combination
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:35,456	| IOT021 |	Interface types
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:40,320	| IOT021 |	On the understanding of the simple thing to do but in a minute it's a relatively simple
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,856	| IOT021 |	Inferences contacts
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,368	| IOT021 |	Foam mat
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:44,928	| IOT021 |	Makes a much more compelling cyst
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:49,024	| IOT021 |	I think with the ability to have like
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:49,792	| IOT021 |	Bluetooth mesh Network
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:52,352	| IOT021 |	Or if you want to say
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,656	| IOT021 |	I only say Bluetooth because we have
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:57,728	| IOT021 |	Do cheetahs kind of the accepted wearable standard
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:37:02,080	| IOT021 |	So if you got Bluetooth sensors now in your light bulbs or
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:02,848	| IOT021 |	In
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:04,640	| IOT021 |	Little things around your home
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:07,712	| IOT021 |	Other bluetooth light bulbs are Bluetooth plugs
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:14,112	| IOT021 |	What you've got suddenly is the ability to do proximity sensing in a room so you can say hey this person's
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,624	| IOT021 |	In this room
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:16,160	| IOT021 |	And you can say
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,696	| IOT021 |	Just turn on the light
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,024	| IOT021 |	In the Assumption as you would be turning on the lights in this room
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:25,120	| IOT021 |	As opposed to right now when I'm turning on the lights I'm telling
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,400	| IOT021 |	I'm saying turn on living room
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:31,264	| IOT021 |	This is addressing one of the other problems which his everything in the home is connected
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,288	| IOT021 |	Said you got lots of things
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:37,664	| IOT021 |	Anna needs a friend not just to figure out which things you're addressing at 8 points and meet you end up please
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,456	| IOT021 |	You know can you can end up with
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:44,832	| IOT021 |	A massive zones and scenes in groups of elements and send some of these systems
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:51,744	| IOT021 |	But also then I'll just switch things am I addressing at the moment but I will say which things might I want to be doing something with it
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:54,048	| IOT021 |	Configuring something to happen to us another time
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,352	| IOT021 |	And so those kind of
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,656	| IOT021 |	Anything I can do to help
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:01,216	| IOT021 |	A little bit easier running is a scribe
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:06,080	| IOT021 |	But it's a ways that's always a challenge with contact sensitivity that you can
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:07,872	| IOT021 |	You can it's pretty easy to live
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:12,224	| IOT021 |	Well you know I make too many assumptions about what somebody wants in that moment
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,976	| IOT021 |	So I think it's
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,256	| IOT021 |	I think it's about
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:30,144	| IOT021 |	Combination bios I think it's about options and I wanted to say little things that's really I think
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,424	| IOT021 |	Quite interested in is
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,216	| IOT021 |	The option to choose
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:36,032	| IOT021 |	The interaction Channel
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:38,592	| IOT021 |	Best suits audio needs but also your
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:40,384	| IOT021 |	Abilities of disabilities
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:41,664	| IOT021 |	So
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,200	| IOT021 |	I think this is a kind of
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:43,968	| IOT021 |	Is it snowing
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:44,480	| IOT021 |	Beam
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:45,760	| IOT021 |	Taraji P
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:50,624	| IOT021 |	People walking in this area of of accessibility on
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:53,952	| IOT021 |	I think is it that some extremely powerful potential.
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:59,584	| IOT021 |	So if you think about it a kind of conventional heating controller for example which generally has a
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,376	| IOT021 |	Tikki bright LCD screen
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,936	| IOT021 |	Listen to somebody with low vision to see
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:10,336	| IOT021 |	If you can duplicate that functionality in a smartphone. We have I perhaps there that the phone will have Macy's accessibility
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:12,896	| IOT021 |	Pictures of stuff like my voice over on the on the iPhone
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:15,456	| IOT021 |	Channel that that person
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:21,088	| IOT021 |	Which is good for other people but it's also good to people who don't see the Box very well
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:21,856	| IOT021 |	Missy
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:24,160	| IOT021 |	So what kind of devices do you have
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,720	| IOT021 |	Your house is it is cluttered is mine
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:31,584	| IOT021 |	Which is very cluttered it's very toxic but it's not particularly houses with
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:32,864	| IOT021 |	Connect two things
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,424	| IOT021 |	I don't know if it's composite CSU pumps my fake
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:37,728	| IOT021 |	Does a couple of fitness trackers
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:40,032	| IOT021 |	But they kind of the sporadic to use
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,080	| IOT021 |	Is a pebble but again
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,360	| IOT021 |	Baby sporadic to use
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:46,176	| IOT021 |	Because I'm waiting for my watch to get off of work
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,224	| IOT021 |	Does the wangjing scale
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,528	| IOT021 |	Hue Lights
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:53,344	| IOT021 |	Amazon favorite Hue smart plugs
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:58,720	| IOT021 |	I've been testing home monitoring system so kind of spent the kits that
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:01,280	| IOT021 |	We have an unknown connect
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:07,680	| IOT021 |	Security alarm testing kind of stomach makes his stuff but I'm already gone to any of it suited to work as well as I would like to
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:11,520	| IOT021 |	Bissell so I was only featuring control up she's a British gas
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,800	| IOT021 |	At the British a product
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:16,384	| IOT021 |	It's not The Shining you e-file wanted state is the old one
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:20,992	| IOT021 |	So that's what we have to do we have anything else
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:25,088	| IOT021 |	It's so much for coming on the show this week and I appreciate your Insight
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:25,600	| IOT021 |	White sand
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,648	| IOT021 |	Guys if you are and if you are
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:28,928	| IOT021 |	Excited about
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:31,232	| IOT021 |	You asked for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,024	| IOT021 |	The book is designing connected products
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,560	| IOT021 |	It is
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:36,096	| IOT021 |	There's a hefty tome
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:37,120	| IOT021 |	I'm not going to lie to you
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:41,472	| IOT021 |	But there is a lot of stuff in here I'm still reading it and I'm still learning a lot of stuff from it so
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,008	| IOT021 |	Yay thank you Claire
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,544	| IOT021 |	Thank you very much for having me
