EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:44,800	| IOT084 |	We have some cool products to review and talk about
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:48,640	| IOT084 |	And we also are going to just scare the pants right off
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:51,968	| IOT084 |	With the question of is the US ready to attack
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:53,504	| IOT084 |	Russia
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,784	| IOT084 |	Using the bus cyber
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:58,368	| IOT084 |	So the Cyber the Cyber I couldn't say Cyber attack
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:01,440	| IOT084 |	Directory
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:04,768	| IOT084 |	And we will have a ad from
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,816	| IOT084 |	The Bluetooth Sig a new sponsor this month
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,376	| IOT084 |	And our guest this week
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:13,216	| IOT084 |	Is rum melissani the CEO of securifi
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:14,496	| IOT084 |	Which makes the Almond router
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:17,312	| IOT084 |	And that is going to be a fun interview
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,336	| IOT084 |	Talking about
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:24,736	| IOT084 |	The future of the Smart Home & Security and yes router said that's that's more than a router
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:29,344	| IOT084 |	But I'm sure you guys going to talk about that we will talk about that and I actually have
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:32,160	| IOT084 |	An almond router that I have not set up yet because I haven't been
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:32,928	| IOT084 |	In home
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,440	| IOT084 |	But

EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,152	| IOT084 |	Actually reads it
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,200	| IOT084 |	Eye to eye to
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,712	| IOT084 |	I love you
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,760	| IOT084 |	Alright so let's get started
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,296	| IOT084 |	Philips Hue
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,576	| IOT084 |	Big news
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,088	| IOT084 |	Was it this week
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:38,208	| IOT084 |	Maybe it was last week I think right after we recorded the
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| IOT084 |	Pirate show
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,792	| IOT084 |	Yes we recorded early last week we're recording a little early this week
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:43,840	| IOT084 |	Will get you there
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:47,680	| IOT084 |	All right so what happened is actually Kevin you want to tell him what happen
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,216	| IOT084 |	Because it's pretty
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:52,288	| IOT084 |	It's almost scary but I should preface the story by saying it
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,568	| IOT084 |	It was more of a
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:57,408	| IOT084 |	Demonstration that anything else so don't panic as I tell you that
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,712	| IOT084 |	A drone was used to hack Philips
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:06,112	| IOT084 |	Hue bulbs and the did Supreme about 450 meters or a thousand feet away which is
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,672	| IOT084 |	It really is scary out on the surface of it
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:14,048	| IOT084 |	What happened was a vulnerability I believe in the zigbee
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,840	| IOT084 |	Protocol or stack
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:20,704	| IOT084 |	Was found by some researchers they did the right thing they contact a Philips Hue
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,728	| IOT084 |	Over the summer
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:28,128	| IOT084 |	And I believe last month Philips Hue actually put a firmware patch out to address the
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:28,896	| IOT084 |	Tissue
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,968	| IOT084 |	However having said all that the demonstration still happened
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,528	| IOT084 |	And folks were able to
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:38,624	| IOT084 |	Take control a Philips Hue bulbs they they injected some new firmware
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,160	| IOT084 |	Into I guess the hue
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,184	| IOT084 |	Bridge
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:43,232	| IOT084 |	And whatever like send SOS message
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,304	| IOT084 |	From a drone through the Philips Hue bulbs
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| IOT084 |	This coming on the heels of
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,888	| IOT084 |	The Mirai botnet
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,680	| IOT084 |	Which is still ongoing
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,448	| IOT084 |	We shouldn't say like
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,984	| IOT084 |	Like that's done
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:54,496	| IOT084 |	Cuz it's not
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:58,080	| IOT084 |	And actually that's a bigger worry because they have all of these devices out there
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:05,248	| IOT084 |	Recalling and that's going to be a hassle and a half
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,016	| IOT084 |	But not all of them
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| IOT084 |	Not all of them
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,832	| IOT084 |	Who knows
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,856	| IOT084 |	Yep unplugged
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,136	| IOT084 |	Unplugem
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| IOT084 |	Buy new stuff
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,952	| IOT084 |	Sorry
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,512	| IOT084 |	I mean that's a terrible thing to say but it is
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,583	| IOT084 |	Baby iot devices need a kill command a kill switch
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,607	| IOT084 |	Hilton
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,447	| IOT084 |	Just thinking out loud
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,471	| IOT084 |	I like it
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:29,567	| IOT084 |	There has actually been some researchers talked about doing something
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,079	| IOT084 |	The do-gooder
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,615	| IOT084 |	Which
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:36,223	| IOT084 |	They're testing a research environment but what it does is it automatically goes in and changes the password
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,271	| IOT084 |	Now the downside is
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,087	| IOT084 |	That's like an automated bot so
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:46,463	| IOT084 |	What would happen if your password on your infected device that you may or may not know is actually infected with suddenly change it
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| IOT084 |	You couldn't get to it anymore
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,559	| IOT084 |	So that
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,095	| IOT084 |	Probably
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,119	| IOT084 |	Bad idea
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,655	| IOT084 |	Killswitch
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,959	| IOT084 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,727	| IOT084 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,311	| IOT084 |	There's iot security people
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,847	| IOT084 |	I get away glad this is happy
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,127	| IOT084 |	Because people are
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:04,895	| IOT084 |	Are now paying a
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,407	| IOT084 |	Attention to it
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:12,063	| IOT084 |	What is disconcerting is there so few Avenue still for fixing it
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,087	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,135	| IOT084 |	I would focus on
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:18,719	| IOT084 |	A building secure products but be thinking about how you
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,767	| IOT084 |	How you can fix it
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,559	| IOT084 |	Over the air updates are like the best option
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| IOT084 |	Mitigating red distributed
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,423	| IOT084 |	A solution is very very challenging
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,447	| IOT084 |	It is
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:28,959	| IOT084 |	But
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,263	| IOT084 |	Like that was really helpful
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,823	| IOT084 |	Security researchers pay attention
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:34,847	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,663	| IOT084 |	We don't have a solution for keeping an eye on
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,199	| IOT084 |	People who are smarter than we are
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,479	| IOT084 |	Cruising Solutions so
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,503	| IOT084 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,551	| IOT084 |	Hopefully we'll bring you some interesting stuff
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| IOT084 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,391	| IOT084 |	I have been playing with
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,927	| IOT084 |	Google home
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| IOT084 |	My
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:53,279	| IOT084 |	Google home is the Amazon Echo light
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,815	| IOT084 |	Speaker device that you
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,607	| IOT084 |	You talk to personal assistant speaker
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,655	| IOT084 |	And I can say
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,215	| IOT084 |	Fit at UK Monday
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,239	| IOT084 |	And this is Tuesday
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,775	| IOT084 |	And I left town so
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,543	| IOT084 |	I did not bring it with me
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,591	| IOT084 |	Said it was super easy
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,127	| IOT084 |	It took you know maybe
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,175	| IOT084 |	5 minutes and that includes it's time to
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,783	| IOT084 |	Then I tested it it sounds good
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,855	| IOT084 |	I don't know if it sounds better than the echo in all honesty some
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:21,951	| IOT084 |	People were saying that jury's out on that I'm seeing mixed comments on that
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| IOT084 |	Bass pretty well
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,327	| IOT084 |	I think a lot of things
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,095	| IOT084 |	Trouble
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,655	| IOT084 |	The higher pitches and Dad
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,679	| IOT084 |	Lost
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,263	| IOT084 |	Maybe it depends on what
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,031	| IOT084 |	Kind of music you listen to
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,335	| IOT084 |	Google home
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,871	| IOT084 |	I did encounter
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,383	| IOT084 |	An issue
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,711	| IOT084 |	And it feels like it might be like a Stacy
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,039	| IOT084 |	Only issue but I'm going to tell you about it because there is
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,343	| IOT084 |	The customer help portion of this which I was kind of
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| IOT084 |	Not as impressed by
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,671	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:56,511	| IOT084 |	I was able to connect my Nest thermostat and that integration worked was very easy
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:03,167	| IOT084 |	I then went to connect my Philips Hue Lights because if my husband can't turn on the lights with his voice he feels like my tire job is worth
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:11,871	| IOT084 |	Dark in here against a serious they say I have to turn it on for the switch
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,687	| IOT084 |	Oh that was a terrible impression of my husband
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,247	| IOT084 |	Nobody tell him
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,783	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,831	| IOT084 |	It didn't connect
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:27,231	| IOT084 |	And so then I went to the troubleshooting page it showed me automatically the troubleshooting page but it was pretty basic it was like Harold
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,023	| IOT084 |	Are they on the same I find it
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,839	| IOT084 |	And is your Google home
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| IOT084 |	I was like
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,143	| IOT084 |	Just all of these things
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,471	| IOT084 |	And then was a try again and it didn't work
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,799	| IOT084 |	I done went to the
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:46,431	| IOT084 |	Bigger troubleshooting page which basically had me do all those things again and then it was like okay reboot both devices
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,455	| IOT084 |	And then
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,759	| IOT084 |	I did that and it still didn't work
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,039	| IOT084 |	And I never like
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:58,463	| IOT084 |	Okay enjoy the troubleshooting got it so there's a there's a phone number there's online chat
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,303	| IOT084 |	Do you can call I did notice that Google does not make the phone number like
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:06,143	| IOT084 |	Easy to click you can just press the phone number to call you after like cutting
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| IOT084 |	Pasting to make a call
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,703	| IOT084 |	What's odd
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,495	| IOT084 |	I know I was kind of like dude Google
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,799	| IOT084 |	Clearly don't be calling you
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,847	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:18,943	| IOT084 |	I spend about half an hour on the phone she the customer service agent was very polite
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,271	| IOT084 |	Took me through all the same steps that
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,295	| IOT084 |	Weather
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:23,807	| IOT084 |	Faceit taken
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,647	| IOT084 |	And after that she she had to call in like
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| IOT084 |	Extra troops
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:35,839	| IOT084 |	And at no point in time did I get that they didn't ask me what I felt were probably some basic questions like
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| IOT084 |	Hey
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| IOT084 |	What kind of Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT084 |	Using
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,983	| IOT084 |	They did ask me what kind of phone I was using but that was just a chic
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| IOT084 |	You could tell me where to go
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| IOT084 |	Go to press the button
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,543	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:47,615	| IOT084 |	I found online someone said that they actually swapped
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,151	| IOT084 |	From they were using Firefox
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,991	| IOT084 |	And swap to the Chrome as their default browser to do this connection
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,783	| IOT084 |	And he said that made
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| IOT084 |	So I use Adblock
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,855	| IOT084 |	Browser on my
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| IOT084 |	And so
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,487	| IOT084 |	I'm going when I get back in town I'm going to swap over to
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,815	| IOT084 |	Chrome and see if that works
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,399	| IOT084 |	But Google when they decided they couldn't help me
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:15,007	| IOT084 |	They're like well we've escalated it in within 24 to 48 hours will send
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,335	| IOT084 |	So that's where I am
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,151	| IOT084 |	I didn't think it was the best experience
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,431	| IOT084 |	It was a terrible
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:28,063	| IOT084 |	But I didn't feel like the Google if you called Google you would get anything other than
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,343	| IOT084 |	What you would get online anyway
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:34,719	| IOT084 |	Yeah that's what it sounds like it sounds like the same process just now with a purse instead of a computer
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,535	| IOT084 |	Which is good for people who don't like following instructions
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,839	| IOT084 |	Computer but for me it was super frustrating
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:44,703	| IOT084 |	Well yeah because you know what you're doing and then you've already been to the types of warrants
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,519	| IOT084 |	I'm surprised that they didn't ask for or
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:53,151	| IOT084 |	Will ask for permission I pull a log from the Google home device
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,455	| IOT084 |	This this I thought was interesting so
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,247	| IOT084 |	Google home it said
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| IOT084 |	Send feedback so I was like
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| IOT084 |	Okay g
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,855	| IOT084 |	Ecology
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| IOT084 |	Okay g
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,439	| IOT084 |	Send feedback it was like what is the problem
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:08,255	| IOT084 |	And then I was like I can't connect my Philips Hue Lights
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| IOT084 |	It sent it
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,607	| IOT084 |	But I don't know what happened
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:16,703	| IOT084 |	So I don't know if that included lawsuit or is that was just like me telling it I just
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,823	| IOT084 |	Yeah that's that's swell
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:25,407	| IOT084 |	Without knowing what was sent to me that's kind of not a good experience either
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,687	| IOT084 |	It should be.
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:32,319	| IOT084 |	Free Christian clear so I forgot
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,367	| IOT084 |	But not in that division
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,135	| IOT084 |	Right at school
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:41,279	| IOT084 |	And I did not order a Google home as of yet because pink is not a partner in my stuff is a twink
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,839	| IOT084 |	You talked about maybe work around a little bit later in the show
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| IOT084 |	Alright so
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,959	| IOT084 |	Wait wait one quick question
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,007	| IOT084 |	I can treat you for what
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,287	| IOT084 |	A lot of people were
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,847	| IOT084 |	Curious what would happen if you were to say the
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,151	| IOT084 |	Keyword for Google home
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:01,759	| IOT084 |	When your phone is nearby and you have voice detection on the phone why did that
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:06,367	| IOT084 |	And I'm betting I'm hoping that it worked only on one device not both
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:10,207	| IOT084 |	It did so both devices were like your listing
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:13,023	| IOT084 |	And then the message on your phone screen is
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,583	| IOT084 |	What is it say it said
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| IOT084 |	Answering on another device
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| IOT084 |	And then the home
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| IOT084 |	Would answer
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,703	| IOT084 |	Perfect
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,263	| IOT084 |	Alright so
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:30,943	| IOT084 |	Two Nest they did last week and announcement all about new appliances they work with so they
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,991	| IOT084 |	Have a list
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:36,063	| IOT084 |	Some of these we actually already knew about and I just don't know if they
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:41,439	| IOT084 |	Existed before this but Whirlpool it tells your dishwasher to start automatically when you leave the house
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,207	| IOT084 |	Or
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| IOT084 |	Have your washer clip your
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,767	| IOT084 |	Clothes fresh until you get home
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,559	| IOT084 |	Jenn-Air
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,327	| IOT084 |	Which is the oven
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:51,423	| IOT084 |	If you forget your oven or stove is on and Nest says hey she's not home
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:54,751	| IOT084 |	You can get a notification that says by the way you left your oven on
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,031	| IOT084 |	Turn that off
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,335	| IOT084 |	Yes please
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,895	| IOT084 |	Yes well maybe not maybe a preheating while you go in
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,455	| IOT084 |	Get something dangerous
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,991	| IOT084 |	What's an oven
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,807	| IOT084 |	Okay this is what I'll tell you guys in my house
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,575	| IOT084 |	Princetown
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,367	| IOT084 |	So ream is another one
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,391	| IOT084 |	And
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| IOT084 |	Hayward
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,951	| IOT084 |	Oh this is a pool
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,719	| IOT084 |	Kleenex
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:20,095	| IOT084 |	Yeah your non-essential pool appliances
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:24,447	| IOT084 |	To turn off during energy rush hour or demand response active
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,215	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,751	| IOT084 |	Nice
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,567	| IOT084 |	And then Samsung has your powerbot vacuum
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,359	| IOT084 |	It can turn on when you're not home
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:37,247	| IOT084 |	That's actually bad for me because by actually it's not a Samsung powerbot but my robot always gets stuck
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,551	| IOT084 |	Its Spots and we could only vacuum
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,879	| IOT084 |	Kind of counterfeit service
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,415	| IOT084 |	It does
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,719	| IOT084 |	All of these things
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,255	| IOT084 |	Seemed pretty cool Kevin Williamson
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,303	| IOT084 |	I love it I love it
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:53,631	| IOT084 |	We need more this more more more because
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,703	| IOT084 |	Typically and I know it's early in the whole Smart Home
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| IOT084 |	Market
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| IOT084 |	For a lot of people
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:05,919	| IOT084 |	A lot of things that are coming to Market a lot of products just replace an existing interface you know let's use voice instead of a light switch
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:11,807	| IOT084 |	Did the real benefit is when you start tying these things intelligently together
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,087	| IOT084 |	Which is what is happening here
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:16,671	| IOT084 |	Yeah I don't want to be home when my Robot vacuum is vaca
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| IOT084 |	You know because
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| IOT084 |	I don't need to be there for example
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,255	| IOT084 |	Crate
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:23,583	| IOT084 |	That's known as I'm not there fire up the robot go clean
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,375	| IOT084 |	Same with the other stove examples
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,423	| IOT084 |	Perfect music great safety feature
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,471	| IOT084 |	So I I want to see
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,799	| IOT084 |	So so much more of this cuz really we don't have Smart Homes yet
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| IOT084 |	We have a lot of
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,871	| IOT084 |	A lot of smart
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,639	| IOT084 |	Devices that
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,663	| IOT084 |	Still don't really
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,687	| IOT084 |	Too much together
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,967	| IOT084 |	Yes we need
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:41,759	| IOT084 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,063	| IOT084 |	More give me more
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:50,975	| IOT084 |	More connections for Kevin in actually in a couple of weeks we are going to do a holiday-themed show that's going to talk about
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:55,327	| IOT084 |	Cool things that we have connected and things that you guys might find useful
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:14:02,239	| IOT084 |	So if you guys have done any cool connections with your hubs or things like that that you want to share that are like totally long
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,007	| IOT084 |	Until
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:06,079	| IOT084 |	Send info at iot podcast
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,103	| IOT084 |	DACA
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,663	| IOT084 |	Thread now onto thread
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,711	| IOT084 |	So last week
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,479	| IOT084 |	Thread group
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,551	| IOT084 |	Which manages the thread Wireless protocol for you guys that
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:20,159	| IOT084 |	You don't keep your wireless protocols memorize this is like a mesh
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| IOT084 |	Network
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:24,255	| IOT084 |	Low-power mesh Network that also supports IPv6 which means
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,279	| IOT084 |	Go Direct
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,327	| IOT084 |	So they said
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| IOT084 |	We are not just for the Smart Home
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,655	| IOT084 |	And they introduced some
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:33,727	| IOT084 |	Enterprise they said they were going to work on Enterprise use cases for lighting
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,263	| IOT084 |	And some other
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:36,799	| IOT084 |	Stop
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,079	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,591	| IOT084 |	They
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,383	| IOT084 |	Will start adding
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| IOT084 |	Kind of
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:46,015	| IOT084 |	Extensions to the thread protocol that let people handle like security and Authentication
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,551	| IOT084 |	At all these kind of
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,855	| IOT084 |	Bigger subnets of thread devices that you
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,623	| IOT084 |	Can manage
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,647	| IOT084 |	So all of that is coming
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,183	| IOT084 |	And
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,207	| IOT084 |	Red is also
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,743	| IOT084 |	Good arm and
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:56,767	| IOT084 |	Other
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,815	| IOT084 |	Companies are
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:02,655	| IOT084 |	Producing radios that will basically let you run
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,959	| IOT084 |	Red and Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,239	| IOT084 |	On the same radio
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,311	| IOT084 |	Which is really interesting I said this was going to happen a while back but
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,103	| IOT084 |	It is actually going to happen
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:18,015	| IOT084 |	And the thinking there is maybe use Bluetooth to connect your thread devices to your phone for examples
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,807	| IOT084 |	Making the connection process easier
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,879	| IOT084 |	But I would be excited to see like a thread light bulb
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| IOT084 |	Butterfinger also uses Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:27,743	| IOT084 |	And then you can get presence detection over your mesh
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,279	| IOT084 |	Lightning Network
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| IOT084 |	How awesome would that be
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:35,935	| IOT084 |	And then could you theoretically access that light remotely without a hub
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:40,287	| IOT084 |	Yeah directions to the web
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,335	| IOT084 |	Yeah actually I guess you could
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| IOT084 |	I'm thinking the cat
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:44,895	| IOT084 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| IOT084 |	Oh but you fancy man
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,991	| IOT084 |	Anyway to get rid of a Hayabusa
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:51,807	| IOT084 |	Teddy day I can get rid of a big breakfast
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,831	| IOT084 |	Will stay tuned for the
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,855	| IOT084 |	Scarify talk
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,415	| IOT084 |	All right so that's a threat news
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| IOT084 |	Here we're going to get into
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:03,327	| IOT084 |	Actually let's talk about we've got some product stuff first but let's talk about if this then that
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| IOT084 |	Before we get in
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,119	| IOT084 |	Because
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,399	| IOT084 |	It just feels better
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,679	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,727	| IOT084 |	If this then that one of our favorite
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,007	| IOT084 |	Averitt
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,543	| IOT084 |	Bobby holik
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,847	| IOT084 |	Connectable services
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,383	| IOT084 |	Flexible service
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,687	| IOT084 |	I don't know if that's
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,479	| IOT084 |	They changed
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT084 |	Their recipe
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:21,759	| IOT084 |	Keys to a
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:25,855	| IOT084 |	And this is a nomenclature thing they also integrated the
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| IOT084 |	Baidu
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,671	| IOT084 |	I was like I can't
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,439	| IOT084 |	Remember what all these apps were
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,231	| IOT084 |	The integrated those
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,767	| IOT084 |	All back into the app so that's all
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,303	| IOT084 |	Bond
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:38,143	| IOT084 |	Which is fine you know I had to do I had a couple do apps and I almost never
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,679	| IOT084 |	Cuz I like physical buttons
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,239	| IOT084 |	Call me crazy
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,031	| IOT084 |	Basically
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,055	| IOT084 |	To create
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,847	| IOT084 |	Aplets it's the same process
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,383	| IOT084 |	Pretty easy
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,967	| IOT084 |	What we did notice there we're playing around
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,503	| IOT084 |	With a phenomenon
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,527	| IOT084 |	Is
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:17:00,671	| IOT084 |	Did the Google assistant is a channel and that works on your pixel phone or your Google home device
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:07,327	| IOT084 |	I'm very happy with by this this discovery this morning because I did not buy a home
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:13,727	| IOT084 |	Because what's a represented by Necco at first because it didn't support what I needed to support my case wink
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,287	| IOT084 |	However in doing some quick
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,591	| IOT084 |	Playing around right before the show
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:21,151	| IOT084 |	Yeah I will be able to create a
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:21,663	| IOT084 |	Applets
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,943	| IOT084 |	Using
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:26,527	| IOT084 |	The Google Assistant Channel and my wink shortcuts
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,319	| IOT084 |	I don't think it's working quite
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,855	| IOT084 |	Right to say that I think it's
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:33,695	| IOT084 |	Speakers having issues with my wink Hub at the moment so I'll keep playing with that but
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,975	| IOT084 |	I can now
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| IOT084 |	Theoretically
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:42,143	| IOT084 |	Control things through the Google assistant app on my pixel and order if I buy a Google home
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,983	| IOT084 |	Yes and I will go home and test this out to sow
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,519	| IOT084 |	If you're going to try this out
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,567	| IOT084 |	It also actually means
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:52,127	| IOT084 |	Theoretically your Google home could also control
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,407	| IOT084 |	WeMo or
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT084 |	There's so many issues
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,015	| IOT084 |	Controllable things out there your skybell
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:58,783	| IOT084 |	Sure
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,087	| IOT084 |	Like so much
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:06,975	| IOT084 |	Now if you want to connect it to your wink Hub you already need to have a shortcut ready for what you want to do which is an art
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,767	| IOT084 |	You just go create shortcut
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| IOT084 |	Say what you want to have happen
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,095	| IOT084 |	It happens
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,935	| IOT084 |	You also have to do to if you want your lights on
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,703	| IOT084 |	That's one command
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,983	| IOT084 |	And if you want your lights off
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,775	| IOT084 |	That's another command so you've got to
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| IOT084 |	Create all of that
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,895	| IOT084 |	So just keep on short that's her both of those so
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:27,967	| IOT084 |	So you could end up with a long list of shortcuts
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,735	| IOT084 |	But
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| IOT084 |	If you really want to make your Google home
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| IOT084 |	Uno programmable
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:36,671	| IOT084 |	And I imagine because if this and that has a lot of latency you're also going to deal with latency but
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:41,023	| IOT084 |	It still might be fun so I'm going to try it will let you know next week
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,071	| IOT084 |	I would do it right now but
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,607	| IOT084 |	By golly Avenue
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:48,447	| IOT084 |	It's it's a good alternative until
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,495	| IOT084 |	Petition Partners come onto the whole Google
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| IOT084 |	Homemade lights
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,567	| IOT084 |	Yes and
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,591	| IOT084 |	Let's just say this rate
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,639	| IOT084 |	Shofar
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,431	| IOT084 |	Amazon Echo is still
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,455	| IOT084 |	Chilling in my house
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:06,879	| IOT084 |	I love Google Assistant I think asking it questions is nice but like if I were going to still put everything around me
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,159	| IOT084 |	My house at still go with Amazon
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,975	| IOT084 |	Mohr partners
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,511	| IOT084 |	Mohr partners
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,303	| IOT084 |	Will for me the goal is to smart
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,863	| IOT084 |	If your goal is to access like
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:18,143	| IOT084 |	Massive Google
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,935	| IOT084 |	Intelligence then
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:22,495	| IOT084 |	I can see where the home comes in handy
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:25,823	| IOT084 |	I'm thinking actually I'll put I get a lot of questions in the shower
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,615	| IOT084 |	A lot of things coming to my brain
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,663	| IOT084 |	Put that in my bathroom
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,967	| IOT084 |	Can just ask random questions
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:36,831	| IOT084 |	Instant that looks like an air freshener it's like perfectly bathroom yes no one will know
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,391	| IOT084 |	Alrighty
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,671	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,975	| IOT084 |	Let's go into Fun exciting
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| IOT084 |	Products
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:50,655	| IOT084 |	Takis this is something that occasionally people ask me about so there was a product while that
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,423	| IOT084 |	Call Troy email
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,983	| IOT084 |	And what it was it is apparent
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,031	| IOT084 |	Does a wifi-connected mailbox fit
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,567	| IOT084 |	Kids can basically
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:58,847	| IOT084 |	Talk to
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:05,247	| IOT084 |	Parents could leave messages in the toymail app and then the kids could play it back on the little mailbox
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:08,063	| IOT084 |	And how cute is that so parents who travel a lot
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,599	| IOT084 |	They can connect to
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,111	| IOT084 |	Communicate with her
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,903	| IOT084 |	While the parents at work
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:13,951	| IOT084 |	Share with the kid
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,743	| IOT084 |	Sota
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,303	| IOT084 |	I went away but now there is a
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,071	| IOT084 |	Plush
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| IOT084 |	Animal
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,375	| IOT084 |	Call the toymail talkie
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,911	| IOT084 |	Basically it's
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,983	| IOT084 |	You exchanged voicemails with your kids
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,311	| IOT084 |	You can use your phone and send it to the toy
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:34,687	| IOT084 |	So I would send it to my daughter for example or my daughter could push a button on the back of the Taki to say something to me
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| IOT084 |	Or to another kids talk
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:37,759	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,807	| IOT084 |	It's $50
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,647	| IOT084 |	I really want to get one of these because I love like
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:46,207	| IOT084 |	I love the idea of while I'm gone
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:46,719	| IOT084 |	Communicate
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT084 |	I think it's fine
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,047	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,607	| IOT084 |	And I'm putting it in a toy to cute implementation
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:59,007	| IOT084 |	The plushie is actually kind of cool because
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,519	| IOT084 |	It's kind of a
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,823	| IOT084 |	Hello local
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,335	| IOT084 |	What that's not a word
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,359	| IOT084 |	Anyway
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:08,223	| IOT084 |	Able to be cuddled thank you thank you
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,039	| IOT084 |	That is available
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,855	| IOT084 |	Online and it's available at beta
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,367	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,672	| IOT084 |	Speaking of beta
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:19,744	| IOT084 |	This is the store I went to last week in Palo Alto that had all these Gadget
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:22,560	| IOT084 |	I bought a crazy silly device
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,096	| IOT084 |	And I'm going to tell you about it
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,608	| IOT084 |	Because
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,168	| IOT084 |	Cuz
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,472	| IOT084 |	Country Cat
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,776	| IOT084 |	So I would advise
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,288	| IOT084 |	Call the spire
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:35,616	| IOT084 |	And if tracks your respiration
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT084 |	2
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:40,224	| IOT084 |	Tell you if you are tense, murrin
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,528	| IOT084 |	Focus it also acts as an activity tracker
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,344	| IOT084 |	So this is a $99
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:49,952	| IOT084 |	Alternative activity tracker it's based on Research from Stanford
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,256	| IOT084 |	So it feels
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,024	| IOT084 |	Scientific
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:56,352	| IOT084 |	And they also offer you meditations
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,680	| IOT084 |	In the app so the goal is to get you to like learn how to be more
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,984	| IOT084 |	And I thought it would be good for me
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,032	| IOT084 |	Because I am super tents
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,336	| IOT084 |	And lo and behold
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,384	| IOT084 |	The app does register that it's like
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:14,528	| IOT084 |	You have had 298 tents minutes today
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:20,416	| IOT084 |	It's nice it is not a need to have because I am so focused on being mindful
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:23,232	| IOT084 |	I thought it'd be good for me and it has kind of helped with that
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:26,048	| IOT084 |	I'm still being through the tutorials that are helping
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,816	| IOT084 |	Can you breathe better
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| IOT084 |	And I will see if I'm more
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,400	| IOT084 |	Peace
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:35,520	| IOT084 |	Is it a necessary to buy snow and then part of me feels like God I got so much crap stuck on me in the world
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:40,128	| IOT084 |	Ifitness tracker I've got this thing I've got a ring that you have
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:40,640	| IOT084 |	My phone
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,992	| IOT084 |	You know if you're trying to be mine
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,272	| IOT084 |	This is kind of fun
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:49,856	| IOT084 |	So it looks like this device Clips on
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:53,440	| IOT084 |	To you it was like a like a like a belt clip
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:59,840	| IOT084 |	It has to clip onto you and touch your skin so the device actually has to face inward
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,912	| IOT084 |	If your girl that means like in your bra like
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,192	| IOT084 |	Restaurant
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,216	| IOT084 |	Somewhere
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,264	| IOT084 |	Or in your pants like
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| IOT084 |	Attached to your
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,568	| IOT084 |	Facing in on you
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,872	| IOT084 |	It's Raining Tacos
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:15,456	| IOT084 |	In this clip my God you guys this clip is so strong
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,736	| IOT084 |	I'm I'm constantly wrestling
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,600	| IOT084 |	What is high quality
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,160	| IOT084 |	Materials it looks like a little Stone
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,696	| IOT084 |	Clippers again
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,208	| IOT084 |	Fairy
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,256	| IOT084 |	Aries Spears
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| IOT084 |	Hefty
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,560	| IOT084 |	And that it's got a wireless charger
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:34,656	| IOT084 |	So you just set it on the charger it vibrates to say like
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:35,936	| IOT084 |	Sweet
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:36,960	| IOT084 |	And that's it
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,240	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,056	| IOT084 |	If you're if you're looking for something like this
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,592	| IOT084 |	It does work
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:46,176	| IOT084 |	But you'd have to be really looking for something
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,944	| IOT084 |	Like us
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:53,344	| IOT084 |	It's interesting because it reminds you something that was just rolled out with the Apple Watch 2 and Ice apples new breathe
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,880	| IOT084 |	The app on the watch
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,648	| IOT084 |	Now
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,184	| IOT084 |	I don't use it because I'm not
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,512	| IOT084 |	One more thing. To deal with during the day but
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:04,352	| IOT084 |	I don't know that monitors your breathing but I know that reminds you to
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:06,912	| IOT084 |	Take time and breathe and walk you through
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:11,264	| IOT084 |	Deep breathing every symptom times a day I turn the function off but
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,568	| IOT084 |	I don't think it matters which this would
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,896	| IOT084 |	Yes so if you do buy it
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,944	| IOT084 |	The app has to be on
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:19,968	| IOT084 |	2 track
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,504	| IOT084 |	Into sync with
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:22,784	| IOT084 |	Spirestone
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:25,344	| IOT084 |	Used to consider device
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,648	| IOT084 |	So if you and it only stores like 6 hours
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,696	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,232	| IOT084 |	Yeah that's that is actually something
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,560	| IOT084 |	Here's a fun Kickstarter
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,840	| IOT084 |	This is The Big C
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,912	| IOT084 |	I love this because I like gestures in
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,240	| IOT084 |	They showed it to me in a kitchen and I was sold
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,520	| IOT084 |	Put on this ID
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,824	| IOT084 |	That's all you have to do
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:49,152	| IOT084 |	Get this in the kitchen and you can celebrate
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,456	| IOT084 |	Is it tiny sensor
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,248	| IOT084 |	Census year
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,832	| IOT084 |	Hand gestures in the air and commands whatever device you program it to
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,112	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,648	| IOT084 |	It works with
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,440	| IOT084 |	If this then that
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT084 |	It works with
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,512	| IOT084 |	Music and lighting control GoPros
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:05,536	| IOT084 |	Your phone
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,864	| IOT084 |	You can even put it in your car in like gesture in York
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:10,656	| IOT084 |	Car that's actually a really interesting use
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,192	| IOT084 |	Or on your bike
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,472	| IOT084 |	You could use it on your bike
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,240	| IOT084 |	Control your GoPro
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:15,776	| IOT084 |	Where to get
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| IOT084 |	Directions
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:21,664	| IOT084 |	I'm intrigued by this and it's $80 for one
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:25,760	| IOT084 |	I think it's $140 for a package of two when the kickstarter is met its goal
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,088	| IOT084 |	The estimated delivery is March of 2017
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,624	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| IOT084 |	I probably won't buy it on the kickstarter
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,512	| IOT084 |	I might buy one
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:42,400	| IOT084 |	I appreciate what they're trying to do here
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,168	| IOT084 |	And
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,728	| IOT084 |	Gestures are not easy and you have to have
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,544	| IOT084 |	The device work with a lot of other devices
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,080	| IOT084 |	Value
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,640	| IOT084 |	I wonder how difficult it is to like
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,688	| IOT084 |	Swap the usage
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:59,808	| IOT084 |	For that cyclists say at your in the kitchen you want hands-free scrolling on your iPad they show that ended MO
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,112	| IOT084 |	So you're needing go and
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,904	| IOT084 |	You don't touch screen CD
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,416	| IOT084 |	Swipe
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,464	| IOT084 |	Yeah over this device grape
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,232	| IOT084 |	But then
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,304	| IOT084 |	What do you do when you want to act like now change it over to
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,096	| IOT084 |	Dimming lights
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,120	| IOT084 |	But you gotta
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,936	| IOT084 |	I guess there's an app and you have to tell it now you're going to do this one
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,496	| IOT084 |	I would think
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:22,080	| IOT084 |	Cuz it's can do a lot of different things and work with a lot of products
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,848	| IOT084 |	Switch is awesome
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,128	| IOT084 |	I just wonder
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,480	| IOT084 |	I think you're going to need
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,296	| IOT084 |	Yeah so I did
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,344	| IOT084 |	Have to
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:33,856	| IOT084 |	Define what
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,160	| IOT084 |	Each of them
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:40,256	| IOT084 |	Now they did say to reduce latency they've got a direct integration with lifx
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,024	| IOT084 |	Q which is a
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:44,352	| IOT084 |	And the battery on this thing lasts about a month
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,888	| IOT084 |	And so
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,168	| IOT084 |	Cuz you do have to charge it
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,240	| IOT084 |	Yeah so that's what we know on this and
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,800	| IOT084 |	I can't wait till I actually want to see it
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,336	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:55,872	| IOT084 |	Looks cool
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,384	| IOT084 |	It does
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,408	| IOT084 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,712	| IOT084 |	Kevin do you want to talk about Russian cyber attacks
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:06,112	| IOT084 |	What does Cyber more of the cyber yasso
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:09,440	| IOT084 |	Okay everybody if
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:13,792	| IOT084 |	Russia interferes with the US election the US government is already too
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,840	| IOT084 |	Pushback using the cyber
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,888	| IOT084 |	That's crazy NBC News who says that
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,704	| IOT084 |	The US military hackers have
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:26,336	| IOT084 |	Unable to penetrate Russia's electric grid Telecom networks and the kremlin's command systems
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| IOT084 |	I don't know
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:33,248	| IOT084 |	This is kind of scary actually I don't know if this is hype this is just posturing this is
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:37,088	| IOT084 |	It's true it's scary no matter which of those scenarios it really is
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:41,184	| IOT084 |	You know it is it opens up a whole new world of like
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,256	| IOT084 |	A Whole New World
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:45,280	| IOT084 |	But not a good
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:46,816	| IOT084 |	Not not the kind of
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:51,424	| IOT084 |	Thinking Out Loud here do you think it's a question of
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:54,752	| IOT084 |	When there's an attack on a mass scale attack on the cyber
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,288	| IOT084 |	Versus
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| IOT084 |	If
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,848	| IOT084 |	So like emasculata Connor
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,616	| IOT084 |	Physical infrastructure
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,688	| IOT084 |	Yeah let's say by let's a state-sponsored
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:03,968	| IOT084 |	Yes
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,272	| IOT084 |	Actually Kevin it's already happened
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,832	| IOT084 |	Back in March 2016
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,904	| IOT084 |	The FBI put it out at the justice department
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,208	| IOT084 |	Claims that Iran had attacked
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:18,048	| IOT084 |	Us infrastructure online by infiltrating the
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| IOT084 |	Shiraz controls
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,632	| IOT084 |	Of a damn that was 25 miles north of
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,144	| IOT084 |	New York City
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,424	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,728	| IOT084 |	The point here is
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,008	| IOT084 |	Not if
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,032	| IOT084 |	Not win but
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,824	| IOT084 |	I guess what
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,872	| IOT084 |	What's next
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:35,712	| IOT084 |	What will be the next Target when and what do we do
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,248	| IOT084 |	Annette that seriously concerning
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:41,344	| IOT084 |	Yes so in the reason why it actually didn't
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,368	| IOT084 |	Cause
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,392	| IOT084 |	Damage
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:47,232	| IOT084 |	Is because the physical infrastructure was unable to actually open on
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,024	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,584	| IOT084 |	In that instance
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,888	| IOT084 |	Free pick up at Target
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| IOT084 |	Latin for sure
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:56,960	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,240	| IOT084 |	But yes if you have
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,776	| IOT084 |	I mean this
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,568	| IOT084 |	Again underlies the importance of
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:04,896	| IOT084 |	Protecting these assets and think about security
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,200	| IOT084 |	All the time in
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,224	| IOT084 |	I would say
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,760	| IOT084 |	Thinking about security
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,344	| IOT084 |	Not as something that could ever really be finished
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,160	| IOT084 |	That is that is a really big issue that
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,952	| IOT084 |	We just be like
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:18,464	| IOT084 |	There is no secure
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,768	| IOT084 |	Thoroughly products that
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,048	| IOT084 |	Contact yet
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:25,120	| IOT084 |	In that world view how do you change your mindset
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:29,472	| IOT084 |	Figure out updates you figure outfit like stopgaps like
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,264	| IOT084 |	If this goes down
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:32,800	| IOT084 |	What's your next backup
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:36,896	| IOT084 |	Especially when we're talking about actuators like things that actually make stuff
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:39,712	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,992	| IOT084 |	Scary scary
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,784	| IOT084 |	But don't worry
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,344	| IOT084 |	As we now have something super lighthearted
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,368	| IOT084 |	Next
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,416	| IOT084 |	We have our guest
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:50,464	| IOT084 |	Rob malisani of securifi
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:54,560	| IOT084 |	We actually do talk about security unless they are the makers of the Almond router
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,328	| IOT084 |	And
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,608	| IOT084 |	Little interesting side note

EDL	00:30:56,512	00:31:00,096	| IOT084 |	All of this in real time for performance Improvement workout
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:05,216	| IOT084 |	And where did this idea come from the market research project with MIT
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:09,056	| IOT084 |	Technology in biology
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:15,200	| IOT084 |	Increase something amazing top people understand more about that body you wake up in the morning today
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:21,088	| IOT084 |	Gas in the tank at the tires oil in the engine
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:27,488	| IOT084 |	You don't have access to the same level to me all the information you need to keep your buddy when it gets best and that's what
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,000	| IOT084 |	What will excited
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,960	| IOT084 |	People who are ready to embrace this concept
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,752	| IOT084 |	Use different station
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,264	| IOT084 |	Woody Allen
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,104	| IOT084 |	Because we could help them
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,384	| IOT084 |	Soldat biggest problem
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:48,224	| IOT084 |	What does knowing how hard to push himself and a****** so when
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:52,064	| IOT084 |	Clear that Bluetooth would be the way to go as it was
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:55,904	| IOT084 |	Easiest way to connect a wearable to phone 2
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,928	| IOT084 |	Deliver information
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:32:00,000	| IOT084 |	In real time in a convenient way will technology.
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:08,960	| IOT084 |	I love you exactly how far I can see you guys are in theater right now
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,984	| IOT084 |	What kind of feedback are you
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:16,384	| IOT084 |	Devices to a speech over the US
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,688	| IOT084 |	And when I say about this program
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:22,272	| IOT084 |	You know we we get a lot of feedback about the quality of our data how
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,856	| IOT084 |	People information Bay
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:31,232	| IOT084 |	When they could get a real snapshot into what's happening in the body
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:35,328	| IOT084 |	Skip back so we can tell them what to do
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:37,632	| IOT084 |	And we help them understand how their body is reacting everyday
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,168	| IOT084 |	So you've had athlete
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,704	| IOT084 |	Has anyone else seen it
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:43,264	| IOT084 |	Yeah we had the chance to them alongside
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:45,312	| IOT084 |	Two others Bluetooth stick companies
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:48,128	| IOT084 |	At last month at the Discovery Museum
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:51,968	| IOT084 |	And that was an amazing opportunity to interact with
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:54,528	| IOT084 |	Yaz most influential
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,576	| IOT084 |	To demonstrate how Bluetooth
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,624	| IOT084 |	Houses built such an amazing solution
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,696	| IOT084 |	And we destroying people externally aphids
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:07,840	| IOT084 |	And where can our listeners learn more about your product you can read all about it she wanted

EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,640	| IOT084 |	So guys
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:56,736	| IOT084 |	Way before this version of podcast I did a version that
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,272	| IOT084 |	And
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,040	| IOT084 |	Two or three years
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,832	| IOT084 |	And
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:05,696	| IOT084 |	Ron was my very first guest all the way back in 2013
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:06,976	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,256	| IOT084 |	Come full circle
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,024	| IOT084 |	Yay
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,328	| IOT084 |	Yeah we did
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:15,680	| IOT084 |	Isn't that crazy we've been doing this iot stuff for so long
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| IOT084 |	Littleoralandie
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:22,080	| IOT084 |	I know so this is a good good place to start you guys started securifi
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:26,944	| IOT084 |	Back in 2012 before everyone else was like I know it let's build a new kind of router
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:28,480	| IOT084 |	What was your thinking
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,248	| IOT084 |	With
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,272	| IOT084 |	Starting the company
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,600	| IOT084 |	I've always hated my home router
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,368	| IOT084 |	And I think
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,136	| IOT084 |	You know there was
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:38,720	| IOT084 |	Gas was
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:42,816	| IOT084 |	The one time I have to help my landlord set up her Wi-Fi router and
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:46,144	| IOT084 |	Just a very simple thing I ended up spending like 30 minutes
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:46,912	| IOT084 |	40 minutes
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:50,496	| IOT084 |	And I realized why you know I'm supposed to be the expert at the stop
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:54,848	| IOT084 |	And I struggle with my home router just imagine
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,384	| IOT084 |	Regular consumers
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,688	| IOT084 |	And that was the founding story of
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:03,040	| IOT084 |	Is a big opportunity to make Robin's easy for consumers
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,344	| IOT084 |	This was in 2000
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,880	| IOT084 |	September 2011
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,648	| IOT084 |	And that's
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,672	| IOT084 |	Just when
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,976	| IOT084 |	Android phone started getting big so
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:16,864	| IOT084 |	Screens are getting bigger and cheaper so we thought why not put touch screen LCD
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,144	| IOT084 |	On the router itself
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:22,496	| IOT084 |	So you do not need to do the 192.168 stuff
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,800	| IOT084 |	So that was the founding Story song
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,592	| IOT084 |	It's it's funny for us because
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,664	| IOT084 |	It's like Silicon Valley woke up last year
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:31,968	| IOT084 |	About Wi-Fi or maybe this year
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:35,808	| IOT084 |	You know we've been screaming and shouting about the importance of
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:39,648	| IOT084 |	Easy to setup Wi-Fi on importance of routers that look
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:42,976	| IOT084 |	So you not show them inside closets
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,256	| IOT084 |	Yes
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,280	| IOT084 |	And you guys also
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,560	| IOT084 |	Was it
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:49,888	| IOT084 |	Maybe not your first router but your second generation writer also
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:54,496	| IOT084 |	Doubled as kind of a home hub or you had other radios other than Wi-Fi in
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,080	| IOT084 |	That's correct the first one router
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,104	| IOT084 |	2012
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:01,152	| IOT084 |	I did not have a smart home hub
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:04,224	| IOT084 |	But we lost Almond Plaza
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,248	| IOT084 |	The next year
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,040	| IOT084 |	CES 2013
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:13,184	| IOT084 |	And that one did have zigbee and Z-Wave all integrated into the home and I think that's when
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,208	| IOT084 |	Right before that
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:16,256	| IOT084 |	Was Ben I was on your podcast
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,376	| IOT084 |	Giving your crazy perspective on this industry
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,168	| IOT084 |	Excited about the Smart Home
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,448	| IOT084 |	4
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,472	| IOT084 |	Just about as long as I have
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:29,312	| IOT084 |	Weird almost four years off from it so how do you think it's going
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,104	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:36,736	| IOT084 |	I'll talk about this from the Wi-Fi perspective and the smart home perspective I think
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:41,088	| IOT084 |	They are they are related but they are orthogonal in
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:41,600	| IOT084 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:44,416	| IOT084 |	Wi-Fi sign in
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:44,928	| IOT084 |	You know
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:48,768	| IOT084 |	Everyone's just realizing the importance of Wi-Fi in home
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:51,328	| IOT084 |	If you go back a decade
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:54,912	| IOT084 |	You just probably had a laptop that required
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,448	| IOT084 |	A wireless internet connection
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:00,544	| IOT084 |	And so that was just one device one or two devices
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:02,592	| IOT084 |	He told the homeowner laptops
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:04,384	| IOT084 |	At home
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,408	| IOT084 |	But today
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,432	| IOT084 |	You know
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:10,272	| IOT084 |	Yunnan Wi-Fi everywhere you need Wi-Fi in the living room
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,296	| IOT084 |	Bedroom
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:13,856	| IOT084 |	Front door because of these doorbell cameras
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,624	| IOT084 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:19,232	| IOT084 |	Your bathroom you know you're mostly Plano take their phones and iPads to the bathroom
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,768	| IOT084 |	Backyard
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:22,560	| IOT084 |	People like working from the backyard
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:24,864	| IOT084 |	Play
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,888	| IOT084 |	In
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:27,424	| IOT084 |	Just around your home
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,496	| IOT084 |	I read you can live without Wi-Fi sauce
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,264	| IOT084 |	Become
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,544	| IOT084 |	Really interesting
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:34,080	| IOT084 |	And I think the number of seniors
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,640	| IOT084 |	Average American household has about eight
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,408	| IOT084 |	Wi-Fi devices
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,480	| IOT084 |	You know what
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:43,808	| IOT084 |	Comcast actually at its most recent earnings last week
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,600	| IOT084 |	Said that they've got 11
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,648	| IOT084 |	Wi-Fi devices on average hanging out their Network
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,976	| IOT084 |	So that's might be the
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:54,560	| IOT084 |	American average and 11 we are at 16
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,096	| IOT084 |	Social Security index
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,632	| IOT084 |	I guess even hayatabad
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,424	| IOT084 |	So that's on the wife I said
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:02,496	| IOT084 |	Still Wi-Fi has become extremely critical
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,800	| IOT084 |	Piece of infrastructure at home you know it's like
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,568	| IOT084 |	Water and Electric
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:08,128	| IOT084 |	So on the smartphone side
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,408	| IOT084 |	Yeah things have been
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,712	| IOT084 |	A bit of a mixed bag I would say
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,016	| IOT084 |	What we learned a lot of things
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,808	| IOT084 |	Thanksgiving we were so early in there
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:17,088	| IOT084 |	And we learned that
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,392	| IOT084 |	The Hub
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,160	| IOT084 |	Is
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:22,208	| IOT084 |	But most consumers it's
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,488	| IOT084 |	It's a very abstract
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:28,352	| IOT084 |	You know it's not the way consumers think about purchasing products
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:30,400	| IOT084 |	Listen to smart home space
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,936	| IOT084 |	That's what we learned
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,472	| IOT084 |	And we've seen
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:35,008	| IOT084 |	The industry has seen
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:35,776	| IOT084 |	Sunray
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:38,592	| IOT084 |	Wine product successes lyrics cameras
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:41,920	| IOT084 |	Know some of the bulbs from Philips
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,432	| IOT084 |	But
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,504	| IOT084 |	Was difficult cell phone
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,784	| IOT084 |	As a consumer product
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:50,368	| IOT084 |	So what we're doing with some of our newer products has I guess
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,416	| IOT084 |	Integrating
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:54,464	| IOT084 |	Some more value into the Hub
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:58,048	| IOT084 |	It sounds like it's not just a hop that just talks to all these devices
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:02,144	| IOT084 |	That's one of the II is
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,936	| IOT084 |	This is going to be a long
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,704	| IOT084 |	Slog
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:05,984	| IOT084 |	In the smart home side
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:06,496	| IOT084 |	I think
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,032	| IOT084 |	You know there was
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:09,056	| IOT084 |	Way too much hype
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,336	| IOT084 |	In the industry
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:13,152	| IOT084 |	I think it's not going to grow as fast as
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,688	| IOT084 |	It was hyped up
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,456	| IOT084 |	But
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,224	| IOT084 |	Here is my analogy
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,784	| IOT084 |	If you compare the smartphone
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:20,832	| IOT084 |	With the Smart Home
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:22,624	| IOT084 |	When you purchase a smartphone
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,440	| IOT084 |	Everything out of one device
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:26,976	| IOT084 |	So you got your
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:30,816	| IOT084 |	Instagram or Facebook or messaging apps
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:35,168	| IOT084 |	Games whatever you do you got all the value
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:36,960	| IOT084 |	Through this one device
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:39,520	| IOT084 |	I think that's one of the big challenges
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,288	| IOT084 |	It's it's
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:44,896	| IOT084 |	Even if you have the money maybe you don't have the time
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:45,408	| IOT084 |	Because
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,736	| IOT084 |	A smartphone
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:51,040	| IOT084 |	You need at least a bunch of things at home
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:52,832	| IOT084 |	Connected
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:54,880	| IOT084 |	And then you start using
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:56,416	| IOT084 |	But no one wakes up
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,464	| IOT084 |	Besides
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,512	| IOT084 |	Change my washing machine.
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:05,632	| IOT084 |	50 lights and whatever one day at a time in a percentage
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,400	| IOT084 |	Who do that
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,192	| IOT084 |	But that's not the main
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:09,216	| IOT084 |	Extreme Behavior
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:12,544	| IOT084 |	Okay so yes Hardware transitions requiring
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:17,920	| IOT084 |	Many pieces of Hardware are definitely more difficult than buying hey I've got a phone I have upgraded my life
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:22,016	| IOT084 |	So do you think so that there is a challenge in
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:26,112	| IOT084 |	Marketing to Consumers so you talked about a hub being abstract
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:31,744	| IOT084 |	I actually think the whole concept of connected devices is a bit abstract for most people
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:34,816	| IOT084 |	That's why we've seen a lot of people purchase one off devices
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,864	| IOT084 |	Weather like oh
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:42,752	| IOT084 |	This doorbell I can see and understand what it does but when you say to your lights
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,288	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:47,616	| IOT084 |	How can you as a company that is trying to
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:49,920	| IOT084 |	Sell a hug maybe make these sort of
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| IOT084 |	Connections abidi
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:53,248	| IOT084 |	Yeah I agree a hundred
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,784	| IOT084 |	Percent that the
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:57,088	| IOT084 |	Hobbits to apps like today and maybe
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,112	| IOT084 |	Maybe Mike
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:58,624	| IOT084 |	Guesses
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,160	| IOT084 |	Maybe the whole hog
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:02,976	| IOT084 |	Concept is couple of years
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,256	| IOT084 |	Too early right now
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:06,048	| IOT084 |	Or maybe doesn't work at all
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,888	| IOT084 |	Serious
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,704	| IOT084 |	Multifunctional
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:16,032	| IOT084 |	Mainstream consumers I don't know
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,080	| IOT084 |	You're ever going to want to do any
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:18,592	| IOT084 |	This
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,128	| IOT084 |	It's possible
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:22,176	| IOT084 |	Very very likely I do think
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,224	| IOT084 |	One product that could change
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,552	| IOT084 |	My perception around this is the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:31,904	| IOT084 |	It is effectively a hub I mean it doesn't talk directly to all the devices at home but
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:36,512	| IOT084 |	You know I talked to a lot of the popular smart home devices today
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:37,792	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:40,608	| IOT084 |	I think that probably is what we'll get
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:41,632	| IOT084 |	Customers
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:47,008	| IOT084 |	Used to this concept of a hub and maybe that's what will make it less abstract
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,288	| IOT084 |	In the consumer space
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:53,151	| IOT084 |	So let's move on though because right now yet another thing that's coming against
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:55,455	| IOT084 |	Connected devices is
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:42:00,063	| IOT084 |	Security issues we can't stop talking about the Mirai botnet
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:06,463	| IOT084 |	Should we invade culprits in some of these security was our routers that you don't have hearts hard-coded
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:10,815	| IOT084 |	Passwords are the manufacturers didn't build onboarding processes that Force
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,351	| IOT084 |	Customers to change password
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:16,191	| IOT084 |	I'm curious what you think about all of this security
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:19,007	| IOT084 |	Drama here and then how you guys are
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:19,519	| IOT084 |	Thinking about address
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:25,663	| IOT084 |	Before I jump into that I just want to clarify one more part I have on the hubs and why I think
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,199	| IOT084 |	The knot
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT084 |	I think in a
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:32,575	| IOT084 |	When you go to Consumers directly yes it's been abstract but I do think
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:34,623	| IOT084 |	When you go through
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:35,647	| IOT084 |	Some interesting
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:39,999	| IOT084 |	Other channels like b2c maybe something like an ISP or even
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,535	| IOT084 |	Insurance companies
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:46,655	| IOT084 |	I'm actually makes more sense for them because from a Catholic perspective it's
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:50,239	| IOT084 |	A small one-time investment and they can keep adding capabilities
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,263	| IOT084 |	I think in the future
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:55,359	| IOT084 |	You mostly right now all of the smart home stuff is being
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,639	| IOT084 |	Either home security or
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:01,247	| IOT084 |	What's provided what what do you get on Amazon
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:03,551	| IOT084 |	So I do think as these channels make sure
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:07,391	| IOT084 |	I think Rob will have a very important role to play I just want to clarify that
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,927	| IOT084 |	So back to this idea of
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,207	| IOT084 |	Security
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,487	| IOT084 |	Yeah I think this is
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:15,327	| IOT084 |	Become Suddenly at an extremely mainstream issue
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:16,863	| IOT084 |	In the last couple of weeks
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,887	| IOT084 |	I do think
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:19,423	| IOT084 |	Lot of fun
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:20,447	| IOT084 |	The Fulton Industrial
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:22,751	| IOT084 |	Talking about
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:24,543	| IOT084 |	Security with.
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:26,335	| IOT084 |	You know we were all wondering about
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:28,383	| IOT084 |	I was going to hack my lights was going to hack my
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:31,455	| IOT084 |	My cameras are look at what's going on
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,247	| IOT084 |	That didn't happen
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:35,551	| IOT084 |	So they work some of these devices what hack
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,087	| IOT084 |	And it's strangely enough
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,879	| IOT084 |	Did not hack tool
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| IOT084 |	Mess up your lighting
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,183	| IOT084 |	They hacked
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:44,255	| IOT084 |	Mess up other devices in create an army of these
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:47,071	| IOT084 |	HotBox I guess so which is
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:47,583	| IOT084 |	We just kind of him
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,143	| IOT084 |	On the traditional
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:55,263	| IOT084 |	Thing that most of us were worried about when iot security first came out I thought that wasn't
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,031	| IOT084 |	Mustang
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:58,079	| IOT084 |	The second thing is yeah
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:02,431	| IOT084 |	The crazy thing is this whole heck happened because of default passwords and
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,199	| IOT084 |	And that's just
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:04,991	| IOT084 |	Get on
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:06,783	| IOT084 |	That's just crazy because
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:08,063	| IOT084 |	If we cannot
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:09,087	| IOT084 |	Get that right
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:12,415	| IOT084 |	I mean there are so many other things that can go wrong
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:15,231	| IOT084 |	Security certificates
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:17,535	| IOT084 |	You're much more advanced things
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:21,119	| IOT084 |	So I did not being encrypted
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,655	| IOT084 |	We are at the ready
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:27,007	| IOT084 |	Base level in terms of how poor the Securities with some of these devices it's just
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:29,055	| IOT084 |	I don't know it's just awful
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,615	| IOT084 |	So when you say we you mean the industry not secure
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:37,759	| IOT084 |	Oh yeah oh yeah so tell me what securifi what you guys do
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:40,063	| IOT084 |	What are the basics for security do you think
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:40,831	| IOT084 |	That a product should have
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:43,391	| IOT084 |	We were the first company
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:44,671	| IOT084 |	In back in 2012
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,743	| IOT084 |	Randomize every single Wi-Fi
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:49,023	| IOT084 |	SSID password
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:51,327	| IOT084 |	The admin credential
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,351	| IOT084 |	We were the first to do that
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:53,631	| IOT084 |	Nice
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:56,959	| IOT084 |	Yeah back then you know everyone Netgear and all these guys
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:44:59,775	| IOT084 |	You still just have the default name for the
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,055	| IOT084 |	Everyone up there
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,335	| IOT084 |	Devices
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:06,175	| IOT084 |	That's all very first week
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:08,735	| IOT084 |	If I was about to say
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:11,807	| IOT084 |	Thesis even back then was we still believe in that
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:15,903	| IOT084 |	Good security comes from good user experience
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,671	| IOT084 |	Youfit
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,975	| IOT084 |	Easy for customers to change passwords
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,023	| IOT084 |	If it's if they feel confident that
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,559	| IOT084 |	Okay
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:26,655	| IOT084 |	I can change it easily I can I can find the password at this place is Ali
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:29,215	| IOT084 |	They're more likely to change password
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:32,031	| IOT084 |	So you guys were the first two
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,567	| IOT084 |	Make default passwords
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:36,639	| IOT084 |	Easy to change so yeah good on you what else do you guys do
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,687	| IOT084 |	So we
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:42,271	| IOT084 |	Currently have no devices on your network
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:44,575	| IOT084 |	You can see you'll get a notification
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:48,159	| IOT084 |	That device joined your network
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,719	| IOT084 |	If it's a device that dinner
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:53,791	| IOT084 |	It's a neighbor trying to hop on the network and we have
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:55,071	| IOT084 |	Esophagus coming up
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:59,679	| IOT084 |	Very soon where it'll be a paid service where you'll be able to
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:01,727	| IOT084 |	Monitor some of the sites visited
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:04,287	| IOT084 |	It's going to be a basic service
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:05,823	| IOT084 |	Jessica less the
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:08,127	| IOT084 |	Sites initially but
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:09,151	| IOT084 |	Eventually we
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:12,735	| IOT084 |	We'll have more intelligence on it and we'll figure it out
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,271	| IOT084 |	Unusual pattern
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,575	| IOT084 |	So as an example
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,879	| IOT084 |	We'll have a service where you can figure out that
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:22,463	| IOT084 |	Your Nest thermostat is talking to service in Russia
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:24,767	| IOT084 |	So we think we are
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:25,535	| IOT084 |	Router
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:29,887	| IOT084 |	Can play a very significant role I mean it is going to be a firewall
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:30,655	| IOT084 |	Home
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:32,447	| IOT084 |	Got it okay well that's in
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:35,263	| IOT084 |	I assume your routers are updatable over-the-air
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:40,383	| IOT084 |	That's over there updates and then
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:47,039	| IOT084 |	You know we make the updates very easy you can just go.
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:49,855	| IOT084 |	You'll actually see a little notice on the Apple pay
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,647	| IOT084 |	Does a new phone battery
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,951	| IOT084 |	That's the second reality
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,487	| IOT084 |	Security
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,511	| IOT084 |	Contradict
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:47:02,911	| IOT084 |	What bugs are going to come out next year I mean this is something that manufacturers have to stay on top of
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:04,959	| IOT084 |	Because a lot of people say that
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:08,799	| IOT084 |	The reason that manufactures don't stand top of this in the
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:11,871	| IOT084 |	Traditional routing industry is because
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:14,943	| IOT084 |	These products are relatively cheap they send up they set him to forget him
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,991	| IOT084 |	When I buy a securifi
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,759	| IOT084 |	Device
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:21,599	| IOT084 |	How long is it going to be supported or how how do you think about the economic system porting
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,391	| IOT084 |	Continuous Security in
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:27,487	| IOT084 |	This is a challenge because there's always there
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:29,791	| IOT084 |	Download price per acre in consumer electronics
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:30,303	| IOT084 |	But
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:36,191	| IOT084 |	I think you'll have to beg him some of this online service cast into the hardware so that's
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,215	| IOT084 |	One way
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,007	| IOT084 |	On the 2nd
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:39,519	| IOT084 |	Is
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:43,103	| IOT084 |	We expect when we launched these monetize services like
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:46,431	| IOT084 |	The Internet Security offering that I just talked about it
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:46,943	| IOT084 |	Publix
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:48,479	| IOT084 |	It will go out
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:49,247	| IOT084 |	Next month
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:50,527	| IOT084 |	We think
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:52,831	| IOT084 |	Some of our customer base and convert to despot
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:56,927	| IOT084 |	I do think pandas have to think about baking and some of these cars
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:59,231	| IOT084 |	To give you a specific example of
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:00,511	| IOT084 |	How we deal with
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:02,303	| IOT084 |	Dalian Ramen was launched in
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:03,839	| IOT084 |	2012 July
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:06,143	| IOT084 |	And we still giving updates to it
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:08,959	| IOT084 |	Okay how do you account for things like that I mean
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:09,983	| IOT084 |	Let's say you have
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:13,567	| IOT084 |	I don't know ten thousand of those out there in the world and
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:16,383	| IOT084 |	It takes however many hours to develop
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:17,407	| IOT084 |	The patch for that thing
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:19,711	| IOT084 |	At some point in time
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:21,503	| IOT084 |	They are going to cost you money
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:24,575	| IOT084 |	It is that the point in time when you say hey it's like if I'm a phone
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:29,183	| IOT084 |	Like a payment Apple or Google I'm like a certain point I just don't support it anymore
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,487	| IOT084 |	So it's a good question
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:34,303	| IOT084 |	I think by one good thing now is
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,583	| IOT084 |	Because
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:39,167	| IOT084 |	Our customers download the app when they set up the product
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:41,727	| IOT084 |	At least they have that visibility into
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:44,799	| IOT084 |	We haven't reached that point yet with any of our products
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:47,359	| IOT084 |	Exped. Updating
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:48,895	| IOT084 |	Especially
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:49,919	| IOT084 |	Critical
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:52,991	| IOT084 |	Piece of infrastructure at home
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:56,063	| IOT084 |	But I think communication is the second thing one is
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:57,343	| IOT084 |	Security updates
EDL	00:48:57,343	00:48:59,647	| IOT084 |	We kind of think of them as mandatory
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:01,183	| IOT084 |	II
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:01,951	| IOT084 |	Suppose you
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:02,719	| IOT084 |	Dell customer service
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:05,279	| IOT084 |	Maybe
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,559	| IOT084 |	Resale Hardware
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:09,119	| IOT084 |	The industry needs to think about
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:10,655	| IOT084 |	Okay we're going to support this
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:16,287	| IOT084 |	Hardware for X years maybe that's the sort of thing we have to come into
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:17,567	| IOT084 |	My guess is
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:21,151	| IOT084 |	Sonic FTC is going to look into something like this
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:21,919	| IOT084 |	In the future
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:24,223	| IOT084 |	They are thinking about it
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:24,991	| IOT084 |	Fatso
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:25,759	| IOT084 |	Act now Russ
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:31,391	| IOT084 |	So let's look at these Services because this is another really kind of
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:34,207	| IOT084 |	Interesting Trend that we're seeing develop which is
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:36,255	| IOT084 |	Delivering Wi-Fi and itself
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:37,279	| IOT084 |	As a service
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,047	| IOT084 |	Or
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:42,399	| IOT084 |	Delivering services like security or something on top of WiFi
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:43,423	| IOT084 |	So
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:50,335	| IOT084 |	Talk to me about that that's a big shift for consumers I think it might be a big shift for vendors to so can you talk
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:51,871	| IOT084 |	About why this is happening
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:53,663	| IOT084 |	Auto
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:54,943	| IOT084 |	Call it a new thing at all
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,479	| IOT084 |	Because we were
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:57,759	| IOT084 |	In the USA
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:59,551	| IOT084 |	You always had the modem fee
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:00,063	| IOT084 |	Service
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:02,111	| IOT084 |	Right we just always have it
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:03,135	| IOT084 |	But yes there is
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:04,415	| IOT084 |	But almost all of us now have
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:06,719	| IOT084 |	Yeah so that's
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:09,535	| IOT084 |	That's the service I don't know I guess it's
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:12,095	| IOT084 |	Anywhere from $2 to $45
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:13,887	| IOT084 |	What's a $7 now
EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:15,423	| IOT084 |	How it's a cash cow
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:16,703	| IOT084 |	Oh wow that's
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:22,079	| IOT084 |	So goodbye at your own router
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:26,687	| IOT084 |	But less than that you can get a basic almond for less than that
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:27,455	| IOT084 |	I think
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,015	| IOT084 |	What you'll see it perhaps is
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:31,039	| IOT084 |	Some of these
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:32,319	| IOT084 |	Isvs could give out
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:38,207	| IOT084 |	Better remote and charge I don't know 12 instead of 7
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:39,231	| IOT084 |	Okay
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:42,815	| IOT084 |	And now if I has pee start doing this
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:49,215	| IOT084 |	This kind of shrinks your Market in a sense because people will your customer base with them become isps
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:50,495	| IOT084 |	Supposed to direct-to-consumer
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:52,799	| IOT084 |	Yes that is actually
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:57,407	| IOT084 |	It's it's a long-term Trend by the way in the US and rest of the world as well
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:57,919	| IOT084 |	Where
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:00,479	| IOT084 |	Most gateways today are
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:02,271	| IOT084 |	Given out by a species
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:04,575	| IOT084 |	Not purchased through retail stores like
