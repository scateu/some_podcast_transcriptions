EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:19,712	| IOT028 |	Hello Kevin
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:26,624	| IOT028 |	Hello hello and I should doing the show with a different set up to them I'm on an iPad using Skype instead of a full
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:27,136	| IOT028 |	Computer
EDL	00:00:27,904	00:00:29,696	| IOT028 |	So guys make sure you complain
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,464	| IOT028 |	And if you don't like the way cabins
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:33,280	| IOT028 |	I will change anything but we do value your
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:35,328	| IOT028 |	So much that we don't show
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:38,912	| IOT028 |	All right
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,936	| IOT028 |	So with that
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:41,472	| IOT028 |	Now that you know how valuable your
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:42,752	| IOT028 |	Feedback is please
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:43,520	| IOT028 |	Keep sending us to Europe
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,824	| IOT028 |	Will move right into the show.
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:46,592	| IOT028 |	Because a lot
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:47,360	| IOT028 |	Has happened this
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:51,200	| IOT028 |	This week was just amazing both from the consumer and the
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:52,736	| IOT028 |	Lookout the developer side
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:54,272	| IOT028 |	Philips Hue launch day new home
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:56,576	| IOT028 |	Let's talk about that
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,344	| IOT028 |	Nest
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,112	| IOT028 |	The
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:58,880	| IOT028 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:00,416	| IOT028 |	Country formerly known as
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,184	| IOT028 |	Google's nest
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:03,744	| IOT028 |	Adjust Nest launched it's weave
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:06,304	| IOT028 |	Platform which is not the same as Google's
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:07,072	| IOT028 |	Of course not
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,608	| IOT028 |	They just have the same name
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:11,168	| IOT028 |	And Amazon
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:14,240	| IOT028 |	Is set to launch its iot cloud
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,520	| IOT028 |	Did Microsoft actually launched
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:18,080	| IOT028 |	So where to stick with big names
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,616	| IOT028 |	On the show
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:21,664	| IOT028 |	And we'll see how far we get with all the
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:23,200	| IOT028 |	So let's start with
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,224	| IOT028 |	My favorite
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:25,248	| IOT028 |	My Bob's
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,808	| IOT028 |	The Hue Bridge
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,856	| IOT028 |	So Kevin why don't you tell us
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,624	| IOT028 |	Let's run down the Hue Bridge
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,416	| IOT028 |	Well sure there's
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:36,000	| IOT028 |	I went to a ton to tell here it's a brand new Hue Bridge
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:37,024	| IOT028 |	You have the old one
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:41,120	| IOT028 |	Yours is already updated congratulations still works obviously but
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:43,936	| IOT028 |	The new one actually is homekit certified
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,216	| IOT028 |	It will cost $60
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,520	| IOT028 |	If you do have the older
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,056	| IOT028 |	Kubrick's like I do
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,080	| IOT028 |	You can
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:52,384	| IOT028 |	Get the new one at a 33% disk
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,920	| IOT028 |	The $40
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,712	| IOT028 |	I believe that this is
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,504	| IOT028 |	Either now available or ready for
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,784	| IOT028 |	Order pre-order
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,880	| IOT028 |	And the deal on the $40 price tag for previous customers
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:06,464	| IOT028 |	That's actually a November 1 to December 31 deal so
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,512	| IOT028 |	I found that kind of odd I guess they want to get new
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,048	| IOT028 |	Customers first with the with unit
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,376	| IOT028 |	But the big deal here is yet home kit
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,912	| IOT028 |	Meaning you can say
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,936	| IOT028 |	I won't say it
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,984	| IOT028 |	I want to stop iPhones but you can ask
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,776	| IOT028 |	Siri to turn on lights
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,336	| IOT028 |	Adjust the brightness to colors
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:25,664	| IOT028 |	Turn on multiple lights to receives and so on so that's
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,944	| IOT028 |	That is the Q news
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,248	| IOT028 |	Stacy I'm kind of
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,296	| IOT028 |	Myths that some of these
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:31,808	| IOT028 |	Products
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,856	| IOT028 |	We're going to have homekit
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:36,416	| IOT028 |	And then we all have to re-buy them in a sentence
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,208	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,744	| IOT028 |	Let's hold that thought for a little bit
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,024	| IOT028 |	Because we're going to talk about
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,048	| IOT028 |	Cuz I'm I miss
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:45,632	| IOT028 |	But there's a couple more things we should know about
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,656	| IOT028 |	And that is
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:51,008	| IOT028 |	1 your old Hue bridge is still going to be updated and supported
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| IOT028 |	What software
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,568	| IOT028 |	So if you're
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:57,664	| IOT028 |	Not planning on moving to homekit don't worry you can keep your existing Hue Bridge
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,688	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,480	| IOT028 |	That deal did Kevin mention
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,272	| IOT028 |	Jennifer existing Hue Bridge owners
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,296	| IOT028 |	To do one upgrade
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,344	| IOT028 |	Spanish while supplies last
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,624	| IOT028 |	So November 1st
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| IOT028 |	They want to not wait till
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,696	| IOT028 |	If the middle of December.
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| IOT028 |	Jump On It
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,488	| IOT028 |	Jump On It
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,768	| IOT028 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| IOT028 |	The
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,048	| IOT028 |	Hue Bridge
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,096	| IOT028 |	If not only
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:20,448	| IOT028 |	Support homekit it's actually going to support Google's new Nest protocol
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,216	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,240	| IOT028 |	It's going to have
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,264	| IOT028 |	Computer inside
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,800	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,336	| IOT028 |	It's worth noting these things
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| IOT028 |	Just because
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,128	| IOT028 |	This is doing two things
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,664	| IOT028 |	One is updating
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,480	| IOT028 |	Kind of for the homekit protocol
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,552	| IOT028 |	But it's also adding a lot more functionality such a
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,832	| IOT028 |	Just kind of that cloud backup
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,416	| IOT028 |	About so some of the commands that you have on your
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:44,000	| IOT028 |	Obviously won't get remote access but some of the scheduling and things like that Uke
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| IOT028 |	Can actually now get
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,816	| IOT028 |	Without going out to the cloud
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| IOT028 |	So Kevin
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| IOT028 |	You might appreciate that
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,424	| IOT028 |	The other thing is that
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,728	| IOT028 |	You know it's going to support the nest weave protocol
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,776	| IOT028 |	We should probably talk about this a little bit
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| IOT028 |	That's going to make a lot more sense
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,592	| IOT028 |	Come back and talk about upgrade
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,616	| IOT028 |	Psycho
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,664	| IOT028 |	With that in mind
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:02,944	| IOT028 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,480	| IOT028 |	So hear the details
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,504	| IOT028 |	What this is
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,600	| IOT028 |	This is not the same thing is Google's we've protocol that they talked about
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,112	| IOT028 |	Who's this summer
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,904	| IOT028 |	This is totally
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,696	| IOT028 |	Wipro
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,256	| IOT028 |	Which is a kind of like
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,791	| IOT028 |	Qualcomm's alljoyn
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,815	| IOT028 |	Device to device
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| IOT028 |	Is protocol
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,119	| IOT028 |	Except it's not sourced
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,911	| IOT028 |	By the way y'all
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:26,751	| IOT028 |	Google is now officially Google and the rest of the company alphabet
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,543	| IOT028 |	That happened
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,335	| IOT028 |	This is a device device protocol
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:36,479	| IOT028 |	It's got a couple things that works on 64GB of ram so it's design for small sensors in Micro Control
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,039	| IOT028 |	Of all the way up to larger things
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| IOT028 |	It has its own security baked
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:44,159	| IOT028 |	And it is designed for anything that works with nest
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,463	| IOT028 |	So you have to apply to nest
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,231	| IOT028 |	To work
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,023	| IOT028 |	With this protocol in to get access
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,583	| IOT028 |	Let's do it basically it is a mesh Network
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,351	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,399	| IOT028 |	And it controls like how a device
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,679	| IOT028 |	Can talk to another device
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,983	| IOT028 |	And how a device knows what it is
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,495	| IOT028 |	Intuit can talk
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,799	| IOT028 |	System of the security features
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,311	| IOT028 |	AR
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,871	| IOT028 |	That because it knows what a device is
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| IOT028 |	It also says
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,407	| IOT028 |	What advice
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| IOT028 |	Talk to
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| IOT028 |	So washing machine
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,527	| IOT028 |	Example probably will never be able to talk to your door locks
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,575	| IOT028 |	Because Nest doesn't really see a great
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,087	| IOT028 |	Use case for the
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,623	| IOT028 |	So that's one of the
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,903	| IOT028 |	I think that's actually really a nice
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,975	| IOT028 |	I do to it at
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,023	| IOT028 |	I think that's a smart approach
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,303	| IOT028 |	Although this is
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:25,887	| IOT028 |	Sort of new for the rest of the World by understanding is correct
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:30,495	| IOT028 |	This is what nessa's been using for the past several years and it's just now that they're opening it up
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| IOT028 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,823	| IOT028 |	NASA's use this in a thermostat
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT028 |	And it says
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,615	| IOT028 |	Nest protect
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,639	| IOT028 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,943	| IOT028 |	Presumably
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,807	| IOT028 |	It also runs over the thread Wireless protocol that nest
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,575	| IOT028 |	Help develop
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,367	| IOT028 |	Samsung and smother chip companies
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,671	| IOT028 |	So that's kind of where this works
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,695	| IOT028 |	But here's
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,463	| IOT028 |	The Clincher
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,743	| IOT028 |	We've only works
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,255	| IOT028 |	In the nest
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,791	| IOT028 |	So what we got now
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:58,143	| IOT028 |	Device-to-device communication protocol and I'm not entirely clear because I have
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,959	| IOT028 |	Unseen it nor have I talked to any developers using it yet
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,239	| IOT028 |	How easy the system
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:07,359	| IOT028 |	So I'll join when I talk to developers about all Joe and they're like oh it's so easy diplomat
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,151	| IOT028 |	This couple lines of code you pop it on it
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| IOT028 |	It's time to here
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,199	| IOT028 |	I don't really know
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:13,503	| IOT028 |	So high I be curious to hear about that from
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:18,879	| IOT028 |	People who don't know even though they share the same name as how this is going to work with Google weave
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,391	| IOT028 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,415	| IOT028 |	Nobody knows
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,207	| IOT028 |	Message spoof app
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,255	| IOT028 |	I don't even know if Google's we even real actual
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,351	| IOT028 |	So that's what we know about that
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,887	| IOT028 |	Do you want to mention the
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,399	| IOT028 |	The first product
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,679	| IOT028 |	That's going to
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:37,567	| IOT028 |	I know it's not super exciting but yeah what is a partner
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:41,407	| IOT028 |	I guess you could call the works with Nest program now and
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,431	| IOT028 |	Don't be using
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,967	| IOT028 |	Nest weave with their
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,735	| IOT028 |	Linus
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,015	| IOT028 |	Connected lock which is
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,295	| IOT028 |	Giant
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT028 |	Keypad
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,623	| IOT028 |	It's like a oblong and
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,159	| IOT028 |	Inset different
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,487	| IOT028 |	Password combinations for people to get in get out
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:00,863	| IOT028 |	LG monitors when the doors open and close see who use the door that's assuming everybody uses differ
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,375	| IOT028 |	Passcodes
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:07,775	| IOT028 |	Panda it's interesting but we see this before I just want to make sure cuz it is something that's going to work with Google's
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,311	| IOT028 |	I'm sorry with nest
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| IOT028 |	With next week
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,871	| IOT028 |	But it won't be out until
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,223	| IOT028 |	And I think partly that's because
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,527	| IOT028 |	Going back to see what net said I think
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,575	| IOT028 |	You know they made the announcement now
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,647	| IOT028 |	They're actually not opening up next week until next year
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,183	| IOT028 |	Oh I thought it was just a
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| IOT028 |	I
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| IOT028 |	Do not think so
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,791	| IOT028 |	But I could be
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:35,935	| IOT028 |	Wrong song official Nest blog posters that says we've been using it meaning we've in Nest products for years
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,215	| IOT028 |	And next year
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,263	| IOT028 |	Will be opening up to everyone who wants to make a K'nex
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,543	| IOT028 |	Home Products
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,335	| IOT028 |	So they're kind of pre announcing this week I guess
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| IOT028 |	More with the
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,639	| IOT028 |	The pre-announcement
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,175	| IOT028 |	What we have
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| IOT028 |	Is we have
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,271	| IOT028 |	Weave protocol it's going to compete with things like I'll join
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:54,623	| IOT028 |	It will also compete with homekit because homekit is an application Level
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,647	| IOT028 |	Device to device
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,927	| IOT028 |	Ace Communications and security
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,231	| IOT028 |	And it will also probably
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT028 |	Compete with
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,791	| IOT028 |	Whatever is coming from the ioc if
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,327	| IOT028 |	People are actually using ioc
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| IOT028 |	So we got
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,631	| IOT028 |	A bunch of different ways now
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,655	| IOT028 |	Devices
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,727	| IOT028 |	So this is our worldview
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:14,335	| IOT028 |	Now and now we're actually sort of having products now that homekit has actual products
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| IOT028 |	Coming out
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,151	| IOT028 |	And I guess next next you will have
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,175	| IOT028 |	Weave products
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,199	| IOT028 |	Coming out okay
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,735	| IOT028 |	Now we should talk about Philip
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,039	| IOT028 |	Because this is kind of
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| IOT028 |	This bridge
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,575	| IOT028 |	Is kind of
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| IOT028 |	I think the beginning of possibly
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,903	| IOT028 |	A lot of decision making
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,183	| IOT028 |	I think that we're going to have to go through
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| IOT028 |	As early adopt
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,791	| IOT028 |	People who listen to the show are probably going to so
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:37,119	| IOT028 |	This weekend I started retrofitting my house for
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,143	| IOT028 |	Home Care
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,447	| IOT028 |	And next week we'll be talking about that
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,495	| IOT028 |	But I'm kind of looking at this
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,007	| IOT028 |	What I'm like God
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,055	| IOT028 |	Am I going to buy the Philips
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,335	| IOT028 |	Am I going to upgrade my
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,615	| IOT028 |	Guess I have to
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,151	| IOT028 |	It's kind of part of my job
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,711	| IOT028 |	So but I I look at this and I
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,735	| IOT028 |	Not really excited
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,527	| IOT028 |	Plaza
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,343	| IOT028 |	I feel like the discount is is good
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:01,439	| IOT028 |	Right and I feel like telling promising customers that they're going to
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,743	| IOT028 |	Support you know the older version
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,535	| IOT028 |	Hopefully for as long as I can
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,303	| IOT028 |	Is good
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| IOT028 |	But I don't
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,119	| IOT028 |	See an end yet
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,911	| IOT028 |	To the need to update
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| IOT028 |	Your physical
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,703	| IOT028 |	Hardware
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,983	| IOT028 |	Because we haven't
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,007	| IOT028 |	Yet achieved
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| IOT028 |	Some kind of status
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| IOT028 |	I don't think we got
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,407	| IOT028 |	So unless you're willing to like
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,175	| IOT028 |	Purchase
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,967	| IOT028 |	And we haven't even achieved like
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,759	| IOT028 |	Unification on hubs
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,271	| IOT028 |	You know
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:33,695	| IOT028 |	So I'm worried that if I tell someone gosh you know update your Philips Hue Hub and then you'll be good to go
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,463	| IOT028 |	Really telling them
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,255	| IOT028 |	You know spent 40 bucks on
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,023	| IOT028 |	40 bucks
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:43,423	| IOT028 |	Sir 60 bucks on this device and you know maybe in two years you're going to have to do it again or maybe I'll just have to buy a router that does
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| IOT028 |	So this hopefully next
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:49,567	| IOT028 |	That's the problem that would work we got His Radio spread out all over the place
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:53,919	| IOT028 |	Personally I don't even want the Hue Hub nothing against the product or the company
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,199	| IOT028 |	It's just I need this
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,503	| IOT028 |	Bridge for the specific brand of Lights
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,575	| IOT028 |	And yeah I know I control other lights are the two but
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,623	| IOT028 |	I can control other lights with other hubs
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,927	| IOT028 |	Get up for me to use my wink with the Q
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,463	| IOT028 |	I still have to have both
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,255	| IOT028 |	The wink Hub and
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:08,767	| IOT028 |	Hue Bridge
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,047	| IOT028 |	Where is
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,583	| IOT028 |	I can just use the wink Hub with
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,119	| IOT028 |	Pretty much any other line I want
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,143	| IOT028 |	It's all
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,911	| IOT028 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,959	| IOT028 |	I don't want to add more hubs and more
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| IOT028 |	Bridges
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,287	| IOT028 |	More radios inside of
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,847	| IOT028 |	Of these things you know it's kind of crazy
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,383	| IOT028 |	So yeah so I'm sitting here thinking
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,431	| IOT028 |	Do I stop recommending the Hue Lights
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:31,551	| IOT028 |	Because now I feel like we're still too early in the game you know we've gotten
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,367	| IOT028 |	I can't in good conscience now tell you
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,183	| IOT028 |	You're never going to have to update + now you're still stuck
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:40,255	| IOT028 |	I can in good conscience tell someone to go out and buy a house
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:44,863	| IOT028 |	Cuz I feel like if you spend like I can I can in good conscience tell someone to go by $100
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:49,215	| IOT028 |	At least you can control a whole bunch of devices and if you have to go into an update
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,495	| IOT028 |	To another hundred dollar hub
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,055	| IOT028 |	Write because by that time you probably a few
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:58,175	| IOT028 |	If you filled up your home system you probably got you know maybe a dozen different devices that you're controlling with that hub
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,223	| IOT028 |	So you were lying on its own
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,735	| IOT028 |	You know so much
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:05,087	| IOT028 |	Just for your life I mean you could say while you're controlling up to 50 like
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,879	| IOT028 |	I'm also a little disappointed
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,415	| IOT028 |	Because the The Bridge update
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,207	| IOT028 |	Still only let you go
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:10,975	| IOT028 |	Control 50 lights
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,511	| IOT028 |	Which
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| IOT028 |	That's not it I have more than two
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| IOT028 |	What's in my history
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,351	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,119	| IOT028 |	I'm kind of like
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,655	| IOT028 |	You beat up your husband you
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,727	| IOT028 |	So and I'm not try it this has become dealer
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:27,871	| IOT028 |	Let's stop attacking you for a second and let's let's go to something like
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:32,991	| IOT028 |	The ecobee thermostat for example cuz they did did thermostat upgrade to homekit
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:38,111	| IOT028 |	You know what you would just bought a ecobee that wasn't homekit certified was their rationale for
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,879	| IOT028 |	Updating
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,463	| IOT028 |	And we're about to see a bunch of other homekit products at the market
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:48,095	| IOT028 |	Because they're chip inside there's two legitimate question like there's going to be a homekit enabled Chamberlain Mike
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,631	| IOT028 |	And I look at that and I'm like
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| IOT028 |	Crikey
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:54,495	| IOT028 |	I'm going to have to replace my you know the door sensors going to be fine but there's a
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:58,335	| IOT028 |	The Hub so don't know how did it start 20-30 bucks or whatever it is
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:01,407	| IOT028 |	Yeah and so they're going to have to replace the admin have to replace
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| IOT028 |	That
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,967	| IOT028 |	That's actually device I love and use Allah
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| IOT028 |	So I'm like
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| IOT028 |	Dang it yeah I mean
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,111	| IOT028 |	I'm taking the approach of
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,415	| IOT028 |	Trying to keep things simple and
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:16,255	| IOT028 |	Control the most or the broadest range of devices with a single
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,279	| IOT028 |	Hub system
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,095	| IOT028 |	I know it's not your favorite but for me right now that's the wink
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,655	| IOT028 |	I would consider switching over to SmartThings which
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:25,471	| IOT028 |	Probably will not get homekit support
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,751	| IOT028 |	They don't know why they're not
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| IOT028 |	I mean Alex is said that
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,055	| IOT028 |	He doesn't like that
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| IOT028 |	It's not opening
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:37,247	| IOT028 |	You know what the Mikey was going over to SmartThings eventually and I'm obviously I'm going to test the
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| IOT028 |	Homekit
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,295	| IOT028 |	System because that's my job
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,087	| IOT028 |	I'm like
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,903	| IOT028 |	Yeah my husband has an iPhone I don't
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:47,231	| IOT028 |	I really see no need in my house currently I'm like
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,279	| IOT028 |	What's the best way to go cuz
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,815	| IOT028 |	I really don't want to update on my device
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,095	| IOT028 |	Say the other thing
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,399	| IOT028 |	Chairs that kind of comes to play at least for me is
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| IOT028 |	Google can I can live without homekit and saying
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,775	| IOT028 |	Siri do this do that because I'm already telling
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,311	| IOT028 |	My Amazon Echo to do those things
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,103	| IOT028 |	Right but you can't tell the Amazon Echo Dot
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,919	| IOT028 |	Garage garage
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,687	| IOT028 |	He could now
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,735	| IOT028 |	I cannot tell the Amazon
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,759	| IOT028 |	Echo
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,783	| IOT028 |	So Chamberlain
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,295	| IOT028 |	MyQ
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,831	| IOT028 |	Is connected through the
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,111	| IOT028 |	But Amazon
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,135	| IOT028 |	Echo Dot
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,439	| IOT028 |	They don't support you okay so
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,975	| IOT028 |	Right so coraggio
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:25,375	| IOT028 |	I said I oh but garageio actually does now as of this week have Amazon Echo support so the more things that glom onto that please
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,167	| IOT028 |	Deco for for boys
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,679	| IOT028 |	I'm fine with that
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:28,959	| IOT028 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,775	| IOT028 |	We'll see so maybe we'll get some and I should note
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,311	| IOT028 |	Because they send me emails all the
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,591	| IOT028 |	Ivy
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,359	| IOT028 |	Which
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,895	| IOT028 |	I have not tested
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,711	| IOT028 |	But was an early voice activated
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:40,991	| IOT028 |	Many many moons ago
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,295	| IOT028 |	They've actually launched in 99 dollar
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,575	| IOT028 |	Competitor the echo
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,367	| IOT028 |	Poet ivivi
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,647	| IOT028 |	So it's a
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,927	| IOT028 |	Kickstarter Indiegogo
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,975	| IOT028 |	Eucerin Indiegogo
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,023	| IOT028 |	Ivy has launched an Indiegogo
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:53,791	| IOT028 |	And there
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,071	| IOT028 |	Trying to raise money
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,631	| IOT028 |	The pre-order it for $99 and it's
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,423	| IOT028 |	It's kind of like an Amazon
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,727	| IOT028 |	Echo type device for this with thing
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:08,127	| IOT028 |	I haven't tried it but it let you control your nest it does let you get Spotify which I'm kind of intrigued by
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:14,527	| IOT028 |	But I don't know if I purchase it only worth looking at if you're interested thing it works with Hewitt with Lowe's Iris it works with SmartThings
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,807	| IOT028 |	So that is
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:19,647	| IOT028 |	Yeah I remember when they first announced that it was probably two or three years ago
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:22,463	| IOT028 |	It's taking awhile to get things moving here but
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,487	| IOT028 |	Well this is a new one
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,023	| IOT028 |	So the other IV was a
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,303	| IOT028 |	Smart Alarm
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,375	| IOT028 |	So this this is a new
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,399	| IOT028 |	Version of ivy
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,423	| IOT028 |	Iv2
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:31,935	| IOT028 |	It's kind of
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,215	| IOT028 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:38,079	| IOT028 |	Yes baby too it looks
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| IOT028 |	Kind of I don't know how to do
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,639	| IOT028 |	Looks like a microphone
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,151	| IOT028 |	Phone stand without
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,991	| IOT028 |	You're smaller than the echo I mean it definitely smaller
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:45,759	| IOT028 |	House speaker
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,111	| IOT028 |	Yeah I mean it's a
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,415	| IOT028 |	Lesser price Amazon Echo like device
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| IOT028 |	I don't think it's going to happen
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,791	| IOT028 |	Broadest ecosystem available to its setting when compared to the echo
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:00,095	| IOT028 |	Probably not but you know
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| IOT028 |	For now it's got
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,399	| IOT028 |	The same sort of
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,447	| IOT028 |	Send a lot of the big
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,471	| IOT028 |	Programs like nest
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:11,871	| IOT028 |	Austin smart things are actually and even that cold makes their ecosystem open so if you're a small developer you can just
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,151	| IOT028 |	Just throw your resources at the
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,711	| IOT028 |	Those those companies to make your stuff work with it
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,015	| IOT028 |	So that's it let's move on to
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,295	| IOT028 |	What kind of sunless
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:23,903	| IOT028 |	Tell me Focus stuff and more kind of developer oriented in big kind of brand
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,695	| IOT028 |	Cloud. Which is
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,231	| IOT028 |	At AWS
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,047	| IOT028 |	Reinvent the Amazon web services,
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,583	| IOT028 |	It announced
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,631	| IOT028 |	A iot service
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,167	| IOT028 |	Stuntin done
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT028 |	Is joining
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,751	| IOT028 |	Microsoft and IBM
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,031	| IOT028 |	And Salesforce and
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,799	| IOT028 |	Send a Lot ad
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,079	| IOT028 |	African fan
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:44,127	| IOT028 |	Julian other companies in launching
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,431	| IOT028 |	Basically an SDK
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| IOT028 |	And kids
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:51,039	| IOT028 |	That will allow a developer directly to their cloud
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:51,807	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:56,159	| IOT028 |	The cloud platform that Amazon is offering is built on its acquisition of telemetry
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:16:01,279	| IOT028 |	From back in March which is the mobile kind of device management and monitoring side and
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:04,095	| IOT028 |	A data analytics platform that Amazon is building
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| IOT028 |	Called Space Needle
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| IOT028 |	This is a little bit
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,983	| IOT028 |	Pre-entry because we're recording this on Tuesday and
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,031	| IOT028 |	Amazon is expected to announce this on
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,055	| IOT028 |	Thursday
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:13,823	| IOT028 |	But
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,615	| IOT028 |	We've got it on pretty good authority
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,407	| IOT028 |	But all this is happening because we haven't
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,943	| IOT028 |	New season
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:25,343	| IOT028 |	Memos that Amazon sent out partner soups
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:28,671	| IOT028 |	So I'm curious to see what the impact is for them
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,951	| IOT028 |	Because more interesting
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| IOT028 |	I think
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,511	| IOT028 |	So aw is had to do
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,327	| IOT028 |	Because you know everybody and their dog has
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,119	| IOT028 |	McLeod play for
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT028 |	Iot
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:43,007	| IOT028 |	But more interesting lie is so many of the connected services today already hosted on a
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,055	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,103	| IOT028 |	You know Alice Petsense yeah
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,663	| IOT028 |	So ala electric imp
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,967	| IOT028 |	Particle which used to be
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,527	| IOT028 |	Spark actually offer kind of development
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| IOT028 |	Kits
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:58,367	| IOT028 |	And cloud services which is exactly what Amazon is
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,135	| IOT028 |	What kind of building in
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| IOT028 |	I'm putting together here
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:03,743	| IOT028 |	So these companies all offer that but they host their Cloud portion of that
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,767	| IOT028 |	On AWS
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,559	| IOT028 |	So in a way
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:09,119	| IOT028 |	You know Amazon's kind of cutting into their business
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,655	| IOT028 |	But most of them
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:14,495	| IOT028 |	Aren't credibly worried because they're like you know we're already acting as a system
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,775	| IOT028 |	Integrator for our customers
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,567	| IOT028 |	Some of the stuff we offer
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| IOT028 |	Is
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,639	| IOT028 |	You know we offer some Amazon stuff we
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:24,479	| IOT028 |	Pulling some other stuff that Amazon doesn't offer for our clients so hopefully
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,295	| IOT028 |	I'll stick with us there they're pretty nonchalant about it
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:27,807	| IOT028 |	If your smoker
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:32,671	| IOT028 |	That'll be the dead horse but I think wink is an AWS customer
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,255	| IOT028 |	Swing hesitated because they went down
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,023	| IOT028 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,583	| IOT028 |	Dropcam used to be a huge AWS
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,911	| IOT028 |	Customer I don't know if they've moved yet over to Google but
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,191	| IOT028 |	I would imagine movie
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,495	| IOT028 |	I don't know because the last time I checked into
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| IOT028 |	This was about
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,287	| IOT028 |	6 months ago
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| IOT028 |	They had
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,335	| IOT028 |	It's a pretty big operation
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,663	| IOT028 |	Because they react built for AWS
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,199	| IOT028 |	It's a pretty big operation
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,711	| IOT028 |	Pictures of all of your info
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,527	| IOT028 |	Moving a cloud it's not easy
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:02,623	| IOT028 |	Exactly they're not as vaporous and light as you might think
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,135	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,671	| IOT028 |	With that
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:08,255	| IOT028 |	That's kind of some of the big news happening in the cloud this week
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,071	| IOT028 |	You guys should stay tuned because we are talking
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,607	| IOT028 |	With Alexandra
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,375	| IOT028 |	DeShawn
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,143	| IOT028 |	Sunset
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,191	| IOT028 |	Who is the creator of The Goodnight Lane
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,727	| IOT028 |	Camp and she and I are talking
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,751	| IOT028 |	About actually
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,775	| IOT028 |	Consumerism
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,055	| IOT028 |	And The Internet of Things
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,871	| IOT028 |	Said how this is leading us to buy more stuff
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,919	| IOT028 |	Maybe not a sustainable stuff
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,735	| IOT028 |	And what we can probably do about that for hubs
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:33,855	| IOT028 |	More hugs yes that is actually we we talked about Phillips so please stay tuned
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:45,119	| IOT028 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the iot podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and I'm here with Alex
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,655	| IOT028 |	Sandra deschamps
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:47,679	| IOT028 |	Who is with
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:50,495	| IOT028 |	Design swarm and iot consultant
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,055	| IOT028 |	Hi Alex how are you doing today
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,847	| IOT028 |	I'm very well how are you
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,359	| IOT028 |	I am
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,919	| IOT028 |	It is but the mid-afternoon where I am
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:03,039	| IOT028 |	Yeah I'm in London and it's raining what a surprise
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,831	| IOT028 |	It's always raining when I text
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,159	| IOT028 |	Geez Louise
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:14,047	| IOT028 |	We have to live up to expectations otherwise people will be at confused and actually want to live here
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,071	| IOT028 |	And then they'll be more of us
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,167	| IOT028 |	No wonder you guys got the
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:23,007	| IOT028 |	What was it the umbrella that tells you when it's whatever lights up when it's about to rain
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:26,079	| IOT028 |	People that came out of a London design firm
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,639	| IOT028 |	You're right I think it was California actually
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,431	| IOT028 |	Nuts
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:33,503	| IOT028 |	Which is also why it makes so little sense
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,783	| IOT028 |	Because in California
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,063	| IOT028 |	In England and it would make no sense
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:40,671	| IOT028 |	Because you need it all the time where is in California it actually would make sense
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:43,999	| IOT028 |	Because it's you know something you need to really be reminded of
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,511	| IOT028 |	There you go
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| IOT028 |	Just have a glowing umbrella
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,143	| IOT028 |	Okay so
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,447	| IOT028 |	I brush and the podcast here be
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,215	| IOT028 |	Because
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,263	| IOT028 |	Actually been on the podcast before
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| IOT028 |	To talk about
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,079	| IOT028 |	A product that you've designed how the good night lamp
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,871	| IOT028 |	And you should probably
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,639	| IOT028 |	Briefly tell
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,175	| IOT028 |	People with a good night lamp is
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,967	| IOT028 |	Just established that you know what you're talking about
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,271	| IOT028 |	Why don't you
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:06,783	| IOT028 |	Do that now
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:11,135	| IOT028 |	So the goodnight lamp is a family of internet-connected lamps
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,671	| IOT028 |	Big lamp Little lamp
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,207	| IOT028 |	You give the little ants away
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,743	| IOT028 |	To anybody around the world
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,535	| IOT028 |	And when you turn the big lamp on the
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,559	| IOT028 |	Once turn on
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,607	| IOT028 |	And the idea is very simple is
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:24,703	| IOT028 |	It's a very simple way of saying I'm around right now and I'm available
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:27,519	| IOT028 |	So when you have family members in different time zones
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:32,383	| IOT028 |	You're dating someone in another country or your grandmother lives on her own
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,687	| IOT028 |	It's just a simple way of knowing
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,199	| IOT028 |	The people are around
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,247	| IOT028 |	And I
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,527	| IOT028 |	I have been working on this
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,551	| IOT028 |	For 10 years now
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,319	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,599	| IOT028 |	Now on sale
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| IOT028 |	In the UK
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,135	| IOT028 |	Are you going
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:48,511	| IOT028 |	I know it's been a long journey I've always liked this concept because it's kind of like an ion status message
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,863	| IOT028 |	Search in the real world for people who maybe aren't great at I am status
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:55,167	| IOT028 |	Yeah and I think
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,983	| IOT028 |	People also would probably people 10 years
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,519	| IOT028 |	Younger than both of us
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,847	| IOT028 |	Struggled even know what an ion status message is but
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,615	| IOT028 |	I think
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:08,223	| IOT028 |	The way mature people can't explain it is also kind of us a bat signal or
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,015	| IOT028 |	Facebook
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,063	| IOT028 |	Online or offline status
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,367	| IOT028 |	Made made RioLearn
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:18,720	| IOT028 |	Major physical and I like that I like that people can always
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:22,304	| IOT028 |	Pics of technology that they associated with this idea of them
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,352	| IOT028 |	The most closely and it means that
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,632	| IOT028 |	Even after 10 years
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,424	| IOT028 |	Do something people get rich
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,728	| IOT028 |	So we're not here to talk
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,008	| IOT028 |	Which is
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:31,776	| IOT028 |	Kind of a shame
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,288	| IOT028 |	Because I really love
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,360	| IOT028 |	We're actually here because you went on
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,408	| IOT028 |	You were quoted in a website
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,200	| IOT028 |	I think
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:45,088	| IOT028 |	You called it like a real estate blog which I'm kind of like oh okay is part of their maker Monday serious
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,112	| IOT028 |	Talking about
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,136	| IOT028 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,208	| IOT028 |	And you talked about how we're going to be buying the internet
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,024	| IOT028 |	And this is something I've been thinking about a lot
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,792	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,328	| IOT028 |	I wanted to talk to you about
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,120	| IOT028 |	How are we going to be
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,632	| IOT028 |	Buying
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:05,312	| IOT028 |	I wasn't in a particularly I think you know feisty mood the day they interviewed me
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,336	| IOT028 |	I guess
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,408	| IOT028 |	The Sting I'm really wondering about
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:16,576	| IOT028 |	10 years into a career talking about the internet of things and seeing other people do the same
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:19,648	| IOT028 |	And Building Things and making things is
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:22,464	| IOT028 |	I worry a little bit about
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:26,816	| IOT028 |	With which we can now make things into the world
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| IOT028 |	In a way
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,912	| IOT028 |	How little people care about things
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:35,264	| IOT028 |	Now I think that's our appetite for physical
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:35,776	| IOT028 |	Products
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,056	| IOT028 |	Has increased
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,616	| IOT028 |	Tenfold and we certainly
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:46,016	| IOT028 |	Don't care about them as much as we used to I think there's maybe a very small number products that we
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:49,344	| IOT028 |	We could consider pulling from the fire if our house was on fire
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:51,904	| IOT028 |	And I think that number of
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,184	| IOT028 |	Products is probably
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| IOT028 |	Very slim now
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:58,048	| IOT028 |	If you'd asked people what they might buy for
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| IOT028 |	Christmas Bell have a
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:22:59,840	| IOT028 |	Particular
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,120	| IOT028 |	Idea and
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,144	| IOT028 |	We're trying to
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:05,472	| IOT028 |	Cater to that I think I'm making connected things and work
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,496	| IOT028 |	Trying to connect
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,264	| IOT028 |	To a world
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,824	| IOT028 |	It really likes to buy things
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:16,992	| IOT028 |	And I'm not sure that's a reason enough to actually build things but I think that's the reason that people are using in order to be
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:23,136	| IOT028 |	Building in this interview you said that the iot will be a mechanism for people to take electronics into a space that's new
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:29,792	| IOT028 |	In order to keep up with the hype of consumerism that we've been experiencing since the end of the second World War
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:32,864	| IOT028 |	I think of it as kind of this mentality of
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,912	| IOT028 |	You know put a chip in it
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,192	| IOT028 |	And will charge you know
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,496	| IOT028 |	10x the price or maybe it's
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,776	| IOT028 |	Only three or four
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,544	| IOT028 |	Surprise
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:43,360	| IOT028 |	And I look it even what I've done in the last
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,128	| IOT028 |	Couple of years
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:44,896	| IOT028 |	Switches
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,664	| IOT028 |	You know I've
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:48,224	| IOT028 |	I spent $500 replacing to thermos
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,272	| IOT028 |	And I've gotten a lot of value
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,808	| IOT028 |	That's what I'm not
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,320	| IOT028 |	The first to do
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,344	| IOT028 |	But
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,880	| IOT028 |	When I
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:57,952	| IOT028 |	I did that a couple years ago and now the next generation of those
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,048	| IOT028 |	Suddenly I'm faced with the fact that I have put Hardware
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:05,120	| IOT028 |	Connected Hardware on my wall that's going to be supported
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,656	| IOT028 |	But it's also
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,472	| IOT028 |	Dunes kind of an obsolescence cycle
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:11,520	| IOT028 |	I'm kind of like
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,288	| IOT028 |	Man
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:16,896	| IOT028 |	I really just do that because I don't know if in five or six years I'm going to really
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,688	| IOT028 |	Want to replace my thermostats again
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:21,248	| IOT028 |	Especially at 250 bucks a pop
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,576	| IOT028 |	Yeah it worse is they used to be Things That No One
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| IOT028 |	Really replace
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:29,184	| IOT028 |	You know you you wouldn't even install your own thermostat
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,000	| IOT028 |	It's actually illegal in the UK to do that
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:37,376	| IOT028 |	Did these desert infrastructural products that we're just that they were infrastructure
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,912	| IOT028 |	Where is now they've become
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,680	| IOT028 |	Consumer
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:43,008	| IOT028 |	And they become part of the consumer landscape
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,800	| IOT028 |	Desire
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:47,616	| IOT028 |	And sales and Edom
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,176	| IOT028 |	It is that planned off the obsolescence of
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| IOT028 |	People have
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:54,528	| IOT028 |	Worked out in the car industry and worked out in
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:55,808	| IOT028 |	Turn the fashion in
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:59,392	| IOT028 |	And now we're working that out for everyday products
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| IOT028 |	Which is the
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,696	| IOT028 |	Problematic
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,488	| IOT028 |	Do you think it's
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:06,560	| IOT028 |	Is nefariousness planned obsolescence or do you think
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,096	| IOT028 |	It's really value I mean
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,144	| IOT028 |	Do you think we're getting value-add
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,680	| IOT028 |	I mean I would argue that
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:14,240	| IOT028 |	A nest thermostat on an ecobee thermostat does
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT028 |	Offer
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,056	| IOT028 |	You know significant power saving
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,872	| IOT028 |	Yes and no in Chinese
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:23,968	| IOT028 |	You know it could be interesting to kind of look at whether
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,248	| IOT028 |	You will have
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:27,296	| IOT028 |	Received 250
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,832	| IOT028 |	Dollars worth of savings
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:32,672	| IOT028 |	In how long in between replacing it again
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,464	| IOT028 |	And then having the Next Generation
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,000	| IOT028 |	Timeout I think the
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,792	| IOT028 |	Every two to five years
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,328	| IOT028 |	Kind of okay I suppose
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:44,448	| IOT028 |	But I kind of apple style upgrade of every 6 months is a new thing
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| IOT028 |	I think it's
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:48,288	| IOT028 |	Just really really aggressive consumerism
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,056	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,104	| IOT028 |	If you have made a product
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,128	| IOT028 |	Well enough
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,408	| IOT028 |	2
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,688	| IOT028 |	Provide value
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,456	| IOT028 |	For your quest
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:58,272	| IOT028 |	I think your first customers should always be the ones
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,040	| IOT028 |	State you
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,320	| IOT028 |	Really cherish the most
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,880	| IOT028 |	Supposed to make them feel like they're
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,904	| IOT028 |	Lefton
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:06,720	| IOT028 |	Stranded because they happen to have the older version
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,000	| IOT028 |	I don't
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:10,304	| IOT028 |	Thanks that we necessarily know how to
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,840	| IOT028 |	Buildings in that way
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,864	| IOT028 |	I'm really
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,888	| IOT028 |	Generally kind of
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| IOT028 |	Pretty
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,424	| IOT028 |	Intrigued
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,448	| IOT028 |	Spy
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,472	| IOT028 |	2 Cycles
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,520	| IOT028 |	Switch very well-funded
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,544	| IOT028 |	Iot company
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:24,128	| IOT028 |	So I'm calling startups when they have millions and BC
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,176	| IOT028 |	Iot companies are
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,712	| IOT028 |	Expecting to grow
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:30,528	| IOT028 |	Because I think that the pressure is on them
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| IOT028 |	Really
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,320	| IOT028 |	Show
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,856	| IOT028 |	Aggressive sale increases
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:39,744	| IOT028 |	And the only real way to do that is to imitate the Apple model even when not a relationship
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,792	| IOT028 |	Ever develop with a
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,072	| IOT028 |	A thermostat but
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| IOT028 |	You know
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,864	| IOT028 |	Let's go let's
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,632	| IOT028 |	Triad
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,168	| IOT028 |	Let's try to make it feel like
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:53,568	| IOT028 |	Consumer product just like any other consumer product that we have just like our phones have contracts and our laptop
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,592	| IOT028 |	Dogs get old and
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,896	| IOT028 |	Let's just do all that stuff away and replace
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,176	| IOT028 |	Well there's a
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,712	| IOT028 |	Whole bunch therapist
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,736	| IOT028 |	What kind of impact
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,784	| IOT028 |	First of all I think 2 to 5 years
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,552	| IOT028 |	For thermostat is
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:07,136	| IOT028 |	Well I I would prefer it to be tender
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,904	| IOT028 |	15 but
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:13,280	| IOT028 |	I think that if you told a company that is has told their shareholders
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,840	| IOT028 |	That they are going to have a hockey stick graph and
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:16,864	| IOT028 |	Terms of sales
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,680	| IOT028 |	And they will realize how
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,960	| IOT028 |	Smaller Market is
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:22,240	| IOT028 |	And then
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:25,312	| IOT028 |	Just aggressively sound to that same Market over and over again
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,616	| IOT028 |	Okay I see like
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,408	| IOT028 |	If you think about it thermostat
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:32,224	| IOT028 |	So if you look at nest with popular example right
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,016	| IOT028 |	Set Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,552	| IOT028 |	Looking at maybe
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,576	| IOT028 |	15 year
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,880	| IOT028 |	Replacement cycle on a thermostat seems
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,904	| IOT028 |	Kind of reasonable
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:44,768	| IOT028 |	Maybe with the protect smoke detectors have like a mandated life on them
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,584	| IOT028 |	Permasense our perspective so it's about
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,608	| IOT028 |	I think seven years
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:51,680	| IOT028 |	You're so five to seven years on that and then you got cameras
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,752	| IOT028 |	There you've got an opportunity
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:57,056	| IOT028 |	I feel like cameras you probably don't replace
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:00,896	| IOT028 |	Is that a 5-year thing I'm curious what the numbers were
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,920	| IOT028 |	Could be on a replacement site
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,480	| IOT028 |	And then you could always come
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:04,992	| IOT028 |	Gets people to add
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,808	| IOT028 |	So maybe your strategy for hockey
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,088	| IOT028 |	Growth is a
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,672	| IOT028 |	Maybe you're not a one device company maybe you become
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,184	| IOT028 |	Multi-Device
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,464	| IOT028 |	Company with different
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,512	| IOT028 |	Cycle so that's one strata
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:17,792	| IOT028 |	Product for
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,376	| IOT028 |	But then there's this idea of the electronics themselves
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,656	| IOT028 |	Because
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,960	| IOT028 |	Most of these companies will have a Services Drive
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:28,032	| IOT028 |	And those services are going to increase in
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,568	| IOT028 |	Computing or
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:33,408	| IOT028 |	Maybe different radios all kinds of different things over time is
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,688	| IOT028 |	The environment changes
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,480	| IOT028 |	Infermon Electronics perspective
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,040	| IOT028 |	You know I think every two years
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,368	| IOT028 |	It's kind of not crazy to think you're going to want to update the hardware
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,904	| IOT028 |	Where and I don't know is a hardware person
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,464	| IOT028 |	Dealt with that even in your own product
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,768	| IOT028 |	What are your thoughts about kind of
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,304	| IOT028 |	How to handle some
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:57,216	| IOT028 |	Well I think what brought me to this conclusion to begin with is work to
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,008	| IOT028 |	This line of thinking too
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,800	| IOT028 |	What is the realization
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,848	| IOT028 |	10 years ago there were things that
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,896	| IOT028 |	Wyndham tee product design
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,176	| IOT028 |	Sphere people were discussing
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,480	| IOT028 |	Got completely dropped
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,040	| IOT028 |	Partly I suppose
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:14,880	| IOT028 |	Juju iPhone coming in and things like that but
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:17,440	| IOT028 |	People used to talk about design for disa
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:17,952	| IOT028 |	Assembly
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,000	| IOT028 |	Cradle to cradle
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,792	| IOT028 |	And things like that and
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,560	| IOT028 |	Concept
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,328	| IOT028 |	Spell applied
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:27,680	| IOT028 |	Two looking at the products that you were making in a way that made it
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:29,984	| IOT028 |	Easy to disassemble take apart
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,520	| IOT028 |	Replace the right piece except
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,824	| IOT028 |	When you're talking about a product
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| IOT028 |	Where the casing
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,712	| IOT028 |	Could be at the electronics could be replaced and upgraded
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,760	| IOT028 |	The tendency for Mom
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,576	| IOT028 |	The product company now is not to say
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:48,160	| IOT028 |	Will you can send us back the old one will replace the guts
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,464	| IOT028 |	For the new with the new tag
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:51,744	| IOT028 |	And we'll
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,280	| IOT028 |	Just give you back at one
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,048	| IOT028 |	It's not even an option
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,584	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,400	| IOT028 |	Your you know whatever upgrades
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:00,960	| IOT028 |	You might need to do from a hardware perspective
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:01,984	| IOT028 |	I think
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:07,872	| IOT028 |	If you're doing a good job you should be planning for your Hardware at that last
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,408	| IOT028 |	Longer than
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:15,808	| IOT028 |	The software upgrades that you need to do which you know will need to happen firmware updates things like that you've talked about
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:22,208	| IOT028 |	This concept of owning the customer relationship and who has the responsibility for owning that relay
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:22,976	| IOT028 |	Relationship
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:26,816	| IOT028 |	Can you talk a little bit more about what that will mean for
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| IOT028 |	Connective life cycle of a
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,376	| IOT028 |	Prada
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:31,168	| IOT028 |	And how you think about designing
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,448	| IOT028 |	And also
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| IOT028 |	Does that mean that
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:39,360	| IOT028 |	Models like Tesla's where they actually own the customer relationship start to make
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,128	| IOT028 |	More sense
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,920	| IOT028 |	Yeah I think I have
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:44,736	| IOT028 |	Having a relationship with customers directly when you
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,248	| IOT028 |	Spelling
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:46,528	| IOT028 |	Very high-end
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,296	| IOT028 |	Cars made
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,064	| IOT028 |	Text a huge amount
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:51,904	| IOT028 |	You're building a relationship with someone you're really cares about what you're doing
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:55,488	| IOT028 |	And the luxury Market really knows how to do that
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:57,792	| IOT028 |	If you want to buy from
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:01,632	| IOT028 |	Chicken luxury Brands you can only really buy from them they don't really do stalkers
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:04,192	| IOT028 |	They Don't Really deal with anybody else
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:07,008	| IOT028 |	And certainly for a long time even Apple
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,800	| IOT028 |	Don't have that they were you know there was
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,592	| IOT028 |	A very small presence
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,104	| IOT028 |	Reseller
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| IOT028 |	Stool is really
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,688	| IOT028 |	Stores in their own brand
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,992	| IOT028 |	It's more easy to find apus
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,760	| IOT028 |	Products now
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| IOT028 |	Elsewhere
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:22,112	| IOT028 |	The ownership of that relationship is one that I think
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,392	| IOT028 |	2
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,928	| IOT028 |	Little attention is your tooth
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,720	| IOT028 |	Put on when you're talking about
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,512	| IOT028 |	Consumerism because really
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,584	| IOT028 |	Brands of most
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:35,168	| IOT028 |	Products hoping you never call them back when you
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,448	| IOT028 |	I need to dispose of
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,216	| IOT028 |	Something
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:41,824	| IOT028 |	They put that responsibility onto the recycling services that cities
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:42,848	| IOT028 |	Will have
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:43,872	| IOT028 |	Certifier
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:47,200	| IOT028 |	And the responsibilities always someone else's responsibility
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,480	| IOT028 |	Ability but
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| IOT028 |	I think
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:53,344	| IOT028 |	And this is sort of what kicked off this whole line of thinking which led
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,136	| IOT028 |	How to talk I gave
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,184	| IOT028 |	Two stalks I gave and then this article
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:32:01,536	| IOT028 |	It's going to be I think as of this year it's illegal in New York to
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,328	| IOT028 |	Throwaway electronic gadgets
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:06,144	| IOT028 |	Until we're kind of entering a world where
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:11,008	| IOT028 |	End-of-life and every single little thing that might have been free once is
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,824	| IOT028 |	Actually not free because it has huge
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,592	| IOT028 |	Impacted
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:18,688	| IOT028 |	And I think that we are aware of how much impact
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,712	| IOT028 |	We can have when we work
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:22,016	| IOT028 |	Technology how much the web has changed
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| IOT028 |	The way
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,832	| IOT028 |	People interact with the things that they love
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:28,416	| IOT028 |	And I think that we should have that same
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,720	| IOT028 |	Sense of responsibility and ethics
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,488	| IOT028 |	In
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,256	| IOT028 |	Product
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,792	| IOT028 |	And Design
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,816	| IOT028 |	Products assertive
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,096	| IOT028 |	Traditional industrial design
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,144	| IOT028 |	Sort of has been baked in
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,424	| IOT028 |	But
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,448	| IOT028 |	A lot of iot
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,216	| IOT028 |	Startups or not
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,008	| IOT028 |	Traditional industrial designer
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,288	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,104	| IOT028 |	It's a whole new population
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:49,152	| IOT028 |	People that needs to be told about
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,688	| IOT028 |	Basic environmental print
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:53,504	| IOT028 |	Okay and so outside of the
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:58,624	| IOT028 |	Let's get back into this kind of idea of how people might buy
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:32:59,648	| IOT028 |	Kind of connected
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:02,208	| IOT028 |	Gadgets over time because
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:03,488	| IOT028 |	I have kind of
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,536	| IOT028 |	I don't know if it's a frustration or its
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,072	| IOT028 |	It's kind of all just using example
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:10,400	| IOT028 |	Philips just let earlier this week actually
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:12,960	| IOT028 |	Talked about how it just announced
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,496	| IOT028 |	An upgraded hub
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:17,568	| IOT028 |	For homekit and kind of the new Nest weave
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,336	| IOT028 |	Protocol
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:20,128	| IOT028 |	Sell Philips Hue Lights have a
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,432	| IOT028 |	Do they have a bridge
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,200	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,968	| IOT028 |	All of your
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| IOT028 |	Philips Hue Lights
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:30,880	| IOT028 |	Continue to work with your existing bridge if you have it but if you want it to work with homekit you're going to have to upgrade to
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,648	| IOT028 |	To this
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,184	| IOT028 |	Newbridge and
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:38,304	| IOT028 |	It's a $60 the new bridge is $60 or it comes down to about 40 bucks if
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,584	| IOT028 |	If you are an existing
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:41,632	| IOT028 |	Philips Hue owner
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,400	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,216	| IOT028 |	And I'm kind of curious because I'm an existing Phillips
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:45,984	| IOT028 |	What's yuan
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,496	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,288	| IOT028 |	I'm very glad that they're go
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,824	| IOT028 |	Continue supporting my old bridge
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:53,408	| IOT028 |	But I'm also kind of like and appreciate the discount
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,176	| IOT028 |	Upgrade
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:56,480	| IOT028 |	And I understand that there's a hardware
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,272	| IOT028 |	Upgrade required to get to
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,600	| IOT028 |	What is an early adopter I'm also
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,904	| IOT028 |	Gosh dang it y'all
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:06,976	| IOT028 |	Now I got to go out and spend 40 bucks on a brand new bridge
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:13,376	| IOT028 |	When there's a new standard coming out of my got going to have to get a 2 years from now spend another $40 when does this
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,144	| IOT028 |	Send
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,424	| IOT028 |	What kind of products
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:17,216	| IOT028 |	Make sense to do this for
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,264	| IOT028 |	Do I have to upgrade everything in my house cuz you know
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:24,896	| IOT028 |	Earlier this summer I was going to have to if I wanted a home kit in my ecobee thermostat has to have to buy a brain
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,408	| IOT028 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,712	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,272	| IOT028 |	I don't know I am kind of feeling a little
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:32,320	| IOT028 |	I don't know early adopters commonly face
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:36,416	| IOT028 |	What's with the Internet of Things it feels like it's still so unfinished
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,696	| IOT028 |	I don't even know what to tell people
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,512	| IOT028 |	Yeah yeah I think
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,328	| IOT028 |	We're going to suffer from kind of Bridge Creek
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:44,608	| IOT028 |	Really really
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:47,424	| IOT028 |	Especially for things that really
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:49,728	| IOT028 |	Are perfectly fine on their own
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,776	| IOT028 |	Really when you think about it because
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,312	| IOT028 |	Having a bridge for your light bulbs
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:54,848	| IOT028 |	Raise
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,920	| IOT028 |	Having a bridge for like a very important piece of
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:00,224	| IOT028 |	Computer only having a router for
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,504	| IOT028 |	Your computer makes sense
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,576	| IOT028 |	But yeah kind of mini bridges for everybody
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,856	| IOT028 |	Interoperability needs
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:06,880	| IOT028 |	Is
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:10,464	| IOT028 |	Probably you know something that will eventually decide
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:13,280	| IOT028 |	Disappear when they just start making better
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,584	| IOT028 |	Amor multitek
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:16,096	| IOT028 |	Routers
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,144	| IOT028 |	But before we get there in
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:21,472	| IOT028 |	Before Cisco decides to build such things at an affordable price
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:23,008	| IOT028 |	To wait and have
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,032	| IOT028 |	Languages
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,848	| IOT028 |	I do think that early adopters
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:30,176	| IOT028 |	We're in the phase and we're going to do the face in the face of
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:34,784	| IOT028 |	Early adoption for a long time with iot I don't think that we
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,064	| IOT028 |	Are going to
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:36,576	| IOT028 |	See
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:37,856	| IOT028 |	Mask
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:40,672	| IOT028 |	Consumer appeal and in these ideas
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:43,744	| IOT028 |	Until they really feel very excessive
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,792	| IOT028 |	I think people are starting to
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:49,120	| IOT028 |	How to build a vocabulary around them and just in the way that
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,400	| IOT028 |	10 years ago when I was
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,960	| IOT028 |	I was presenting the good night lamp people used to tell me
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,008	| IOT028 |	Is that the time it was a wifiber
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:57,568	| IOT028 |	People used to tell me oh Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:58,848	| IOT028 |	Doesn't that fry your brain
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,128	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,152	| IOT028 |	That's just
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:03,456	| IOT028 |	Change in society and
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,224	| IOT028 |	Constant
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:04,736	| IOT028 |	Inconstant
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,552	| IOT028 |	Education on the part of the text
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:08,832	| IOT028 |	With respect
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,368	| IOT028 |	To the benefits rather than the pitfall
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,904	| IOT028 |	And
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:14,720	| IOT028 |	I have no idea whether Wi-Fi fries my brain but I've stopped caring about
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,256	| IOT028 |	Answer to
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,280	| IOT028 |	The job was done
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,048	| IOT028 |	Adequately
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,072	| IOT028 |	And I think that
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:22,144	| IOT028 |	With iot we're going at we're talking about so many different
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,424	| IOT028 |	Competing
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:23,936	| IOT028 |	Technologies
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:26,240	| IOT028 |	That people will
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:29,312	| IOT028 |	By the end-user application that they find is interested
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,360	| IOT028 |	And then realized
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:31,872	| IOT028 |	Stats
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,432	| IOT028 |	Something that they will have to
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:34,944	| IOT028 |	To suffer for
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,248	| IOT028 |	Because they got into
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:38,016	| IOT028 |	Just did a little
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:38,528	| IOT028 |	Kitsune
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,600	| IOT028 |	I don't think I can
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:44,672	| IOT028 |	Traditional product design work
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,440	| IOT028 |	Flatware
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,976	| IOT028 |	If you bought something
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,512	| IOT028 |	40 years ago cancer
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,280	| IOT028 |	This were
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,560	| IOT028 |	Dad yes they might be in
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:55,424	| IOT028 |	And you were more interesting version made out of a better plastic later on
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:59,008	| IOT028 |	But you didn't feel cheated by the first version if anything
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:03,104	| IOT028 |	Dad gained a bit more Authority because it was the first version
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:04,640	| IOT028 |	And I don't think that we've
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,176	| IOT028 |	Managed
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,944	| IOT028 |	Tudo Certo
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,736	| IOT028 |	Vintage iot
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:14,368	| IOT028 |	Simply because things are really just stopped working entirely I mean I have an Avast text somewhere in a box
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:18,976	| IOT028 |	Exposed it in my office for a little too long to
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:21,536	| IOT028 |	Sons of the Plastics really turned
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,304	| IOT028 |	Colors
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,584	| IOT028 |	And you know I should have sent
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,656	| IOT028 |	It hasn't even aged
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,936	| IOT028 |	Well as a product
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:28,960	| IOT028 |	Never mind as a
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:29,472	| IOT028 |	Connected
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,264	| IOT028 |	So
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,032	| IOT028 |	Yeah I think we'll
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,568	| IOT028 |	Will definitely still suffer
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:35,872	| IOT028 |	A little while
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,152	| IOT028 |	Will BVM canaries in
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,968	| IOT028 |	Buy what you like
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:40,480	| IOT028 |	But you will suffer
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,832	| IOT028 |	A wonderfully Grim way to end the conversation
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,112	| IOT028 |	And this podcast
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,648	| IOT028 |	So Alex thank you so much
