EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:06,816	| IOT111 |	You need to turn
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:12,448	| IOT111 |	There's just no way around it that we're probably going to say her name
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,984	| IOT111 |	Normally we are really polite
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:14,752	| IOT111 |	What is this week
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:15,264	| IOT111 |	Is not going to be that
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:18,848	| IOT111 |	We'll try not to say her name but boil boys can be tough
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,872	| IOT111 |	And I'm going to tell you right now
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:21,920	| IOT111 |	When we get to the gas segment
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:22,944	| IOT111 |	The guests were not as
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,712	| IOT111 |	It just got to me
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:24,992	| IOT111 |	It was too much
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:27,552	| IOT111 |	They were name dropping huh
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,064	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:29,600	| IOT111 |	Take this moment
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:32,160	| IOT111 |	I hit that like button if you got one year
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,440	| IOT111 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:34,464	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,000	| IOT111 |	Shall we get started
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| IOT111 |	We shall
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,072	| IOT111 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,608	| IOT111 |	So Kevin and I both
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,376	| IOT111 |	Try.
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,400	| IOT111 |	The Echo Show we should
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:43,424	| IOT111 |	But what it is for
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:49,824	| IOT111 |	Well just to clarify we didn't try the Echo Show we tried a feature that comes with Echo Show
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,616	| IOT111 |	Because the news is that
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:55,456	| IOT111 |	Amazon launched or introduced the Echo Show device which is a
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,736	| IOT111 |	Screen
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,272	| IOT111 |	With a speaker and
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,808	| IOT111 |	8 microphones
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:04,416	| IOT111 |	It will cost you $229.99 available black or white
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,720	| IOT111 |	It will be released on June 28th
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:13,120	| IOT111 |	And I should note that if you buy two Echo Show devices you can save $100 with a promo code
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:16,704	| IOT111 |	Amazon is posting it is show the number two
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,472	| IOT111 |	Pack
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:22,592	| IOT111 |	And you might want two of these because it has a new feature which we did try
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:26,176	| IOT111 |	Saying the called she who shall not be named
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:26,944	| IOT111 |	Calling
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,224	| IOT111 |	So it's video and voice
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,736	| IOT111 |	Calling
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:32,320	| IOT111 |	Yeah that's what it is one thing I think you
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| IOT111 |	Forgot
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,136	| IOT111 |	Show which
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,160	| IOT111 |	Probably will make a lot of pee
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,696	| IOT111 |	It has a camera
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:44,608	| IOT111 |	It hasn't always on camera in an always-on Mike that actually cannot be turned off physically it has to
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,376	| IOT111 |	2B only
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,656	| IOT111 |	It can only be turned off
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,168	| IOT111 |	Digitally
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,728	| IOT111 |	There's no physical shutter
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:50,752	| IOT111 |	On the camera
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:51,776	| IOT111 |	Interesting
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,080	| IOT111 |	I just threw that in there because
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,104	| IOT111 |	Cuz how would you do me a call
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,896	| IOT111 |	Without the video
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:02,272	| IOT111 |	This means we've got we talked about the other one last week but the echo look
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,296	| IOT111 |	Which is the
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,856	| IOT111 |	Hands-free selfie
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,488	| IOT111 |	The thing that were like
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,024	| IOT111 |	I ordered one
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:15,584	| IOT111 |	I could I could suddenly feel Washington
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:22,240	| IOT111 |	We tried the calling feature and just so you know everyone now if you have an echo device
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:26,080	| IOT111 |	You update if you update the app you're going to see a brand new app icon
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,360	| IOT111 |	On your phone
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:27,872	| IOT111 |	On your phone
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,664	| IOT111 |	Google Voice cloud
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,456	| IOT111 |	And you have the ability to
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| IOT111 |	You should see in your home screen
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,040	| IOT111 |	Conversations
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,576	| IOT111 |	And
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,624	| IOT111 |	That's going to let you set up the ability to
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,416	| IOT111 |	Use your Echo as a
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,440	| IOT111 |	I people
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,512	| IOT111 |	It doesn't do a video on the phone does it
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:49,376	| IOT111 |	Kevin and I just tried this in a brief interlude here inspired interlude
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:53,728	| IOT111 |	And what we discovered is that you cannot do video from
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,032	| IOT111 |	On the phone so this isn't going to compete with you know
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:57,824	| IOT111 |	Skype
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,592	| IOT111 |	Order
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| IOT111 |	Hangouts
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| IOT111 |	Duo or FaceTime
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,432	| IOT111 |	At least not yet
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,480	| IOT111 |	But what we did discover in
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,296	| IOT111 |	What I thought was kind of interesting as when Kevin called
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,576	| IOT111 |	My echos
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,368	| IOT111 |	All of my echos in my house when
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,392	| IOT111 |	Any calls me ring
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,208	| IOT111 |	And my phone rings
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:17,280	| IOT111 |	Now it'll be interesting is if I'm away from home
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| IOT111 |	What happens
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,631	| IOT111 |	Because my husband is also on our Echo
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,679	| IOT111 |	And
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,239	| IOT111 |	His number should be associated
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,519	| IOT111 |	It with this device so I'm like
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,311	| IOT111 |	Could he answer my phone calls from
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:33,663	| IOT111 |	That could be a minute is all tied to a phone number because when you set this up
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,991	| IOT111 |	You enter the your phone number into the app
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,271	| IOT111 |	And
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:42,367	| IOT111 |	It didn't send you a confirmation code so it ties or links your phone number to your devices
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,903	| IOT111 |	Great butt
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| IOT111 |	It also allows you to be in a house
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,975	| IOT111 |	So I'm
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| IOT111 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,303	| IOT111 |	I will try that
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT111 |	Be kind of
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:53,887	| IOT111 |	I don't have
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,935	| IOT111 |	My other household member has a job that is not
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,335	| IOT111 |	So the question then becomes Kevin
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:06,175	| IOT111 |	You of the Isle of the echo would you buy an echo
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:06,687	| IOT111 |	Did you buy
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,503	| IOT111 |	I did not
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:14,623	| IOT111 |	And the main reason is I think the biggest use case here and there multiple use cases
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,415	| IOT111 |	The biggest one is the video
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,695	| IOT111 |	Calling and
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,023	| IOT111 |	I have so many devices that already do that
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,791	| IOT111 |	Mean yes
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:25,119	| IOT111 |	I would say this is nice from a hands-free perspective
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,423	| IOT111 |	But I don't really
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:30,239	| IOT111 |	Again to have that use case I want to do have tablets with
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,031	| IOT111 |	Stan's in things that
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,311	| IOT111 |	In computers
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,615	| IOT111 |	I just don't need another way to make
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,151	| IOT111 |	These kinds of calls
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:43,295	| IOT111 |	However I do like the fact that the screen shows you you know flash briefing videos and
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,343	| IOT111 |	Weather and so on just like
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:49,439	| IOT111 |	If you have a Fire TV and use you know use the intelligent assistant
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:53,279	| IOT111 |	You get visuals of what you're asking about so it's kind of nice but
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:58,143	| IOT111 |	For $229 I'm not sure what this replaces for me it's why I didn't buy one
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:58,911	| IOT111 |	Got it
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT111 |	All right
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| IOT111 |	I may send you a
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| IOT111 |	Just for fun
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| IOT111 |	Listen I see
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,103	| IOT111 |	People infected in the marketing video for this
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:10,175	| IOT111 |	They're showing me no moms on the road calling on home
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:14,271	| IOT111 |	Talking to her daughter and the daughters grandfather who are working on a
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,855	| IOT111 |	You know school project together so Mom can check in and see
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,879	| IOT111 |	How it's all working
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,951	| IOT111 |	I can see people wanting to certain people but
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,719	| IOT111 |	Big enough for me
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:26,303	| IOT111 |	I thought the baby monitor like the look in on the babies
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| IOT111 |	Was kind of in
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:27,839	| IOT111 |	Interesting
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,375	| IOT111 |	Baby monitor
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,655	| IOT111 |	Because the babies are probably not
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,447	| IOT111 |	Aldo
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,983	| IOT111 |	What if your baby's first word was Alexa
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,103	| IOT111 |	What if your baby's name is that
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,407	| IOT111 |	I don't know
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:47,807	| IOT111 |	You right you right because this does like any other equity-based tie into all of the smart home goodies and things that we
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT111 |	Musicals for today
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,159	| IOT111 |	So yeah you can turn into if you know the camera
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:55,999	| IOT111 |	Of another show for example I would have imagined
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:00,095	| IOT111 |	Could I use it to look at a nest camera don't know
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,167	| IOT111 |	It does say that you can shut
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:08,031	| IOT111 |	It says she can show you the front door monitor baby's arm is compatible cameras from ring and Arlo for example
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,079	| IOT111 |	Well I don't know about
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,151	| IOT111 |	Then right but certain things
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,175	| IOT111 |	That's exactly
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,991	| IOT111 |	So you could have like your own security system
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,271	| IOT111 |	I like it
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:23,135	| IOT111 |	Okay lot of cool stuff Happening Here we will talk more about it in June
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| IOT111 |	When you get one
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,415	| IOT111 |	When I get one
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:28,511	| IOT111 |	I did only order one now I'm thinking I should have ordered two
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| IOT111 |	One for me and
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,303	| IOT111 |	One for Kevin
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,071	| IOT111 |	But you know
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,607	| IOT111 |	Find a friend on the internet
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,679	| IOT111 |	Are you my friend
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,727	| IOT111 |	Also
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:42,079	| IOT111 |	We should say that Microsoft is planning a home hub function for
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,615	| IOT111 |	Windows 10
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,895	| IOT111 |	Shooters
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,943	| IOT111 |	I'm okay with this even though
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,479	| IOT111 |	I feel like the market is
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,807	| IOT111 |	Yeah I mean so this is
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,111	| IOT111 |	Returning from The Verge who has
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,439	| IOT111 |	Some what they call internal documents that they
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,463	| IOT111 |	Obtained
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,303	| IOT111 |	To show how Microsoft's home hub all one word Capital H's
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,095	| IOT111 |	I will work
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,863	| IOT111 |	And
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,375	| IOT111 |	It's
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,751	| IOT111 |	To the ideas it's going to be a place where you can control your devices
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| IOT111 |	Where you can
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:15,103	| IOT111 |	Collaborate with family on calendars and such
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:21,247	| IOT111 |	I just don't really see it I don't see people using the PC for controlling smart home stuff
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,807	| IOT111 |	It's always got to be on you have to be in the home Hub app
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,855	| IOT111 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,623	| IOT111 |	I'm with you
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:30,463	| IOT111 |	The only time I'm in front of a PC or PC like devices when I
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,231	| IOT111 |	Working at my dad
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,559	| IOT111 |	Granite people have laptops
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| IOT111 |	How often
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:39,679	| IOT111 |	Now I open my laptop so rarely when I'm not quoting
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:40,959	| IOT111 |	Creating content
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,495	| IOT111 |	Register
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:52,479	| IOT111 |	Yeah for folks who are curious what the tentative plans are according to these documents support for hue
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,783	| IOT111 |	Nest insteon wink and SmartThings
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,599	| IOT111 |	Use Cortana of course for voice
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,391	| IOT111 |	Controls and such
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,415	| IOT111 |	I am just
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| IOT111 |	I'm not Jazz but
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| IOT111 |	Also
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,839	| IOT111 |	We have a really interesting
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,607	| IOT111 |	Start up
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,375	| IOT111 |	Coming out
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,655	| IOT111 |	It's called lighthouse
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,727	| IOT111 |	It's backed by playground Studios which is the
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,263	| IOT111 |	Adventure fund
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,055	| IOT111 |	But Andy Rubin
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,359	| IOT111 |	Of Android and Google Fame started
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,383	| IOT111 |	And also is like
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| IOT111 |	Is he psychic or danger
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| IOT111 |	Danger
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,015	| IOT111 |	We've had this conversation before
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:30,111	| IOT111 |	Sorry
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,671	| IOT111 |	The lighthouse is a new startup
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,975	| IOT111 |	And what they're building is a personal assistant
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,791	| IOT111 |	That has 3D sensing technology
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:43,423	| IOT111 |	That they built as part of the DARPA Grand Challenge and it lets you accurately distinguish
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| IOT111 |	People
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| IOT111 |	Embarrassed
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,007	| IOT111 |	Actions
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:51,103	| IOT111 |	And so what it does is it adds this layer of understanding
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,383	| IOT111 |	Both who's in the room
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,943	| IOT111 |	But then it also has a deep layer of understanding in it
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:59,039	| IOT111 |	So you can tell it very complicated things and it will actually do them
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| IOT111 |	So to make this
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,087	| IOT111 |	Real
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:05,439	| IOT111 |	You can tell it notify be at the babysitter doesn't get home
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT111 |	By 4
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,535	| IOT111 |	And think about all the tablet that will impact all this happening
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,095	| IOT111 |	So you just hold in plain English
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,631	| IOT111 |	A person that has to write
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,959	| IOT111 |	I'm your set a time so you've done kind of Summer
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,239	| IOT111 |	If this then that programming
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| IOT111 |	Location
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT111 |	And location
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,151	| IOT111 |	That's really freaking
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,663	| IOT111 |	Powerful
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:31,295	| IOT111 |	Well this is what the promise of a smart home is to me and if they can deliver that's great because
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:35,391	| IOT111 |	Very few devices and platforms are delivering
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,671	| IOT111 |	At this level yet
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:43,583	| IOT111 |	Yes we can take our existing assistance and we can tie our own if this then that recipes and so on to make this happen
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,399	| IOT111 |	But this is a native solution
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| IOT111 |	And
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,935	| IOT111 |	I
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:50,751	| IOT111 |	Suspected will work better but we'll have to see
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| IOT111 |	Exactly so but we won't see any time soon
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,591	| IOT111 |	Assume
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| IOT111 |	This is really expensive
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:03,295	| IOT111 |	This won't be available until September and when it is available
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:09,951	| IOT111 |	Getting a device is going to cost you $400 and that will include one year of the lighthouse intelligence
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| IOT111 |	Service
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:14,303	| IOT111 |	Look at that point your intelligence service cost $10
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:21,215	| IOT111 |	Right you could pay more Upfront for 99 to get 3 years of the service with the device
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:26,591	| IOT111 |	599 is an interesting bundle because you get 5 years of the television service
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,383	| IOT111 |	And the device
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,431	| IOT111 |	Well it says it renders the device free
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,247	| IOT111 |	Which makes me wonder is the device
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,015	| IOT111 |	599
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,319	| IOT111 |	I feel like the device is probably
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| IOT111 |	399
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| IOT111 |	Or thereabouts
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,671	| IOT111 |	I mean
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,463	| IOT111 |	That makes sense matter
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| IOT111 |	Exactly
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| IOT111 |	The cost of the Dubai
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,815	| IOT111 |	Nice cuz like this is one of those things that I actually
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,607	| IOT111 |	People may not love this
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:52,447	| IOT111 |	I like how they're trying to get people away from paying for a subscription if they want to pay more upfront
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:56,799	| IOT111 |	Doing something like this is going to require a lot of constant
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,359	| IOT111 |	Computing and support on the back end
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,663	| IOT111 |	So it makes sense that this is going to need
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| IOT111 |	Some kind of
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,783	| IOT111 |	Your subscription fee just to help pay short
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| IOT111 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,391	| IOT111 |	I'm pro-life idea of what they're doing here
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,927	| IOT111 |	Pro having a business model
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,279	| IOT111 |	I don't know if consumers are going to be stoked
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,071	| IOT111 |	I'm stoked about this but I'm a creep
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,839	| IOT111 |	Chongqing
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:23,935	| IOT111 |	So I don't know if real consumers are going to be stoked about this when
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,519	| IOT111 |	Make something like the echo is out there doing crazy things
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,055	| IOT111 |	True
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,335	| IOT111 |	Truing and you have
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:36,735	| IOT111 |	Developers that are climbing onto these different platforms that are readily available mainstream people have and they're always knew
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,039	| IOT111 |	Skills coming out a new intelligence and so on
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,831	| IOT111 |	One thing that might
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,367	| IOT111 |	Appeal to
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,671	| IOT111 |	People fought for the lighthouse device
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| IOT111 |	They say that
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:53,119	| IOT111 |	Lighthouse customers data is only viewable by the customers themselves and never by Lighthouse employees or part
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,423	| IOT111 |	That's a big deal
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,215	| IOT111 |	Oh so you can pay for
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| IOT111 |	For privacy
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,519	| IOT111 |	Which in a sentence
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,543	| IOT111 |	Is something
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,567	| IOT111 |	Is a thing
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:05,151	| IOT111 |	Yeah you know if you know what I see I see something like this getting
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,479	| IOT111 |	Is something like this would make home
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:09,759	| IOT111 |	Just
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,039	| IOT111 |	Miles better
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,855	| IOT111 |	Miles in apple already understands this they brought
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,879	| IOT111 |	What about the guys
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,391	| IOT111 |	Define Siri
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,695	| IOT111 |	IC
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,719	| IOT111 |	That's illogical
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,791	| IOT111 |	That's all right because I I don't see it actually
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,727	| IOT111 |	Speaking of Apple Apple
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| IOT111 |	If I accompany called
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,055	| IOT111 |	Barrett
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,639	| IOT111 |	Didn't see that one coming
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:39,199	| IOT111 |	I've never tried a bit it although I have I have
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:40,223	| IOT111 |	Graze
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| IOT111 |	Browse thank you
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:49,695	| IOT111 |	I think what scared you away from
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| IOT111 |	Bet it is
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,023	| IOT111 |	The technology that uses because you can't say it
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,303	| IOT111 |	Oh Kevin
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,583	| IOT111 |	Go for it I'll give you 10 points
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,399	| IOT111 |	Ballistocardiography
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| IOT111 |	10 points
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,703	| IOT111 |	Kevin
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:03,007	| IOT111 |	Yeah at the end of the show you'll have
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,311	| IOT111 |	I'll give you a trinket
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,591	| IOT111 |	Sure
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,431	| IOT111 |	Yes words are meaningless but I'm winning
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,735	| IOT111 |	Gamify all the things
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,527	| IOT111 |	What is ballistocardiography
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,343	| IOT111 |	Well I better get more points than 10
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:23,743	| IOT111 |	So it measures the mechanical activity of your heart lungs and other body functions which shall not go into detail what does MyPay
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,791	| IOT111 |	Because I've no idea
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,583	| IOT111 |	It's actually
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| IOT111 |	Along
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,119	| IOT111 |	Sensory thing
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,167	| IOT111 |	That you place under your mattress and it measures your
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:34,495	| IOT111 |	I'm very intrigued by this device but I've never been
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:42,175	| IOT111 |	So Apple bought it at this will be amazing
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,711	| IOT111 |	Data for
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,991	| IOT111 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:49,343	| IOT111 |	We don't always hear a lot about healthkit but you know the people I talk to you for using it
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:55,743	| IOT111 |	Researchers medical folks it's a very credible platform so having kind of granular sleep data
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| IOT111 |	Makes me feel like
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:58,815	| IOT111 |	This could really adalah
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,655	| IOT111 |	Makes me think that that is if you want
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:06,495	| IOT111 |	Really good sleep center might be the way to go cuz I'm assuming Apple that at all the other company
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,079	| IOT111 |	I can't I could see one other function that Apple would use
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:18,271	| IOT111 |	So every time they announce the new iPhone I have to get up at 3 in the morning to order it because that's when they order stuff on sale and Lease
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:18,783	| IOT111 |	Coso
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,087	| IOT111 |	Just a little alarm
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,135	| IOT111 |	Little little nudge for your bed
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,487	| IOT111 |	They work you that
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,279	| IOT111 |	Say that means by it
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| IOT111 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,375	| IOT111 |	Yeah that way there's no alarm feature vibraciones just a sensor
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,679	| IOT111 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:41,823	| IOT111 |	All right we also have this is kind of exclusive to us so we'll talk about it company that I followed for years
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,359	| IOT111 |	It's called you know me
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,919	| IOT111 |	Yonomi
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,943	| IOT111 |	And there
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:51,551	| IOT111 |	Consumers you can download it it connects to all kinds of things and
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,855	| IOT111 |	Establishes what it calls routines with
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,415	| IOT111 |	If this thing called applets or other companies called robots
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,231	| IOT111 |	But the idea is an in they do it automatic
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:04,095	| IOT111 |	So what they've done is they've created a product called that you know me thin cloud
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,887	| IOT111 |	In this isn't for consumer
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| IOT111 |	This is for
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,959	| IOT111 |	Manufacturers of
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:11,775	| IOT111 |	Connected devices especially those working in the smartphone
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,823	| IOT111 |	The first customer is Schlage
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,335	| IOT111 |	DJ Norm
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,943	| IOT111 |	Complete so you know me think loud is basically a way to
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,991	| IOT111 |	Get your devices online
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:23,295	| IOT111 |	Connect them manage them
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:28,159	| IOT111 |	Do all of that but it's it's very thin they're using the AWS
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,695	| IOT111 |	Lambda functions
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:32,511	| IOT111 |	So there's a couple key things here that you need to know
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,047	| IOT111 |	1
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| IOT111 |	Is
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,327	| IOT111 |	That
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,119	| IOT111 |	A manufacturer
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT111 |	By this
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| IOT111 |	Once so
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:46,079	| IOT111 |	They don't have to pay yonomi on an ongoing basis adding to their own ongoing cost
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:46,591	| IOT111 |	4
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,895	| IOT111 |	Turn off all the provisioning and fun stuff
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:52,479	| IOT111 |	But there they will have to pay for the AWS cost
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,759	| IOT111 |	So there is still an ongoing
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,807	| IOT111 |	Right but
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:17:00,671	| IOT111 |	This is where we get into this concept of server list and I feel bad that I haven't talked to you guys about this
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,743	| IOT111 |	4 because it's actually a really big deal for iot
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| IOT111 |	From an economic stance
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,815	| IOT111 |	Disappear With Me
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,119	| IOT111 |	Because later on we're going to come back to Target
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| IOT111 |	Take a shower
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,959	| IOT111 |	Serverless computing
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,287	| IOT111 |	Things like AWS Lambda Google functions
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:20,383	| IOT111 |	The Computing instance only spins up when it's needed
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:24,991	| IOT111 |	Really important for iot because a lot of times you don't have like a constant
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,783	| IOT111 |	Compute job you have a sensor that wakes up and is like
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,807	| IOT111 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:30,367	| IOT111 |	Quickteller home hub my door is open
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,135	| IOT111 |	Is it a ghost
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:34,207	| IOT111 |	So if you had a server running all the time for that
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,511	| IOT111 |	That would be just disliked ongoing tiny little cost
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,071	| IOT111 |	But if you want you serverless computing
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,863	| IOT111 |	It wakes up
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:45,727	| IOT111 |	Perform that function charges you only for that function and then goes back to when it goes back to sleep
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| IOT111 |	It's been Stout
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:52,383	| IOT111 |	So that's the concept we're talking about here so serverless Computing is really important for iot
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,431	| IOT111 |	Because it keeps your cost
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,967	| IOT111 |	Only when you use it
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,271	| IOT111 |	And I know that's what everyone told you about
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,295	| IOT111 |	Cloud computing
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,319	| IOT111 |	But that's not actually true
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,903	| IOT111 |	What is becoming true now
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,439	| IOT111 |	The way this approaches
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,207	| IOT111 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:07,999	| IOT111 |	And it's not the right approach for every
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,535	| IOT111 |	It new
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,839	| IOT111 |	But Netflix isn't going to use this
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:16,447	| IOT111 |	It's a really big deal for iot so now you guys have this
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,983	| IOT111 |	Amazingly nerdy
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:21,055	| IOT111 |	Party talk that will actually make people run away from you
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,335	| IOT111 |	So maybe picture
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| IOT111 |	But in your management meetings
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:30,015	| IOT111 |	So what you know me does is they've built their platform for
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:32,575	| IOT111 |	Another server list kind of function Basecamp
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,623	| IOT111 |	And they did this to help
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,391	| IOT111 |	Cut costs again
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:36,927	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,719	| IOT111 |	What we've got with a Janome send
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:43,327	| IOT111 |	Is software the manufacturer buys once a one-time cost
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,887	| IOT111 |	Can pay for you no service another
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,655	| IOT111 |	Other things
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,423	| IOT111 |	If you want but you don't have
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,471	| IOT111 |	And then you've got the
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,543	| IOT111 |	Most as-needed function of AWS run
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,127	| IOT111 |	Basically you can run a smart
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,895	| IOT111 |	Hallmark
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,919	| IOT111 |	Connected device
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,991	| IOT111 |	Basically you can run a connected device
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,271	| IOT111 |	With
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,039	| IOT111 |	Minimal
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,551	| IOT111 |	Overhead
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,087	| IOT111 |	And that's what's so cool
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,879	| IOT111 |	That's what Schlage is excited about
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:10,207	| IOT111 |	That's what other customers they have are excited about so
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,511	| IOT111 |	I don't know I think this is really into
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:17,375	| IOT111 |	I agree it's it's far more efficient and specifically tailored to
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,423	| IOT111 |	The iot industry because as we
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT111 |	Just said
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,983	| IOT111 |	These devices aren't
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:22,751	| IOT111 |	Requiring
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,519	| IOT111 |	Qtime
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,567	| IOT111 |	All the time and so why pay for it
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,127	| IOT111 |	And why not make it more efficient so that
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,431	| IOT111 |	Computations take place as needed on demand
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:33,247	| IOT111 |	So yes the other things I should say
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,527	| IOT111 |	Because this is really important
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,551	| IOT111 |	If you're building this stuff
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,319	| IOT111 |	Is
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,367	| IOT111 |	When you buy the license to the thin called
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,135	| IOT111 |	You get the source code
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,671	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| IOT111 |	You're not locked into it you
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,559	| IOT111 |	And that's a big deal because I have talked to many
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,887	| IOT111 |	Connected device companies who've gone with a
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT111 |	A cloud provider
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| IOT111 |	Maven like
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,543	| IOT111 |	Crap we want to change our luck in this sucks
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:03,455	| IOT111 |	And that also is a benefit if a service provider for some reason goes out of business but not that I'm saying
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:07,039	| IOT111 |	You know me would or whatever but we talked about this
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:12,415	| IOT111 |	We talked about this in the past what happens to the the customers you know at that point well somebody can
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,719	| IOT111 |	Take up the torch and continued on with
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:16,767	| IOT111 |	Because they already have the code and they can
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:20,095	| IOT111 |	Obviously as you said tweakin to customizer do whatever they need
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,143	| IOT111 |	But still I think that adds a level of
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,191	| IOT111 |	Insecurities not not
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,959	| IOT111 |	The typical
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:29,055	| IOT111 |	Definition security not like device in data security but security that this
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,335	| IOT111 |	Service will be
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT111 |	Around for a long time
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,639	| IOT111 |	Exactly
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,663	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:39,807	| IOT111 |	Retrieving into kind of some industrial stuff I've got one more industrial news bit for us before we move onto our guest
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,111	| IOT111 |	Plural plural
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,183	| IOT111 |	Also for people who are building as opposed to just buying
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,463	| IOT111 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,767	| IOT111 |	CB insights the
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,559	| IOT111 |	Oh how do I describe them
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,839	| IOT111 |	They do Venture Capital data
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:52,863	| IOT111 |	They
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,911	| IOT111 |	Earlier this month put out
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,703	| IOT111 |	The industrial iot stack
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,239	| IOT111 |	Where they looked at
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,311	| IOT111 |	What it takes to build the industrial iot
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,895	| IOT111 |	They highlighted 125 startups transforming
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:09,759	| IOT111 |	All kinds all aspects of the industrial iot I can see that they forgotten some they
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,039	| IOT111 |	Put some on there that I'm like what
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,599	| IOT111 |	Their stack is really interesting
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,391	| IOT111 |	Because they break it down into sensors and connect
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,464	| IOT111 |	Edge device isn't connected
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:18,976	| IOT111 |	Objects
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:22,304	| IOT111 |	Universal platforms and Edge intelligence
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:27,680	| IOT111 |	Applied sensor networks which are very vertical specific so thank boiling glass
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,472	| IOT111 |	Cleat
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:32,288	| IOT111 |	And then Advanced analytics protection
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,080	| IOT111 |	Which I'm kinda like everything else
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:37,664	| IOT111 |	If I think about the way that business is going
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,992	| IOT111 |	Feel like a sensors and connectivity side
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,272	| IOT111 |	Are going to be pretty high leak
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,576	| IOT111 |	I would agree
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,112	| IOT111 |	Now some of the companies here
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,416	| IOT111 |	They've got sigfox Center
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,976	| IOT111 |	Engineer those are all connectivity side that got
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:54,048	| IOT111 |	In the censors of monitoring side they have companies like electric and power
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:58,144	| IOT111 |	What I see those companies doing is actually going all the way up to the
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,936	| IOT111 |	The topper
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,984	| IOT111 |	The analytics and Security Site
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,496	| IOT111 |	Height of the stack
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,776	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:08,128	| IOT111 |	When I look at this I disagree a little with the order but I see a lot more movement between the
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,408	| IOT111 |	Companies in these classify
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:13,248	| IOT111 |	Locations in the show notes you come look at it
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:17,088	| IOT111 |	I'm also going to include this in the newsletter on Friday so you
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,368	| IOT111 |	You can spend even more time with it
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| IOT111 |	If you want
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,928	| IOT111 |	And
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,976	| IOT111 |	I'm glad that someone did this because
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,024	| IOT111 |	You don't even I sit there and try to
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:25,536	| IOT111 |	Create a stack
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:31,424	| IOT111 |	Industrial Computing iot industrial iot and I'm like
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,448	| IOT111 |	I give up
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,752	| IOT111 |	And it's hard
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:40,640	| IOT111 |	So it is hard I didn't even noticed they say while some companies may fit into multiple categories and parts of the stack
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,224	| IOT111 |	Weedmaps companies based on their primary use case of these sort of
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,504	| IOT111 |	I think I agree with what you're saying
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:49,600	| IOT111 |	A tendency right this is a challenge this is not to
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,624	| IOT111 |	And there's no
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,904	| IOT111 |	Correct answer here
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| IOT111 |	To build a stack
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,488	| IOT111 |	But looking at this
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,304	| IOT111 |	There's like over 700 Industrial iot
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:05,472	| IOT111 |	This really reach we talked about this but the newly-launched platform Edge X found
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:08,544	| IOT111 |	That the Linux Foundation is doing
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,336	| IOT111 |	And we had a guest from dalian
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,360	| IOT111 |	Police are talking about
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,640	| IOT111 |	This is
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,176	| IOT111 |	Part of why that
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,224	| IOT111 |	Because they want to take
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,552	| IOT111 |	Some of these companies and push them together and then let
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,088	| IOT111 |	Push them together
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,928	| IOT111 |	Let them linked together without having to write individual
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,280	| IOT111 |	That's the Technic
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:29,792	| IOT111 |	Pickle side happen
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,120	| IOT111 |	They're just pushing them together
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:39,264	| IOT111 |	And then let people really focus on some of this exterior stuff so they're trying to come out if I the stuff in the middle
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,080	| IOT111 |	So not just sensors and connectivity but
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,872	| IOT111 |	Just at middleware where you just
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,384	| IOT111 |	Connecting
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,504	| IOT111 |	With that
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,272	| IOT111 |	Let's
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,064	| IOT111 |	Take a momentary break
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,600	| IOT111 |	Get into
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,648	| IOT111 |	Guess this week which
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,184	| IOT111 |	Are Michael Wolff
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| IOT111 |	Jonathan Frankel
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,512	| IOT111 |	The CEO of nucleus
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:06,912	| IOT111 |	Mark Rolston the head of argodesign
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:12,544	| IOT111 |	For a message from this week's sponsor this week sponsor is Eris and we have
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:17,920	| IOT111 |	Z Hussain who is the CTO and founder of eras here to talk to us today
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,712	| IOT111 |	Let's get started with an easy one
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,736	| IOT111 |	What is Eros
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:27,392	| IOT111 |	This is a company that was founded on the premise that people needed to get remote information
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:31,488	| IOT111 |	From equipment and devices and applications out in the field
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,792	| IOT111 |	Process them and take some business action
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:38,400	| IOT111 |	That's what we've been doing for the past 20 plus years providing these kinds of services for our
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,424	| IOT111 |	Enterprise customers
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,728	| IOT111 |	Why should a company think
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| IOT111 |	About implementing
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,104	| IOT111 |	One of the first things I tell people is to understand
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:52,736	| IOT111 |	Exactly what the outcome is that they looking for from a business perspective meaning
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,272	| IOT111 |	Is there some basic
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:58,368	| IOT111 |	Cost advantage that they get by implementing an iot solution
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:03,232	| IOT111 |	What is there some kind of enhanced Revenue that they will generate because they've implemented in Iowa
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:06,560	| IOT111 |	Lucia having said that there may be other drivers as well.
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:09,632	| IOT111 |	Create the need for deployment IRP application
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:13,216	| IOT111 |	For example if a utility company wants to do
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:17,312	| IOT111 |	Time of day billing and they have to measure and take him
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:23,712	| IOT111 |	Information from the electric utility meters and that creates the requirements of the opportunity for implementing and iot
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:25,248	| IOT111 |	Solution even though it's in perhaps
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,528	| IOT111 |	Santander Consumer
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,296	| IOT111 |	Meter reading app
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:30,112	| IOT111 |	That sounds great so what does it take to
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,392	| IOT111 |	To implement some sort of Iota
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:34,208	| IOT111 |	They need to understand what
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:39,328	| IOT111 |	Data Vinnie together what control functions they might need what business action are they
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,632	| IOT111 |	Going to take on receiving that data
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:45,984	| IOT111 |	What are the worst things you can do is gather data for the sake of gathering data and create
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:50,336	| IOT111 |	But I will call Haystacks of unimportant data that actually has no
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:56,480	| IOT111 |	Relevance to what they're the problem is that they're trying to solve any to understand exactly what it takes to get that data
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,016	| IOT111 |	And what day does it need now
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,576	| IOT111 |	Transport of that data if it's a remote
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:06,976	| IOT111 |	Device is very very important how do they need to get that data back to their facility where is the device locate
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:13,120	| IOT111 |	Then they need to go beyond the conductivity portion of it I understand where they're going to store the data how reliable is that storage
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:20,032	| IOT111 |	Do they need to perform an analysis of that data so what areas does is when these companies are look
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:26,432	| IOT111 |	Looking for a iot Solutions Paris provides them guidance right from the start as to what their solution is
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| IOT111 |	Things to look like
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:32,064	| IOT111 |	And then once the Enterprise has made a decision that they needed to play an application
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:36,672	| IOT111 |	We provide them the network transport from the cellular device at my PR
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:42,304	| IOT111 |	Filled all the way to the cellular system where there's within the United States or overseas internationally
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:45,888	| IOT111 |	And provides a data to them in a in a massage Orem
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,192	| IOT111 |	That they are expecting to see
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:50,496	| IOT111 |	Where can I find out more
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:51,776	| IOT111 |	About what heiresses
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:56,896	| IOT111 |	We want to find out more about iot Solutions and how to deploy
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:02,528	| IOT111 |	And iot solution for their particular problem I would highly recommend that it download a copy of the
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:05,600	| IOT111 |	Free ebook that I have published it's available on our website
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:07,392	| IOT111 |	Www. Eres
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,416	| IOT111 |	Atrrs
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| IOT111 |	Dot-com
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:13,024	| IOT111 |	We can also listen to a copy of this podcast another podcast app
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:19,424	| IOT111 |	Www.arris.com podcast
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:25,824	| IOT111 |	We're doing something a little bit different this week on the guest portion of the show because we are
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,872	| IOT111 |	So excited about the Amazon Echo Show
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,944	| IOT111 |	I got a few people to talk about what they think this means
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,712	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,016	| IOT111 |	My first guess this week is Mike Wolfe
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,576	| IOT111 |	Who is a smart home analyst
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,880	| IOT111 |	And who has his own site called
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,648	| IOT111 |	The spoon
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,696	| IOT111 |	Where he covers smart kitchen stuff
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,488	| IOT111 |	It's not as the spoon. Tech
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,536	| IOT111 |	If you're really lucky
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,352	| IOT111 |	You'll be in Seattle for a smart
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,120	| IOT111 |	Kitchen Summit
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,656	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,168	| IOT111 |	Mike
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,960	| IOT111 |	Amazon
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,472	| IOT111 |	Show
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,008	| IOT111 |	What do you think
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| IOT111 |	Well
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:00,128	| IOT111 |	It came so fast after the walk it's like the looking show
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,688	| IOT111 |	Was in what two weeks in a row
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:05,504	| IOT111 |	But I'm not surprised because I wrote a piece I think early
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,784	| IOT111 |	About 2 months ago saying
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,552	| IOT111 |	Amazon
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,624	| IOT111 |	As a whole bunch of connected Home Hardware coming this year
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:13,952	| IOT111 |	I'm Thor's I've been hearing out of the Doppler side of things
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:16,768	| IOT111 |	And I just out of out of Amazon for my sources is
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,304	| IOT111 |	They're not done
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,376	| IOT111 |	After what they showed up that with Echo with a.
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,144	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,680	| IOT111 |	I think they're just going all-in on this thing
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,728	| IOT111 |	What do you think about Amazon
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,752	| IOT111 |	I think it's
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,824	| IOT111 |	As doing everything they can to get you to buy more stuff
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:34,944	| IOT111 |	Does that still fit in with this Smartphone Vision or should I expand
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,480	| IOT111 |	My Amazon is going to take over the
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:42,880	| IOT111 |	I think they're just trying to like find of a fit with Alexa for every type of user
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:46,208	| IOT111 |	Modality every type of preference in whether that's a
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,744	| IOT111 |	A touch screen
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,280	| IOT111 |	Were you going to show some things
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,328	| IOT111 |	Whether it's a
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:54,144	| IOT111 |	A camera which you know as we know people love
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:57,216	| IOT111 |	Some people love cameras either one I don't know if I want a camera in my in my
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,008	| IOT111 |	My bedroom
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,776	| IOT111 |	But
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:02,848	| IOT111 |	There's they're just different looks in different use cases they're trying to
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:05,408	| IOT111 |	Fit into and give people
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,712	| IOT111 |	A way to use Alexa
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,504	| IOT111 |	Really what it's all about
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:15,648	| IOT111 |	And I think it's over taking everything in terms of their connected-home Vision including I think it's in a way replacing
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:22,816	| IOT111 |	Dash I think the physical done for Dasher starting to go away you starting to see them just went to Virtual buttons are they really think they're going all-in
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:25,632	| IOT111 |	When is an Alexa has the weight of the century by stuff
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:28,960	| IOT111 |	And and get people like you said to interact with our conversation
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:33,312	| IOT111 |	So I'm with you on the dash because I always thought those buttons were stopgap
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:36,896	| IOT111 |	And I thought the real story was with the dash replenishment service
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:41,248	| IOT111 |	Because you can build ERS into anything and that feels so powerful
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:45,088	| IOT111 |	For any maker of some sort of like razor blades or
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:45,856	| IOT111 |	Pet food or whatever
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,392	| IOT111 |	Brita water pitchers
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,440	| IOT111 |	So the idea of
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:49,952	| IOT111 |	Having
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,232	| IOT111 |	Different
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,512	| IOT111 |	Echo form factor
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,584	| IOT111 |	Who is most threatened by alipay
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,096	| IOT111 |	This is it
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:59,680	| IOT111 |	You know Google home with its me to speaker is it maybe
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:02,752	| IOT111 |	Apple with its I don't know if it's going to launch a speaker
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:03,776	| IOT111 |	What do you think
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:07,104	| IOT111 |	I don't know if they're not knocking out of the park
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:07,872	| IOT111 |	Either
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,896	| IOT111 |	The walk
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,944	| IOT111 |	Or the show
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,456	| IOT111 |	I feel like
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:14,528	| IOT111 |	The go-to big winner still is the
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:20,672	| IOT111 |	Backhoe the primary product that started it all I mean we'll have to wait and see I don't necessarily feel like this
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,232	| IOT111 |	One factor is like a huge winner
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,024	| IOT111 |	It look when I first saw the picture I thought like
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:26,560	| IOT111 |	Okay this is just someone's
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,328	| IOT111 |	Physical
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:31,680	| IOT111 |	Idea but it wasn't going to be the final products I was kind of surprised the final product look
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:34,752	| IOT111 |	So 2007 quite honestly
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,800	| IOT111 |	And what surprises me is like
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| IOT111 |	I'm wondering if
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:41,408	| IOT111 |	If Amazon is using there are lots of fun to invest in companies
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:44,224	| IOT111 |	The price for discovery mode because this looks a lot
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:51,136	| IOT111 |	It feels a lot like the nucleus and also asking a lot of ways like that the tribute which is it another company busted in inbox yet
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,904	| IOT111 |	To the kitchen speaker
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,488	| IOT111 |	They've invested in comes with Alexa fund that
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:58,304	| IOT111 |	The ultimate creative practice very similar to
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,584	| IOT111 |	So that's interesting to me
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:02,912	| IOT111 |	And we have Jonathan Frank
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,680	| IOT111 |	Nucleus
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,192	| IOT111 |	Is coming on in a
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,728	| IOT111 |	He shares your opinion
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:10,592	| IOT111 |	If they are using this is a Discovery Fund as opposed to an actual advance
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,616	| IOT111 |	You know the platform
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:16,736	| IOT111 |	What would you advise startups who are looking at taking money from the Amazon
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,760	| IOT111 |	The city Alexa voice
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,320	| IOT111 |	Get a great lawyer
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:24,160	| IOT111 |	To write your agreements although you may be at the mercy of whatever they want to do
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:27,488	| IOT111 |	But just go into this with full understanding that
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,024	| IOT111 |	Amazon
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,304	| IOT111 |	Is never going to be
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:33,888	| IOT111 |	Someone other than maybe coopertition then maybe ultimate your competition
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,168	| IOT111 |	Like they're ultimately
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,192	| IOT111 |	In it for their own
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,496	| IOT111 |	Motivations
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:42,848	| IOT111 |	Step back and say I do think they want it have Alexa distributed among the different devices
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,408	| IOT111 |	There's going to be categories that they don't go into
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,992	| IOT111 |	But I mean you can never fully right off the fact
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:52,576	| IOT111 |	The idea that they mailed maybe your competitor even if you had their your investor
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,368	| IOT111 |	Where won't they go
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,648	| IOT111 |	I think
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:32:00,256	| IOT111 |	Most everything has to have a Commerce orientation I don't necessarily see them going into
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,048	| IOT111 |	Connected
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:06,144	| IOT111 |	Sprinklers or garage door openers or those types of things at
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,192	| IOT111 |	You emailed me get some sort of
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:12,032	| IOT111 |	Level of adoption but it's never going to be like this massive
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,104	| IOT111 |	I don't think they've ever going to like low-volume
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,872	| IOT111 |	Niche products
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,944	| IOT111 |	I was going to ask so there's this idea that it like
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:23,808	| IOT111 |	Roughly 5 to 6 million Amazon echos either in the dot or the echo format
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,088	| IOT111 |	WhatsApp have been sold
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:32,000	| IOT111 |	And usually when I talk to people who aren't interested in it they're not interested in it because they don't want to have a speaker always listen
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| IOT111 |	I kind of freaks them out
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,120	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,400	| IOT111 |	Do you think the
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:41,216	| IOT111 |	Telenovela can
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,496	| IOT111 |	I can't find anybody who wants to
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:44,544	| IOT111 |	So do you think the show is
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:49,664	| IOT111 |	Going to bring Ian that audiences so far is kind of worried about privacy and that sort of thing
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:50,944	| IOT111 |	Maybe
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:54,784	| IOT111 |	I think the main motivation for the shows is a video screen
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:33:01,184	| IOT111 |	I mean Wilder you receive platonia natural decline in in tablet shipments I mean iPad numbers Court
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,720	| IOT111 |	Continue to go down
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,512	| IOT111 |	I still feel better
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,792	| IOT111 |	Our people are very visual
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:07,328	| IOT111 |	Want some sort of
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,120	| IOT111 |	Touch interface video interface
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,144	| IOT111 |	What's interesting news
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:16,800	| IOT111 |	Remember we were at 8 on the one of the podcast when I talk about the cabinet project cabinet that talk about a rumor kitchen computer
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:21,920	| IOT111 |	From a couple years ago I think this is what they told me was this Maybe Might their kitchen computer
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,968	| IOT111 |	Cuz you can do things like video
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,992	| IOT111 |	Demonstrations of a cup
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,320	| IOT111 |	Like Buzzfeed video recipe how to
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:28,832	| IOT111 |	I think
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,392	| IOT111 |	Basically the kitchen use cases very visual
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,184	| IOT111 |	There's just certain things you can't do
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:36,256	| IOT111 |	With a voice interface like I may ask Alexa
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,280	| IOT111 |	To tell me how to cook
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:40,352	| IOT111 |	But I can't show me how to cook with a video
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:42,144	| IOT111 |	Dennis it's has somewhat Limited
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:45,216	| IOT111 |	Usefulness I think so I think this kind of sauce for that
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,520	| IOT111 |	Okay and what about the voice calling
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,288	| IOT111 |	Again this kind of
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,592	| IOT111 |	Tizanidine nucleases stuff
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:53,408	| IOT111 |	I was kind of excited by the fact that
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:56,992	| IOT111 |	Looks like it only goes from
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,016	| IOT111 |	Do you have any thoughts there
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:03,648	| IOT111 |	I really liked video calling I don't think anyone's going to necessarily replace FaceTime
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,720	| IOT111 |	You know Skype video calling
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:07,744	| IOT111 |	Or even
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:11,072	| IOT111 |	Google Hangouts with this thing but I can see them
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| IOT111 |	Sewing
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:15,424	| IOT111 |	These and then maybe coming out with an app much like they did with the Kindle app eventually
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,704	| IOT111 |	The Royce attraction
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:23,360	| IOT111 |	Video calling maybe they've go that direction okay so after Amazon has released all this Hardware I'm looking at it and you know what I think
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,432	| IOT111 |	I think it might be time to relaunch the Fire Phone
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:27,712	| IOT111 |	Phone now
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:32,320	| IOT111 |	Now you serious I'm serious think about all the data that they could get from being able to
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,088	| IOT111 |	Put this
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,880	| IOT111 |	Basically think of
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:36,672	| IOT111 |	Alexa on your handset
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:41,024	| IOT111 |	And there is definitely a market for that today but now that you've got you know calling
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:44,864	| IOT111 |	Now you can create this entire ecosystem around that I don't know either
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:47,168	| IOT111 |	What are they did a killer
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,448	| IOT111 |	Wearable
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,752	| IOT111 |	Like no one's really done I think Apple watch
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:56,640	| IOT111 |	It's kind of like okay are people done with that boy that you did this really great wearable with Alexa integration I'm just Breeze from
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,176	| IOT111 |	Just kind of spitball in butt
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,968	| IOT111 |	I feel like big Commerce
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:05,856	| IOT111 |	Because of Commerce being so big to them I don't know if a wearable make sense unless we think about it as like a bio
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,928	| IOT111 |	But what if what if it has
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:13,792	| IOT111 |	Some sort of like scanner in it or something to tell you when you watch Walking to a store if you just scan a product
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,584	| IOT111 |	It goes into your Amazon account
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,888	| IOT111 |	And I'm let me advise or something I don't know
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:18,656	| IOT111 |	Just thinking out loud
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,216	| IOT111 |	I like when people think out loud Mike
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,240	| IOT111 |	Thanks so much
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:22,752	| IOT111 |	For coming on the show
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| IOT111 |	This has been a lot of fun things Stacy
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:31,712	| IOT111 |	Alright I'm here with Mark Rolston who is the founder of argodesign and he's here telling us about how
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,760	| IOT111 |	The Echo Show
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,040	| IOT111 |	Was inevitable
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,576	| IOT111 |	Hey Mark how you doing
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:39,136	| IOT111 |	Good to talk to you
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:40,416	| IOT111 |	We have spoken
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:42,976	| IOT111 |	Several times in the past about
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:45,792	| IOT111 |	Amazon Echo in the voice as an interface
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:49,120	| IOT111 |	So can you kind of break down what you mean for me when you say that
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:51,680	| IOT111 |	This designer this product was somewhat inevitable
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:54,496	| IOT111 |	Yeah well when you look at the echo
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,032	| IOT111 |	It's fantastic
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:58,336	| IOT111 |	Devices you can imagine talking to
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,896	| IOT111 |	Soon as you start doing that
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:01,408	| IOT111 |	You realize
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:05,760	| IOT111 |	You really not
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:08,320	| IOT111 |	Look for it to read out the answer verbally
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,136	| IOT111 |	For you
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:11,648	| IOT111 |	The time
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:13,440	| IOT111 |	You can start talking back
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:16,256	| IOT111 |	Now you realize that I have a list of restaurants
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,560	| IOT111 |	A grocery list
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,096	| IOT111 |	Store what are my points
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:24,192	| IOT111 |	Anylist that's beyond one or two words any sample of words
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:26,496	| IOT111 |	Just not tall ago.
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:28,800	| IOT111 |	Tablet computer
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:30,848	| IOT111 |	So
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,664	| IOT111 |	You realize you need a screen
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,944	| IOT111 |	Anywhere and everywhere but
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,224	| IOT111 |	Queens
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:43,136	| IOT111 |	Super useful for any kind of like the concert so it wasn't a glamazon
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,488	| IOT111 |	Obviously the show is there
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,256	| IOT111 |	Response
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:51,328	| IOT111 |	Alright a lot of people have said that this thing
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:51,840	| IOT111 |	Is ugly
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,680	| IOT111 |	I think someone earlier in the show's 10th it look like it was a design from the
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,264	| IOT111 |	2007 so as a professional product designer
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:00,800	| IOT111 |	Give us your take
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,408	| IOT111 |	Agreed
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,432	| IOT111 |	Ugly because
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:09,248	| IOT111 |	I think so read on it as soon as I hear
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,808	| IOT111 |	Is Billy twofold wine is
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,136	| IOT111 |	Quietly into my home
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,928	| IOT111 |	Cincinnati
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,696	| IOT111 |	Does
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,976	| IOT111 |	As much as I can
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:21,024	| IOT111 |	Given what it's doing today
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:23,072	| IOT111 |	Does it look like a gorgeous objects
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:27,936	| IOT111 |	First run
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:28,448	| IOT111 |	Consumer
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,008	| IOT111 |	Introducing everybody
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,288	| IOT111 |	I understand why they didn't
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:37,920	| IOT111 |	Sasori what they're trying to do is say
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,456	| IOT111 |	Form around it
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,224	| IOT111 |	Just look
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:43,296	| IOT111 |	It is
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:46,112	| IOT111 |	In the nursery speaker
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:49,952	| IOT111 |	I really don't mind I don't think it's a silly silly
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,744	| IOT111 |	Got it let's
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,768	| IOT111 |	What's your profession
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:04,288	| IOT111 |	True and I feel like we are kind of to this point where we have fetishized
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:07,616	| IOT111 |	Electronic objects these white plastic
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,408	| IOT111 |	Maybe they're space gray plastic
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:13,248	| IOT111 |	Things that we stick out our home and I'm kind of like
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:18,368	| IOT111 |	I don't know if I need any more like UFO looking like things that control stuff in my house
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:22,720	| IOT111 |	What do you think of it
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,816	| IOT111 |	Unnecessarily
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:32,448	| IOT111 |	But as a stepping stone it's an all-in-one device and it has
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:34,752	| IOT111 |	Thing that is causing it so much
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,032	| IOT111 |	Mass is
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:38,336	| IOT111 |	This microphone and speakers
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,128	| IOT111 |	Vim screen
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,456	| IOT111 |	But that's just because that's when we are
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:46,528	| IOT111 |	I'm really look forward to this answer when
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,320	| IOT111 |	I've got a set of
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,600	| IOT111 |	Potential screen
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,136	| IOT111 |	Microphone array
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:53,952	| IOT111 |	Organic part of a well-equipped home
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,072	| IOT111 |	The speaker's Maybe
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,632	| IOT111 |	The same way that were starting to hide
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,192	| IOT111 |	Speakers that we listen to music with
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,752	| IOT111 |	The device speaker
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,824	| IOT111 |	We're not anywhere near that yet
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:14,944	| IOT111 |	Kind of hardware stores on come on
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:16,224	| IOT111 |	Breaking news
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:17,760	| IOT111 |	Find
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,808	| IOT111 |	Because it's introducing a lily
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,856	| IOT111 |	Magical 7 features
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:26,208	| IOT111 |	Everyone recognizes how complex that scenario
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:31,072	| IOT111 |	Understand this is really pretty successful design and it took a lot of engineering
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:35,168	| IOT111 |	Well let's talk about those other ideas kind of us the final
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,960	| IOT111 |	Bit of all of this
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:39,520	| IOT111 |	You once showed me a prototype when you are at frog
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:46,432	| IOT111 |	And it was his concept of house that understands context
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:51,296	| IOT111 |	Adapts to you and show you information kind of where you need it
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,576	| IOT111 |	It was really kind of cool
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,112	| IOT111 |	And so
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,648	| IOT111 |	From
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:58,464	| IOT111 |	And I don't remember how long ago without pus but from that time
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,000	| IOT111 |	To hear
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:02,304	| IOT111 |	Where do you see us evolving
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:05,376	| IOT111 |	When it comes to building these kind of contextually aware smart
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:11,776	| IOT111 |	Elsa Rumi was our future mission to imagine instead of devices
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| IOT111 |	That we got a lot of this
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,896	| IOT111 |	What is low-level functionality
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,456	| IOT111 |	What time is it change the temperature turn on the lights
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,248	| IOT111 |	I almost died.
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,320	| IOT111 |	Devices that will help you with that
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:26,368	| IOT111 |	Which required
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:28,160	| IOT111 |	GoDaddy pocket unlocked
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:30,208	| IOT111 |	Go to Red Lobster Vine app
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:30,720	| IOT111 |	And such
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,280	| IOT111 |	But we imagine that the home
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,304	| IOT111 |	Itself
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:37,632	| IOT111 |	Was equipped with all the necessary for
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,936	| IOT111 |	To do that for you orthodox
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:43,264	| IOT111 |	Any environment that humans
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:46,080	| IOT111 |	Commonly existed within them could be equipped
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:49,408	| IOT111 |	With the level of computing where you would say the room is
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,456	| IOT111 |	The computer in the corner
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:57,088	| IOT111 |	Is really
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,368	| IOT111 |	Beautiful example of
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,136	| IOT111 |	First product
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:01,184	| IOT111 |	Way back into a guy
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:02,976	| IOT111 |	Chesnaught
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:06,048	| IOT111 |	Was thinking if we wanted to build this
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:09,376	| IOT111 |	The first thing we need to do is essentially make a box with some of it
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:12,448	| IOT111 |	Then we thought maybe the first box will be the projector
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:15,776	| IOT111 |	We want to quit
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,312	| IOT111 |	Field that product
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,080	| IOT111 |	Be kind
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,616	| IOT111 |	It's obvious today
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,640	| IOT111 |	Got answer so.
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,176	| IOT111 |	Amazon go
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,248	| IOT111 |	I'm extremely coffee
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,272	| IOT111 |	We will get
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,296	| IOT111 |	Back to that
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:30,880	| IOT111 |	Instead of these discrete boxes you have
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:34,208	| IOT111 |	Corner yoga
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,744	| IOT111 |	You instead
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:38,048	| IOT111 |	Put the next one up into the ceiling
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,352	| IOT111 |	I like all.
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,888	| IOT111 |	A can light
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:44,960	| IOT111 |	Socket you put one of those dogs will be your max
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:48,544	| IOT111 |	We kind of see this today with if you look at like the ecobee did with the
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:54,687	| IOT111 |	Alexa powered thermostat in there actually doing light switches with both of microphones and speakers in them
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:57,247	| IOT111 |	So that feels close to this patient
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,319	| IOT111 |	Cats getting their rights
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,599	| IOT111 |	They're basically
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,135	| IOT111 |	Exploiting existing
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:06,719	| IOT111 |	Appliances in the house or existing affordances
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,743	| IOT111 |	Alexa light socket
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:09,535	| IOT111 |	To sneak in another mic
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:11,839	| IOT111 |	More control service
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:17,471	| IOT111 |	Eventually you have a an overarching system
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:20,543	| IOT111 |	Something Amazon Rhymes or Apple
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:21,311	| IOT111 |	Google Now
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:24,895	| IOT111 |	Back to the room
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,431	| IOT111 |	Into other room
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:28,991	| IOT111 |	Cost of laundry room
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:32,575	| IOT111 |	It's really one conversation one
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:35,647	| IOT111 |	You'll stop thinking of it is that thermostat
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:38,719	| IOT111 |	Calories
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:39,743	| IOT111 |	Black
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:41,279	| IOT111 |	Monolith in the corner
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,839	| IOT111 |	I'm really just talking to the room
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:47,167	| IOT111 |	Go back to the question of what do I think of
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:49,471	| IOT111 |	Echo Show
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:51,775	| IOT111 |	It's a great stepping stone
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,311	| IOT111 |	All right
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:54,335	| IOT111 |	Well thank you so much
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:59,455	| IOT111 |	Can you have Jonathan Frankel who is the CEO of nucleus
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:03,039	| IOT111 |	Which as you can imagine today just found out
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,319	| IOT111 |	That the Amazon show
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,111	| IOT111 |	Looks kind of like
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:06,623	| IOT111 |	Bear pride
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,415	| IOT111 |	Hi Jonathan how are you
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:14,303	| IOT111 |	So we talked for years I've tried out a nucleus I thought it was actually pretty
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:17,631	| IOT111 |	Pretty sweet what was your reaction today when you saw the Amazon show
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:22,495	| IOT111 |	I thought hey that there's an eerie resemblance to product
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:26,079	| IOT111 |	And how is it how is your day been so
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:27,615	| IOT111 |	Let's ask it like that how is your day been
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:30,431	| IOT111 |	It's been a rollercoaster
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:32,223	| IOT111 |	I like it.
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,783	| IOT111 |	Elf crystallized thing
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:35,807	| IOT111 |	We
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:37,087	| IOT111 |	Having a
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,367	| IOT111 |	Yeah that this was
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,135	| IOT111 |	Coming
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:39,647	| IOT111 |	But
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:42,975	| IOT111 |	At the same time you're under the impression that it was
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:44,255	| IOT111 |	Not overly
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,791	| IOT111 |	Competitive by
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,071	| IOT111 |	Signal leak
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:49,631	| IOT111 |	Nothing video this morning yeah kind of
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,167	| IOT111 |	Different direction
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,703	| IOT111 |	But
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,751	| IOT111 |	Panda strategic part of my brain
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:56,031	| IOT111 |	Working as well
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:56,799	| IOT111 |	And
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,847	| IOT111 |	As I'm watching this as much as I make
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:03,455	| IOT111 |	Straight in my chair thinking about the future of nucleus and
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:05,247	| IOT111 |	Call the Family petrolina
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,527	| IOT111 |	I also think about the
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,551	| IOT111 |	Ordering.
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:08,831	| IOT111 |	Walmart
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,599	| IOT111 |	Target
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,367	| IOT111 |	Comcast
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,135	| IOT111 |	Google
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,159	| IOT111 |	They also have
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:14,207	| IOT111 |	Wondering
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,999	| IOT111 |	How do they remain relevant
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,559	| IOT111 |	Amazon has
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,327	| IOT111 |	Potentially
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:19,839	| IOT111 |	Shopping cart
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,143	| IOT111 |	Every room in your home
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:24,447	| IOT111 |	The reason
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:26,239	| IOT111 |	Why I think Amazon is willing
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,263	| IOT111 |	2 +
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,055	| IOT111 |	Directly with
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:32,127	| IOT111 |	By the time you were the single largest investment from the
