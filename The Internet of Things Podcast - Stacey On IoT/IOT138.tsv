EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,960	| IOT138 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:48,800	| IOT138 |	Kevin let's just get started with some quick news bits because there's lots of
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:49,568	| IOT138 |	Quick news bits to Happy
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:50,592	| IOT138 |	To go around
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,896	| IOT138 |	So Google Assistant
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,432	| IOT138 |	It finally got support
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,456	| IOT138 |	Ecobee
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:59,040	| IOT138 |	Speaking of Google Assistant
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:03,392	| IOT138 |	I got an email the other day from the desk crew I imagined many of you guys got
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,184	| IOT138 |	Jane basically that
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,464	| IOT138 |	Before the end of this month
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,744	| IOT138 |	I'm going to have to reconnect
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,024	| IOT138 |	My
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,304	| IOT138 |	Nest gear
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:12,352	| IOT138 |	To my Google Assistant
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:12,864	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,192	| IOT138 |	The reason for this is a little unclear but we have our suspicions
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:23,360	| IOT138 |	Yeah what message saying is that Google search voice actions and Google Now are essentially part of Google assist
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,664	| IOT138 |	Which therefore also Google home
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:32,064	| IOT138 |	So I guess this is a Google thing that's being changed innocence which is affecting us which is there for fighting all the nests
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:32,576	| IOT138 |	Customers
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,368	| IOT138 |	They're just pulling this
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,672	| IOT138 |	Part out of Google Now which
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:40,768	| IOT138 |	Seems very strange to me because you've always been able to tap the microphone icon on Google noun
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,304	| IOT138 |	Essentially like a sister
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,608	| IOT138 |	I guess you're kind of going away from that
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,680	| IOT138 |	Google Now
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| IOT138 |	Cards
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,472	| IOT138 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:56,640	| IOT138 |	So it sounds to me like Google Now is becoming more of just a contextual card-based
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,432	| IOT138 |	Information-based system
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,712	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,736	| IOT138 |	Assistant
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| IOT138 |	Will take the place of the
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:06,624	| IOT138 |	Voice searches and controls and things like that
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,392	| IOT138 |	I'm seeing this happen
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:10,464	| IOT138 |	It's like they want to separate them
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,536	| IOT138 |	Make a very specific for different use cases
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| IOT138 |	Also
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,632	| IOT138 |	While we're on this topic we should also mention
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,168	| IOT138 |	And I put this in my newsletter last week
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,704	| IOT138 |	And I
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:21,984	| IOT138 |	Kevin
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:25,312	| IOT138 |	Because it's my friend Michael Wolff over at the spoon
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,872	| IOT138 |	Notice that Google had applied for a patent
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,432	| IOT138 |	Four chimes
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:32,736	| IOT138 |	Unique Chimes that were specific to
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,528	| IOT138 |	People locations and events
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,856	| IOT138 |	And this seems right on par with the idea of using
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,136	| IOT138 |	Your home to notify
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,720	| IOT138 |	I might have my own purse
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,232	| IOT138 |	Personal chimes
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,512	| IOT138 |	Stacy
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,304	| IOT138 |	Oh my God get out the door right now
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:50,144	| IOT138 |	And that would sound like something where is my daughter might have a different time that says
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,680	| IOT138 |	I don't know
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| IOT138 |	You should get up
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,056	| IOT138 |	I thought that was actually really interesting
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,080	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,408	| IOT138 |	Very on-point with actually getting rid of
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,456	| IOT138 |	The smartphone in your home
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| IOT138 |	Which
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,272	| IOT138 |	Designer Carrie mine
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,040	| IOT138 |	India
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:13,440	| IOT138 |	No I agree it's actually ironically it's actually taking a feature from smartphones and moving it to the home because you
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:13,952	| IOT138 |	You can customize
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,791	| IOT138 |	Notifications and ringtones for different people are different types of alerts
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:22,399	| IOT138 |	But if you don't have your phone with you it doesn't really matter but if those kind of alerts come from a smart home
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,447	| IOT138 |	What are your in the home you have to carry the phone
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:24,959	| IOT138 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| IOT138 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,519	| IOT138 |	So I think that's
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,287	| IOT138 |	Really
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,055	| IOT138 |	Really cool
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:32,639	| IOT138 |	And it's worth talking about in the show because
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,943	| IOT138 |	How many of us have two Google assistants
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,527	| IOT138 |	Google homes are Google other devices in I like it
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:42,367	| IOT138 |	Yay it's just they filed for the patent they don't have the patent
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,183	| IOT138 |	Pet disclaimers
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,487	| IOT138 |	Check it out if you want
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:52,351	| IOT138 |	My little tiny Google mini it's actually smaller than I thought
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,679	| IOT138 |	So that's the first thing it's probably maybe
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,471	| IOT138 |	3 1/2 across
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:59,775	| IOT138 |	If that and it doesn't sound great
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,543	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:03,103	| IOT138 |	I find it very difficult to control using the Taps be
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,663	| IOT138 |	It's hard to orient on the device
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,199	| IOT138 |	My daughter is fascinate
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,039	| IOT138 |	The lights George that makes sense
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:15,903	| IOT138 |	So I think a question a lot of people would have I don't know if you can answer or not book
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,695	| IOT138 |	Sound quality and microphone
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:21,535	| IOT138 |	Pick up of your voice any better or worse than the echo Dot
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,815	| IOT138 |	I think it's
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| IOT138 |	Probably the Mikes are better
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| IOT138 |	The sound quality
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:27,935	| IOT138 |	Probably on
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,495	| IOT138 |	It's really
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,007	| IOT138 |	Quiet
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:33,823	| IOT138 |	I mean
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:38,687	| IOT138 |	That might do it I could I was listening actually the podcast in the kitchen on that thing
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:44,319	| IOT138 |	Write this is just me personally everybody has their own way of approaching us
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:51,231	| IOT138 |	When I think about what devices I want in my house from a voice assistance perspective I think about what do I do
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,767	| IOT138 |	I do in that room Dua
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:58,911	| IOT138 |	Need an input device with better Mike's or do I want a consumption device with better speakers and that's why I put the.
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:05,311	| IOT138 |	In places where they don't listen to music like on the nightstand for examples perfect and it's fine for listening to light music when you're
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:05,823	| IOT138 |	Fall asleep
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:12,223	| IOT138 |	But I. Where many would make sense in that use case for me so that's my Approach input sources that puts
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,551	| IOT138 |	I agree and I like it we put it down in the kitchen
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,367	| IOT138 |	Mostly because it is now our backup
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,159	| IOT138 |	Amazon so when
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,719	| IOT138 |	Meta Mages pumps on a question which happen
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,535	| IOT138 |	Where are you ever dinner now I can just be like
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:27,583	| IOT138 |	Sorry you guys
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,375	| IOT138 |	Haji
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,911	| IOT138 |	Okay done with Google
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,703	| IOT138 |	Not really we're going to come back to it
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,495	| IOT138 |	Other news
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,263	| IOT138 |	This works
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:38,335	| IOT138 |	About the Amazon Echo is now available in Canada
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,615	| IOT138 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,895	| IOT138 |	And India
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| IOT138 |	It is exciting
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,271	| IOT138 |	This year in Canada radio
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:47,807	| IOT138 |	Well yes
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,855	| IOT138 |	And it reminds me
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,391	| IOT138 |	Report neighbors to the north
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:51,903	| IOT138 |	They get nothing
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,207	| IOT138 |	I feel really bad for them.
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,719	| IOT138 |	But they don't get
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,559	| IOT138 |	I hear you they speak English
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,583	| IOT138 |	Something speak
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,447	| IOT138 |	Alright let's get back to Google see I lied to
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:08,543	| IOT138 |	I told you the truth cuz I think I said we're going to come back to it
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,823	| IOT138 |	Not
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| IOT138 |	Associated with smart
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:13,151	| IOT138 |	They have their tensorflow
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,455	| IOT138 |	Will have chips they have
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:21,855	| IOT138 |	And they now have machine learning for embedded devices
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,391	| IOT138 |	Big trend
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,927	| IOT138 |	For next year so
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,439	| IOT138 |	Oak Avenue
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,791	| IOT138 |	Yasso tensorflow Lite is what they announced this week
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:36,191	| IOT138 |	It is a developer preview basically the lightweight version of tensorflow do they use for their Ai and machine learning
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:40,543	| IOT138 |	This is specifically geared as you said Stacy towards embedded devices also mobile devices
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,591	| IOT138 |	So your Android phones in particular
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:47,199	| IOT138 |	I'm more interested in the iot type devices embedded devices because
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,271	| IOT138 |	We think about adding machine learning to these things now instead of
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:54,367	| IOT138 |	Theoretically you automating things based on potential trigger events and so on
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,927	| IOT138 |	Things can happen based on an event
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,975	| IOT138 |	That machine has learned
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,487	| IOT138 |	Essentially
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:04,095	| IOT138 |	Perfect example I think is I forget the name of it
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:07,423	| IOT138 |	There's not a platform built on tensorflow that does image
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,703	| IOT138 |	Enhancement for example
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,007	| IOT138 |	And it starts to
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:15,103	| IOT138 |	Take an image that's kind of muddied and it will apply the machine learning to a tank
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,871	| IOT138 |	Clear it up
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:19,455	| IOT138 |	So basically what looks like a fuzzy picture becomes a crystal clear picture of
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,735	| IOT138 |	Exactly what it should be
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,551	| IOT138 |	Sewing machine has learned what something is supposed to look
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:26,879	| IOT138 |	So I'm thinking for image recognition maybe in the Smart Home
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,903	| IOT138 |	This could be
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:32,511	| IOT138 |	A tremendous tremendous value but that's just one of many possible avenues for this
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,327	| IOT138 |	You don't have in your Roomba have
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| IOT138 |	Processing
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,887	| IOT138 |	Actually recognized
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| IOT138 |	Furniture
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,959	| IOT138 |	I know it's Pat but I can tell you that
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,775	| IOT138 |	My cabinets definitely have little Roomba
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,287	| IOT138 |	Ruffles
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,335	| IOT138 |	Bam Bam
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,663	| IOT138 |	So that kind of stuff
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:55,807	| IOT138 |	Would be helpful also things like learning who people are in their emotions around the house that's definitely something that you
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,599	| IOT138 |	What companies are investing in
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,111	| IOT138 |	All kinds of
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,415	| IOT138 |	So I'm excited about this
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,975	| IOT138 |	I would tie it to
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,511	| IOT138 |	A couple things one
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,815	| IOT138 |	Intel bought a company called movidius
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,607	| IOT138 |	And status
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,423	| IOT138 |	Computer vision on the device which is really in
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:17,055	| IOT138 |	So they have an effort and play here and they actually launched a dongle it's a little
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,335	| IOT138 |	Basically neural network stick
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| IOT138 |	They can train things at the edge
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,711	| IOT138 |	And then Qualcomm also has a very
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,247	| IOT138 |	Big effort income
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| IOT138 |	Computer vision at
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| IOT138 |	The edge
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,551	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,575	| IOT138 |	What we're seeing
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,087	| IOT138 |	When is
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:33,183	| IOT138 |	Trend in kind of a shift in thinking so we used to think
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:37,023	| IOT138 |	With machine learning there's two elements Thursday
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:41,375	| IOT138 |	Learning part where you're training a computer model and that's done on gpus and in the cloud
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,911	| IOT138 |	And then there's the execution site
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| IOT138 |	Which has been done
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| IOT138 |	At the edge
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:46,751	| IOT138 |	Andon
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,055	| IOT138 |	What we're seeing
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:52,639	| IOT138 |	Is this idea that maybe we can do some basic training
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:57,759	| IOT138 |	Even so build models on the device that's where the industry is trying to
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,063	| IOT138 |	I don't know if we're ever go
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:00,831	| IOT138 |	Can I get there but
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:04,415	| IOT138 |	I think if we're going to get there they're going to need this type of
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:10,559	| IOT138 |	Technology where that comes from Google or somebody else is irrelevant that's what's needed for sure and just to set that one second
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,399	| IOT138 |	Deep dream that's the computer vision program I was thinking about you look it up
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:20,799	| IOT138 |	But if you take a look online at Deep dream you can see visually what I was talking about Google uses the tensorflow for the smart reply
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,103	| IOT138 |	I seen lot of its messaging applications
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:27,199	| IOT138 |	And that reason context of a message and provide you with your three possible
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,271	| IOT138 |	Are multiple possible responses that actually make sense contextually
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,439	| IOT138 |	This is true this this is true but think about this
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| IOT138 |	Instead of just getting
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:41,023	| IOT138 |	Smart home notifications for example that are just
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:41,791	| IOT138 |	Pretty cans
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,583	| IOT138 |	And are always the same
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,119	| IOT138 |	How about something with more context
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| IOT138 |	Casino such as
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,911	| IOT138 |	Well I just
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,983	| IOT138 |	I get tired of the door has opened or disclosed kind of things
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,287	| IOT138 |	Maybe it should say so and so just step through the door
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,079	| IOT138 |	What is home
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,103	| IOT138 |	I said that's where we're going
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,127	| IOT138 |	I think I agree with you
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,687	| IOT138 |	Superfund super inter
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| IOT138 |	Christine
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:10:59,967	| IOT138 |	Supra eKEY
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,295	| IOT138 |	All right
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,623	| IOT138 |	There's some
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,391	| IOT138 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,207	| IOT138 |	SmartThings is getting an update later
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:10,975	| IOT138 |	This week
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,255	| IOT138 |	Actually
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:12,767	| IOT138 |	Local
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:19,935	| IOT138 |	Because it has
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,567	| IOT138 |	Spell but even if you don't have cellular backup
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:31,711	| IOT138 |	What's going to happen is for your lights and some alarms they're going to be able to run locally on the Hub
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,247	| IOT138 |	Which means if your internet goes out
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,063	| IOT138 |	You will still have your lights turn on and off
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,599	| IOT138 |	But this will only happen
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,879	| IOT138 |	If you have it on a schedule
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:42,463	| IOT138 |	If you're like me and you have a lot of stuff to set to sunrise and sunset
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,231	| IOT138 |	It's not going to
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:43,999	| IOT138 |	Is that actually
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,511	| IOT138 |	The cloud
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:48,095	| IOT138 |	Sprite well that's kind of a shame because
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:51,167	| IOT138 |	If a device is still on even though it doesn't have a connection is not like the
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:54,495	| IOT138 |	The time has gone down the time just continues on the on the Hub
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,519	| IOT138 |	That's really weird
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,311	| IOT138 |	Well it's because they have to pull out
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,639	| IOT138 |	Get the different the different time every day I get that
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,687	| IOT138 |	Awesome
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| IOT138 |	Here's where we should be going
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,271	| IOT138 |	Pull that time down
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,551	| IOT138 |	Store it locally
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,343	| IOT138 |	And then keep it for a day
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,391	| IOT138 |	24 hours
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,671	| IOT138 |	That would be
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,207	| IOT138 |	A fun way to go
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,743	| IOT138 |	Maybe someone
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,839	| IOT138 |	And it's kind of complicated
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,887	| IOT138 |	They've got child apps
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,423	| IOT138 |	The SmartThings app
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT138 |	This is really
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,983	| IOT138 |	I'm getting back into smart
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,031	| IOT138 |	Set of a hiatus
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,847	| IOT138 |	Maybe we'll do a special segment just that
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,687	| IOT138 |	It's a good idea so that's actually a hub update
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,711	| IOT138 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,991	| IOT138 |	Your house
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:42,367	| IOT138 |	That's a later this week there's actually been an app update this week as well
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:47,487	| IOT138 |	Which hopefully people happy about interviews and getting back into smart thing so maybe you can give it a try
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,535	| IOT138 |	They've added scenes
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,815	| IOT138 |	Which is nice to have
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,119	| IOT138 |	As well as visitor lock
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,423	| IOT138 |	Code-switch I love the idea that
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,447	| IOT138 |	I don't think I have that
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,007	| IOT138 |	Today on my system so I would like that
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,055	| IOT138 |	And also a fingerprint authentication for the app
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,823	| IOT138 |	Which
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,359	| IOT138 |	Alicia already have that anyway but
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| IOT138 |	The scenes in a lock code
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:07,455	| IOT138 |	The two big he's here so you can go update your SmartThings app
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| IOT138 |	Codes are
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,527	| IOT138 |	I can issue lock
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:17,951	| IOT138 |	That's correct you can because in the developer notes of release notes it says create unique lock code for visitors to a
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT138 |	Access your home
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| IOT138 |	Very funny
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| IOT138 |	Speaking of locks
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,583	| IOT138 |	I should let anyone know
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,911	| IOT138 |	If you're using the Comcast Xfinity home
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,423	| IOT138 |	Set up
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,215	| IOT138 |	And services
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,519	| IOT138 |	They actually just added for different
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,543	| IOT138 |	Kwikset locks
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,567	| IOT138 |	To their plot
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,847	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,615	| IOT138 |	Yay
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:39,711	| IOT138 |	Stacey's happy
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,503	| IOT138 |	Kwikset locks on my game
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,855	| IOT138 |	If you're going that route in the August locks but
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| IOT138 |	This way
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,671	| IOT138 |	It's all in the same place
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,231	| IOT138 |	It's fine we should actually maybe we should
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:51,999	| IOT138 |	You talk a little bit about
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| IOT138 |	Lox B
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:56,095	| IOT138 |	Because one of the other stories that I saw this week
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,631	| IOT138 |	Was
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,399	| IOT138 |	John Cena
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:02,495	| IOT138 |	Which two thing up coverage there is latches teaming up with
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,263	| IOT138 |	The company called
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,031	| IOT138 |	Comelit
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,567	| IOT138 |	4 Apartments
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,103	| IOT138 |	And latches a lock
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,919	| IOT138 |	How late is a intercom
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:14,271	| IOT138 |	Picture and I actually get a lot of questions for people who live in
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,807	| IOT138 |	Apartments about how they
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:18,879	| IOT138 |	Can integrate their smart locks with control of the internet
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,927	| IOT138 |	Any answer right now is
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,439	| IOT138 |	You really can't
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,231	| IOT138 |	But
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:27,071	| IOT138 |	What this does is there saying that this intercom
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,095	| IOT138 |	Company is going to work
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,119	| IOT138 |	With these smart
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,399	| IOT138 |	Lakme curso comelit
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,191	| IOT138 |	It's another intercom
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:32,959	| IOT138 |	Company is nelo
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:37,311	| IOT138 |	They have said in the past that they're going to do something like this but
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:37,823	| IOT138 |	They haven't
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,103	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:41,919	| IOT138 |	I thought this was interesting cuz I get so many questions from
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| IOT138 |	People saying
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,223	| IOT138 |	Hey
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:49,343	| IOT138 |	I want to be able to Grant entry to someone and not just into my apartment but all the way up to
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:50,879	| IOT138 |	My door
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,903	| IOT138 |	Wish I could be
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:55,231	| IOT138 |	Kind of it feels like where we're going if you think about
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,791	| IOT138 |	Amazon key
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| IOT138 |	August in the
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,583	| IOT138 |	Their access program
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| IOT138 |	Image taken
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,167	| IOT138 |	Talk about this
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| IOT138 |	Dislike
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,471	| IOT138 |	What you need to let people in
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,519	| IOT138 |	You know Amazon needs a camera
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,799	| IOT138 |	As somebody point
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,079	| IOT138 |	In and out
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,847	| IOT138 |	Fraud detection
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,431	| IOT138 |	And for you to know who's coming and going
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,735	| IOT138 |	August is the same thing they use their doorbell
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,015	| IOT138 |	They also I think
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,551	| IOT138 |	With Nest on that
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,319	| IOT138 |	Do we really want
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,855	| IOT138 |	I mean
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,927	| IOT138 |	In general or I mean if I lived in an apartment complex
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,719	| IOT138 |	Sexy I think I would want this
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,767	| IOT138 |	You know I'm not home somebody buzzes
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| IOT138 |	The intercom
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,327	| IOT138 |	Person that the
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,095	| IOT138 |	Front desk
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:35,679	| IOT138 |	Says they're not home and sends me an alert and I can decide to let them in my
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| IOT138 |	Apartment or not
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:36,959	| IOT138 |	I kind of like that
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,495	| IOT138 |	As for my house
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| IOT138 |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,335	| IOT138 |	I just mentioned before the show that I'm thinking about getting out
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:44,383	| IOT138 |	Ring doorbell for the front door
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:48,223	| IOT138 |	And I may have to figure out how to make it work to
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:53,855	| IOT138 |	Unlock my door if I want the door unlocked like maybe I want the UPS guy to put something in my house cuz I'm not home
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,879	| IOT138 |	I can just unlock the door for me
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,159	| IOT138 |	I know it's him
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,951	| IOT138 |	Die, I like it
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| IOT138 |	But I managed case
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,023	| IOT138 |	Yeah and I'm still like
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:07,423	| IOT138 |	I think about the number of people who don't want like an Amazon Echo in their home because it's always listening and I'm thinking those people are probably not going to let
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| IOT138 |	UPS guy in
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,727	| IOT138 |	Warehouse
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,495	| IOT138 |	No
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,287	| IOT138 |	So we definitely wouldn't I mean it's
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:16,127	| IOT138 |	To me it's if you bought into the whole smart home especially with cameras
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,407	| IOT138 |	Lifestyle so to speak
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,687	| IOT138 |	Then
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,967	| IOT138 |	Yeah you would want this
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:20,991	| IOT138 |	Otherwise probably not
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,575	| IOT138 |	Well here we have it yes I'm still puzzling over this
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:26,879	| IOT138 |	I'm still
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,927	| IOT138 |	That's okay
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,207	| IOT138 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,999	| IOT138 |	Your review of
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:32,511	| IOT138 |	The wing
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,071	| IOT138 |	Cuz we both got
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,583	| IOT138 |	Toys
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,679	| IOT138 |	Okay I'm scratching my head a little bit over the wink Lookout
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:41,471	| IOT138 |	So let me start off by saying that
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:46,591	| IOT138 |	And the reason scratching my head is not because it doesn't do what
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,615	| IOT138 |	It advertises
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,919	| IOT138 |	To do because it does basically
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,735	| IOT138 |	In the lookout can't you get a Wink 2 hub
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:57,087	| IOT138 |	You get two door window sensors magnetic sensors that are Z-Wave
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,159	| IOT138 |	You get a motion sensor again
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:00,927	| IOT138 |	Aussie wave
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,743	| IOT138 |	And you get a siren
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,255	| IOT138 |	Also see
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,303	| IOT138 |	Pairing everything
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:11,935	| IOT138 |	I did struggle a little bit and I find this a lot with Z-Wave devices I have to be really close to the hub
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,727	| IOT138 |	And I don't know if that's your experience Stacey but
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,031	| IOT138 |	I really loved when the wing
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| IOT138 |	Cub went Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,847	| IOT138 |	Special
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:23,455	| IOT138 |	I liked that about the wink Hub cuz I would just bring it with me to wherever I was trying to
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,015	| IOT138 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:29,343	| IOT138 |	And that I did that exactly that when I did my zwave door lock
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,111	| IOT138 |	So that's
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,879	| IOT138 |	You're right
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,159	| IOT138 |	In this case these
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,695	| IOT138 |	Little devices are all
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,535	| IOT138 |	Small enough for me to just walk up stairs and go next to the wink Hub while I'm in the
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,559	| IOT138 |	Setup program
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:39,839	| IOT138 |	Once I did that cuz I
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,631	| IOT138 |	I was trying to do it from a couple runs away was not working
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,423	| IOT138 |	Once I got close
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,191	| IOT138 |	Everything paired fine
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:46,239	| IOT138 |	The motion sensors
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| IOT138 |	Are super
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,871	| IOT138 |	Super super good my opinion there are at least five different sensitivity settings so you can
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,943	| IOT138 |	You know if you got pets and things you can reduce the settings
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| IOT138 |	You can
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:59,295	| IOT138 |	Say don't send me alerts unless there's motion for more than
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:02,623	| IOT138 |	1 2 5 10 minutes whatever you like that I like
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,951	| IOT138 |	The door window sensors also work well no problems there
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:08,255	| IOT138 |	I will say in this is not specific to wink
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:14,655	| IOT138 |	I have like traditional molding around my door so the molding is not flat which makes it very difficult to attach
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,703	| IOT138 |	A door window sensor of any kind
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,471	| IOT138 |	To it
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,775	| IOT138 |	So just say that for people who have
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| IOT138 |	Similar molding
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:21,823	| IOT138 |	Have some issues there
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,103	| IOT138 |	But again that's industry-wide is not a
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,383	| IOT138 |	Knock on wink at all
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,919	| IOT138 |	The siren
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,735	| IOT138 |	As a chime feature which I like or you can have it now
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,807	| IOT138 |	Blaring really loud alert alert you know
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,599	| IOT138 |	Three different volume settings on that which is
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:36,927	| IOT138 |	Just good sided forgot my dog is everything connected really well
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:41,791	| IOT138 |	And there is I think everybody should have this now in the Wing Cap there's a new look out Prada
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:46,143	| IOT138 |	But it's not a product per se because it's more of a
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,959	| IOT138 |	I'll call a platform or a way to get into the
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,983	| IOT138 |	Lookout settings
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:57,407	| IOT138 |	When you go in there you can actually see what you can connect and even though they didn't send me this I was able to connect my nest camera
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| IOT138 |	2
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,967	| IOT138 |	The lookout settings
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:02,527	| IOT138 |	What Lookout actually does it's an alert system
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:05,087	| IOT138 |	And that sounds like will shortz a security system
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:07,903	| IOT138 |	What I mean by that is anytime any of these things
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,951	| IOT138 |	Text motion or a like that
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,743	| IOT138 |	You will get an alert
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,303	| IOT138 |	When you get the alert on your phone in the app
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,607	| IOT138 |	You can choose to sound the siren
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,399	| IOT138 |	You can choose to call 911
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,935	| IOT138 |	Choose to
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,703	| IOT138 |	Call a friend
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,471	| IOT138 |	So it's
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:26,847	| IOT138 |	Taken all of the security aspects and giving them to you and you decide what you want to happen
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:28,127	| IOT138 |	That works
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,407	| IOT138 |	But it also introduces some
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:36,319	| IOT138 |	Challenges and if you have a traditional security system obviously you got a keypad or way to disarm the system by a
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:39,391	| IOT138 |	Maybe with a new nest for example you can use an RFID tag
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,695	| IOT138 |	Swiper NFC tags
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,719	| IOT138 |	Parmer Dessau
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:47,327	| IOT138 |	There's no way to do that here and that I think is going to be a challenge because it's all at base
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,143	| IOT138 |	And one of the particular challenges in
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,191	| IOT138 |	I've set this up to automatically
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,983	| IOT138 |	Go on and alert for things
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| IOT138 |	From 11 at night
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,311	| IOT138 |	Until 5:30 in the morning so overnight
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,103	| IOT138 |	Somebody walks in the house through my front door
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,919	| IOT138 |	Or the door window sensor or motion sensor
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,735	| IOT138 |	Text the siren will go off cuz that's what I want to happen
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,271	| IOT138 |	What is my son
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:09,343	| IOT138 |	Works late comes in at 1 in the morning doesn't know
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| IOT138 |	If it systems on or not
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,647	| IOT138 |	Doesn't even have the app
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,231	| IOT138 |	I got to sign him in as me
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,559	| IOT138 |	And he's got it basically turn off the alerts before he walks in
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,839	| IOT138 |	And my family is not going to do that
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,887	| IOT138 |	So that's going to be a challenge
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,399	| IOT138 |	Yeah you're coming
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:27,519	| IOT138 |	You're starting to know that they're actually starting to now and that's
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:31,103	| IOT138 |	Actually why they don't have the Wink app installed because they don't need the app
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| IOT138 |	Because I just tell
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:33,919	| IOT138 |	The lights to go on and off as they need you now
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| IOT138 |	So that's crate at Amazon
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:40,319	| IOT138 |	Yeah which is great but now as they're engaging in that which is awesome
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,367	| IOT138 |	Now how do I get them to use the security system
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,903	| IOT138 |	Oh
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,439	| IOT138 |	I would say maybe voice recognition
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:48,511	| IOT138 |	Analog one day and then you could be like it's just me
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,303	| IOT138 |	And that would work but that's not going to happen
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| IOT138 |	Cuz the false positives
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| IOT138 |	Non-recognition
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,655	| IOT138 |	It's still pretty
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| IOT138 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,215	| IOT138 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,751	| IOT138 |	Amazon still doesn't know
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:20:59,263	| IOT138 |	Who I am
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,543	| IOT138 |	Really
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,335	| IOT138 |	Really it is the saddest
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:02,847	| IOT138 |	Satisfy
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,151	| IOT138 |	No personalization for Stacy
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,735	| IOT138 |	I haven't tried it in my house because again they just use the
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,271	| IOT138 |	Lights on lights off kind of stuff
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:13,087	| IOT138 |	What are the challenges is everyone has to have the
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:13,855	| IOT138 |	Their own
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT138 |	Mattimeo
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,952	| IOT138 |	Each of them on their own app
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| IOT138 |	2
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,512	| IOT138 |	You have to log out of you
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,048	| IOT138 |	Re-login is that
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,328	| IOT138 |	For each one
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,376	| IOT138 |	It's a little convoluted
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,144	| IOT138 |	Identity management
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:30,752	| IOT138 |	This sounds
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,568	| IOT138 |	And I was looking for a presence detection.
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,080	| IOT138 |	Tobias Forge
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:40,992	| IOT138 |	Disarm
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,016	| IOT138 |	You're right
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:45,600	| IOT138 |	I kind of feel like that's the missing piece here
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:50,464	| IOT138 |	And I understand why wink went this way because their feedback they've got
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:54,048	| IOT138 |	What they tell me they want people to be in control of their security systems
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| IOT138 |	A total control
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:57,120	| IOT138 |	And you do if there's no question them succeeded in this
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,680	| IOT138 |	This is perfect for somebody who lives alone
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,472	| IOT138 |	If you have to worry about those
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,752	| IOT138 |	Scenarios that I was talking about
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,312	| IOT138 |	Not right and you have total control but
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,592	| IOT138 |	It just feels like there's a
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,360	| IOT138 |	Piece missing
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,640	| IOT138 |	2
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,176	| IOT138 |	Truly arm disarm
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,688	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:13,760	| IOT138 |	You can do some automation bits and I've done some butt
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:19,392	| IOT138 |	It almost feels like they don't want you to in a sense cuz I don't really tell you how to set up robots
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,928	| IOT138 |	Their schedules or anyting
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:27,328	| IOT138 |	With this kit and I mentioned this to that man like I get who this kid is game four because as a hub you're talkin about first-time smart
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT138 |	Home buyers
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,376	| IOT138 |	But if you're talking about the buyers
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,424	| IOT138 |	You got to tell them how to do the automation bit
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:37,824	| IOT138 |	We've had to figure it out along the way we got good at it but connecting everything is fine but then how do you make it all work together
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,128	| IOT138 |	That's kind of missing for a new person I think
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:45,760	| IOT138 |	And again I just maybe some stuck in a traditional security mindset of this arm / disarm
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,552	| IOT138 |	But I think that's a lot of you think
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,320	| IOT138 |	Stihl.
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,624	| IOT138 |	Well and I would say that in some ways that's
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,256	| IOT138 |	Because like when I was a kid growing up my parents had an alarm and they kept it
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| IOT138 |	On
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,560	| IOT138 |	So they'd hear the beep beep beep
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,584	| IOT138 |	When I open the door
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:06,752	| IOT138 |	Same here that you could hear it beep beep beep with the siren and the chime sure they're also potentially going to get
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,312	| IOT138 |	Notification after notification after notification on a smartphone
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:12,640	| IOT138 |	Like every time somebody walks past a motion sensor
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,504	| IOT138 |	200
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:21,088	| IOT138 |	Which is a good price and there's no monthly fee or anything because again
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:21,856	| IOT138 |	It's not
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,392	| IOT138 |	Professionally monitored it's
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:29,024	| IOT138 |	Immaturely monitored by you I don't think it's a bad product I just think it's probably for a very specific
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:29,792	| IOT138 |	Type of user
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,072	| IOT138 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:35,936	| IOT138 |	All right well if you're that kind of user you like hearing your smartphone you like notifications
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:39,008	| IOT138 |	You want to really know what's going on in your house this
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,032	| IOT138 |	Happy for you
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,312	| IOT138 |	All right
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,848	| IOT138 |	Before I get to my toy
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,384	| IOT138 |	We're actually going to take
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,664	| IOT138 |	AR

EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,936	| IOT138 |	Alright this week
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,216	| IOT138 |	On the iot
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:19,200	| IOT138 |	Iccl Kevin my name is Hugo and my calling from Montreal I sent
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:20,480	| IOT138 |	Tuesday
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,784	| IOT138 |	Asking her what she thought about
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,296	| IOT138 |	The wife
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:28,672	| IOT138 |	$20 1080p full HD night vision two-way audio camera
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,464	| IOT138 |	$20
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:34,048	| IOT138 |	Reviews from cdnuts last year
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:38,144	| IOT138 |	Call tmw my question is fairly simple is it safe to use
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:43,520	| IOT138 |	Secure where are those image going and more generally what should I look for
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,568	| IOT138 |	Or if I want to get any type of camera
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:49,408	| IOT138 |	The outside can is a little bit less worrisome for me but inside cam
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,456	| IOT138 |	Could be something that they don't hold it
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:54,016	| IOT138 |	More something I would think more about to wear
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:57,856	| IOT138 |	Data is going obviously there is an account be saved
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,624	| IOT138 |	For 7 days
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,160	| IOT138 |	The things that are recorded
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,696	| IOT138 |	So it's all good and it's very cheap
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,024	| IOT138 |	However I don't know if it's a
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:09,120	| IOT138 |	Thank you so much guys I will be looking out for an answer
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| IOT138 |	However you wished
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,168	| IOT138 |	I will about you
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:14,496	| IOT138 |	Okay good news for you Hugo
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,520	| IOT138 |	I just
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:18,080	| IOT138 |	Bought and received my wyze camera
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:21,152	| IOT138 |	My $20 tiny cute camera oh my gosh
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,432	| IOT138 |	It is adorable
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,712	| IOT138 |	And it works
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:25,504	| IOT138 |	And for your accused
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,088	| IOT138 |	It has a slot for an SD card
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,624	| IOT138 |	Which means it doesn't have to
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:38,048	| IOT138 |	If you are interested in where the stuff goes and I think it's smart of you to ask these questions
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,376	| IOT138 |	There are security breaches
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,936	| IOT138 |	Time so
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,704	| IOT138 |	With this
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:49,568	| IOT138 |	Can set up motion detection I set that up it seems pretty responsive so
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,128	| IOT138 |	And then when I open the app
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,408	| IOT138 |	I can see the live stream
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,944	| IOT138 |	I can record
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:57,248	| IOT138 |	My voice and talk to people
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,016	| IOT138 |	Over the cap
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| IOT138 |	Camera so that
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,320	| IOT138 |	That's good I can hear stuff
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,344	| IOT138 |	My sound off
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,136	| IOT138 |	I can hear stuff if I want
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,440	| IOT138 |	There is night vision
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:08,000	| IOT138 |	That seems to be pretty good although I haven't
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,024	| IOT138 |	Play with it in the app
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,328	| IOT138 |	End
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,608	| IOT138 |	If you go under settings
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,888	| IOT138 |	You can send
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:16,192	| IOT138 |	Vocal recording to a MicroSD card
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,264	| IOT138 |	So for twenty bucks
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:22,080	| IOT138 |	Sounds great Scott the SD card slot if you
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:25,920	| IOT138 |	Don't want to send the data to the storage card
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,736	| IOT138 |	Where can you save it or does it get sent to
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,528	| IOT138 |	It seems it on the app
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| IOT138 |	And then it shows
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:32,832	| IOT138 |	Photos on
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,160	| IOT138 |	Okay so it's not going to the cloud
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:36,672	| IOT138 |	Does not appear
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,768	| IOT138 |	Okay then there's a reason I ask this
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,536	| IOT138 |	That's because
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,328	| IOT138 |	I don't think we've yet figured out what the
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:50,240	| IOT138 |	Portico best and safest practices here for webcams because why don't we send the data to the cloud
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,264	| IOT138 |	Well cuz we don't want
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:53,056	| IOT138 |	The companies to
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,824	| IOT138 |	Have it
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,848	| IOT138 |	Can hack and so on and so forth
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,432	| IOT138 |	So you want an SD card slot okay that makes sense to
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,712	| IOT138 |	Which this. Is which is awesome
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:03,040	| IOT138 |	But if I'm breaking through the house and I see this thing
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:05,088	| IOT138 |	And I noticed there's a little
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,112	| IOT138 |	I'm making that card out
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,672	| IOT138 |	Rob my house
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:12,000	| IOT138 |	I mean I know it's an extreme example and I know what most people
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:14,560	| IOT138 |	Breaking into a house that probably aren't going to notice this but
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:17,632	| IOT138 |	I just there's like no guarantee you'd have the date at that point
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,936	| IOT138 |	This is the same debate I had
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:22,752	| IOT138 |	Like 10 years ago when I started uploading all my CDs
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:23,520	| IOT138 |	Is 2
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,288	| IOT138 |	My
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,312	| IOT138 |	Terabyte drive
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:29,408	| IOT138 |	I was like I have converted all my CDs to you know
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,432	| IOT138 |	Flac files
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,480	| IOT138 |	And it took a long time it was a lot of work
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,248	| IOT138 |	Working then
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,528	| IOT138 |	I put them on my
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:37,344	| IOT138 |	Local hardware but then I was like what happens if this fails
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,904	| IOT138 |	So then I was like okay I'll buy Carbonite backup
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:41,696	| IOT138 |	This is
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,232	| IOT138 |	It's the same kind of situation
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:49,632	| IOT138 |	Yeah but it's a dilemma that I think is it's more personal here because now it's pictures inside your house
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,704	| IOT138 |	So I think people need to decide
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,728	| IOT138 |	Am I going to trust
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,264	| IOT138 |	Any company with this
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:58,848	| IOT138 |	And if so pick that company and get a camera that works with that company
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,384	| IOT138 |	Or no I'm not going to
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:06,784	| IOT138 |	Trusted company have an SD card slot and manage it myself and hope that nobody takes the card slot or just walks away with a camera
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:11,136	| IOT138 |	And I'm in if they walk away the camera then they walk away with the SD card
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,160	| IOT138 |	Portable
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,440	| IOT138 |	It's exactly
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:17,024	| IOT138 |	Yes I mean it's it looks like a camera
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:24,704	| IOT138 |	You can tell it would have signs you can tell it's a camera I mean ultimately what I guess what we really want is
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:26,496	| IOT138 |	Hidden camera so to speak to that way
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,544	| IOT138 |	You wouldn't have to worry about somebody walk
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,080	| IOT138 |	And or the data on it
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,640	| IOT138 |	Well then you can turn the indicator light on or off
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,944	| IOT138 |	So I could put this in and out of
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:40,064	| IOT138 |	See I returned that indicator off if I'm going to store to an SD card together
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,136	| IOT138 |	I will also tell you guys
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,672	| IOT138 |	I rather you go I will tell
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,976	| IOT138 |	Netatmo
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:49,792	| IOT138 |	Welcome camera also stores data to
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,584	| IOT138 |	Either an SD card or your own
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:52,608	| IOT138 |	To be server
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,912	| IOT138 |	Which might be an interesting
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,424	| IOT138 |	Way to
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,728	| IOT138 |	If you set it up to the store to your server
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,776	| IOT138 |	Someone
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,544	| IOT138 |	You have to take your server
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,896	| IOT138 |	Yep I'm making that again
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,176	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:09,248	| IOT138 |	It's a nice camera I like it alot I like it actually more than the
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,272	| IOT138 |	Best camps
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:10,784	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:16,160	| IOT138 |	Although some people complain about that Atmos customer service and they are not wrong to
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:18,208	| IOT138 |	Is there a French company and they tend to be
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:19,488	| IOT138 |	Less responsive
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,768	| IOT138 |	They are eventually respond
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,304	| IOT138 |	They're not
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,376	| IOT138 |	That is
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,400	| IOT138 |	Really all the news
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,168	| IOT138 |	To print this week
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,544	| IOT138 |	Cabinet
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,128	| IOT138 |	You can say hi to us
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,640	| IOT138 |	PCS around
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:40,480	| IOT138 |	Too at the end of November November 30th I will be

EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:20,160	| IOT138 |	He talks about some really cool stuff
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:26,560	| IOT138 |	And if you're going to say yes you'll be able to see it in person
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:31,936	| IOT138 |	From The Internet of Things podcast from our sponsor
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:36,032	| IOT138 |	Cognition and I've got Stewart killing here to talk to us about
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:39,104	| IOT138 |	Promise is critical infrastructure
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,384	| IOT138 |	The powers
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:41,152	| IOT138 |	Just about
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:43,456	| IOT138 |	Alright Stewart
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:48,320	| IOT138 |	Sparkcognition is using a improve safety and reliability
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:51,648	| IOT138 |	Can you give me some real examples of ways that utilities
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:53,440	| IOT138 |	Are using
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:55,744	| IOT138 |	To offer more advanced
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,280	| IOT138 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,840	| IOT138 |	Absolutely for example we're working with
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,120	| IOT138 |	One of the largest
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:03,680	| IOT138 |	Producers of wind energy in the country invenergy
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| IOT138 |	And we're working with them
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:05,984	| IOT138 |	To be able to
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,752	| IOT138 |	To help.
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,288	| IOT138 |	Specific
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,080	| IOT138 |	Donuts on their wind turbines
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,128	| IOT138 |	Very specifically on there
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:12,640	| IOT138 |	Gearbox
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,968	| IOT138 |	On turbine and what we're doing is we're taking the same techniques
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,760	| IOT138 |	Facial intelligence
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:19,552	| IOT138 |	Machine learning algorithms
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,344	| IOT138 |	Using our Technologies in art
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,648	| IOT138 |	Tools and what we're providing them is
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,672	| IOT138 |	Lead time
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,464	| IOT138 |	In terms of failure
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:26,976	| IOT138 |	Prediction
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,256	| IOT138 |	For the
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,024	| IOT138 |	Gearbox
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| IOT138 |	Does AKA
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,072	| IOT138 |	Opponents of the
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,120	| IOT138 |	Turbine are about to sail
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:37,728	| IOT138 |	I love it so how can machine learning improve equipment reliability and
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,520	| IOT138 |	Performance
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:42,592	| IOT138 |	We're working with some of the leading utilities
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:44,640	| IOT138 |	We're looking at operations on their gas
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:48,736	| IOT138 |	Part of that what we're able to do is we're able to identify
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,504	| IOT138 |	Operation
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:50,528	| IOT138 |	Conditions that
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,552	| IOT138 |	Their subject matter expert
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:52,832	| IOT138 |	Want to wear a
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,624	| IOT138 |	Before implementing an AI tool
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,416	| IOT138 |	What this allows them to
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| IOT138 |	To do is run
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,464	| IOT138 |	Machinery more efficient
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:00,000	| IOT138 |	Understand better
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,792	| IOT138 |	When it needs to be taken offline
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,560	| IOT138 |	Scheduled
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,352	| IOT138 |	Maintenance and really this helps
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:06,400	| IOT138 |	Improve their bottom line both from
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| IOT138 |	Keeping the machine running
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,472	| IOT138 |	As well as reducing maintenance
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:11,520	| IOT138 |	Cost from unexpected breakdown
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,288	| IOT138 |	Failures
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,080	| IOT138 |	Okay so you mentioned humans
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,128	| IOT138 |	What is the role of human subject matter
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,176	| IOT138 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:21,760	| IOT138 |	We still find that there's a tremendous value in the
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,528	| IOT138 |	The subject matter expert
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,320	| IOT138 |	As you mentioned them humans
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,600	| IOT138 |	May I at least in
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:28,416	| IOT138 |	Some of the industrial world where it can be sort of Celsius
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT138 |	Sustaining
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:31,744	| IOT138 |	There's still a lot of information about
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,768	| IOT138 |	We might come up with
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,280	| IOT138 |	The result
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:35,584	| IOT138 |	And we really need the humans
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,120	| IOT138 |	To help us understand
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,144	| IOT138 |	What does
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:38,912	| IOT138 |	Results are telling
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,960	| IOT138 |	So our goal isn't necessarily.
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:42,240	| IOT138 |	Replace the humor
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,288	| IOT138 |	Can we augment their capability
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:47,104	| IOT138 |	Instead of them taking a shotgun approach
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,128	| IOT138 |	Looking at every
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:50,944	| IOT138 |	Machine all the time because they really don't understand
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,480	| IOT138 |	If we can help them with a i
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,784	| IOT138 |	Focus their information Focus
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,296	| IOT138 |	Is there knowledge
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,088	| IOT138 |	Specific use cases
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,856	| IOT138 |	Pacific problem
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,160	| IOT138 |	Seen and then allow them to
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,184	| IOT138 |	Is there expert
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,720	| IOT138 |	They can augment
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:03,744	| IOT138 |	The outcomes
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,536	| IOT138 |	Lisa thinking about

EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:47,520	| IOT138 |	An innovation for the city of Las Vegas
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,544	| IOT138 |	Hi Michael how are you doing today
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,592	| IOT138 |	I'm doing well thank you for having me
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,896	| IOT138 |	Excited because
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,944	| IOT138 |	Cuz I went to Vegas a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:58,016	| IOT138 |	And Michael took me on this wonderful tour
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,320	| IOT138 |	Around central or Vegas downtown Las Vegas
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,624	| IOT138 |	Downtown is correct
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:08,768	| IOT138 |	And I got to see all kinds of crazy street lights and things that most normal people would not be excited about
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:12,096	| IOT138 |	The thing that most impressed me though
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,376	| IOT138 |	Was
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,144	| IOT138 |	Is it you
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:17,984	| IOT138 |	You're the coolest job in the world so you are thinking about how to make cities smarter
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:19,264	| IOT138 |	Not just any
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:22,592	| IOT138 |	Stereotypical hey let's put a lot of sensors and cameras on lamp posts
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,104	| IOT138 |	Switch we will talk
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,432	| IOT138 |	But you seem to have a broader vision of how to make the city
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,968	| IOT138 |	So let's
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,528	| IOT138 |	Heart with your overall what's your pervy
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,296	| IOT138 |	What is it
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,320	| IOT138 |	That you're there to do in
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,112	| IOT138 |	Willis
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,648	| IOT138 |	To connect the community
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:38,208	| IOT138 |	And provide new avenues of a fish
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:42,304	| IOT138 |	C4 citizens and I like to call people that come to the city consumers
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,328	| IOT138 |	Whether you live here
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,376	| IOT138 |	Or you're visiting your
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,656	| IOT138 |	Assuming our product
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:48,704	| IOT138 |	We want to do is really have
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,984	| IOT138 |	Your experience
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,800	| IOT138 |	In Las Vegas be one-of-a-kind and if we can do that
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,080	| IOT138 |	Through iot
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:56,128	| IOT138 |	Technology to LP transversal
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:59,968	| IOT138 |	City a little bit more efficiently provide you with locations
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:00,736	| IOT138 |	Parking
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:04,576	| IOT138 |	Make the air around you more enjoyable or healthy
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:07,904	| IOT138 |	I just provide you a level of safety that you have while you're here
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,952	| IOT138 |	What is extremely important in
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:11,232	| IOT138 |	We really believe
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,560	| IOT138 |	The iot and The Internet of Things in general
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,864	| IOT138 |	Play a major role in that experience
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,680	| IOT138 |	All right in a lot of people are really
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,192	| IOT138 |	Stoat
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,216	| IOT138 |	About smarts
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:24,032	| IOT138 |	But it's also a huge
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,848	| IOT138 |	It's a huge project you can't just wave a magic wand
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:29,664	| IOT138 |	Or if your Google I guess you can buy 800 acres
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,456	| IOT138 |	In Toronto and just rebuild
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| IOT138 |	But
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:35,296	| IOT138 |	As someone who's working with an existing infrastructure
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:37,856	| IOT138 |	What do you think are the first things a city should
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| IOT138 |	Maybe
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,184	| IOT138 |	Connect or maybe it's just the first things they should consider
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:44,512	| IOT138 |	I think the first thing to consider is starting something have a plan
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,816	| IOT138 |	Understand what your priorities are we have
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,584	| IOT138 |	5 priority
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:50,144	| IOT138 |	But I understand what those priorities are
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:56,544	| IOT138 |	Have a plan but I think a lot of my peers the thing is they don't start anything they talk a lot they have a lot of plans
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,568	| IOT138 |	He never actually X
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:00,384	| IOT138 |	Anything I think what we do uniquely here
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:02,432	| IOT138 |	Is we do lots of pilot project
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,968	| IOT138 |	And try a lots of
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,480	| IOT138 |	For technology
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,016	| IOT138 |	Find out
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,808	| IOT138 |	Nothing like in a real lab environment
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,088	| IOT138 |	Knowing
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:11,392	| IOT138 |	If something works or doesn't you really don't know
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:15,744	| IOT138 |	You put it out into the field the downtown Las Vegas area we really set up as a
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:18,048	| IOT138 |	Technology we caught the Innovation District
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:20,096	| IOT138 |	Are we set up this area we can really
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:20,864	| IOT138 |	Test
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:21,888	| IOT138 |	Improve out things
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,936	| IOT138 |	Before we make large investment
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:26,240	| IOT138 |	In any one particular technology
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,568	| IOT138 |	People tracking in The Innovation disc
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,616	| IOT138 |	To count things like hay
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,920	| IOT138 |	There are x number of people who walked by this place
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:37,760	| IOT138 |	In a given time. And that's great for the economic
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,808	| IOT138 |	Chotu
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,576	| IOT138 |	Like Starbucks
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,880	| IOT138 |	Yeah that's that mean we've had really good
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,648	| IOT138 |	Exceso
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:47,488	| IOT138 |	We have now 50 of Those sensors throughout the downtown area
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,536	| IOT138 |	And we're counting not just people but
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:52,096	| IOT138 |	The difference between Motor Vehicles
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,120	| IOT138 |	Pedestrian
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,888	| IOT138 |	And cycle
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:55,936	| IOT138 |	So now we're able to
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,984	| IOT138 |	Take that data and show Developers
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,288	| IOT138 |	And local business owners
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:02,848	| IOT138 |	Here's the amount of people that foot traffic that comes
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:03,616	| IOT138 |	By weather
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:09,248	| IOT138 |	Vehicle and it's important to know if it's in a vehicle or walking by your location and in the past
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:13,600	| IOT138 |	The city would only send a surveyor out maybe once a year and it was sitting in a lawn chair in
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:18,464	| IOT138 |	Everything manually now we have these sensors that are constantly on 24 hours a day
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:19,744	| IOT138 |	7 days a week
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,536	| IOT138 |	And now we'll start we have these traffic
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:27,680	| IOT138 |	Patterns now that we can actually see the number of people and then if they're in a vehicle versus pedestrian versus a cyclist
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:30,496	| IOT138 |	And we really think economic wise
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,520	| IOT138 |	That's going to be so
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,824	| IOT138 |	Great data that are Developers
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:36,384	| IOT138 |	And other business people will be excited about as well
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:39,200	| IOT138 |	So let's go back to the Innovation District
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,992	| IOT138 |	Because this is what we toured
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:41,760	| IOT138 |	Part of
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:44,064	| IOT138 |	And just talk to me a little bit about
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:45,344	| IOT138 |	How that came to be
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:46,880	| IOT138 |	What you're doing
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,952	| IOT138 |	Sure so in March of twenty
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:52,000	| IOT138 |	16 to the city council designated
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:56,096	| IOT138 |	A large area in the downtown Las Vegas area so for those of you that
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,120	| IOT138 |	Are familiar with
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,912	| IOT138 |	Las Vegas to Fremont Street
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,936	| IOT138 |	Experienced witches
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,704	| IOT138 |	Original
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:02,240	| IOT138 |	Las Vegas and
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:04,288	| IOT138 |	Incorporates several different
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,824	| IOT138 |	Areas around it
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:12,224	| IOT138 |	So when the city council built this Innovation District obviously we've included the Fremont Street which is all the casinos and hotels
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:13,248	| IOT138 |	That everybody knows and loves
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,040	| IOT138 |	About Las Vegas
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:19,392	| IOT138 |	But it also includes our Medical Center where we have our County Hospital A Private Hospital
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,928	| IOT138 |	Throw in a bunch of medical
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,464	| IOT138 |	Support facilities around it
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:24,000	| IOT138 |	Which we consider that our Medical
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,792	| IOT138 |	Subdistrict within the innovation
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,584	| IOT138 |	District we have some
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:29,376	| IOT138 |	Business districts as well
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:31,680	| IOT138 |	Business supporting the city as a whole
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,984	| IOT138 |	We have an area of social economic
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,520	| IOT138 |	Do we want to improve
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:37,056	| IOT138 |	We have all these little mini districts
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:39,360	| IOT138 |	What's in this Innovation District
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:39,872	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:42,944	| IOT138 |	Stay purpose of the Innovation District was to
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,992	| IOT138 |	Use it as a living lab
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,808	| IOT138 |	Truly test technology to test iot based
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:51,904	| IOT138 |	Tools and services to see how they work in a real environment
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| IOT138 |	And if they would be
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,696	| IOT138 |	Scalable
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:55,232	| IOT138 |	To be able to move across
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:57,280	| IOT138 |	Or the pool across the entire city
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:01,120	| IOT138 |	Some of the things we are doing in the downtown area as we have
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,144	| IOT138 |	Cameras at intersection
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:04,704	| IOT138 |	That are actually analyzing
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:10,592	| IOT138 |	People will believe a bag behind for security purposes was more of a security functionality we're using
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,616	| IOT138 |	Video Analytics
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:12,896	| IOT138 |	To look at parking spaces.
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,456	| IOT138 |	Occupied or unoccupied
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:18,272	| IOT138 |	Hide we're doing air quality to imagine
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:22,368	| IOT138 |	89 cars at a light and it's red we're looking at sampling the air quality
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,928	| IOT138 |	And then based on the carbon emissions
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,976	| IOT138 |	Does Vehicles changing the light to Green
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:31,072	| IOT138 |	So that we don't have carbon buildup in the downtown area
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:33,376	| IOT138 |	Where people are obviously outside walking
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,400	| IOT138 |	From venue to venue
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,704	| IOT138 |	So we try to manage all these different
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,472	| IOT138 |	Aspects
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,752	| IOT138 |	We're doing other things with
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,544	| IOT138 |	Radar now and lidar
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,312	| IOT138 |	Where
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,848	| IOT138 |	We are scanning intersection
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:45,664	| IOT138 |	Looking for people walking into the
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,944	| IOT138 |	The street that they do
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:48,480	| IOT138 |	Then we can turn the light red
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,528	| IOT138 |	Lots of Pilots around that
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,064	| IOT138 |	But the data that we collect
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,088	| IOT138 |	We make available to the
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:57,184	| IOT138 |	The public as well and hoping they find ways one of their businesses or citizens
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:40:02,048	| IOT138 |	Those are all really good in fact I learned several things just talking to you
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:03,072	| IOT138 |	One was
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:05,376	| IOT138 |	That you can't have one camera that does it all
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,144	| IOT138 |	You've got
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:10,240	| IOT138 |	I think I saw three cameras on a light post each one of them had a different job in your very
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:12,800	| IOT138 |	Helpful in explaining why that was so
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:15,104	| IOT138 |	Let's talk about some of the concrete things that you
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,640	| IOT138 |	Learned so far
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:19,712	| IOT138 |	Because I feel like when we talked about iot
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,504	| IOT138 |	We tend to get excited about
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:26,624	| IOT138 |	Really cool things that can happen but we neglect to think about all the Practical learning
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,392	| IOT138 |	Going to place
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:30,976	| IOT138 |	So things like oh yeah you need three cameras
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,280	| IOT138 |	So I don't know if you want to pick a project that
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,840	| IOT138 |	Changing the light for
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:37,120	| IOT138 |	Cars that are idling the
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,400	| IOT138 |	That might be an interesting thing
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:39,424	| IOT138 |	Everything she learned
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:41,216	| IOT138 |	Shirt woot
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:44,288	| IOT138 |	Probably the most fascinating one and I get the most
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,056	| IOT138 |	Questions on
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:48,640	| IOT138 |	Stuff the most complex one in the one we probably learned the most
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,944	| IOT138 |	As we've gone through this journey and continue our journey
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,760	| IOT138 |	But you would think the very simplest sounds
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:54,784	| IOT138 |	Sensor reaches
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:55,808	| IOT138 |	Is a certain level
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,832	| IOT138 |	Sends a signal
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:57,856	| IOT138 |	That signal turns
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,136	| IOT138 |	It changes a light green
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:00,672	| IOT138 |	It sounds simple
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,720	| IOT138 |	I penciled it out we worked on it at
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:08,096	| IOT138 |	It seems very easy but no we started learning quickly was obviously there's lots of little things that we weren't even
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,632	| IOT138 |	Paired for
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:14,240	| IOT138 |	One just getting the buy-in of everybody around you think it sounds really good and
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,008	| IOT138 |	People would want
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,288	| IOT138 |	Partaken nut
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:18,848	| IOT138 |	But as soon as you start talking about it there's a lot of
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:21,152	| IOT138 |	Well do we want to do this why are we doing this
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,944	| IOT138 |	So we had to break through Jess
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:24,736	| IOT138 |	The internal politics
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,504	| IOT138 |	Around Prague
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,272	| IOT138 |	Just like that
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,040	| IOT138 |	Tacitly
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:27,808	| IOT138 |	Is
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:29,600	| IOT138 |	Who's going to be the installer
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,880	| IOT138 |	Obviously the city hits
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,160	| IOT138 |	City traffic lights
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:34,208	| IOT138 |	We don't want a 3rd party installer doing it so you
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,488	| IOT138 |	You try to accommodate
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:42,400	| IOT138 |	That component of who's going to be responsible who's installing who's touching what when and then when you start getting into
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,936	| IOT138 |	Just more of
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,960	| IOT138 |	The actual interface
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,496	| IOT138 |	So
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,288	| IOT138 |	The air sensor Caesars we have
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,824	| IOT138 |	How to send it to a legacy
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,848	| IOT138 |	Traffic system
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:53,663	| IOT138 |	That's not current with what we could say current
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,943	| IOT138 |	Software standards
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:56,991	| IOT138 |	So we have to write an interface
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,807	| IOT138 |	In order to for it to do that and then add fail-safes
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,087	| IOT138 |	Into that interfaces
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:05,695	| IOT138 |	As well and so before you know it's something that I figured would be a 3245 damp
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:08,255	| IOT138 |	Implementation is now we're at 5 months
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:10,047	| IOT138 |	And we're close now to actually
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:10,559	| IOT138 |	Having it
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:13,119	| IOT138 |	Fully work the way we intended it
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,399	| IOT138 |	But the
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,935	| IOT138 |	Amount of time in the
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| IOT138 |	Enforce
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,727	| IOT138 |	Seeing things
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,495	| IOT138 |	That came up
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:21,311	| IOT138 |	Constantly required us to go back
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:23,615	| IOT138 |	And evolve the project revolve to specify
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:24,383	| IOT138 |	Applications
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,431	| IOT138 |	To get to the point where we are now or we ask
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,199	| IOT138 |	You have
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT138 |	We consider a functioning
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:31,039	| IOT138 |	Project same thing very similar with
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:33,087	| IOT138 |	Hazard light are intersect
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:36,671	| IOT138 |	Project you can use the lidar radar for two things one seeing a
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:37,695	| IOT138 |	Pedestrian
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:38,975	| IOT138 |	Walk across the
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:41,279	| IOT138 |	Street on a green when they should be waiting
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:43,071	| IOT138 |	The other thing would be for wrong way driver 210
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,607	| IOT138 |	It's on a one-way Street if
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,631	| IOT138 |	Cars going the wrong way
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:49,727	| IOT138 |	This radar lidar system would be able to
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:50,751	| IOT138 |	Have signage
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:51,775	| IOT138 |	On the street
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,567	| IOT138 |	Saying hey wrong way
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,847	| IOT138 |	Flash of the driver host
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,871	| IOT138 |	Reseda and stop
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,895	| IOT138 |	And realize you're on the wrong Street
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:59,199	| IOT138 |	Again sounds very simple
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:42:59,967	| IOT138 |	In concept
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:01,759	| IOT138 |	But it's actually taken
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:02,527	| IOT138 |	From concept
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:03,295	| IOT138 |	I'm putting it into the
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:07,647	| IOT138 |	Street itself and then seeing how it operates in making all the connection
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,415	| IOT138 |	Is a lot of it
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,695	| IOT138 |	Just the ticking this
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,999	| IOT138 |	Newer iot technology and have it work
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,023	| IOT138 |	With more Legacy taipei
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:14,815	| IOT138 |	Systems that just weren't designed
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:17,631	| IOT138 |	To accept the input that were trying to give
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:20,959	| IOT138 |	I'm working through that it's just takes a lot longer than in
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:24,799	| IOT138 |	What about so that's fair I deal with that whatever
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,103	| IOT138 |	Can imagine
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,895	| IOT138 |	When Public Safety is on the line
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:31,967	| IOT138 |	How much time do you spend thinking about
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,247	| IOT138 |	The rules of
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:33,759	| IOT138 |	This kind of
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:36,575	| IOT138 |	So I thought it was kind of funny
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:38,879	| IOT138 |	Just thinking about oh my gosh
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| IOT138 |	There's too much traffic building up
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,439	| IOT138 |	The air quality suffering
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,975	| IOT138 |	Turn the light green
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:47,071	| IOT138 |	Oh my gosh there's a pedestrian in the middle of the intersection don't do that
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:50,143	| IOT138 |	I just got to start thinking about how complicated that kind of
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,655	| IOT138 |	Rule setting
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,191	| IOT138 |	Might
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:57,055	| IOT138 |	B-but we discuss internal I mean so and then some of the fun things about the discussion is
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:59,359	| IOT138 |	Where tacotaco at the light or in the fishing industry
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:01,151	| IOT138 |	The kid was
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,175	| IOT138 |	It's kind of a troublemaker
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,199	| IOT138 |	Probably still in Canada
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,991	| IOT138 |	Troublemaker you were discussing
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,271	| IOT138 |	We actually had to come
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:07,551	| IOT138 |	What ifs
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,343	| IOT138 |	Kid on the sidewalk find out about the
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,111	| IOT138 |	What is lidar system
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:12,415	| IOT138 |	And jumps into the street and then jumps back over
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,463	| IOT138 |	How do we
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,767	| IOT138 |	How to prevent a bunch of people from jumping into this
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| IOT138 |	Rihanna Jump
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,559	| IOT138 |	Back over
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:20,095	| IOT138 |	And not having all the lights on
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:20,607	| IOT138 |	The city turn
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:21,887	| IOT138 |	Red
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:23,167	| IOT138 |	Could I be a safety
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,191	| IOT138 |	Concern
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,215	| IOT138 |	Some kind of prom suits
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:29,567	| IOT138 |	We actually do have some deep inside discussion and again we try to go towards
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:33,663	| IOT138 |	You're the reason we're doing a pedestrian goes back to one of our five principles which is
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:34,431	| IOT138 |	Public Safety
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:35,711	| IOT138 |	And so
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:38,015	| IOT138 |	We design around us but there's a lot of
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,807	| IOT138 |	People who know is there a problem
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:46,207	| IOT138 |	Accessories getting hit why are you doing this and answer is no we have a pretty low pedestrian fatality rate
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:47,487	| IOT138 |	But the same time
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,023	| IOT138 |	One fatality is one
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:49,791	| IOT138 |	Too many
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,583	| IOT138 |	So let's talk about dealing with citizens
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:52,351	| IOT138 |	Because
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:53,375	| IOT138 |	That is a
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,399	| IOT138 |	Challenge
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:58,751	| IOT138 |	To say the least there is concern about their concerns about privacy
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,031	| IOT138 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,055	| IOT138 |	They're also
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:06,431	| IOT138 |	You know concerns about your taxpayer dollars and where those go so someone once told me in smart cities
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:09,247	| IOT138 |	If you can't provide a citizen use case
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:10,527	| IOT138 |	The city council will not
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:11,039	| IOT138 |	Even listen to
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:12,319	| IOT138 |	Which is probably true
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,879	| IOT138 |	So how do you think about
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:16,415	| IOT138 |	Selling this and educated
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:17,695	| IOT138 |	The citizenry
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:20,767	| IOT138 |	But you brought up a lot of me a lot of great points so
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:25,631	| IOT138 |	Obviously privacy is a big deal a lot of people
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:26,655	| IOT138 |	Have no trouble
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:29,215	| IOT138 |	Going on to Facebook other social media application
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:31,519	| IOT138 |	Tell everybody I'm out of town
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,799	| IOT138 |	Having a great dinner
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,335	| IOT138 |	And don't think anything about
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,103	| IOT138 |	Privacy
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:37,407	| IOT138 |	In that regard yet in the government space
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,175	| IOT138 |	If I
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,455	| IOT138 |	Put out information
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:43,551	| IOT138 |	Before immediately suspect of that we already have a huge barrier
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,575	| IOT138 |	To overcome
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:46,623	| IOT138 |	I think a lot of what we're doing is
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:49,439	| IOT138 |	Around education right now and letting the
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:51,999	| IOT138 |	Actual population know what we're doing so
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:54,303	| IOT138 |	A lot of what we're doing is not
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,071	| IOT138 |	Users
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,119	| IOT138 |	Pacific yet we're working on some identity manager
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,399	| IOT138 |	Programs
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,959	| IOT138 |	The lot of what we're doing right now in the iot space
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:06,591	| IOT138 |	Is aligning what we believe our citizens needs with city council priorities
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:09,663	| IOT138 |	So when we talk about providing the temperature
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,943	| IOT138 |	And weather condition
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:16,319	| IOT138 |	Google say at a city park it's not just about providing that the citizens will see that part of it and will
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:18,879	| IOT138 |	Purdue sat on a website and on her mobile app so that people
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:21,183	| IOT138 |	Can get that data but we're also using that data
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:23,487	| IOT138 |	To find out when we need the water
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,255	| IOT138 |	The fields
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:24,767	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:27,583	| IOT138 |	What makes sense based on
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:28,351	| IOT138 |	Actual
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,375	| IOT138 |	Conditions at
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:31,679	| IOT138 |	The facility rather than just using the sprinkler timer
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,471	| IOT138 |	And timing it daily
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,495	| IOT138 |	So what are you saying
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:35,519	| IOT138 |	Different sensors
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:37,311	| IOT138 |	To achieve
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:39,615	| IOT138 |	What we consider multiple successes
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:43,711	| IOT138 |	But then the other piece on that is how do we use that data that were collecting
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,735	| IOT138 |	To help better the
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,015	| IOT138 |	The city internally
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:47,551	| IOT138 |	So how do we take that
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:50,367	| IOT138 |	Weather information and use it in our maintenance
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,159	| IOT138 |	2
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:55,743	| IOT138 |	Find better patterns on when the water knowing how many people are coming to
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,023	| IOT138 |	Parking at what time
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:58,559	| IOT138 |	So we can schedule maintenance
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:46:59,839	| IOT138 |	Mission operations around
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,631	| IOT138 |	When there's the least amount of people
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:02,399	| IOT138 |	At the
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:05,983	| IOT138 |	Facility a lot of data at a high level
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,031	| IOT138 |	And then looking at how
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:09,311	| IOT138 |	We can make it
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:10,335	| IOT138 |	A better experience
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,359	| IOT138 |	For all that are there
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:14,175	| IOT138 |	Now we are working on other products
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:16,479	| IOT138 |	And programs that use your specific
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:18,015	| IOT138 |	Identity inhabit
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,831	| IOT138 |	To build a better experience
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:21,855	| IOT138 |	But on those type of
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,135	| IOT138 |	Ideas
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:26,463	| IOT138 |	One you have to opt-in for it to privacy is a very big
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:29,279	| IOT138 |	Certain the laws here in our state
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:31,071	| IOT138 |	Still haven't caught up to the touch
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:31,839	| IOT138 |	Technology
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:35,935	| IOT138 |	So that's going to be a major challenge hopefully next legislative session
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:37,727	| IOT138 |	Will be able to have some additional protect
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:42,591	| IOT138 |	For the consumer as far as how we can use their data or not release it
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:43,615	| IOT138 |	So that there is
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:44,383	| IOT138 |	Privacy
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:47,455	| IOT138 |	For the individual at the same time that they have privacy
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:48,735	| IOT138 |	They get the benefits
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,759	| IOT138 |	What does technology
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:50,527	| IOT138 |	You can do for them
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:53,855	| IOT138 |	Let's go to your vision of the city of
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:56,159	| IOT138 |	The future cuz you're putting together some crazy stuff there
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:58,207	| IOT138 |	Let's visit Las Vegas in 10 years
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:03,839	| IOT138 |	There's a lot I mean so we'll pick some of the bigger things off I think that I'm going to say that
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:09,471	| IOT138 |	Do we really want that Amazon experience and what I mean by that I would say Amazon experience with a little touch of
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,519	| IOT138 |	Nordstrom's in there
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:13,311	| IOT138 |	Look at delivering City service
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,591	| IOT138 |	In that same way
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,127	| IOT138 |	Meaning when you login
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:18,431	| IOT138 |	My mobile app lets you use
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:23,551	| IOT138 |	Parking lot 12 downtown every week and we know that we're going to resurface that lot
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:29,951	| IOT138 |	So now that we know that you use that lot we're going to now send you a push notification automatically this is hip the next two weeks you
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:32,255	| IOT138 |	Use lot 13 because 12 is going to be research
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:35,327	| IOT138 |	Another idea would be we noticed that you
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:38,655	| IOT138 |	Sign up your son for daughter for baseball or softball
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:39,679	| IOT138 |	Every year
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:40,959	| IOT138 |	And bring it to you
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:41,727	| IOT138 |	Additional
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:42,495	| IOT138 |	Sports programs
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,775	| IOT138 |	During the off-season
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,055	| IOT138 |	Automatic
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:47,615	| IOT138 |	If you have any go research and find out we would send you
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:49,407	| IOT138 |	Apus notification saying hey
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,687	| IOT138 |	This is for you
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,711	| IOT138 |	This will help you
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:53,503	| IOT138 |	Get additional classes at maybe
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,271	| IOT138 |	You weren't aware of
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:56,575	| IOT138 |	I'm look at that is helping Drive our Revenue
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:58,879	| IOT138 |	As well as providing the end
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:01,695	| IOT138 |	Consumer additional information that they wouldn't have had
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,743	| IOT138 |	How many goes on from
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:07,327	| IOT138 |	Using your phone to pay for your parking to pay your sewer bill
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:08,095	| IOT138 |	Weave
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:12,703	| IOT138 |	Used and started to build applications for the Amazon Echo platform
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,983	| IOT138 |	As well as
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:15,263	| IOT138 |	For Google home
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:17,311	| IOT138 |	And now the Amazon show
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:19,359	| IOT138 |	Which is an upgraded Amazon
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,639	| IOT138 |	Product with a screen built
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:21,407	| IOT138 |	Intuit
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:22,431	| IOT138 |	So now you can ask
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:23,711	| IOT138 |	AC
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:24,735	| IOT138 |	As well as here
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:26,527	| IOT138 |	And so really is making
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:30,111	| IOT138 |	Government as transparent as possible but very
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:30,623	| IOT138 |	Hi touch
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:32,927	| IOT138 |	High service oriented
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:35,231	| IOT138 |	Where you really feel connected
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:36,511	| IOT138 |	And if you're able to get the
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,071	| IOT138 |	Information that you need in the most timely manner
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:40,095	| IOT138 |	Vanessa from everything
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:42,399	| IOT138 |	From a safer environment your street light goes out on your
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:42,911	| IOT138 |	Street
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:44,191	| IOT138 |	As soon as it goes out
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:45,983	| IOT138 |	It's not about you having
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:48,799	| IOT138 |	You call us we already know what's out and hopefully
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:53,919	| IOT138 |	We replace it before you even know that the lights burnt out of those a type of things that were looking at
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:54,943	| IOT138 |	Do you really
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:55,967	| IOT138 |	Going Beyond
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:57,247	| IOT138 |	What
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:50:00,575	| IOT138 |	Traditional government that I call up and I never get a response to
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:02,367	| IOT138 |	Hey I didn't even have
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:05,439	| IOT138 |	Call they called me and help me or they message
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:06,975	| IOT138 |	Instant messenger
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:07,487	| IOT138 |	Give me your day
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:10,815	| IOT138 |	Send me an email or automatically alerted me on the app
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:12,607	| IOT138 |	So it's really about that service
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:14,399	| IOT138 |	Level
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:16,703	| IOT138 |	I mean we're looking at doing fiber optics
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:17,471	| IOT138 |	Downtown
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:20,287	| IOT138 |	Where we would look at providing internet Based Services
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:21,823	| IOT138 |	Everybody not just
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:24,639	| IOT138 |	Two selected area stole a lot
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:25,407	| IOT138 |	2
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:29,759	| IOT138 |	Really give our city a competitive advantage through either education
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:30,527	| IOT138 |	And Technology
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:33,855	| IOT138 |	I don't see any limit the sky's kind of the limit
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:35,903	| IOT138 |	As far as what we're looking at implementing and
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:37,695	| IOT138 |	The technology just we will
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:38,463	| IOT138 |	Yo testing
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:39,743	| IOT138 |	Actually
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,023	| IOT138 |	Deploy at one point in the future
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,839	| IOT138 |	Alright I kind of look forward to that
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:49,215	| IOT138 |	Nature vision and let me ask you one final question where does the money for all of this
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:51,007	| IOT138 |	So right now
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:54,591	| IOT138 |	Majority of it comes from companies that want to be here and obviously
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:51:00,991	| IOT138 |	We have a huge technology show called CES every year so we kind of have that as an advantage more companies will put their technology and down
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:02,015	| IOT138 |	Downtown at no cost
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:04,831	| IOT138 |	Sublime we can test it to they can show customers
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:06,367	| IOT138 |	That come to
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:07,647	| IOT138 |	CES in January
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,415	| IOT138 |	This one
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:10,975	| IOT138 |	Obviously we do have a budget set aside for innovation
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:13,535	| IOT138 |	This past year was $1000000
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:14,815	| IOT138 |	And we've been
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:17,119	| IOT138 |	Leveraging that as we do these Pilots
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:17,887	| IOT138 |	And
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:18,911	| IOT138 |	Additional testing
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:21,727	| IOT138 |	But really down the road we kind of see
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:23,007	| IOT138 |	The ability of
EDL	00:51:23,007	00:51:23,519	| IOT138 |	Proving
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:25,823	| IOT138 |	If we're able to put a technology out there
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:31,711	| IOT138 |	That actually saves money so we're looking at trash can sensors right now people we have
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:34,015	| IOT138 |	Physical laborers that go up and down the street
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:36,575	| IOT138 |	And look at all the trash can if they're empty or full
EDL	00:51:36,575	00:51:39,647	| IOT138 |	And no matter what right now they drive up and down and they checked
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:43,487	| IOT138 |	Well if we were able to put a sensor in the trash can to say if it was empty or full
EDL	00:51:43,999	00:51:46,047	| IOT138 |	And we didn't have to go to Every trash can ever
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:46,815	| IOT138 |	Everyday
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:48,095	| IOT138 |	That would be a savings
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:50,399	| IOT138 |	We're looking at that those savings mechanism
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:53,215	| IOT138 |	2 then be funded redirected
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:58,591	| IOT138 |	Back into the Innovation fund and it would be a fun that would eventually pay for itself
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:51:59,103	| IOT138 |	Through efficient
EDL	00:51:59,615	00:52:01,151	| IOT138 |	And we think that is one
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:03,711	| IOT138 |	Great way of long-term
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:04,735	| IOT138 |	Sustainability
EDL	00:52:04,735	00:52:07,039	| IOT138 |	A lot of what we work on with all the technology
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:07,807	| IOT138 |	We're talking about
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:10,111	| IOT138 |	Is sustainability how do you keep these
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:10,879	| IOT138 |	It's going to just
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:12,671	| IOT138 |	Can't put in 10000 sensors
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:13,951	| IOT138 |	And then
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:17,535	| IOT138 |	How do you keep from going after 3 years when the batteries die or you need to replace
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:19,583	| IOT138 |	And what are you get the money to do that
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:21,119	| IOT138 |	Exactly all right
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:22,399	| IOT138 |	Michael
EDL	00:52:22,399	00:52:23,679	| IOT138 |	You have been a Funt
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:24,703	| IOT138 |	Information
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:25,471	| IOT138 |	I love it

EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:35,967	| IOT138 |	Obviously Vegas is open to everybody so can we hope to get everybody out here and
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:36,735	| IOT138 |	Enjoy it and see
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:37,503	| IOT138 |	The technology we have
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,295	| IOT138 |	Yeah if you're a CES
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:39,807	| IOT138 |	This year guys
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:40,831	| IOT138 |	You should actually go
