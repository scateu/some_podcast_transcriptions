EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:32,256	| IOT160 |	We're also going to talk about
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:33,280	| IOT160 |	Apple acquisitions
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:35,328	| IOT160 |	Possible acquisition
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:37,376	| IOT160 |	New details on
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,912	| IOT160 |	What your August locks
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,680	| IOT160 |	Can talk to
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:41,472	| IOT160 |	Twilio has introduced a new
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:42,240	| IOT160 |	Iot product
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:46,592	| IOT160 |	We've got a crazy idea in transporting small pets
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:50,176	| IOT160 |	Kevin's going to review and talk about the fibaro homekit sensors
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:51,456	| IOT160 |	And our guest this week
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,224	| IOT160 |	Zeke is gay
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:52,992	| IOT160 |	The hunt
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:54,016	| IOT160 |	Was actually
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:56,064	| IOT160 |	The Mastermind behind
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,344	| IOT160 |	Azure sphere
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,880	| IOT160 |	So we're getting a lot of detail on
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,160	| IOT160 |	Plus we got him
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,952	| IOT160 |	From our sponsor for sure
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:02,976	| IOT160 |	And now
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:05,024	| IOT160 |	Will hear a message from one of our other sponsors
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:12,704	| IOT160 |	Is you know me so you know me platform from the makers of the free you know me after you know me
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:18,080	| IOT160 |	Is a cloud-based platform-as-a-service for companies Building Solutions for the connected home
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:24,480	| IOT160 |	You know these offerings include a cloud a server list iot platform for device manufacturers
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:30,880	| IOT160 |	Get their products to Market quickly and securely and also you know me what a powerful integration engine that connects
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:37,280	| IOT160 |	It's more than a hundred top smart home devices this week on the Stacey on iot podcast
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:41,120	| IOT160 |	Hang up their five-part series what the next billion dollar smart
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:44,960	| IOT160 |	Home startup will look like you can find part for it part 5 today
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:50,848	| IOT160 |	By visiting platform. You know me. Oh Stacey on iot
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,896	| IOT160 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,664	| IOT160 |	Heaven
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,456	| IOT160 |	This party started
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,760	| IOT160 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:02,368	| IOT160 |	Yeah it's going to be fun to talk about Microsoft and not
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,648	| IOT160 |	Talk about Windows
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:07,232	| IOT160 |	Yes so everyone was very excited about this
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:09,280	| IOT160 |	Probably the most common headline I saw was
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,816	| IOT160 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,728	| IOT160 |	Yeah I doubt they did that pizza
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:21,568	| IOT160 |	Yeah they've actually done a good chunk of
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:26,688	| IOT160 |	Work on bringing Linux to Windows desktops recently which is great to see
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:30,528	| IOT160 |	Obviously this has to do with iot devices and seizure
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:32,064	| IOT160 |	Would you say that there
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:35,648	| IOT160 |	Using a you're creating a Linux embedded OS
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,184	| IOT160 |	Not exactly
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:41,536	| IOT160 |	This is only for the address fear is only for security
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,584	| IOT160 |	So I think that's a really important
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,608	| IOT160 |	To note so this is
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,656	| IOT160 |	Obviously going to talk about it later
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,960	| IOT160 |	Gary Bradley
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,752	| IOT160 |	Is a secured microcontroller
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,312	| IOT160 |	It is secured OS layer
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,360	| IOT160 |	On top of that my
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,128	| IOT160 |	Microcontroller
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,432	| IOT160 |	It handles the back and forth between that
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,968	| IOT160 |	The MCU and
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,480	| IOT160 |	What is a
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,016	| IOT160 |	Secure
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| IOT160 |	Cloud Elliman
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:06,368	| IOT160 |	So the OS is really just handling the back
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,136	| IOT160 |	And forth between
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,672	| IOT160 |	The hardware
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,184	| IOT160 |	And kind of
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| IOT160 |	Brains and
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,488	| IOT160 |	The cloud seoul
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| IOT160 |	What's Happening Here
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:14,816	| IOT160 |	Is the MCU
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,608	| IOT160 |	Who has a lot of the elements that you would
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,120	| IOT160 |	Expect
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,144	| IOT160 |	From
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,168	| IOT160 |	Trusted
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,960	| IOT160 |	Cute environment secure boot Olive
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,752	| IOT160 |	What is also
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,032	| IOT160 |	Has is
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:26,080	| IOT160 |	It also has the certificate based on the
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,592	| IOT160 |	Sanitation
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| IOT160 |	He's going to
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,432	| IOT160 |	Communicate with the certificate granting
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,712	| IOT160 |	In the cloud
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| IOT160 |	End
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,784	| IOT160 |	Also in the cloud
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,088	| IOT160 |	His threat detection so when new
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| IOT160 |	Viruses
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,392	| IOT160 |	Abilities are detected
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,184	| IOT160 |	It's going to be able to
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,464	| IOT160 |	Basically
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,488	| IOT160 |	The check goes in
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:47,328	| IOT160 |	Tell the chip and get having a secure patching ability
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,608	| IOT160 |	Back down to the ship
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,632	| IOT160 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,424	| IOT160 |	Yasso
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:57,824	| IOT160 |	Product self is the Azure sphere and then the cloud service that you mention that the security piece that's the address.
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:01,408	| IOT160 |	Security service in the cloud so this song
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:07,808	| IOT160 |	Which would not always understanding is there secure at all times
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,088	| IOT160 |	When they're not secure
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,392	| IOT160 |	And how to update the security on them
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,952	| IOT160 |	It has been a challenge so this should help with that
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,488	| IOT160 |	Yes this gives you 2
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,512	| IOT160 |	Detection audit
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| IOT160 |	Zation
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,607	| IOT160 |	There's a lot of things that gives you
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| IOT160 |	Now
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:25,215	| IOT160 |	The issue here is Microsoft is doing this for
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,751	| IOT160 |	It's open sourcing
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,775	| IOT160 |	That's so it's open
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,847	| IOT160 |	It's trying to work with all the chip vendors to get this on
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,615	| IOT160 |	I'm bored and
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:35,967	| IOT160 |	Will people take it that's really the question there's plenty of
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:39,551	| IOT160 |	Chip companies that have their own security standards in them anyways that's part of the problem
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,087	| IOT160 |	Is it
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,111	| IOT160 |	Fragmented Market
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:45,439	| IOT160 |	You'll never hear someone say
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,719	| IOT160 |	It's not
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,095	| IOT160 |	This feels more in line with something like Samsung
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:54,911	| IOT160 |	Arctic which has they have their secure module
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,543	| IOT160 |	I'm curious with Amazon could probably do something like this
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:03,359	| IOT160 |	The free artist if it wanted to Overlay security
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,127	| IOT160 |	Some of those
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| IOT160 |	Thanks right so
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,711	| IOT160 |	They would have to do a deal also with
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT160 |	What the Chip n
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| IOT160 |	Letters to have the hardware
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,295	| IOT160 |	Comment sold
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:11,807	| IOT160 |	That's a little
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,855	| IOT160 |	But
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,879	| IOT160 |	This is a good
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| IOT160 |	Model
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,951	| IOT160 |	It feels like a good model
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,719	| IOT160 |	And
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:22,303	| IOT160 |	I am excited to see if it works it's not retroactive though so
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,839	| IOT160 |	Right right
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:29,215	| IOT160 |	You mentioned chip makers and trying to get them and Microsoft already has mediatek is one of the first
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:35,615	| IOT160 |	Companies to make peace microcontroller units you mentioned Arctic and that's the one challenge that Samsung doesn't have
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,199	| IOT160 |	Samsung does made chips are these designs chips and have some produce
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,479	| IOT160 |	So
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,295	| IOT160 |	If they wanted to do something similar
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,831	| IOT160 |	They could without
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,599	| IOT160 |	Bering
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,879	| IOT160 |	Chip makers are going to come on board
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,023	| IOT160 |	Secure
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:54,559	| IOT160 |	So
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,607	| IOT160 |	I don't have the block diagram
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,399	| IOT160 |	What
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,055	| IOT160 |	I can't get this
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:06,847	| IOT160 |	Come back to you on that
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| IOT160 |	We'll see ya
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:16,831	| IOT160 |	Problem
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:23,231	| IOT160 |	I'm sure that our guess is going to get into the details even further boat in one thing is worth stressing Riverfront is Microsoft
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:29,631	| IOT160 |	On the security aspect of this through address fear but the date
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,911	| IOT160 |	Sent to Microsoft azure
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:34,751	| IOT160 |	Yes and we talked about all of that and we even talked about
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,287	| IOT160 |	When you see this
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,055	| IOT160 |	And
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:37,823	| IOT160 |	How
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,871	| IOT160 |	Little bit about how the trip is made so
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,895	| IOT160 |	Stay tuned for Galen
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,919	| IOT160 |	Because he is worth it
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,943	| IOT160 |	Also
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| IOT160 |	On the security front
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,527	| IOT160 |	We have the online trust Alliance
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,039	| IOT160 |	Switch
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| IOT160 |	Cool stuff
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,415	| IOT160 |	James a ringing endorsement
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,487	| IOT160 |	They actually created
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| IOT160 |	Several years ago
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:59,071	| IOT160 |	They created a checklist for what to do when
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,351	| IOT160 |	When you move from your smartphone
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:03,423	| IOT160 |	So how did I remember
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,007	| IOT160 |	They've created an Enterprise iot
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,775	| IOT160 |	Security check
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,847	| IOT160 |	Quest best practices for
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,639	| IOT160 |	Things if you're going to have an iot Network
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,711	| IOT160 |	Your office and I won't call them to it
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,479	| IOT160 |	I won't go into all
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,759	| IOT160 |	There's about
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| IOT160 |	11 or 12
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,927	| IOT160 |	You probably should have a guest Network or separate iot
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,463	| IOT160 |	Yay
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:29,535	| IOT160 |	You should update all your passwords and don't use products with hard-coded password
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,583	| IOT160 |	Yay
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,119	| IOT160 |	Some of the more interesting
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,399	| IOT160 |	Is
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:38,751	| IOT160 |	Don't allow or severely restrict automatic connections via Wi-Fi or other be
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:41,055	| IOT160 |	This will restrict the ability of other devices to
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| IOT160 |	Infiltrate
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,639	| IOT160 |	I don't know why
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,943	| IOT160 |	I feel like
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,967	| IOT160 |	That kind of defeats the
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| IOT160 |	The purpose of
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,527	| IOT160 |	Some of these iot devices I don't know what
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,319	| IOT160 |	Well
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:58,719	| IOT160 |	I mean deployment of a society devices is always a challenge
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,255	| IOT160 |	It's simpler to Adam but
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:04,095	| IOT160 |	Obviously that's not a good security practice so I get what they're saying there
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:08,703	| IOT160 |	Enterprise as opposed to home so I can understand
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:10,751	| IOT160 |	Cover up all my
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,615	| IOT160 |	Disabled
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,455	| IOT160 |	So in my favorite one which we should all do
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,503	| IOT160 |	Although this puts the burden on the consumer
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,039	| IOT160 |	Enterprise or
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,063	| IOT160 |	Consumer consumer
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:27,391	| IOT160 |	Is closely
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,439	| IOT160 |	From service when they are no longer updatable
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| IOT160 |	More secure
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:36,095	| IOT160 |	So in this actually you I'll bring back the Microsoft thing cuz in my conversation
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,863	| IOT160 |	Michaela
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,887	| IOT160 |	He mentioned that
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| IOT160 |	The
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,703	| IOT160 |	MC user supporter for a 10-year
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,983	| IOT160 |	Cycle
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,007	| IOT160 |	So
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| IOT160 |	I was think
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:47,871	| IOT160 |	Supremes my washing machine stops being secure a sphere
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,151	| IOT160 |	10 years
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,199	| IOT160 |	But this
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,479	| IOT160 |	In the Enterprise
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,759	| IOT160 |	You've got similar sort of
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,575	| IOT160 |	You got some Thor gear this could be running around
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,343	| IOT160 |	4
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,903	| IOT160 |	7 to 10 years is usually the longest I've seen
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| IOT160 |	These connected devices in their support
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,231	| IOT160 |	Contracts
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,023	| IOT160 |	Chilling at reasonable
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,047	| IOT160 |	It's reasonable but check
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| IOT160 |	That's a challenge
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,447	| IOT160 |	If you'd like to see what you should be
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| IOT160 |	Skipping riddle
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,031	| IOT160 |	Home security news
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,871	| IOT160 |	Called nice out of Italy
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,431	| IOT160 |	Is buying a 75% stake in
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,199	| IOT160 |	Abode
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,759	| IOT160 |	Which is a home security system
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,039	| IOT160 |	Lots of pee
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| IOT160 |	Love
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:32,159	| IOT160 |	The value of the 75% stake is 18.75
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,671	| IOT160 |	Million
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| IOT160 |	And
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,975	| IOT160 |	De stijl
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,255	| IOT160 |	Is
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,279	| IOT160 |	It's a good one
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,815	| IOT160 |	Fits with what
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,095	| IOT160 |	Aldi
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:43,167	| IOT160 |	Smart home security companies getting purchased by
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| IOT160 |	Barter companies
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:44,959	| IOT160 |	Such as
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| IOT160 |	Ring
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| IOT160 |	Who else has not been
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:55,199	| IOT160 |	Where she did see the iota
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| IOT160 |	Gateway
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,759	| IOT160 |	Fromm adult at CES
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,159	| IOT160 |	We did we did and then plan to sell that for $329 and would ship
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,695	| IOT160 |	In late q1 well
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,279	| IOT160 |	It's now early cute to and
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,839	| IOT160 |	This acquisition but no updates
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:18,751	| IOT160 |	Right it turns your Bose system into something compatible with
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,055	| IOT160 |	And if you don't have an existing
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| IOT160 |	About system
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,359	| IOT160 |	You can buy that at
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| IOT160 |	Add about pieces on
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,175	| IOT160 |	Security system
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:34,623	| IOT160 |	Supposed to work with nasty Kirby Philips Hue and lifx right out of the box I will see what happens if and when that shows up
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:37,439	| IOT160 |	Alright also in a position
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,719	| IOT160 |	Lucci
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,231	| IOT160 |	The maker of
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,535	| IOT160 |	Favorite light switches
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,863	| IOT160 |	Tetra which is actually an austin-based company that makes
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,399	| IOT160 |	Really fancy high-end
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:46,911	| IOT160 |	Commercial lighting
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:50,239	| IOT160 |	Tetra is a company that was actually
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,519	| IOT160 |	Created by no suits
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT160 |	Who was one of
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:55,615	| IOT160 |	Founders of silicon Labs so school Austin
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| IOT160 |	Guy here
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| IOT160 |	Are the chip world
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,479	| IOT160 |	The cool thing about technology
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:00,991	| IOT160 |	They make
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,015	| IOT160 |	LED
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,063	| IOT160 |	Chips that
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,831	| IOT160 |	Are in there
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,879	| IOT160 |	False so this actually give us
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| IOT160 |	How to do it
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,231	| IOT160 |	I'll say it
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,023	| IOT160 |	Lighting
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,559	| IOT160 |	So they can make the
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| IOT160 |	The chips that
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,375	| IOT160 |	Make LEDs
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,143	| IOT160 |	The bulbs
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,167	| IOT160 |	And then the
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,471	| IOT160 |	Radio protocols that allow them all to talk to each other
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,263	| IOT160 |	And catchers
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,031	| IOT160 |	Unique because
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,079	| IOT160 |	The chips actually
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,871	| IOT160 |	Controlling themselves so
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,943	| IOT160 |	To the right color that
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,223	| IOT160 |	The company or the
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| IOT160 |	Resident wants
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,295	| IOT160 |	They walk
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,575	| IOT160 |	Always stay that color
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,879	| IOT160 |	So apparently LEDs can pop
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:39,647	| IOT160 |	In-N-Out us
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,159	| IOT160 |	2
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,743	| IOT160 |	Dismiss apparently
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,535	| IOT160 |	So
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:50,655	| IOT160 |	Do you think we promised to actually get into the business cuz this is a very unique
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| IOT160 |	Technology in LED
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| IOT160 |	I
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,471	| IOT160 |	Sync
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| IOT160 |	So I've been to catchers demo
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,079	| IOT160 |	Maroon and Kesha's lights are in like
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,871	| IOT160 |	The Museum of Modern Art in Chicago
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,431	| IOT160 |	Some very fancy high-end
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:02,943	| IOT160 |	Fun places
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,991	| IOT160 |	Lot of nice retail stores
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,015	| IOT160 |	I think this gets
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,039	| IOT160 |	Flu shot into the
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,575	| IOT160 |	Commercial Lighting space
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,599	| IOT160 |	More so than
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| IOT160 |	D
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| IOT160 |	Cherry Crest Market
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| IOT160 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,535	| IOT160 |	I think this is a smart move for them
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,071	| IOT160 |	They know what they're doing
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:19,839	| IOT160 |	In terms of like
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,631	| IOT160 |	And I think
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,935	| IOT160 |	Bringing their expertise from the
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,703	| IOT160 |	Consumer world
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,263	| IOT160 |	In the high-end home in dealer
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,031	| IOT160 |	Which is why they started
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,311	| IOT160 |	I think this is really
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,383	| IOT160 |	Esprit Market
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,151	| IOT160 |	Competition
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:33,663	| IOT160 |	I guess
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,687	| IOT160 |	Phillips
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,479	| IOT160 |	Other big
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:38,783	| IOT160 |	I think it's a smart
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,415	| IOT160 |	Trap mix
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,255	| IOT160 |	No word on how much this cost
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| IOT160 |	So sad
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,887	| IOT160 |	To hear that and I don't know if actually Lutron will suddenly have an outpost in Austin
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,423	| IOT160 |	We should be super cold for me
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,447	| IOT160 |	Granny backyard
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| IOT160 |	This is true
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| IOT160 |	All right
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,871	| IOT160 |	That is
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:07,967	| IOT160 |	We have
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,295	| IOT160 |	Touted as someone who
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,319	| IOT160 |	Might acquire
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,111	| IOT160 |	Nokia's
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| IOT160 |	Health division
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,903	| IOT160 |	Which we all know and love
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:18,975	| IOT160 |	Are used to know and love is why things
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:21,535	| IOT160 |	A little convoluted but
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,583	| IOT160 |	Leukemia
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,143	| IOT160 |	Now in February of this year they were like yeah
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| IOT160 |	This isn't for us
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:37,407	| IOT160 |	Yes the internal memo explained the digital Health business did not look like it was going to be profitable for the
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:41,247	| IOT160 |	The company and they were evaluating what to do in February
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:46,879	| IOT160 |	I forget the quote something about failing fast isn't failure to accelerated learning what they said
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:53,791	| IOT160 |	Terminator was failing fast because things for $100
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:56,607	| IOT160 |	In 2016 and I suspect whoever guess
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:59,423	| IOT160 |	This part of their business it's coming
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,215	| IOT160 |	Be a lot less bright
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| IOT160 |	A lot
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,775	| IOT160 |	Google makes sense to me
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:07,103	| IOT160 |	Only because
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:11,199	| IOT160 |	It could tie into their nest in the hardware teams
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:17,087	| IOT160 |	Also because and this is just my experience I try this several times
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:21,439	| IOT160 |	Google is not that great with Health Data Google fit in particular has just been
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:27,839	| IOT160 |	Wonky for me does not work and not synced with other services so maybe
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:34,239	| IOT160 |	Why things I peking come in there I don't know
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:37,055	| IOT160 |	That perspective to me I don't know what's going to happen obviously
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,895	| IOT160 |	Write another I think they also floated Amazon as a possible acquire
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,223	| IOT160 |	Which would be interesting because Amazon is launched that health initiative
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,503	| IOT160 |	Southwest JP Morgan
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,807	| IOT160 |	I believe
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,391	| IOT160 |	That we don't actually know what the heck that is but you know
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,951	| IOT160 |	Sew-ins
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,743	| IOT160 |	We have
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,023	| IOT160 |	Watch Dora
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:03,935	| IOT160 |	Yeah if you have an Apple Watch like I do I don't have an August lock you can update
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:10,079	| IOT160 |	And now just tap on your watch to unlock the door keep in mind I know the August has
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:13,663	| IOT160 |	Walk up to your door and have it unlock when you have your phone with you
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,967	| IOT160 |	This does not do that if he has cold smart unlock
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,783	| IOT160 |	This is not that this is actually just
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:23,391	| IOT160 |	Tapping on the watch to in the app to unlock your door so it's going to be clear about that
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| IOT160 |	So you have to tap
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:27,999	| IOT160 |	The Watch
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:34,911	| IOT160 |	Yeah but keep in mind you can set to complications on Apple watch to be shortcuts to apps
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| IOT160 |	R show data
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:42,847	| IOT160 |	So 1 tap to open up an app or two types of is pretty quick
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| IOT160 |	Waiting for 5 seconds
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,151	| IOT160 |	Also
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| IOT160 |	Twilio
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:51,807	| IOT160 |	It's now generally available
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,623	| IOT160 |	Programmable Wireless
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:57,183	| IOT160 |	Basically this is the ability to have a
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,511	| IOT160 |	Connected to
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:06,911	| IOT160 |	Places with a SIM card the last you provide SIM cards and service and they have pricing plans that are
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,703	| IOT160 |	Pretty reasonable
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:12,543	| IOT160 |	Maybe you want to create your own little iot sensor that connects to the
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:18,687	| IOT160 |	Weber something for whatever reason and it's remote he can pop a Sim in there and you know I have text messages sent to your phone
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:27,647	| IOT160 |	People who are do-it-yourselfers number one but there have been some companies that are using this they mention in their blog post
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,695	| IOT160 |	I did eat a bit and
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,743	| IOT160 |	Not a bit snow just kidding dwelo
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:38,655	| IOT160 |	Which is a cellular connected Smart Hub for apartment buildings but even the folks are just
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,447	| IOT160 |	Connected dashboard camera
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:46,847	| IOT160 |	They talked about using trulia's programmable wireless cellular
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,871	| IOT160 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,943	| IOT160 |	And Kevin has a brilliant idea
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT160 |	Maybe we'll send him
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:06,047	| IOT160 |	Bunch of mailboxes all together the front
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:10,399	| IOT160 |	Ascensor in there and then have it send me a text message saying your else here we could all do it
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,959	| IOT160 |	People
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT160 |	I'm sure Kevin
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,055	| IOT160 |	I'll tell you about it
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,895	| IOT160 |	I'm going to patent and sell it to the post office
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,663	| IOT160 |	Hugo
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,455	| IOT160 |	All right oh also
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| IOT160 |	Now you can
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,295	| IOT160 |	Astra products
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:32,671	| IOT160 |	Yeah this is interesting I haven't taken it for a test drive but this is their VMware pulse iot Center
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:39,071	| IOT160 |	State of couple of Hands-On Labs where you can actually remote so you can explore
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:44,959	| IOT160 |	For the polarity center consoles dashboards you can manage simulated IRT
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:49,311	| IOT160 |	So this is a way for them to educate people on their product to manage devices
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,127	| IOT160 |	Latex free to access the lab zombie run through
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,919	| IOT160 |	These things
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,455	| IOT160 |	I thought it was kind of cool looking Kurama
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,247	| IOT160 |	And
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,295	| IOT160 |	Prayer since summer is coming
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,063	| IOT160 |	Kevin also found
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,367	| IOT160 |	The video is cheesy
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,047	| IOT160 |	Peta safe so this is how to transport your pet
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,327	| IOT160 |	Safely
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:17,727	| IOT160 |	Yeah safely right it'll actually help you if you have not said you're moving across the country and you were going to take your pet on the plane
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:22,335	| IOT160 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:28,735	| IOT160 |	Or you're going to have a transportation service take your pet will digipak for example has a company that uses this
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:33,599	| IOT160 |	Technology and use RFID tag tracking
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:36,159	| IOT160 |	To basically monitor where your pet is
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:43,839	| IOT160 |	Temperature yeah they can even help you
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:47,679	| IOT160 |	No smoke
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:55,103	| IOT160 |	Not everybody transports their past but I just thought it was a cool Easter Vallarta to the summer sometimes
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:55,871	| IOT160 |	That's nice
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,895	| IOT160 |	Bring your dog with you
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:58,943	| IOT160 |	So
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,527	| IOT160 |	If I use it I'll let you guys know how I found
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,063	| IOT160 |	All right and
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| IOT160 |	Kevin this week you reviewed
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,647	| IOT160 |	Homekit sensors from fibaro
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:15,839	| IOT160 |	It was time to look at home kit stuff since I just moved everything over to SmartThings so I have the $60
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:22,239	| IOT160 |	Sbarro door window sensor and the $70 fibaro motion sensor the eyeball
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,823	| IOT160 |	They're pricey but they're very well-designed
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:29,151	| IOT160 |	They are very responsive easy to set up in home app
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:35,551	| IOT160 |	For iOS for automations I have the door window sensor literally from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:38,111	| IOT160 |	In the office and shut the door the light just comes on
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,159	| IOT160 |	Can you open the door to leave the light goes off
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,743	| IOT160 |	Obviously you can use that for security as well very configurable
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,303	| IOT160 |	I'm a little concerned about the batteries only because the
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:50,399	| IOT160 |	The knot standard like double a triple a kind of batteries that sort of unique
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:53,215	| IOT160 |	Tomorrow said they should last two years so
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:59,615	| IOT160 |	If that's the case then it's less of an issue I mean you pay a premium for good design while working
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:04,223	| IOT160 |	Cancers that don't just do what they claim to do the motion sensor and the door window sensor
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:10,623	| IOT160 |	Also report temperature which is Handy and the motion sensor can tell you the brightness
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:15,487	| IOT160 |	Set a room in terms of Lux so you might be able to make some custom automations based on room brightness
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,791	| IOT160 |	Open my shades
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,375	| IOT160 |	Mapleshade's and I believe you actually
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,655	| IOT160 |	If you want to do something like that
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,471	| IOT160 |	And you can see the Lex on the home app
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:29,823	| IOT160 |	Yeah then you could do that with Lutron Serena shades
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,383	| IOT160 |	Hunter Douglas also has a shade that works with
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,431	| IOT160 |	So if you're
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,223	| IOT160 |	Eager to try something like that out
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,991	| IOT160 |	Which
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:37,759	| IOT160 |	I would be
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,271	| IOT160 |	That's actually kind of
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,551	| IOT160 |	I think so too
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,879	| IOT160 |	Allright basal temperature actually
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,951	| IOT160 |	Bring the sheets.
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,279	| IOT160 |	All right well now it is time

EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,544	| IOT160 |	Question
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| IOT160 |	Comes to us
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:40,992	| IOT160 |	Hello my name is. I live in Louisville Kentucky and I've only been listening to yourself a couple weeks now
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:44,320	| IOT160 |	Into the home automation
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,600	| IOT160 |	I love you so
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,880	| IOT160 |	But what I'm wondering is
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,184	| IOT160 |	Is there a
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:51,488	| IOT160 |	Video doorbell system that work
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,560	| IOT160 |	Being good for someone in an apartment building
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,608	| IOT160 |	Who does not have the ability
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:01,472	| IOT160 |	A wired system because there is no existing wire
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,264	| IOT160 |	Thank you for your time
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,848	| IOT160 |	Okay Scott I wish this were longer answer
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,360	| IOT160 |	Because
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,152	| IOT160 |	Then you have a lot of choice but
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:12,736	| IOT160 |	There's really only one choice out there for battery powered doorbells today
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,552	| IOT160 |	I'm going to recommend you don't go and buy
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,088	| IOT160 |	What are some of the no name brands on
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,368	| IOT160 |	On Amazon which
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,416	| IOT160 |	Are out there but don't do it
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,696	| IOT160 |	A Lot of Things Fall Apart
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:23,488	| IOT160 |	Genki to have terrible apps
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,512	| IOT160 |	So your options
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:25,792	| IOT160 |	I really rich
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:30,912	| IOT160 |	Ring the original for $100 or the ring video doorbell
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:31,936	| IOT160 |	For 200
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:38,080	| IOT160 |	And the video so what that price difference will get you as a slightly different camera
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:40,128	| IOT160 |	On the video doorbell 2
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,664	| IOT160 |	It doesn't have his wider field-of-view
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,456	| IOT160 |	But it is high resolution
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,248	| IOT160 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,272	| IOT160 |	The battery pack
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,552	| IOT160 |	For that one is
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,320	| IOT160 |	Rechargeable
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:48,832	| IOT160 |	So
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,368	| IOT160 |	You just take it out
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,416	| IOT160 |	And you can actually buy an extra battery pack
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,208	| IOT160 |	I want just like alternative
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:55,744	| IOT160 |	So some people find that way more
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:56,512	| IOT160 |	Convenient
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,792	| IOT160 |	Lie by Rihanna
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:02,144	| IOT160 |	Original video doorbell is also rechargeable but you have to
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,680	| IOT160 |	Take the whole thing off
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| IOT160 |	Retarded
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,728	| IOT160 |	It's a little less can be
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:12,896	| IOT160 |	Yeah if you're not in a rush Scott I would consider waiting to see when the
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:19,296	| IOT160 |	Blink video doorbell arrived it was coming out in 2018 we last heard still says coming soon on their site
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:22,368	| IOT160 |	Blank was purchased by Amazon so I don't know if there's any changes
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:27,488	| IOT160 |	That will also be a battery-powered option I know they announce the price
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:33,120	| IOT160 |	Previously but now there's no price listed on the site so I'm not going to Hazard a guess that may change
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,144	| IOT160 |	So there you go
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,656	| IOT160 |	You can wait
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,032	| IOT160 |	And you don't mind a little inconvenience
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,336	| IOT160 |	You can always swap it out later
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,872	| IOT160 |	So there you go also
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,200	| IOT160 |	Nest
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,992	| IOT160 |	Hello doorbell speaking of doorbells
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,272	| IOT160 |	I found
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| IOT160 |	It difficult
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,808	| IOT160 |	Because
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,088	| IOT160 |	It just was not connect
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,856	| IOT160 |	I have the
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,880	| IOT160 |	Darkness time
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,648	| IOT160 |	Connecting my Android phone
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,672	| IOT160 |	To this thing
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:57,696	| IOT160 |	Which
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,232	| IOT160 |	We did get someone who
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,280	| IOT160 |	Call Dustin said hey
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,072	| IOT160 |	I get that problem sometimes too
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,584	| IOT160 |	Doing what I do is like
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| IOT160 |	End
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,704	| IOT160 |	That person I say you are so right that is it
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,216	| IOT160 |	Exactly what you
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,520	| IOT160 |	When you have an Android phone
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,288	| IOT160 |	That is not
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,568	| IOT160 |	2
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| IOT160 |	Turn off
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,872	| IOT160 |	Mobile data
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,152	| IOT160 |	Usually
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:18,944	| IOT160 |	Horses things to go
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:27,136	| IOT160 |	But I would also say eating with iOS because when I had problems with my ring that's what they had suggested originally
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:31,232	| IOT160 |	In the case of the nest
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:31,744	| IOT160 |	Do that
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,024	| IOT160 |	It did not help
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:36,096	| IOT160 |	But other people have said that they installed on an Android phone
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,144	| IOT160 |	No problem so I am just a special special
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,216	| IOT160 |	Which does not surprise me
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,008	| IOT160 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:46,080	| IOT160 |	Do you want to call

EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT160 |	Thursday
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:18,080	| IOT160 |	And some sensors that you can actually connect to it
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,592	| IOT160 |	And
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:21,152	| IOT160 |	Have the camera go on when the sensors go
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,200	| IOT160 |	Or off or however you
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| IOT160 |	You want to set it up
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,992	| IOT160 |	So that is
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:27,808	| IOT160 |	Yay
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,344	| IOT160 |	And now
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,368	| IOT160 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:36,768	| IOT160 |	For our guest
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:40,864	| IOT160 |	Break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:47,008	| IOT160 |	This week we have been Goodman Innovation at 4
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,032	| IOT160 |	What is 4
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:53,920	| IOT160 |	Our scale flexibility lets our customers move Beyond
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,456	| IOT160 |	Traditional Enterprise I-10
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:01,344	| IOT160 |	Typically people use identity management tools for things like provisioning employees
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,624	| IOT160 |	Is access to corporate applique
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:08,512	| IOT160 |	We like to do a lot more but we also do things like the authentication security for your bang
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:12,864	| IOT160 |	Cellular network or for connected cars or even things like connected
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,168	| IOT160 |	People doing really cool things
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:19,008	| IOT160 |	When it comes to digital transformation by leveraging for trucks technology
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:24,128	| IOT160 |	Okay and what are the challenges with identity management today is that it's applied
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:27,968	| IOT160 |	To so many things or maybe it should be applied to so many things
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,760	| IOT160 |	How are you guys looking at that more
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:33,344	| IOT160 |	It's a great Point there's this Rush right now
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,880	| IOT160 |	How to get technology to mark
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:38,720	| IOT160 |	And I think as technology just keeps moving faster and faster
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:45,120	| IOT160 |	The reality is that securing identity is Austin after I thought you know you hear these stories about
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,144	| IOT160 |	It has thousands
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,656	| IOT160 |	Sensors on
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,960	| IOT160 |	Collect all this data
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,752	| IOT160 |	Enjoy your day start with
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| IOT160 |	Something like that
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:56,384	| IOT160 |	And they don't think about okay how am I going to secure that day. How am I going to secure that
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:00,736	| IOT160 |	And we're also seeing is that you know the government and the regulatory
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:04,064	| IOT160 |	Climate can't really keep up as well and so you see things like
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,856	| IOT160 |	In Europe they have gdpr which is
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,392	| IOT160 |	Privacy regulation
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,208	| IOT160 |	In there and it was probably yours too late
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,744	| IOT160 |	Yet it's ahead of
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,792	| IOT160 |	Pretty much where anyone else in the world is
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,328	| IOT160 |	So how does identity manager
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,352	| IOT160 |	Actually
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,704	| IOT160 |	Identity if used properly is like magic
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:24,800	| IOT160 |	It's one of the few technologies that can actually improve customer experience
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:28,128	| IOT160 |	Why actually making their interaction more secure
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:32,480	| IOT160 |	So I didn't he is also one of the few technologies that is future proof
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,760	| IOT160 |	The reality is
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| IOT160 |	In order to
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,832	| IOT160 |	Secure something you must identify it first
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:40,672	| IOT160 |	And if you think about it no matter what the device is identity persist
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,464	| IOT160 |	You always are who
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:45,024	| IOT160 |	Who you are and your thing always is who it is
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:48,352	| IOT160 |	And so are people realizing this and building their products
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,120	| IOT160 |	With that in mind
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,448	| IOT160 |	I think this whole concept of identity in
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,240	| IOT160 |	Security being an afterthought
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:54,752	| IOT160 |	Is starting to
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| IOT160 |	And quite frankly
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,568	| IOT160 |	We're working with
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,616	| IOT160 |	Consumer electronics companies who
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| IOT160 |	Are now thinking about
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:07,040	| IOT160 |	How they create an end-to-end identity driven customer experience so from when you order it when you put it on the first
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:11,904	| IOT160 |	They provide a better customer experience but they also make the device more
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:15,232	| IOT160 |	We're working with large Industrials that are building
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,536	| IOT160 |	Command-and-control iot Networks
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:19,072	| IOT160 |	Stutter making sure that
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:23,680	| IOT160 |	Since Inception that they ensure that everything is secured all the way from the chip
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,192	| IOT160 |	The Clown
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:26,752	| IOT160 |	Sounds good so where can we go to find out more
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,312	| IOT160 |	To learn more about what you can do it
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:32,128	| IOT160 |	What our customers are doing with identity

EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:51,072	| IOT160 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:53,376	| IOT160 |	And today's guest
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,400	| IOT160 |	Is Galen hunt
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,424	| IOT160 |	Who is with Microsoft
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,216	| IOT160 |	Hey David how are you
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:57,728	| IOT160 |	Good
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,008	| IOT160 |	It's great to be here
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:02,336	| IOT160 |	All right you guys are at RSA where Microsoft just announced
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,360	| IOT160 |	A pretty big product
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:06,688	| IOT160 |	Azure sphere
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,480	| IOT160 |	Coming for a while cuz we talked
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:11,808	| IOT160 |	Last April about some of the core ingredients
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,648	| IOT160 |	What is azure sphere
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,696	| IOT160 |	Azure sphere
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:21,280	| IOT160 |	Is an Ambien solution for device manufacturers
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,048	| IOT160 |	Who built
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,328	| IOT160 |	MCU micro
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,864	| IOT160 |	Controller based devices
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:25,632	| IOT160 |	Allows them
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,936	| IOT160 |	Build devices that are
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,704	| IOT160 |	Connected
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,472	| IOT160 |	The internet
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,240	| IOT160 |	Highly secure
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:36,128	| IOT160 |	You might ask you what's an MCU or what kind of devices use those are museums to use our
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,920	| IOT160 |	They're in everything from
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,736	| IOT160 |	Toys to Home Appliances Industrial
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:44,576	| IOT160 |	Factoring equipment and basically none of them are connect Jets
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:47,392	| IOT160 |	Huge transition
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:50,208	| IOT160 |	Over the next couple years of all these devices
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,256	| IOT160 |	All right
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:55,072	| IOT160 |	So yes Galen as you might imagine is correct
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:59,936	| IOT160 |	Guys out there we talked about computer usually talking about processors
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,448	| IOT160 |	Your phone
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:07,360	| IOT160 |	What we're talking about with microcontrollers are all the as the arm m-class devices although there are plenty of
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:15,552	| IOT160 |	Things in your washing machine and and yes they are getting connected to the internet so you guys are created a secure
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,832	| IOT160 |	MCU
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,880	| IOT160 |	There is also a secure OS
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,672	| IOT160 |	In a secure cloud
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:24,000	| IOT160 |	Opponents of the idea is that this microcontroller
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,536	| IOT160 |	Who actually used to explain
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,584	| IOT160 |	What is happening
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:28,864	| IOT160 |	If I do we need all these
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,936	| IOT160 |	Well if you remember but when we talk back
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,752	| IOT160 |	We talked about the seven properties
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:35,776	| IOT160 |	Highly secure device
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:39,616	| IOT160 |	That was a paper that we wrote released
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,384	| IOT160 |	The year-ago
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:44,992	| IOT160 |	Basically we looked at from our experience at Microsoft building devices
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,760	| IOT160 |	What is NASA
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,808	| IOT160 |	Build an iot device
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,088	| IOT160 |	Stanolone
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,624	| IOT160 |	Internet device that is highly
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,952	| IOT160 |	To address those seven properties
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:57,280	| IOT160 |	You need three pieces you need Hardware support
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,816	| IOT160 |	Software support on this device
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,584	| IOT160 |	And you need
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,608	| IOT160 |	Collaboration with
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| IOT160 |	Cloudtail Pecos
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:04,192	| IOT160 |	And that's what we've built
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,472	| IOT160 |	We built azure
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,496	| IOT160 |	Sphere are these
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,264	| IOT160 |	3 LM
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:09,312	| IOT160 |	So there's a new class
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:15,712	| IOT160 |	MCU sphere certified MCU these will be built by our silicon partners
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,504	| IOT160 |	Is not getting the business of building
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,552	| IOT160 |	Sailing ships we do however have
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,392	| IOT160 |	Pablo Acosta silicon IP blocks we have Microsoft
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,928	| IOT160 |	Security technology
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,696	| IOT160 |	Developed
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:30,048	| IOT160 |	That we put into every single one of these Azure sphere certified ship
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,840	| IOT160 |	And that gives a hardware rooted Trust
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:34,144	| IOT160 |	And the second element is the
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,168	| IOT160 |	Spear operating
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,192	| IOT160 |	System
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:38,752	| IOT160 |	Defense-in-depth multi-layer properties
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,520	| IOT160 |	System that
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:42,336	| IOT160 |	Create a very secure environment on the hardware
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,104	| IOT160 |	For the song
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,432	| IOT160 |	Temdan the third aspect is the
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,968	| IOT160 |	Azure sphere security service
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| IOT160 |	Security service
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,296	| IOT160 |	A broken trust
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:54,368	| IOT160 |	Between hydrosphere devices and other devices
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:32:00,768	| IOT160 |	Cloud it monitors for emerging then to text emerging security threats against the devices
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,840	| IOT160 |	Across the entire ecosystem and it renews this
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:06,144	| IOT160 |	Security on the devices through software update
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,680	| IOT160 |	It's new security challenges come out
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:11,008	| IOT160 |	Okay threat detection and then
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,824	| IOT160 |	Renewing Security on the chip what's happening
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,872	| IOT160 |	Well okay so we'll talk about
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,176	| IOT160 |	Software update
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:20,736	| IOT160 |	When a device is out there
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:25,856	| IOT160 |	And it's some music 33 it emerges or maybe even someone finds a bug in some peace
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,136	| IOT160 |	Coats on the device
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,672	| IOT160 |	You want to be able to
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:30,208	| IOT160 |	Create a patch for that and
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,232	| IOT160 |	And get it out on the coast
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,000	| IOT160 |	Devices
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,792	| IOT160 |	Do it reliably do
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:37,120	| IOT160 |	Attentively another every device you build it out in a field
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,400	| IOT160 |	Is now running the latest
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:38,912	| IOT160 |	Software
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:43,008	| IOT160 |	Security service
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:43,520	| IOT160 |	Provide the
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:49,408	| IOT160 |	Does it also do things like signed update sign patches does it
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,432	| IOT160 |	Check for that
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,200	| IOT160 |	It's all apps
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,808	| IOT160 |	Yes so it
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,088	| IOT160 |	I'll just talk about one of those
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,624	| IOT160 |	Vulnerabilities in which town
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:32:59,648	| IOT160 |	In Microsoft experiences
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,976	| IOT160 |	Version one of your software is out running on
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,256	| IOT160 |	Sounds like you figure out
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:07,072	| IOT160 |	Security vulnerability
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,096	| IOT160 |	Guitar version 2
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:09,888	| IOT160 |	Well Packers will
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:14,240	| IOT160 |	Try to trick the device into instead of running person to the rollback version 1
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,568	| IOT160 |	Bill Clinton
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT160 |	Is rollback
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,664	| IOT160 |	Protection in a way that we can
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:24,224	| IOT160 |	Physically Modified by blowing some fuses
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:24,992	| IOT160 |	And the chip
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:25,760	| IOT160 |	Say hey
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:28,576	| IOT160 |	Don't ever run version 1 ever again
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,600	| IOT160 |	Vulnerability
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:32,160	| IOT160 |	Wow so it's kind of stone self-destruct button
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,000	| IOT160 |	For a particular version software you
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:38,560	| IOT160 |	You guys originally worked with mediatek
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,072	| IOT160 |	On this hard
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:43,424	| IOT160 |	How can other companies become Hardware Partners or is that
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,752	| IOT160 |	We have a program
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,520	| IOT160 |	Working
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,288	| IOT160 |	With
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,312	| IOT160 |	As many silicon partners
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:54,688	| IOT160 |	Over a dozen companies were working with right now
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,224	| IOT160 |	Detecting the first partner
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,248	| IOT160 |	You're the first one that's coming
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,016	| IOT160 |	Market
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,552	| IOT160 |	And what we do is we go out and
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:02,112	| IOT160 |	We are licensing royalty free
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:02,880	| IOT160 |	AR
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:04,416	| IOT160 |	Security technology for the chip
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,952	| IOT160 |	And that's so that
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:07,232	| IOT160 |	The Spinners can use it
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:13,632	| IOT160 |	MCU Market very different from like the PC market in the regard of
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:18,240	| IOT160 |	Maybe you can I come at 3 silicon providers for the processors in the MCU
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| IOT160 |	Market 32
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:19,520	| IOT160 |	Jasmine
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,616	| IOT160 |	And so in order to provide app and
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,664	| IOT160 |	Breath and get a solution outfits
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,944	| IOT160 |	It will be an everyday
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,736	| IOT160 |	We realized we were going to have to life
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,856	| IOT160 |	Give them
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:36,672	| IOT160 |	What's called an IP block that goes into their device
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,440	| IOT160 |	We get them
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,232	| IOT160 |	Sports teach them how to use that
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,512	| IOT160 |	Appropriately
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:42,304	| IOT160 |	And we also work with them.
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,328	| IOT160 |	Validate to take
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,888	| IOT160 |	Put it in writing put the rest of the architecture
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:47,424	| IOT160 |	Ship correctly together
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,704	| IOT160 |	It really is
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:50,752	| IOT160 |	Secured and then we certified
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,544	| IOT160 |	We let them put the address
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,592	| IOT160 |	Sphere brand on that ship
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:59,968	| IOT160 |	How does this compare with something like arm has their trust Zone that they recently extended to MCU
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,272	| IOT160 |	There's nxp has I can
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,296	| IOT160 |	Remember what they're
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:06,624	| IOT160 |	Secure module stuff is called for their kinetis lines
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,904	| IOT160 |	In the MCU world
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,976	| IOT160 |	Everybody right now has as you said roll their own
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:12,768	| IOT160 |	Compare
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,536	| IOT160 |	Coexist with
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:16,864	| IOT160 |	Ours is a solution that we have
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,656	| IOT160 |	Built based on the Learning Zone
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,936	| IOT160 |	15 years of
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,960	| IOT160 |	Security
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,240	| IOT160 |	Game console
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:25,056	| IOT160 |	And in that game console business Microsoft concert
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,336	| IOT160 |	Three generations ago
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,104	| IOT160 |	Consul
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:27,872	| IOT160 |	Justice
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:28,896	| IOT160 |	Significant
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,664	| IOT160 |	Amounts of money
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,456	| IOT160 |	Security
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| IOT160 |	Console
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,760	| IOT160 |	Clear Lake to prevent piracy
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,552	| IOT160 |	But in the process
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,344	| IOT160 |	Doing that we learned a lot
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,368	| IOT160 |	About
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:42,464	| IOT160 |	What determine hackers will do how far they will go
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:44,768	| IOT160 |	And what kind of defense mechanism
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,792	| IOT160 |	Eaton Place
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:52,192	| IOT160 |	And then we took that learnings and created this it block that we are using I think one of the things that stands out
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:55,008	| IOT160 |	Compared to some other Solutions is that
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,800	| IOT160 |	It really has based on this
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,080	| IOT160 |	Many many years
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:01,664	| IOT160 |	Experience dealing with very persistent very determined
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,480	| IOT160 |	I guess another way to describe it is
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:05,248	| IOT160 |	It is built
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:09,088	| IOT160 |	Shoe function with the address Pier operating system
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:10,368	| IOT160 |	And the Azure sphere
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,672	| IOT160 |	Security service
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,696	| IOT160 |	Optimizing
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,000	| IOT160 |	Fire system in the end
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,816	| IOT160 |	So the all the pieces work together perfectly
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:25,984	| IOT160 |	So if I'm a customer and I'm like hey this sounds awesome I totally want to go and get these devices
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:28,544	| IOT160 |	Never worried about security does that mean that I
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,824	| IOT160 |	If I buy
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:34,176	| IOT160 |	This does that mean all of my date that these chips are generating get sent to
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:37,248	| IOT160 |	The Azure iot Cloud eventually or could I use
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:38,016	| IOT160 |	Another
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,040	| IOT160 |	Or keep it on premise
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:43,648	| IOT160 |	That's a great question as I mentioned before you were really committed to open this
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,536	| IOT160 |	But we don't actually
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,304	| IOT160 |	Hold your data
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,632	| IOT160 |	Connect to whatever cloud service
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:57,472	| IOT160 |	So if you that you're running proprietary servers
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,264	| IOT160 |	On-premises Enterprise
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,800	| IOT160 |	Will you connect to them
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:03,104	| IOT160 |	Are you connect AWS or Google
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:06,432	| IOT160 |	Or I am or Azure iot hub
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:07,968	| IOT160 |	Shroud
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:12,064	| IOT160 |	Obviously you want to make it as easy as possible
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:12,832	| IOT160 |	Thatcher
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:17,184	| IOT160 |	Created a fantastic very easy to use while buried and freeway
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:21,024	| IOT160 |	For people to use Azure cloud services for their date if they want to but we don't
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:24,096	| IOT160 |	Let's talk about Azure sphere
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,120	| IOT160 |	But I buy it
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,656	| IOT160 |	Have you guys would I buy
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,168	| IOT160 |	The chip Inn
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,472	| IOT160 |	Can force from the chips
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,800	| IOT160 |	The way you
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,592	| IOT160 |	We would purchase address
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:36,640	| IOT160 |	Fear is you would go to your
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,432	| IOT160 |	Distributor
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:41,760	| IOT160 |	Spirit certified ship and whip it would come bundled
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:44,320	| IOT160 |	The license for the Azure sphere operating
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:48,160	| IOT160 |	Come pre-installed on the ship and
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,696	| IOT160 |	The rights to use the azure
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:51,232	| IOT160 |	Security service
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,512	| IOT160 |	Or attend your lifetime
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,072	| IOT160 |	At the one-time transaction
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,352	| IOT160 |	One-time pay one cost
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:59,168	| IOT160 |	You get the operating system
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,936	| IOT160 |	Security service
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,216	| IOT160 |	An ongoing service
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:01,728	| IOT160 |	Prices for that
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,800	| IOT160 |	Okay so let's talk now about
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:07,104	| IOT160 |	Macro iot thing
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:10,432	| IOT160 |	One of the big things that we
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:15,040	| IOT160 |	We talked about a lot is this oh my gosh are we going to do everything in the cloud to do everything at the edge
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,576	| IOT160 |	It's probably going to be a bit of both
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:18,368	| IOT160 |	Depending on your use case
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:20,928	| IOT160 |	This feels like a very cloud-centric model
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,440	| IOT160 |	Because
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,768	| IOT160 |	Sending my data from the secure MCU up to
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,560	| IOT160 |	The cloud security
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,328	| IOT160 |	Development
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:30,912	| IOT160 |	How might I build this to work in borovan
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:32,192	| IOT160 |	Distributing in Bayern
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,472	| IOT160 |	It may not have
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:36,800	| IOT160 |	Always on or even reliable connectivity does that break this model
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:39,616	| IOT160 |	We have to see the clouds in a very important element
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,944	| IOT160 |	Microsoft message
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:44,736	| IOT160 |	Talk about the intelligent cloud
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:45,248	| IOT160 |	Intelligent
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,576	| IOT160 |	Azure iot
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:55,232	| IOT160 |	That allows you to take computation you normally run the clouds and bring it down locally in the environment
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:57,792	| IOT160 |	Stare
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:00,864	| IOT160 |	Container ship that's offline
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,400	| IOT160 |	The time
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:06,240	| IOT160 |	Factory you don't want to shut down your after shutdown your product line
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,520	| IOT160 |	Just because you have lost your internet can
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:13,152	| IOT160 |	And so have the capability bringing this coffee tastes very very vocal as well
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:18,016	| IOT160 |	Am I correct in understanding that this will work with Azure iot Edge
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:20,064	| IOT160 |	Yes absolutely
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:20,832	| IOT160 |	And
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:22,112	| IOT160 |	Would it work with some
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,880	| IOT160 |	Other
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,416	| IOT160 |	Edge Computing platform
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,184	| IOT160 |	I'm not using
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,952	| IOT160 |	Iot Edge
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,000	| IOT160 |	It could be made to work with enough
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,048	| IOT160 |	Platform
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,840	| IOT160 |	We got it
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,376	| IOT160 |	Chicken got an operating system
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,424	| IOT160 |	And we provide an API
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,448	| IOT160 |	Programming.
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,472	| IOT160 |	Chips and
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:39,264	| IOT160 |	Or giving you internet connection
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:42,080	| IOT160 |	TCP IP connection TLS connection
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,384	| IOT160 |	Programmer to program
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,176	| IOT160 |	The actual device
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:47,200	| IOT160 |	They're open today
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,480	| IOT160 |	Program
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,016	| IOT160 |	Execution
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:51,552	| IOT160 |	Local device they're open till
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:55,648	| IOT160 |	Whatever local devices are other things in the environment as well
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:58,720	| IOT160 |	In why is Microsoft doing
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,232	| IOT160 |	What is
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:02,048	| IOT160 |	Obviously we care a lot about iot security
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:03,072	| IOT160 |	White in Turkey
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:07,168	| IOT160 |	What is a hardware platform in a Linux distro which is kind of crazy for you
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:11,520	| IOT160 |	But you don't participate in the it
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:15,104	| IOT160 |	Think about I guess Jeff back and think about
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:15,872	| IOT160 |	Descendants you
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:19,200	| IOT160 |	Billions of these devices
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,712	| IOT160 |	Coming on
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:25,856	| IOT160 |	We look at it cuz they that the Technologies of people are using right now
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:27,136	| IOT160 |	Free azure
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,928	| IOT160 |	Those devices are not going to
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:30,976	| IOT160 |	Security nightmare
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,512	| IOT160 |	And we looked at it
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,304	| IOT160 |	Start this project
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:34,816	| IOT160 |	4 years ago
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,352	| IOT160 |	Looking at that eclipse
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:40,704	| IOT160 |	Future that looks like a very scary future and saying
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:42,752	| IOT160 |	Yeah we have the technology
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,520	| IOT160 |	We have
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,288	| IOT160 |	A lot of
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:47,616	| IOT160 |	Experience we could that kind of do almost started the research
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:49,920	| IOT160 |	Could we take everything that we've
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,456	| IOT160 |	Learned a Microsoft about
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,224	| IOT160 |	Security
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,272	| IOT160 |	And figure out how to package unit
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:58,112	| IOT160 |	Such a way that it could be used on these very very small devices
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,648	| IOT160 |	So that we lived in a secure where
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,440	| IOT160 |	And that's what we create with that
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:04,512	| IOT160 |	What year was kind of
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:08,608	| IOT160 |	When I talk
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,448	| IOT160 |	It was reason is Galen wants to live in
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:17,568	| IOT160 |	The security is out there is out there for him to use
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,592	| IOT160 |	I could not get it
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:20,896	| IOT160 |	So we're bringing the Technologies to make those
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,200	| IOT160 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:25,248	| IOT160 |	Ultimately a corporation
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,784	| IOT160 |	Responsibility
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:30,880	| IOT160 |	But we see is if there are many of these devices and their
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,648	| IOT160 |	Picture and people
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,768	| IOT160 |	They will be part of Cloud solution
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,560	| IOT160 |	So they will use cloud services
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,680	| IOT160 |	Are all of the Azure service
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:46,752	| IOT160 |	So we see tremendous economic benefits there
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:51,616	| IOT160 |	Okay so what are the things that you cited several times in relation to the creation
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:55,199	| IOT160 |	This is your seven properties of Highly secure device
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,247	| IOT160 |	Just briefly letsrun
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,807	| IOT160 |	Okay soda
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,575	| IOT160 |	7 properties
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,623	| IOT160 |	Margarita Trust
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:05,183	| IOT160 |	Then defense-in-depth
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,463	| IOT160 |	Small PCB
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,999	| IOT160 |	A trusted Computing base
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,535	| IOT160 |	Dynamic compartments
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:11,071	| IOT160 |	Certificate-based Authentication
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,863	| IOT160 |	Online are recording
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,655	| IOT160 |	And renewable security
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:16,703	| IOT160 |	Yes okay
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,471	| IOT160 |	So
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:20,543	| IOT160 |	Let's just dig into a couple of those that people might be like what
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,335	| IOT160 |	Compartmentalization what does that mean
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:23,871	| IOT160 |	Okay I love this
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:27,711	| IOT160 |	The compartmentalization is actually probably almost one of the oldest
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:28,991	| IOT160 |	Security Technologies
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:29,759	| IOT160 |	Known to man
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,807	| IOT160 |	And this is the idea of
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:34,367	| IOT160 |	Having multiple layers of Defense
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:34,879	| IOT160 |	Having
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:36,927	| IOT160 |	Separation of concerns
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:38,975	| IOT160 |	Example
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:42,815	| IOT160 |	Compartmentalize with Floodgate one part of the ship
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:43,583	| IOT160 |	Because there's a lake
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:46,143	| IOT160 |	That doesn't just fill up the entire ship
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:51,519	| IOT160 |	Buildings where we have firewalls inside a building if there's a fire
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:52,287	| IOT160 |	Prevent it from property
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:55,103	| IOT160 |	Lego Back to the Future cast
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:57,151	| IOT160 |	If you think about all that s***
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:43:01,247	| IOT160 |	One of the most important lessons we've learned at Microsoft about security or less
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:04,319	| IOT160 |	20 years is that it isn't a matter of
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,343	| IOT160 |	If I will get her
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,879	| IOT160 |	You will get high
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,415	| IOT160 |	Make sure to buy some version of your device
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:10,719	| IOT160 |	Question
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:11,487	| IOT160 |	When your device
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:15,327	| IOT160 |	What are the medications and what how prepared are you
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:18,399	| IOT160 |	It's a building compartment actually end of the chapter
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:19,935	| IOT160 |	Self and the operating system
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:22,239	| IOT160 |	Allows us to if
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:24,031	| IOT160 |	Partnership becomes compromised in summer
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:26,079	| IOT160 |	That compromise
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:28,383	| IOT160 |	Compartmentalize they can't go any further
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:32,735	| IOT160 |	And then we can use the rest of the ship and the rest of the operating system and software
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,015	| IOT160 |	To build restore
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:34,527	| IOT160 |	Security.
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:38,367	| IOT160 |	I'll even go a little bit farther because one questions you might ask
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,903	| IOT160 |	These chips are different
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:41,439	| IOT160 |	The traditional MCU
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,487	| IOT160 |	We brought in a cortex a class
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:45,791	| IOT160 |	Processor in addition to the cortex M class
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,607	| IOT160 |	Non-exempt to use for the very first time
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,167	| IOT160 |	The reason why
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:53,727	| IOT160 |	Because it gives us Dynamic compartments
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,775	| IOT160 |	Traditional MCU
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,567	| IOT160 |	Aesthetic Apartments I have like
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:00,639	| IOT160 |	Maybe at TruStone and then one other Lakes
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,431	| IOT160 |	Willie two compartments on the chair
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,199	| IOT160 |	And so
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:07,039	| IOT160 |	You can't change departments like after you've been out and employment if you figure out the
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:08,063	| IOT160 |	You custom music
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:10,879	| IOT160 |	Security vulnerability or some news form of attack
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,671	| IOT160 |	Like with a device been out with you
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,439	| IOT160 |	Light years
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:15,231	| IOT160 |	And some new
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,767	| IOT160 |	Security attack is
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:20,351	| IOT160 |	Embedded we can actually change the compartmentalization
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:26,495	| IOT160 |	In the device by years after it's out in the field and mitigate against and prevent that attacks will be you
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,775	| IOT160 |	Wow
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:32,127	| IOT160 |	That sounds awesome but it's also brings up these are not chips
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:34,687	| IOT160 |	Battery-powered devices the song
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:35,455	| IOT160 |	It's going to consume
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,223	| IOT160 |	More power
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:36,991	| IOT160 |	Glass chip
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:41,087	| IOT160 |	Well one of the innovations that we get so we partnered very early with
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:41,855	| IOT160 |	Arm
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,367	| IOT160 |	Building
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,207	| IOT160 |	Figured out
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:49,279	| IOT160 |	Scout II with their help to construct an a class
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:50,303	| IOT160 |	Processor
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:52,351	| IOT160 |	It is much lower power and
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,143	| IOT160 |	Smaller area
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:56,447	| IOT160 |	10 people traditionally associated with the cortex 8
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:00,287	| IOT160 |	And so we will see battery power
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:01,311	| IOT160 |	Address to chips
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:02,847	| IOT160 |	All of this sounds
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:03,871	| IOT160 |	Really intriguing
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,663	| IOT160 |	My biggest question
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,455	| IOT160 |	With this is forever
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,223	| IOT160 |	Going for
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,783	| IOT160 |	Is there a way to retrofit some
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:11,551	| IOT160 |	Space force
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:12,319	| IOT160 |	Are all healthy
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:13,087	| IOT160 |	Millions
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:16,159	| IOT160 |	Hundreds of millions of connected devices that are already
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,975	| IOT160 |	Well it turns out
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,535	| IOT160 |	In the empty space there aren't that many device
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:25,375	| IOT160 |	And so we're really kind of worth it
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:27,167	| IOT160 |	Perfect timing rainout address
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:34,335	| IOT160 |	The problems before they can become problems or all of the new devices as they
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,615	| IOT160 |	Can created become
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:38,175	| IOT160 |	You know it's like right now
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,711	| IOT160 |	Every Appliance in your kitchen is
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:43,295	| IOT160 |	You have not been to my house
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:46,111	| IOT160 |	Is your kitten
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,391	| IOT160 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,463	| IOT160 |	Okay
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,999	| IOT160 |	And these will be on the market
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:53,023	| IOT160 |	Like physical devices
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,095	| IOT160 |	The first
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:46:01,727	| IOT160 |	Azure sphere certified ships will be available in volume this summer and we expect
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:02,495	| IOT160 |	See the very first
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:04,287	| IOT160 |	Azure sphere base
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:05,823	| IOT160 |	Products on shelves
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,103	| IOT160 |	Devices on shelf
