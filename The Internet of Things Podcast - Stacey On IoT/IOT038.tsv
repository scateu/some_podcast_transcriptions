EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:42,240	| IOT038 |	We wanted to do a special holiday podcast
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:46,080	| IOT038 |	In which we briefly spend a few moments with you to sing a few carols
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:47,872	| IOT038 |	Drink a little eggnog
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:48,896	| IOT038 |	I'm just kidding
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:51,200	| IOT038 |	Freaking out he's like there was no singing
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:52,480	| IOT038 |	I was reaching for my glass
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:54,016	| IOT038 |	You had me right now
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:59,648	| IOT038 |	No we wanted to do just a quick kind of like
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,928	| IOT038 |	This is our Christmas gift
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:01,952	| IOT038 |	Do you guys which is
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:08,608	| IOT038 |	Which is actually kind of a downer we're going to assume that you might have some trouble say
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:10,912	| IOT038 |	Merry Christmas
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,752	| IOT038 |	Yes so
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:15,520	| IOT038 |	In case
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,800	| IOT038 |	We're also going to assume that
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,848	| IOT038 |	We're going to try to help you out
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,360	| IOT038 |	Before you get into
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,152	| IOT038 |	So
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:23,968	| IOT038 |	We wanted to share advice when we're setting up connected.
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:30,624	| IOT038 |	Send devices what do we we've gone through all the pain point for years so that you don't have to that's our hope with us
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,160	| IOT038 |	So here we go
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:33,696	| IOT038 |	Starting out
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,232	| IOT038 |	Kevin you want to go with
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,024	| IOT038 |	With your your first
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:38,048	| IOT038 |	Tip for people
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:44,448	| IOT038 |	Right off the bat you've got to have patience and time put aside if you're going to be connecting your devices weather
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:50,848	| IOT038 |	Are there add-ons to existing system or just a whole brand new system I'm in I was joking with Stacy before the show this is now
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,872	| IOT038 |	Not the kind of project
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,200	| IOT038 |	That you didn't want to do it between say Christmas dinner and dessert
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,504	| IOT038 |	Make sure you give yourself plenty of time
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,528	| IOT038 |	And have patience
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:06,208	| IOT038 |	Is devices upon startup sometimes there they look like they're ready for you to add things you don't maybe you got a hubber bridge
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,000	| IOT038 |	Legend cycling headlights
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,304	| IOT038 |	Just make sure you wait sometimes babe
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:13,376	| IOT038 |	LED indicator sometimes it don't just be patient
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,936	| IOT038 |	And follow instructions when you should be fine
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,960	| IOT038 |	All right on that note
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,752	| IOT038 |	You need to read the
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:22,080	| IOT038 |	Instructions and you need to have your tools at the ready
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,104	| IOT038 |	So
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:28,224	| IOT038 |	So guilty of this I am often like so excited I grabbed it out of the box
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,504	| IOT038 |	A start
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:34,624	| IOT038 |	Trying to install stuff and then I've got like my hands full of stuff this is really important for like
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,648	| IOT038 |	Things that involve
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,672	| IOT038 |	Light switches
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,184	| IOT038 |	Locks
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| IOT038 |	Actual physical installs of products
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,304	| IOT038 |	But make sure you have your tools ready
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,096	| IOT038 |	Like that include your phone
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:47,168	| IOT038 |	If for some reason is still like back in the early
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,984	| IOT038 |	Translate mm and has only a web app
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,520	| IOT038 |	I might need your computer
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,568	| IOT038 |	So read the instructions
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,104	| IOT038 |	Make sure you have your tools ready
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| IOT038 |	I'm screwdrivers
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| IOT038 |	If you need to
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,224	| IOT038 |	Turn off the power of my God turn off the power
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,040	| IOT038 |	And then
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| IOT038 |	You know
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,088	| IOT038 |	Start your install
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,136	| IOT038 |	Don't be too afraid to do any of those things
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,464	| IOT038 |	Exactly exactly
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:13,024	| IOT038 |	And then once you really get going
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:16,352	| IOT038 |	The first thing I do with just about any device that I add to my house
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:20,448	| IOT038 |	I always check and see where in the app for where the settings
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,752	| IOT038 |	Firmware version is appearing
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:25,312	| IOT038 |	And usually will see a check for updates in there
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:29,664	| IOT038 |	Always check for updates before you even start adding devices to other devices
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:35,296	| IOT038 |	It's a simple process you might follow instructions to the T out-of-the-box for device
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,320	| IOT038 |	But it still doesn't work
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,856	| IOT038 |	What's usually the culprit
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:40,672	| IOT038 |	From where maybe something is changed and instructions
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:47,584	| IOT038 |	Haven't weeks or so on and they don't apply anymore because the firmware has been changed so I highly recommend making sure and every single device
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| IOT038 |	Has firmware
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,168	| IOT038 |	Make sure you update that from her before you really get going
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,448	| IOT038 |	Also with this
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,984	| IOT038 |	Possibility
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,520	| IOT038 |	Make sure
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,056	| IOT038 |	Your device actually works with
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,592	| IOT038 |	Your device
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,104	| IOT038 |	So
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:04,224	| IOT038 |	I can't tell you how often I've been like in the Google app store or Play Store
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:04,992	| IOT038 |	Xiaomi
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:09,344	| IOT038 |	I'm looking for an app for device only to find out that it will only works with iPhones
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,648	| IOT038 |	And I'm like
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:15,488	| IOT038 |	That's not a big deal cuz I also have an iPhone but if you don't you're going to be kind of sad
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:20,863	| IOT038 |	And actually that probably should go before the other one because a bunch of open the box York
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,399	| IOT038 |	Going to be like now I can't return it
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,703	| IOT038 |	This is going to be the worst regift ever
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:32,639	| IOT038 |	Just to add to compatibility a lot of these products write on the box
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:35,967	| IOT038 |	I'll tell you what hubs and bridges and other products they work with
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:39,295	| IOT038 |	So just make sure before you even open it
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,319	| IOT038 |	Just make sure that
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:44,671	| IOT038 |	You know if I say will work with the base B if it says it's compatible on the box
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| IOT038 |	You could open a keep going
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,231	| IOT038 |	Yeah cuz what if it's like
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,511	| IOT038 |	I'm sorry Mom
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:53,375	| IOT038 |	But what if they're like Clarity like connected devices so I got you this connected device
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,399	| IOT038 |	And then
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,703	| IOT038 |	Like oh my God but this only works with the
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:01,311	| IOT038 |	The wink Hub and I have a SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:04,127	| IOT038 |	I need this would not be a problem for me but for other people
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,663	| IOT038 |	This is true
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:06,943	| IOT038 |	So
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,015	| IOT038 |	I know Stacy doesn't want me to say this I'm gonna say it anyway
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,319	| IOT038 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,647	| IOT038 |	This is so under duress you guys
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,927	| IOT038 |	So are we.
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:20,255	| IOT038 |	Stacy still upset that I haven't installed the
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,535	| IOT038 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,607	| IOT038 |	Busy I'm sorry
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:30,239	| IOT038 |	I'm sorry Stacy is still upset that I have not installed the Z-Wave lock set on my front door
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,799	| IOT038 |	Actually I have tested it
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:36,127	| IOT038 |	And that actually is a good thing for this list of things to consider
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:39,711	| IOT038 |	I already know that the locks that works because
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:44,063	| IOT038 |	I took it out of the box I put the batteries in I set it up on my
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,087	| IOT038 |	With my phone
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:49,183	| IOT038 |	And I was actually using my phone to lock and unlock the door lock
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:52,255	| IOT038 |	Even though it was in the door and I say this because
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,279	| IOT038 |	Why bother
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:59,679	| IOT038 |	Taking out a lockset putting in a new one only if I know it doesn't work maybe you didn't put the batteries in right maybe you didn't set some
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,471	| IOT038 |	Something up right maybe there's a switch inside
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:05,567	| IOT038 |	So just test things before if you can test them before you actually install them
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,383	| IOT038 |	I don't think it's a bad thing I said under
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,919	| IOT038 |	That's because it's not hard
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,247	| IOT038 |	Install and uninstall lock change the batteries
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:20,415	| IOT038 |	Also because yes I'm mad at you for not installing the locks I said to you
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| IOT038 |	Anyway moving on
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| IOT038 |	Also
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,047	| IOT038 |	Kevin brought it this week
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,327	| IOT038 |	Which is really good point
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,863	| IOT038 |	About order of operation
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,375	| IOT038 |	And install
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,167	| IOT038 |	So once
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,983	| IOT038 |	When she performed are very dull and very serious checklist
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,287	| IOT038 |	Which will save you time and trouble
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,335	| IOT038 |	Start with
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,383	| IOT038 |	Especially with things like light bulbs
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,663	| IOT038 |	Start like
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,199	| IOT038 |	What was your tip there
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,015	| IOT038 |	I said start in the center Mortuary
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,039	| IOT038 |	Yeah
