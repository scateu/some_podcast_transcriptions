EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:40,704	| cediaspecialreal |	First and then several interviews from
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:41,728	| cediaspecialreal |	People I met on the Shelf
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:45,056	| cediaspecialreal |	Last week I went to CD in San Diego
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:49,152	| cediaspecialreal |	And CD is this trade show aimed at the custom installer Market
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:50,688	| cediaspecialreal |	These are the professionals
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:53,248	| cediaspecialreal |	To put those awesome AV systems
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:57,344	| cediaspecialreal |	High-end lighting and other electronics into the homes you might see in places like
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:59,392	| cediaspecialreal |	I don't know architectural Digest
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:00,672	| cediaspecialreal |	So think of
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:05,536	| cediaspecialreal |	Easy things like a TV screen that unfolds to show you a movie by the pool
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:11,680	| cediaspecialreal |	Or something that takes your lighting and controls it based on your mood or time of day
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,192	| cediaspecialreal |	I
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:16,544	| cediaspecialreal |	Probably could come up with other crazy examples except I am just not fancy enough
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:22,432	| cediaspecialreal |	Much of the show is dedicated to professional AV audio visual equipment
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:25,760	| cediaspecialreal |	There are so many speakers
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:30,368	| cediaspecialreal |	Fairmount and row after row Movie Theater seating
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,952	| cediaspecialreal |	But smart home stories still wherever
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:39,072	| cediaspecialreal |	I saw several startups worth calling out such as Neo which is Bill to Hub
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,120	| cediaspecialreal |	I know it's a hub
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:45,216	| cediaspecialreal |	But it has all the radios you need like Wi-Fi Bluetooth zigbee Z-Wave
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,264	| cediaspecialreal |	Cute
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,032	| cediaspecialreal |	Is it okay to say cute
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,568	| cediaspecialreal |	It's askew
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,104	| cediaspecialreal |	Black and silver
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:51,616	| cediaspecialreal |	Housing
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:54,176	| cediaspecialreal |	And then it also has a remote
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,480	| cediaspecialreal |	That goes with it in this remote design
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,248	| cediaspecialreal |	Is gorgeous
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:59,296	| cediaspecialreal |	It is very Sleek looking at has a
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:03,136	| cediaspecialreal |	Beautiful screen on it and it has a sensor on the back
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,672	| cediaspecialreal |	And what that sensor does is it
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:07,232	| cediaspecialreal |	What is a reading the palm of
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:07,744	| cediaspecialreal |	Your hand
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,560	| cediaspecialreal |	And in doing so
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,840	| cediaspecialreal |	It is able to tell
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:17,728	| cediaspecialreal |	Who has the remote control in their hand and so it will offer personalized recommendations for that
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,776	| cediaspecialreal |	Person so you may have many different net
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| cediaspecialreal |	Accounts
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,592	| cediaspecialreal |	But when you pick up that remote
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| cediaspecialreal |	You're only going to see
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,384	| cediaspecialreal |	Your Netflix
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,176	| cediaspecialreal |	I'm a little
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,200	| cediaspecialreal |	Worried about the
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,224	| cediaspecialreal |	The startup it's based income
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,552	| cediaspecialreal |	I'm worried about its ability to actually
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:37,184	| cediaspecialreal |	Last for very long but I'm hoping that someone snaps it up because it really looked
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,720	| cediaspecialreal |	Compelling it was a Kickstarter
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,816	| cediaspecialreal |	Another cool startup that I saw was called hibersense
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:46,656	| cediaspecialreal |	And this startup is trying to make my dream of not having a thermostat
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| cediaspecialreal |	On the wall
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,960	| cediaspecialreal |	True what it does
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| cediaspecialreal |	This is
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,776	| cediaspecialreal |	Like many of the companies that offer
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,544	| cediaspecialreal |	Control of
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,360	| cediaspecialreal |	Vents in your house like kinor
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,128	| cediaspecialreal |	Ecovent
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:59,968	| cediaspecialreal |	This company offers control of both dampers and vent sweeties
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,760	| cediaspecialreal |	Connected
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,784	| cediaspecialreal |	Motorized
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:07,392	| cediaspecialreal |	Opener thingies but it also has a sensor that goes in every room
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,184	| cediaspecialreal |	The sensors measure the temp
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| cediaspecialreal |	Temperature
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:14,560	| cediaspecialreal |	City all of that and they use that to control your AC and HVAC on an individual room
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,120	| cediaspecialreal |	And every time I talk about
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,912	| cediaspecialreal |	Companies doing this again about you notes for
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,728	| cediaspecialreal |	HP AC installers Clear Lake
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,800	| cediaspecialreal |	You blow out you know your ductwork with too much pressure
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:28,384	| cediaspecialreal |	So these guys actually say they take all of that into account so
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:33,504	| cediaspecialreal |	If you're in only one room in the house and everyone's there and all the others you want shutdown it actually probably won't
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,040	| cediaspecialreal |	Do that cuz it would create too much of
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,576	| cediaspecialreal |	Pressure on your deck
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,344	| cediaspecialreal |	But
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,880	| cediaspecialreal |	I loved the startup
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,696	| cediaspecialreal |	I loved the idea that one day you won't have a thermostat
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,744	| cediaspecialreal |	And they're trying to make that a reality
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,280	| cediaspecialreal |	Again
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,816	| cediaspecialreal |	I don't know if they're going to hit it for
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,120	| cediaspecialreal |	They're going to be around for the Long Haul but I liked where they were going
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,912	| cediaspecialreal |	There are also some
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,448	| cediaspecialreal |	A lot of router
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:55,264	| cediaspecialreal |	Companies running around so I saw some companies that were offering
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,824	| cediaspecialreal |	Basically the ability for you
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,872	| cediaspecialreal |	To put parental control inside
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,896	| cediaspecialreal |	Security software
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,432	| cediaspecialreal |	On a router made by
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,248	| cediaspecialreal |	Another OEM so the OEM has to buy
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,528	| cediaspecialreal |	The software
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:09,600	| cediaspecialreal |	But then you can also extend it through apps on people smartphone
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| cediaspecialreal |	The benefit there is
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,928	| cediaspecialreal |	If you tell your teenager
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,232	| cediaspecialreal |	That
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| cediaspecialreal |	At 10
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,791	| cediaspecialreal |	Heater turning off WiFi throughout the house
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,839	| cediaspecialreal |	For their devices
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:22,655	| cediaspecialreal |	Then most likely they're going to hop on their phone and
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,959	| cediaspecialreal |	I'll just use the LTE networks text
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,775	| cediaspecialreal |	But in this way you can actually
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,055	| cediaspecialreal |	With a pond
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,335	| cediaspecialreal |	Their phone
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,103	| cediaspecialreal |	You can actually
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,871	| cediaspecialreal |	Turn off
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,407	| cediaspecialreal |	Their LTE network
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,199	| cediaspecialreal |	As well so I thought that kind of offer to
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,223	| cediaspecialreal |	Hole
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,783	| cediaspecialreal |	A whole device solution maybe that was worth noting
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,111	| cediaspecialreal |	Cool stuff from big companies to
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,647	| cediaspecialreal |	So LG
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:47,231	| cediaspecialreal |	Had this $20,000 television
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,279	| cediaspecialreal |	That was to OLED screen
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,047	| cediaspecialreal |	Mountain
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,071	| cediaspecialreal |	Back to back
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,583	| cediaspecialreal |	Initiative
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| cediaspecialreal |	It
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:53,887	| cediaspecialreal |	Was gorgeous
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,935	| cediaspecialreal |	It is for
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,703	| cediaspecialreal |	Retail
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,215	| cediaspecialreal |	Primarily
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| cediaspecialreal |	And it's only in portrait
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,055	| cediaspecialreal |	But holy cow you guys
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| cediaspecialreal |	They offered this at landscape
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,663	| cediaspecialreal |	And I had $20,000 I would totally put
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,991	| cediaspecialreal |	Actually maybe you don't need it back.
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| cediaspecialreal |	I would just like my TV
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,087	| cediaspecialreal |	That was
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,599	| cediaspecialreal |	That was awesome
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:17,951	| cediaspecialreal |	Lutron also launched a new product line that sits between is
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| cediaspecialreal |	Professional-grade

EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,071	| cediaspecialreal |	Acetylene
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,863	| cediaspecialreal |	The Maestro lion uses
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,655	| cediaspecialreal |	Is a different radio protocol

EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,007	| cediaspecialreal |	But what Lutron is done
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,799	| cediaspecialreal |	Is a taken things like
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,591	| cediaspecialreal |	The concept of a smart bridge and
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,383	| cediaspecialreal |	Programming based on an app
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,175	| cediaspecialreal |	And they brought that up
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| cediaspecialreal |	To its Maestro radio
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,735	| cediaspecialreal |	Saratu
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,783	| cediaspecialreal |	Radio now
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:47,135	| cediaspecialreal |	Professional installers this is only through professionals is not for like
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,647	| cediaspecialreal |	DIY people
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,439	| cediaspecialreal |	But if you have more than I have
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,999	| cediaspecialreal |	50 lights you can't control
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,327	| cediaspecialreal |	So you're going to move up into this
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,607	| cediaspecialreal |	Pro-Line
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| cediaspecialreal |	And
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,911	| cediaspecialreal |	You can program it with an app
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,191	| cediaspecialreal |	Which means someone might
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,983	| cediaspecialreal |	Come in and install it for you
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| cediaspecialreal |	But then you can tweak it
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,079	| cediaspecialreal |	The rest of your life without calling the
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,455	| cediaspecialreal |	That actually ties into a lot of Trends we're going to talk about me
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,479	| cediaspecialreal |	Little bit on the show soap
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,759	| cediaspecialreal |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,551	| cediaspecialreal |	This idea of having a pearl come in
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,623	| cediaspecialreal |	Install it for you and then leave your life forever
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,647	| cediaspecialreal |	And
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,439	| cediaspecialreal |	I also found out
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:25,535	| cediaspecialreal |	Kevin and I couple episodes were kind of a little bit wrong
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,071	| cediaspecialreal |	Not that we would have known it
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,119	| cediaspecialreal |	I ran into some SmartThings p
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,655	| cediaspecialreal |	At the event
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,447	| cediaspecialreal |	And they were showing off smart thing
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,983	| cediaspecialreal |	In
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,519	| cediaspecialreal |	Wi-Fi routers and
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| cediaspecialreal |	Is the SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:39,615	| cediaspecialreal |	But what they weren't showing is SmartThings in a TV
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:42,687	| cediaspecialreal |	So I asked him about it and they said Hold Ya weave
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,735	| cediaspecialreal |	But that basically we're not doing that anymore
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,575	| cediaspecialreal |	It may one day come back but they're not doing it now be
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,903	| cediaspecialreal |	Because they think that TVs are trying to make them skinnier
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:52,927	| cediaspecialreal |	And flattered
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,487	| cediaspecialreal |	And adding more videos just runs
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| cediaspecialreal |	Counter to that
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| cediaspecialreal |	But
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:00,095	| cediaspecialreal |	Don't worry SmartThings The Hub is not going away
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,655	| cediaspecialreal |	It's still going to exist and what they are doing
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,983	| cediaspecialreal |	Is putting SmartThings into Samsung's new line of Wi-Fi
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,543	| cediaspecialreal |	So they've got a mesh Wi-Fi
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,055	| cediaspecialreal |	A system that will
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,335	| cediaspecialreal |	SmartThings software
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,383	| cediaspecialreal |	Zigbee and Z-Wave radios in there
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,663	| cediaspecialreal |	And
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,687	| cediaspecialreal |	It should be
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,711	| cediaspecialreal |	Out there ready for
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,527	| cediaspecialreal |	You're looking for SmartThings in a TV
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| cediaspecialreal |	Stop looking
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,575	| cediaspecialreal |	Even though they said that would happen to
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,111	| cediaspecialreal |	Just not going to have
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,695	| cediaspecialreal |	Now those are some of the cool things that I saw
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,999	| cediaspecialreal |	But I decided that since
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,279	| cediaspecialreal |	This is my first year at
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,815	| cediaspecialreal |	I should probably get more
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,375	| cediaspecialreal |	So I talked to Julie Jacobson
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,911	| cediaspecialreal |	Who is the founding editor of CEO
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,447	| cediaspecialreal |	She is like

EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,079	| cediaspecialreal |	She knew everyone there and actually what we were doing our conversation
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,383	| cediaspecialreal |	Someone even walked by and said
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,943	| cediaspecialreal |	Is that Julie and then they snapped a picture during the interview
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:50,527	| cediaspecialreal |	But before we get to the things that Julie thought were
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,087	| cediaspecialreal |	Let's take a moment

EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,623	| cediaspecialreal |	Because you have moved
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,391	| cediaspecialreal |	Beyond doorbell
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,671	| cediaspecialreal |	Into this
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,207	| cediaspecialreal |	Concept of building a ring of six
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,255	| cediaspecialreal |	What does that even mean
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:39,167	| cediaspecialreal |	Bring a company our mission is around a different kind of neighborhoods
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:45,567	| cediaspecialreal |	What is a Solutions company until you started with

EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,111	| cediaspecialreal |	And then we moved to the ring a straight down the hall
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,647	| cediaspecialreal |	The other products
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| cediaspecialreal |	Thornell coming out look like

EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| cediaspecialreal |	But before we get to that
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,263	| cediaspecialreal |	Which is exciting
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,823	| cediaspecialreal |	Talk to me a little bit about how
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| cediaspecialreal |	Cameras
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,103	| cediaspecialreal |	Doorbells
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| cediaspecialreal |	Help
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,663	| cediaspecialreal |	Your neighborhood
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| cediaspecialreal |	Not just you
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,991	| cediaspecialreal |	What we found is that what
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:28,063	| cediaspecialreal |	Really impacting neighborhood is the lack of
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,367	| cediaspecialreal |	Cousins in the neighborhood
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,695	| cediaspecialreal |	Delivering presents
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,463	| cediaspecialreal |	What are products
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,023	| cediaspecialreal |	Intellectuality a motion detection
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,839	| cediaspecialreal |	Allowing you to answer your door from wherever you are
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,399	| cediaspecialreal |	Russia able to reduce crime in neighborhood
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,727	| cediaspecialreal |	A real true that we did a study with the LAPD when we play
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:49,311	| cediaspecialreal |	10% of homes in a neighborhood with the ring video doorbell
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:52,639	| cediaspecialreal |	And in that study available to reduce crime by 55%
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:59,295	| cediaspecialreal |	By just having 10% of the homes with having that presence of the Ring video doorbell and adding that presents back into the neighborhood
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,087	| cediaspecialreal |	That is awesome
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:07,231	| cediaspecialreal |	And we're going to hear more about that in a little bit
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:24,639	| cediaspecialreal |	And now to Julie Jacobson of ZTE Pro on the cool stuff she saw it CDA
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:32,063	| cediaspecialreal |	I think we've been sort of saddled with complete custom work in our industry and what happens is
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:38,463	| cediaspecialreal |	An integrated will go into a home and complete completely set up a configured system and when they walk away the consumer
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:44,863	| cediaspecialreal |	Kind of stuck with that may have to call the installer for every little change so what we're really saying is a trend towards person
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:51,263	| cediaspecialreal |	Conversation were you giving the end-user themselves many more tools to configure their systems once the install is
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,287	| cediaspecialreal |	Household
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,359	| cediaspecialreal |	What do you think is going to be
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:11:01,759	| cediaspecialreal |	The impact of DIY type stuff and smart home stuff on the industry
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:08,159	| cediaspecialreal |	Canyon early on was Ohno everyone's going to go DIY but I think it's been clear not just to the
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:13,023	| cediaspecialreal |	Integrators but to the larger industry as well everyone from Amazon and Google
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:19,423	| cediaspecialreal |	Down to the Nick markets that the integrators provided very necessary service I mean let's face it we can
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:25,823	| cediaspecialreal |	Lawn mower Lawns but not everyone wants to mow their lawn so he mass-market is bringing so much awareness and
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:32,223	| cediaspecialreal |	So much attention so much excitement to the mass-market about smart home technologies that are really good
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:38,623	| cediaspecialreal |	Can only benefit those who install the stuff for a living what is some of the most exciting Tech you seen at the show
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:45,023	| cediaspecialreal |	Fighting is kind of a strange word in our industry because it's little things like control4 is that an if-then
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:51,167	| cediaspecialreal |	10 engine into their home automation software to allow as we discussed earlier to allow consumers to
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,495	| cediaspecialreal |	Create their own scenes after the installer is left
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:12:00,895	| cediaspecialreal |	But there's also a bunch of mass-market things you excite me that the Samsung frame TVs I think they're fast
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,663	| cediaspecialreal |	Mating
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,479	| cediaspecialreal |	For single lot of applications for
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,551	| cediaspecialreal |	Motion art moving art barcode very high-end
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:14,463	| cediaspecialreal |	Producer of video projection screens is teaming up with Neo that's in Rio
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,767	| cediaspecialreal |	With a motion art
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:23,679	| cediaspecialreal |	Service and you're saying some fantastic applications about here in the show so it really runs
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:30,079	| cediaspecialreal |	Pogamat from Amazon Echo is huge and it's having a huge impact even on premium products Georgia
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:32,127	| cediaspecialreal |	Acoustics of showing a product that
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:38,527	| cediaspecialreal |	Pair Echo streaming and control with the premium multi-room audio
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:44,159	| cediaspecialreal |	So we're staying at really a wonderful blend of DIY with premium products and services
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,463	| cediaspecialreal |	Is Julie mentioned origin acoustics
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,743	| cediaspecialreal |	Scare was awesome
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:53,119	| cediaspecialreal |	You have to buy it from a professional installer but the capability it gives is really compelling
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,655	| cediaspecialreal |	The system
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,679	| cediaspecialreal |	Call the valet
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:58,751	| cediaspecialreal |	And it's a more powerful speaker Plus
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,311	| cediaspecialreal |	Power and ceiling cover for the echo
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:04,383	| cediaspecialreal |	So you'll end up buying for Echo dots for about
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:04,895	| cediaspecialreal |	$200
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,199	| cediaspecialreal |	And then you get this kit with
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:10,271	| cediaspecialreal |	Set the mounting system and a superior speaker for about six
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:10,783	| cediaspecialreal |	1600
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,087	| cediaspecialreal |	And suddenly you have liked
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:17,951	| cediaspecialreal |	The premium in-ceiling speaker setup that acts as a microphone to capture any command set
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| cediaspecialreal |	But it wasn't all cool technology
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,583	| cediaspecialreal |	The biggest things I think I saw at the showare to
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| cediaspecialreal |	1
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:29,215	| cediaspecialreal |	Is the business model challenges facing the professional installers in
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,751	| cediaspecialreal |	Companies like control4 in Crest
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,055	| cediaspecialreal |	And the other
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,823	| cediaspecialreal |	Was
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:34,847	| cediaspecialreal |	Perhaps
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,615	| cediaspecialreal |	What might say that
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:39,455	| cediaspecialreal |	Which is I'm going to call it the rise of something called
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,223	| cediaspecialreal |	Do it for me
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:44,319	| cediaspecialreal |	So if you consider that many of us RDI wires that do it for ourselves
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:47,903	| cediaspecialreal |	And then there are those people who pay for fancy systems in their home
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:50,207	| cediaspecialreal |	And how other people install it for them
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:54,047	| cediaspecialreal |	The do it for me concept is somewhere in the middle kind of like that
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:54,559	| cediaspecialreal |	New Lutron sir
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:59,423	| cediaspecialreal |	Basically you take consumer-grade technology like a nest thermostat or hue bulbs
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,959	| cediaspecialreal |	And you get someone else like
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,007	| cediaspecialreal |	Custom installer to come in and do it for them
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:06,591	| cediaspecialreal |	This is kind of what Amazon is doing with its installing server
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,639	| cediaspecialreal |	Best Buy's betting on that for
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,151	| cediaspecialreal |	The Geek Squad
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,943	| cediaspecialreal |	And you even see it from some
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,711	| cediaspecialreal |	Professional monitoring
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:12,991	| cediaspecialreal |	Like alarm.
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:14,783	| cediaspecialreal |	Honeywell
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,295	| cediaspecialreal |	And
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:21,695	| cediaspecialreal |	Tim Becker day the director of product marketing at a company called savant
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,231	| cediaspecialreal |	Which I like to think of his Apple
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,255	| cediaspecialreal |	A smart home
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,583	| cediaspecialreal |	Talks about why the do it for me model
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:30,143	| cediaspecialreal |	Might not be the worst thing to happen
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,655	| cediaspecialreal |	Professional
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:34,239	| cediaspecialreal |	What are the trends that we're seeing here is the
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,031	| cediaspecialreal |	Do it for me
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:39,359	| cediaspecialreal |	Concept which is where the custom integrators come in and
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,383	| cediaspecialreal |	They are
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| cediaspecialreal |	Starting people
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,687	| cediaspecialreal |	What do you think about that
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:46,015	| cediaspecialreal |	First thing you know some of them see it as an opportunity to
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,039	| cediaspecialreal |	Get clients
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,111	| cediaspecialreal |	Early to get them started on maybe a simple any
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,951	| cediaspecialreal |	People in Hawaii Market
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,231	| cediaspecialreal |	Yuge
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,743	| cediaspecialreal |	But
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,815	| cediaspecialreal |	You're my friend he's a banker

EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,167	| cediaspecialreal |	Afraid
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:17,823	| cediaspecialreal |	And at the same time the dealers are trying to figure out how to make that work because it's a very different Financial
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,199	| cediaspecialreal |	Familiar with that financial model can you break that down for me
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:28,575	| cediaspecialreal |	Looking for a

EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:38,815	| cediaspecialreal |	Control4 Crestron or something like that
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,119	| cediaspecialreal |	Thousands of dollars
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,191	| cediaspecialreal |	Likely

EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:52,895	| cediaspecialreal |	Stores all of your music for you and it's all local in this wonderful but
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,687	| cediaspecialreal |	Frankly it's not necessary
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,735	| cediaspecialreal |	Seymour in what you probably really want
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| cediaspecialreal |	Is
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,831	| cediaspecialreal |	Your Deezer and your Spotify
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,111	| cediaspecialreal |	And services like that
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,159	| cediaspecialreal |	The problem
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,463	| cediaspecialreal |	I think
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,231	| cediaspecialreal |	Realize
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,535	| cediaspecialreal |	These products aren't as expensive
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,559	| cediaspecialreal |	Bose dealers
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,375	| cediaspecialreal |	Make their money on Market
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:19,519	| cediaspecialreal |	You sure there's money in installing it for you they also make a share on Market
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,847	| cediaspecialreal |	Product is a product only cost $169
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,895	| cediaspecialreal |	Instead of $4,000
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:31,039	| cediaspecialreal |	That's a very different financial situation so I think the challenge for the four installers is going to betray
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,159	| cediaspecialreal |	About this alot
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:42,559	| cediaspecialreal |	We monetize long-term.

EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:01,376	| cediaspecialreal |	They do large-scale installations and they have a
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,936	| cediaspecialreal |	Recurring relationship with their clients and then
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,472	| cediaspecialreal |	You start to see a lot more
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:12,384	| cediaspecialreal |	With clients these days that they have smaller setup still need as much because they become a lot more tech-savvy and we're just there
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:16,224	| cediaspecialreal |	To help support the things they don't understand or don't want to install
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:23,136	| cediaspecialreal |	And what would you like to see from the industry that maybe they're not giving you or maybe some people are giving it to you but as an s

EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| cediaspecialreal |	What do you want
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,512	| cediaspecialreal |	When it comes down to it it would be nice if
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:34,144	| cediaspecialreal |	Coyote side of things and also the custom guys could find a little bit better common ground in terms of
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:41,056	| cediaspecialreal |	Alder oldwyn play well together in the future either sides not going away I would say the iot and
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,872	| cediaspecialreal |	Great products that are coming out on a consumer level
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,640	| cediaspecialreal |	AR
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:50,784	| cediaspecialreal |	Fully encroaching more and more the custom side of things but the way I look at it is you have to look at these things and
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:57,696	| cediaspecialreal |	Find Wade Implement them with some custom products or quite frankly look to see if those those type of products can act
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:03,328	| cediaspecialreal |	LeapFrog what you currently have and it's sometimes hard for integrated to look at that and say
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,120	| cediaspecialreal |	Here's a $250 device
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,400	| cediaspecialreal |	Quite frankly
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:11,264	| cediaspecialreal |	Performs better than my $2,500 X Y and Z product
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:15,104	| cediaspecialreal |	And it's just something you have to look at hard but then also realize that
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:19,968	| cediaspecialreal |	There is a business model behind approaching these products installing amuse have to be smart about it
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,320	| cediaspecialreal |	There are plenty of other trends that I saw at the show
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,648	| cediaspecialreal |	Such as an emphasis on both voice control and Apple's homekit
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,720	| cediaspecialreal |	Energy management was also a big trend

EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:43,008	| cediaspecialreal |	My focus was on trying to figure out how the world of high-end home automation
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,568	| cediaspecialreal |	Would react and adapt to the encroaching
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,104	| cediaspecialreal |	Consumer technology
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,896	| cediaspecialreal |	From the outside

EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,328	| cediaspecialreal |	The big Tech
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:15,008	| cediaspecialreal |	A lot of the Innovations are coming out of companies like restaurant in control for which at CVS seem like very big companies
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:21,152	| cediaspecialreal |	But they're tiny compared to Google and apple and so when does Innovations are coming out of companies that really aren't that big
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:28,064	| cediaspecialreal |	It's hard to do things like voice control which takes hundreds of Engineers a lot of brainpower to pull off we had about set

EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:41,632	| cediaspecialreal |	So we really started with the hard stuff and then the control system stuff isn't easy by any means but
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,680	| cediaspecialreal |	In this landscape
