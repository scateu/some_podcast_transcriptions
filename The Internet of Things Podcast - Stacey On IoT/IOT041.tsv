EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:31,744	| IOT041 |	No it's it's an upper twenties today but we did have some snow
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:34,816	| IOT041 |	I think it was like the first snow of the season for us
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:39,424	| IOT041 |	Is Dan usually have something right now but
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:42,240	| IOT041 |	You know I live in a place where when we get snow
EDL	00:00:44,032	00:00:45,824	| IOT041 |	Shut it all down
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:48,384	| IOT041 |	Who know that does not happen here
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:53,504	| IOT041 |	Well so we're going to start off the show we got a lot of goodies plan for you we've got a CES wrap up
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:55,296	| IOT041 |	Some final thoughts
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:58,368	| IOT041 |	We only recorded half the show
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:03,232	| IOT041 |	You were only out at CVS like the second day of a whole week when we recorded the last show
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,256	| IOT041 |	Exactly
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:07,328	| IOT041 |	So we'll get the rest of CES and will cover
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,632	| IOT041 |	New bits and bobs for Amazon Echo
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,936	| IOT041 |	And will also talk about
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:13,472	| IOT041 |	Our guests who is endorsing
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:15,520	| IOT041 |	Who is the CEO of
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,104	| IOT041 |	Rectal thermometer did you say he's interesting
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:20,128	| IOT041 |	Oh India
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:20,896	| IOT041 |	Sing
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:21,920	| IOT041 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:25,504	| IOT041 |	I know that's a great name it is a great name he is also interesting
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:26,016	| IOT041 |	So it's
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,040	| IOT041 |	Like a double on
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:29,344	| IOT041 |	What is Kenzie
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,624	| IOT041 |	Connected
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,648	| IOT041 |	Thermometer
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:37,280	| IOT041 |	Imma said thermostat which it is not unless it's a thermostat for the human body which I guess it might be
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,560	| IOT041 |	No it doesn't control the temperature
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,144	| IOT041 |	So it's going to be fascinating
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:46,240	| IOT041 |	When we do the interview was before why things actually announced their own connect
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:52,640	| IOT041 |	Thermometer at CVS but I'm sick of the kids up because it is $60 to
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,664	| IOT041 |	$100
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,712	| IOT041 |	And having seen both apps
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,992	| IOT041 |	Kind of like the kids up
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,016	| IOT041 |	Myself so
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,296	| IOT041 |	There we have it
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,576	| IOT041 |	Let's kick it off
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,368	| IOT041 |	With the rest of CES
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:02,880	| IOT041 |	What a tide
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:06,464	| IOT041 |	So when you were not at dueling piano bars
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,024	| IOT041 |	What did you see that we didn't talk about last week
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:12,864	| IOT041 |	You weren't going to talk about the dueling piano bars you know I had to bring that up
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| IOT041 |	All right
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,912	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,192	| IOT041 |	For you Kevin
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,960	| IOT041 |	I met with
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,264	| IOT041 |	CEO of WinCo
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,824	| IOT041 |	GERD and
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:26,432	| IOT041 |	I discovered some really exciting news for all the wink Hub owners out there which is
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,456	| IOT041 |	Local
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,248	| IOT041 |	Troll is coming starting with
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:29,760	| IOT041 |	Lights
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:34,624	| IOT041 |	It will come sooner rather than later so the next update for your wink hub
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,720	| IOT041 |	Should give you local control of your lights which means
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,256	| IOT041 |	Lower latency
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,536	| IOT041 |	Not waiting so long
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:44,608	| IOT041 |	And I am looking for the local because
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:47,936	| IOT041 |	When the clouds down I don't want to have my smart devices not working
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:50,752	| IOT041 |	Exactly what I'm hoping actually it will
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:52,288	| IOT041 |	Maybe take care of me
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:57,920	| IOT041 |	Poopoo poopoo poopoo poopoo poopoo what's going on in sequence
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,968	| IOT041 |	List all at once
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| IOT041 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:04,320	| IOT041 |	8/8 interesting you have far more lights in your house connected
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,088	| IOT041 |	Then I do
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,184	| IOT041 |	The only I only have one room or have multiple light and it's only two lights
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:11,232	| IOT041 |	And they do come off do poop
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,000	| IOT041 |	But not
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:15,840	| IOT041 |	I don't have a whole string of them so that's probably why it doesn't annoy me as much as annoys you
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,376	| IOT041 |	I have listened
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,656	| IOT041 |	My entire kitchen is
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,424	| IOT041 |	Is connected to my wink
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,984	| IOT041 |	You have how many lights in the kitchen
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| IOT041 |	Sex
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| IOT041 |	So sexy boobs
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,312	| IOT041 |	Text boobs
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| IOT041 |	And it's
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,592	| IOT041 |	Kind of
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,176	| IOT041 |	I understand that better now
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,224	| IOT041 |	It's always wondered why does that bother you so much
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,296	| IOT041 |	Play never hit me I don't have that many a single room
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,832	| IOT041 |	If I had a hallway in the boot
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,136	| IOT041 |	In line with the hallway that would be different
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,416	| IOT041 |	Do you like a Runway
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,696	| IOT041 |	Exactly that would be cool
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,256	| IOT041 |	Follow the blinking lights this way people
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,560	| IOT041 |	The other thing I have from
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:52,704	| IOT041 |	Pink is we talked a little bit about Flextronics which now owns them and I'm more convinced
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| IOT041 |	Thing
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:57,312	| IOT041 |	I'm so gay and there are 1.2 million
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,616	| IOT041 |	Lync qualified devices out there
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:02,944	| IOT041 |	Which is actually a lot that is not the number of hubs which I could not go
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:03,968	| IOT041 |	For the life of me
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,320	| IOT041 |	I'm sure you tried
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,368	| IOT041 |	I did everything short of sitting on the person
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,392	| IOT041 |	Twitch
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,160	| IOT041 |	But Define
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,928	| IOT041 |	No
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,952	| IOT041 |	It was not for any of
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,512	| IOT041 |	What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:19,839	| IOT041 |	Probably would actually go in my
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:27,775	| IOT041 |	Yeah anyway so 1.2 connected devices are devices connected to wink hub
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,079	| IOT041 |	Yes that's what we know about link
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,871	| IOT041 |	So get excited
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,199	| IOT041 |	Soon actually get details about you no updates
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,479	| IOT041 |	The platform that sort of thing
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:43,135	| IOT041 |	I didn't they were actually kind of excited about the bankruptcy
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:45,951	| IOT041 |	With plans last year to issue a new hub
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:48,255	| IOT041 |	Actually kind of gay
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,791	| IOT041 |	Time to
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,863	| IOT041 |	Temperature around new platform switch
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,167	| IOT041 |	For them have been kind of a nice thing
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:05:01,567	| IOT041 |	I think so because you know you've got if they're open platforms to begin with and you've got what Google's doing with
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| IOT041 |	Pillow and weaving
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:03,871	| IOT041 |	And the whole
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,919	| IOT041 |	Thread and nexton
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:10,783	| IOT041 |	I guess they want you home care take that got that to consider there's a lot that has happened
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,319	| IOT041 |	Since they put that first hello
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,903	| IOT041 |	Going to put the second like in May of last year
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,231	| IOT041 |	Homekit
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,999	| IOT041 |	All kinds of things
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,303	| IOT041 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,911	| IOT041 |	Last year home kit was like the belle of the ball at CES
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,679	| IOT041 |	The sheriff
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| IOT041 |	Not so much
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,519	| IOT041 |	We just didn't hear a lot about it
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,847	| IOT041 |	There were a couple homekit company or homekit devices
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| IOT041 |	Lots of
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,407	| IOT041 |	You know I devices was out there with
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:37,919	| IOT041 |	Huge boo
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| IOT041 |	Products
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,807	| IOT041 |	We're still waiting for more profiles
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT041 |	From Apple
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:48,415	| IOT041 |	And that means certain devices so we have to not work with homekit
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,463	| IOT041 |	Right so we can lights
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,999	| IOT041 |	Sir support if we've got
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,023	| IOT041 |	Natalie thermostats
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:56,095	| IOT041 |	Search supported locks are supported garage doors
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:59,167	| IOT041 |	Supported but we're still waiting for things like video cameras
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,191	| IOT041 |	To be supported
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:05,311	| IOT041 |	And that just takes time and so that's kind of what we're waiting Owen more sensors
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,383	| IOT041 |	So that's what we're waiting for on homekit
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,711	| IOT041 |	I think Apple's taking their time for one thing cuz I think they want to do this right
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:16,063	| IOT041 |	They focus so much on security that has slowed things up in my pendant
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:19,391	| IOT041 |	I also wonder if they're starting with the basics no lights in the
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:19,903	| IOT041 |	Baby locks
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,183	| IOT041 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,999	| IOT041 |	I wonder how many people
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,815	| IOT041 |	Mainstream people that are starting to build a smart home
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,839	| IOT041 |	Platform in their house
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:34,751	| IOT041 |	Actually considered a video to be on at the top of the list I know security is important from the homeowner standpoint security is the most
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,519	| IOT041 |	Most important from a home
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,567	| IOT041 |	Standpoint most people get into the smart
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:38,847	| IOT041 |	For security
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| IOT041 |	Believe it or not
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,383	| IOT041 |	Bites
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,151	| IOT041 |	Send home automation
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,711	| IOT041 |	Are actually energy saver
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| IOT041 |	Wood slices part of it
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT041 |	Secondary
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,831	| IOT041 |	That's from surveys from both Lowe's and I can
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,111	| IOT041 |	Both of those matches
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,135	| IOT041 |	Interesting
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:56,511	| IOT041 |	They're at their numbers are slightly off but the number one reason a security number two is energy-savings like thermostats
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,559	| IOT041 |	Lighting controls
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| IOT041 |	Distance
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:02,911	| IOT041 |	Energy savings and then third is like automation
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:03,679	| IOT041 |	Lighting and fun
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,983	| IOT041 |	And yes I know I said lightning twice
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,055	| IOT041 |	That's okay for Energy savings
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,567	| IOT041 |	Lighting for fun
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,615	| IOT041 |	Yep
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:17,503	| IOT041 |	I just got done I get I totally understand that with the metrics actually show a guy get it
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:22,879	| IOT041 |	Sometimes I think when I talk about when I talk to people there like video cameras in the house that's just creepy
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:26,975	| IOT041 |	An apple is kind of like tries to positions of the anti creepy 2
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,999	| IOT041 |	Google another
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,559	| IOT041 |	Send video cameras in the house
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| IOT041 |	Looking at your family
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:32,863	| IOT041 |	And that is creepy
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:33,887	| IOT041 |	Or I think
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:37,727	| IOT041 |	But there's also video cameras facing Outdoors facie
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,239	| IOT041 |	Windows
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:43,615	| IOT041 |	Indoor Bells sing like your front foyer
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| IOT041 |	On hallway
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,919	| IOT041 |	You know
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,455	| IOT041 |	Is a little less creepy
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,479	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,527	| IOT041 |	And I don't know why I get it
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:53,599	| IOT041 |	But I also see you like a lot of the use cases that
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,903	| IOT041 |	Kind of tend to resonate with people or things like
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:57,439	| IOT041 |	Hey did my kid make it home
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:04,095	| IOT041 |	You can do that with a a little door sensor but you could also do it with like a video camera and then your kid could be like
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:09,471	| IOT041 |	Word like Raichu crazy notes throughout the day and be like
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| IOT041 |	Pop in front of the camera and beans
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,311	| IOT041 |	Minecraft cookies and you can be like
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| IOT041 |	Child
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,919	| IOT041 |	My phone with notifications with
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,431	| IOT041 |	Advance for cookie
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:25,343	| IOT041 |	Maybe it's not the creepy Factor that's held them back but it's the security aspect of it cuz they want to ensure that nobody else has access to that
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:27,135	| IOT041 |	That video that you do not want them to have
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:33,535	| IOT041 |	I will say that Apple has done one thing well and people have commented on it
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,583	| IOT041 |	And we're commenting on it at CES
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| IOT041 |	Which was
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| IOT041 |	Getting devices
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,471	| IOT041 |	And make it easy for people to get devices online
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| IOT041 |	As
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,775	| IOT041 |	People bring more stuff into the home
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,079	| IOT041 |	Is becoming more and more apparent
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,407	| IOT041 |	Getting them online and typing in your Wi-Fi password
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| IOT041 |	It's not
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| IOT041 |	Huge pain
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,015	| IOT041 |	But people are becoming sure
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| IOT041 |	Wait a sec
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:59,391	| IOT041 |	What if I change my SSID for my WiFi network
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,183	| IOT041 |	Crap
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:05,791	| IOT041 |	Public Service Announcement if you want to change your Wifi password
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,071	| IOT041 |	Are you have a really like
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| IOT041 |	What you feel is like
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:11,935	| IOT041 |	Really awesome SSID which is your Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,447	| IOT041 |	And it's like
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:18,335	| IOT041 |	A random string of numbers and letters if you're going to bring a lot of connected devices in your home
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,359	| IOT041 |	You may want to change
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| IOT041 |	Is that right now to something else
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:24,223	| IOT041 |	For you bringing all these connected devices cuz you're going to be like
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,991	| IOT041 |	Name of that
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,271	| IOT041 |	A lot in your password
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,551	| IOT041 |	Aesthetic
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,063	| IOT041 |	Going to be
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| IOT041 |	Something you want
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,623	| IOT041 |	How to be able to type
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,135	| IOT041 |	A bunch of times
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:36,767	| IOT041 |	Yep just name your network Linksys everything will be just fine
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:43,935	| IOT041 |	But do keep in mind you know if you're going to be connecting a bunch of devices to your home
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,727	| IOT041 |	SSI
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,239	| IOT041 |	Alaia
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| IOT041 |	Okay so
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,567	| IOT041 |	That was our little PSA for the day
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,103	| IOT041 |	Cartoons
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| IOT041 |	Little scoop I heard
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:56,735	| IOT041 |	Amazon Echo support for thermostat
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,015	| IOT041 |	Is coming
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| IOT041 |	Soon
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,343	| IOT041 |	Native support native support
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| IOT041 |	This is going to be like
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| IOT041 |	Right now
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,999	| IOT041 |	The Echoes supports lights
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| IOT041 |	And that's it
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,303	| IOT041 |	In the Smart Home
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| IOT041 |	Connected home I think is what it's called
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,399	| IOT041 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,959	| IOT041 |	Very cool very cool
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,751	| IOT041 |	I also heard
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,775	| IOT041 |	And talking to some people
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:24,639	| IOT041 |	The original plan was to actually along with lights was to support like
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:29,759	| IOT041 |	You know other settings but it became the syntax became too cumbersome
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,551	| IOT041 |	So they had to back off.
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,623	| IOT041 |	So you know like an Siri how you can have
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| IOT041 |	Seems like dinner party lighting
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,207	| IOT041 |	That was kind of the plan to have
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| IOT041 |	Amazon to
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,047	| IOT041 |	Progesta Logistics around
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,887	| IOT041 |	Figuring out how to do that across so many different
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| IOT041 |	Possible
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,679	| IOT041 |	Platform
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,727	| IOT041 |	What is natural language processing
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,031	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,311	| IOT041 |	But it's coming
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| IOT041 |	The thermostats
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,407	| IOT041 |	Soon and neck
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,223	| IOT041 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,991	| IOT041 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,783	| IOT041 |	And people don't realize this
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,647	| IOT041 |	Will you and I only talk pretty much on the show these days cuz we don't truly work together anymore
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,671	| IOT041 |	Different from writing perspective
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:12,767	| IOT041 |	But we wrote I think they exact identical story
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| IOT041 |	Based on some news that came out
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,351	| IOT041 |	This week's coming yesterday in fact
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| IOT041 |	Yeah I thought my story was probably
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:23,007	| IOT041 |	I bet it was 300 worth
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,335	| IOT041 |	But we still wrote the same thing what we're talking about is
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:30,943	| IOT041 |	The Amazon Echo me have a baby is what I'm saying there's reports anything
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,247	| IOT041 |	Journal Wall Street Journal was the first to note this
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:40,159	| IOT041 |	That it's expected that Amazon will release a smaller version a Portmore portable version and cheaper version
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,975	| IOT041 |	Amazon Echo soon I don't know what soon means but
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,023	| IOT041 |	That's what they're saying I'm taking a couple weeks
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:49,375	| IOT041 |	So it sounds like from their description is like the size of a beer can
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,399	| IOT041 |	And
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,727	| IOT041 |	Yes exactly still a chance
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:59,359	| IOT041 |	I have batteries inside but will also have a docking station so you can recharge those batteries it one of the
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,943	| IOT041 |	Things that we observe you and I both in our separate articles. Talking each other as
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,247	| IOT041 |	If you have enough battery power
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:08,575	| IOT041 |	We're hearing that you got to press a button to be able to do your voice commands
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,135	| IOT041 |	Motorcycle that defeats the whole purpose but
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:17,535	| IOT041 |	The thought is if it's sitting in the docking station in a different room than okay is probably always on microphone least that's what I'm
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| IOT041 |	Open
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| IOT041 |	Why are we hoping
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:25,471	| IOT041 |	Won't because we otherwise we just use our phones or whatever and then there's there's just no point
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,263	| IOT041 |	Cuz it takes them bad check out of this
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| IOT041 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:28,799	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,871	| IOT041 |	See the value in having
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:32,895	| IOT041 |	Multiple echos
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,455	| IOT041 |	Especially if you want to
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,991	| IOT041 |	Smaller
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,551	| IOT041 |	Basically a link to echo to the mama Echo
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,319	| IOT041 |	Elsa satellite
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:44,671	| IOT041 |	Is multiple in like party mode for your speakers
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,463	| IOT041 |	Cuz then you have
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,767	| IOT041 |	You can play music around anywhere in your house
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,583	| IOT041 |	It would also be nice to be able to you know
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,631	| IOT041 |	Give commands
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,679	| IOT041 |	You know that work throughout your house right
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:58,751	| IOT041 |	But only if you can talk to it and you don't have to
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,543	| IOT041 |	To touch it because the magic of the echo
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,079	| IOT041 |	Is this
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| IOT041 |	You don't touch anything otherwise
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:08,991	| IOT041 |	You know I have a good Chilean devices in my house that I can control here by smartphone or through
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,295	| IOT041 |	Some sort of tactile interface
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,367	| IOT041 |	The reason I love the echo is because
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,903	| IOT041 |	I don't have to use any of those
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| IOT041 |	Guy Curry
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:20,767	| IOT041 |	I can understand why they want to limit
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,839	| IOT041 |	The always-on microphone when you're running a battery power that's cuz
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,143	| IOT041 |	You're going to shoot your batteries pretty darn quick
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:26,655	| IOT041 |	If it's always listening
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,983	| IOT041 |	So I get that I'm just hoping that they
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,543	| IOT041 |	Haven't always on release an option when it's
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| IOT041 |	Plugin I can't see why not
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,615	| IOT041 |	Brent there's no
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| IOT041 |	Power constraint there
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,943	| IOT041 |	It's plugged in
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:41,247	| IOT041 |	True I mean your phone has an always-on
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,063	| IOT041 |	The way Amazon's theoretically
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,391	| IOT041 |	In the way Amazon's always on listening
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,159	| IOT041 |	Works is
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,695	| IOT041 |	It's always listening
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,487	| IOT041 |	For the trigger word a trigger word
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| IOT041 |	Try not to say
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,327	| IOT041 |	Correct and then if yours
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,399	| IOT041 |	You know what it starts it wakes up and starts processing
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| IOT041 |	And sends those
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,727	| IOT041 |	Those words that you said after the trigger work to the cloud
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,007	| IOT041 |	And then it goes back
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,775	| IOT041 |	Back to sleep essential
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| IOT041 |	Then it stops
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| IOT041 |	Sending those
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,383	| IOT041 |	There are processors
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,175	| IOT041 |	Make
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,455	| IOT041 |	Light work
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,223	| IOT041 |	That kind of
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,271	| IOT041 |	AI for listening
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:14,783	| IOT041 |	To those were
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,319	| IOT041 |	Listening for a trigger
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:21,951	| IOT041 |	And those kind of processors are currently in a lot of next-generation phones or current generation phone
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,255	| IOT041 |	Like which iPhone is it
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,023	| IOT041 |	It's the current
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,791	| IOT041 |	Jen iPhone
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,375	| IOT041 |	Right you can you don't need to be plugged in and you can just
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,911	| IOT041 |	Speak to Siri
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| IOT041 |	An adult
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,983	| IOT041 |	Do what you need to do I think it's
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,519	| IOT041 |	I want to say it's only the larger
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,567	| IOT041 |	Are the two latest iPhones
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:44,479	| IOT041 |	There are processors there's a Qualcomm processor I'm assuming that there's a version of the a
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,575	| IOT041 |	Is it the A7 that Sunday current
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:54,975	| IOT041 |	Benign
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:58,047	| IOT041 |	It's okay so that's not insurmountable in that gives you
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,583	| IOT041 |	Yeah whatever
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:05,471	| IOT041 |	Three four days worth of battery life I am not sure it's been pretty much a day for most people
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:05,983	| IOT041 |	Really
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,055	| IOT041 |	Okay so you still have to charge
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,591	| IOT041 |	Kills that theory
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| IOT041 |	Dead in the water
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,919	| IOT041 |	Do you know what would solve this whole problem
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,479	| IOT041 |	I've said it once I said it doesn't time
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:21,599	| IOT041 |	I'll just let the Amazon Echo app on your smartphone
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,415	| IOT041 |	Listen to your words and Bluetooth them over
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:27,231	| IOT041 |	Through to the speaker or up to the cloud I mean
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:29,279	| IOT041 |	We all have a little remote in our hands
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,167	| IOT041 |	All right all of us but Stacy have a little remote in our hands
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:39,775	| IOT041 |	I think our survey said that like 30% I know I know
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:45,151	| IOT041 |	I know it just seems silly to me that have that app sitting there and not be able to interact with it
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,919	| IOT041 |	Via voice
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| IOT041 |	Bipolar
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,247	| IOT041 |	I won't go there again
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,879	| IOT041 |	Alright so
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,487	| IOT041 |	Let's see if this is cheap enough depending we'll see when details come out if we would buy
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,767	| IOT041 |	We would buy such a thing
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| IOT041 |	I have a feeling we will
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:03,839	| IOT041 |	No matter what
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,655	| IOT041 |	And I'm going to I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's going to
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,703	| IOT041 |	Cost 79 to 8 at $99
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,495	| IOT041 |	That sounds about right
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,103	| IOT041 |	And you think that we can tell people to buy
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,663	| IOT041 |	Listen put multiple ones in their house I think it would
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,223	| IOT041 |	I have a Sonos already I would rather see Sonos
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:24,319	| IOT041 |	Let me know Amazon voice services in there
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:26,367	| IOT041 |	Why isn't there the new Sonos
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:28,159	| IOT041 |	Aren't they supposed to have a microphone on them
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:31,999	| IOT041 |	I don't know I haven't looked so I feel like I do
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,047	| IOT041 |	So if that's the case
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| IOT041 |	Then
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,839	| IOT041 |	I don't know if I would need
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:39,423	| IOT041 |	But that's true that's true I would definitely buy one
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,703	| IOT041 |	Because I really want
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,239	| IOT041 |	I don't know if I said that
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,007	| IOT041 |	But I really want to know
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:44,543	| IOT041 |	Echo
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,567	| IOT041 |	In mybatis
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,383	| IOT041 |	That's you have said listen
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:51,455	| IOT041 |	I stripped my head last time and I'm shaking it again to go ahead
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:55,295	| IOT041 |	How do you say I want to hear music while I'm taking a shower and I want to ask
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:55,807	| IOT041 |	The time
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,111	| IOT041 |	Weather in the morning I like
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| IOT041 |	Like the news
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,391	| IOT041 |	Honestly
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| IOT041 |	At the end of the day I want this
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,975	| IOT041 |	Everywhere in my house
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:07,839	| IOT041 |	Because I don't want to have to be in a specific room
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,887	| IOT041 |	I have a question or I want to know the time
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:13,983	| IOT041 |	That's the whole point of that that invisible interface that permeates your smart home
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,775	| IOT041 |	I want it I want it now I want to cheat
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| IOT041 |	Exactly
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,335	| IOT041 |	Alright so
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,383	| IOT041 |	Garnet will buy them
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,407	| IOT041 |	Give it to us
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,967	| IOT041 |	But preferably with always on voice
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,783	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:30,879	| IOT041 |	That is that has he any other oh I was going to say final OCS.
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,927	| IOT041 |	Are two things worth mentioning
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| IOT041 |	1
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,255	| IOT041 |	We hate doubt over these tiny little moat
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,535	| IOT041 |	Switch actually not
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| IOT041 |	They were introduced maybe last year
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,167	| IOT041 |	University of Michigan
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,679	| IOT041 |	Has
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,727	| IOT041 |	Developed a technology called
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| IOT041 |	Easy
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,567	| IOT041 |	Little
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| IOT041 |	Chips like to MMM lacrosse
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,663	| IOT041 |	Yes they like
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,223	| IOT041 |	I took a picture I'll run it with the podcast
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:56,991	| IOT041 |	If you see it
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,807	| IOT041 |	I mean this fits on the tip of your finger like probably like
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,623	| IOT041 |	I don't know like 15 of them could fit on your finger
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:08,511	| IOT041 |	I don't know about a finger but they say like a hundred and fifty could fit in a thimble
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,303	| IOT041 |	Istanbul
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,887	| IOT041 |	I have a connected symbol
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,935	| IOT041 |	They're really tiny and they have
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:22,079	| IOT041 |	A radio they have processing power I mean and they have itsy bitsy photovoltaic cell
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:26,431	| IOT041 |	Pressure sensors a temperature or
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,223	| IOT041 |	A temperature sensor or motion sensor
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,295	| IOT041 |	Some processing power
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,063	| IOT041 |	Radio
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,111	| IOT041 |	And some power on this thing
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,647	| IOT041 |	Is a couple bucks
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,415	| IOT041 |	Is
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:39,743	| IOT041 |	What I was told this was at the arm Booth by Andrew over an arm
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,303	| IOT041 |	And they last for a couple years
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,863	| IOT041 |	I'm not 100% sure what I could do with one of these
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,911	| IOT041 |	Honestly on the radio
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,935	| IOT041 |	Send the signal light
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:52,031	| IOT041 |	But they want to get it to 20 and I want to start
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:57,407	| IOT041 |	It's funny you say that cuz it was we were talking about it before the show Psych I want these
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,991	| IOT041 |	I don't know what I would do with him that it doesn't matter I just want them
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,319	| IOT041 |	You can make Computing more self-sufficient
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| IOT041 |	Smaller put in like
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:10,207	| IOT041 |	More places that were previously on accessible and you can like it or
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,487	| IOT041 |	Information from it I'm like
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,255	| IOT041 |	My God why wouldn't
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,535	| IOT041 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| IOT041 |	I mean they're talking about
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,143	| IOT041 |	They were like you could stick this in someone's eye in like measure
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,423	| IOT041 |	Blood pressure for glaucoma
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:22,495	| IOT041 |	Yes you we need to get out by Medical
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,519	| IOT041 |	Coding for it
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:26,079	| IOT041 |	But that is not hard
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,383	| IOT041 |	I hope I'm curious to see what people
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,407	| IOT041 |	Eventually do with these things
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,711	| IOT041 |	Yeah you can swallow them yet because
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:32,991	| IOT041 |	I need solar
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,831	| IOT041 |	Power I forgot about that I said that before the show I said I want to eat one Justice
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,135	| IOT041 |	I don't know measure something inside body in
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,671	| IOT041 |	Well no solar power there
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,255	| IOT041 |	It's so small you could eat it you could accidentally eat it
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,839	| IOT041 |	So I was excited about that
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,399	| IOT041 |	Guys get excited tell us what you think
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,935	| IOT041 |	Think you might be able to do with it cuz
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,471	| IOT041 |	I don't know
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:59,871	| IOT041 |	Maybe the University of Michigan is going to listen to this and they'll be like idea from some random person who listens
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,639	| IOT041 |	Super smart
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,431	| IOT041 |	Probably know y'all probably have like
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,967	| IOT041 |	Who cashes at these and you're like
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,759	| IOT041 |	Stacy
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,039	| IOT041 |	Boring
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,807	| IOT041 |	Already have
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,319	| IOT041 |	Already done
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:12,415	| IOT041 |	Final CES fight is
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,695	| IOT041 |	On obsolescence
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:16,255	| IOT041 |	Chance and we'll talk more about this because it's worth
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,535	| IOT041 |	About butt
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,607	| IOT041 |	I was shocked at how little people were talking about
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:21,887	| IOT041 |	Obsolescence
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,167	| IOT041 |	At the show
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:30,079	| IOT041 |	You're sticking like I saw you know the Samsung refrigerator with the Giant
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,591	| IOT041 |	Android phone
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,383	| IOT041 |	And it's very large
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:32,895	| IOT041 |	It is
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:38,527	| IOT041 |	Refrigerators get a lot of heavy-duty usage and they last for like 8 or 10 years
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,087	| IOT041 |	And it felt really strange to me to stick
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,135	| IOT041 |	What is essentially a giant computer in the face of it
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,439	| IOT041 |	In some ways it's super cool cuz like
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:48,511	| IOT041 |	Yeah I want to be able to read my recipes on my refrigerator
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:53,631	| IOT041 |	Set a rather have it like next to me on the counter or in front of me on the backsplash but that's cool
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,399	| IOT041 |	And I love
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,423	| IOT041 |	Message boards and
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| IOT041 |	Pictures and
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,263	| IOT041 |	Maybe a calendar that reminds me of things on the refrigerator
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| IOT041 |	I also like
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:02,847	| IOT041 |	Dang
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,383	| IOT041 |	Download away
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,175	| IOT041 |	Yeah that is it
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:06,943	| IOT041 |	Terrible
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| IOT041 |	Place for that
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,783	| IOT041 |	Cuz we spell all kinds of crap on a refrigerator
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,575	| IOT041 |	Right now I think there's like
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,111	| IOT041 |	There's some soup
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,623	| IOT041 |	I'm like two nights ago
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,440	| IOT041 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,232	| IOT041 |	I mean I'm going to get to it
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:19,744	| IOT041 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,536	| IOT041 |	Maybe my husband is
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,608	| IOT041 |	You know and what do you clean the computer with
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,376	| IOT041 |	With spandex
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,656	| IOT041 |	Stainless steel refrigerator cleaner
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:31,520	| IOT041 |	It's a tough call and we've already got so much E-Waste you know on this
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| IOT041 |	May not make the most sense to have these kind of Integrations
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,872	| IOT041 |	And I don't think we can get
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:40,992	| IOT041 |	To your concern now that we figured out how to really disposal stuff the right way especially when we're adding more and more
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,016	| IOT041 |	Trudy's products
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,808	| IOT041 |	And then that yeah and
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:46,880	| IOT041 |	I mean what if someone throw something in the kitchen at cracksat screen
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,416	| IOT041 |	Go to replace your fridge
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,536	| IOT041 |	Let's hope
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:56,096	| IOT041 |	But then like think about software updates
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,608	| IOT041 |	Sand Lake
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,912	| IOT041 |	Two 5G radios
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:05,056	| IOT041 |	I mean like in your application processor in that thing it's a little slow and you want to run the latest games I mean
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,104	| IOT041 |	If you call someone out and they have to like
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,640	| IOT041 |	Replace the motherboard on that thing
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:13,760	| IOT041 |	I don't disagree that I'd rather see these things no more modular in that you know just make it magnetic
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,784	| IOT041 |	Back on a
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:19,648	| IOT041 |	Application-specific tablet or something in and let it stick up on there so you can just
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,672	| IOT041 |	Put down in
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,952	| IOT041 |	Replace that when needed
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,256	| IOT041 |	I don't know yeah I'm just thinking of that
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:28,352	| IOT041 |	Qualcomm didn't answer modular thing for cars a modular Lake
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,376	| IOT041 |	Electronics
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,424	| IOT041 |	Box for cars basically
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:34,240	| IOT041 |	Which is kind of in that line of thinking
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,520	| IOT041 |	Which is good
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,848	| IOT041 |	Cuz I already want to replace the 3G radio in my Tesla
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,360	| IOT041 |	44 GB
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:41,920	| IOT041 |	Because 3-g
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,200	| IOT041 |	It takes forever to load my maps
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,504	| IOT041 |	And ghetto
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:47,040	| IOT041 |	5G is going to be here in
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,552	| IOT041 |	20
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,136	| IOT041 |	17 if you believe Horizon in 20/20 if you believe everyone else
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,440	| IOT041 |	Anyway
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,208	| IOT041 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:54,976	| IOT041 |	Obsolescence
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,000	| IOT041 |	Skip think about it guys
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,048	| IOT041 |	I'm looking for Solutions
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,328	| IOT041 |	And now
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,352	| IOT041 |	That is like
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,680	| IOT041 |	I think that was enough
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,472	| IOT041 |	Okay so now we're going to
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,520	| IOT041 |	Talk to August about how we're going to
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:13,920	| IOT041 |	To stop the spread of disease by using connected thermometers
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:20,064	| IOT041 |	It's going to be awesome
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:27,232	| IOT041 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is Stacey Higginbotham and our guest this week is indoors

EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,432	| IOT041 |	I am super excited
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| IOT041 |	Because
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| IOT041 |	Connected thermometers are my
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:54,368	| IOT041 |	Because I have a 9 year old daughter who is constantly bringing
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,648	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,184	| IOT041 |	Why
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| IOT041 |	Why did you get the
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,976	| IOT041 |	It's in your head that
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| IOT041 |	You're like the world needs
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,816	| IOT041 |	Yeah so it looks like the product first
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| IOT041 |	And tell you about that and then
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,912	| IOT041 |	So it sounds simple it is
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:11,264	| IOT041 |	It's a SmartPhone connected thermometer and makes it easier to take a child's temperature
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,800	| IOT041 |	It automatically stores
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:15,616	| IOT041 |	Remember screen brightness automatically stores the results
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:19,456	| IOT041 |	Offer you and each member of the family can put in multiple different profiles
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,992	| IOT041 |	And so that way when you go to the doctor
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,784	| IOT041 |	And they ask you how did
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,832	| IOT041 |	You were your child's illness start

EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:30,720	| IOT041 |	And beyond that it should have realized the vision of what
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:34,560	| IOT041 |	Consumer health product always ought to of done right in my opinion
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,376	| IOT041 |	Consumer health product to him always
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,400	| IOT041 |	Ought to have
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT041 |	Not only
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| IOT041 |	Comforted
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,984	| IOT041 |	But given you guidance
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:42,496	| IOT041 |	About what
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,032	| IOT041 |	Our product
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,800	| IOT041 |	Realized
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,104	| IOT041 |	In the product we have you
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:51,712	| IOT041 |	Rules that based on your fever and certain symptoms we give you formal guidance we tell you

EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,928	| IOT041 |	You need to go see the doctor right away so we tell you that
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:05,024	| IOT041 |	How does it do this for me so let's say my 9 year old has a temperature of
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:07,584	| IOT041 |	103 which I always am I
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,144	| IOT041 |	This is really high
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:13,216	| IOT041 |	Yeah so let's say that it's the middle of night
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| IOT041 |	3 in the morning
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,544	| IOT041 |	And your nine-year-old comes in here and says mommy mommy
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,360	| IOT041 |	So you pull the kinsa thermometer app
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,920	| IOT041 |	And you get her to take her temperature
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,200	| IOT041 |	Do you take a temperature
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,992	| IOT041 |	Usually in under 10 seconds
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,040	| IOT041 |	You get these professionally accurate results
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:30,112	| IOT041 |	And with a few simple Taps you can input sensor
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:32,928	| IOT041 |	Show the proper numbers for you
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:36,768	| IOT041 |	How to start an interesting share that with your doctor later or
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,304	| IOT041 |	Your babysitter
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:45,216	| IOT041 |	You're concerned that she may have some severe symptoms and the app automatically processes that information whether there's a
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:45,984	| IOT041 |	High fever
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:48,288	| IOT041 |	What are the associated symptoms
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:53,664	| IOT041 |	The age of the profile and gives you information if it's cause for concern it'll tell you
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:56,224	| IOT041 |	And if you want more information on that you just happen
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:58,272	| IOT041 |	You can get all the sources for the medical experts themselves
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:01,600	| IOT041 |	Now imagine that you your child has a fever
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,880	| IOT041 |	You're concerned
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:07,744	| IOT041 |	She may have caught something from one of her friends at school so you go check the health at her school
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,560	| IOT041 |	So we have this group's feature that allows you to opt-in
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,608	| IOT041 |	To seeing the aggregated
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:15,168	| IOT041 |	Anonymous help stats at your child School
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:18,752	| IOT041 |	And here you see that say 5 out of 24 kids RL
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:22,080	| IOT041 |	And you see in the message boards that are associated with that group
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,848	| IOT041 |	Bad strep throat
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,152	| IOT041 |	Well that's a little bit more cause for
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,968	| IOT041 |	Turn the common cold so now you decide to talk to Medical
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,016	| IOT041 |	And starting
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:34,880	| IOT041 |	Middle next year we will have a ton of disintegration that allows you to talk to a doctor right then and there
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,904	| IOT041 |	Right through the app itself
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,464	| IOT041 |	I'm for now it just gives you that
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,488	| IOT041 |	Information that
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| IOT041 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:44,608	| IOT041 |	Help you make a decision as to when when and whether you want to go see the doctor
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:48,960	| IOT041 |	Right now it's based on schools and I know that you guys have a program
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,752	| IOT041 |	With your
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,544	| IOT041 |	Kenneth stick thermometer
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,568	| IOT041 |	At schools
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,616	| IOT041 |	Could you also do this based on like
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:56,896	| IOT041 |	Zip code
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,456	| IOT041 |	You could and that's part of the broader vision
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,016	| IOT041 |	So take a huge step back
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,296	| IOT041 |	We didn't
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,320	| IOT041 |	Create the product
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,624	| IOT041 |	For the product itself we created a product
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:10,976	| IOT041 |	And our mission cancer is to create a map of human health
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,024	| IOT041 |	Track and thereby stocks
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,536	| IOT041 |	Spread of disease
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:16,096	| IOT041 |	We started the company with no product
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,376	| IOT041 |	With no business model
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:17,888	| IOT041 |	And with this mess
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:20,960	| IOT041 |	And we thought to ourselves how can we
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:22,240	| IOT041 |	Begin communicating
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:24,288	| IOT041 |	With someone who has just Fallen ill
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,056	| IOT041 |	To help them
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:28,384	| IOT041 |	And simultaneously collect the data needed
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| IOT041 |	To track the spread of disease
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:32,224	| IOT041 |	And thermometer became the most ideal
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,760	| IOT041 |	To piggyback
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,064	| IOT041 |	On the thermometer is
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:38,624	| IOT041 |	The single most ubiquitous medical product in the world is
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:40,672	| IOT041 |	The first product that parents turn to
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:43,744	| IOT041 |	To confirm illness even before they call the docker
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,024	| IOT041 |	Go online
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:50,912	| IOT041 |	And it allows us to aggregate really interesting information that will help us track
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:53,728	| IOT041 |	On the spread of many contagious illnesses like
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:56,288	| IOT041 |	Influenza and like other contagious illnesses
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,848	| IOT041 |	What are the challenges in dealing with
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,640	| IOT041 |	Information like this is
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:03,968	| IOT041 |	It's medical data and people might be kind of worried about
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,992	| IOT041 |	You know having their children
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:08,320	| IOT041 |	Labeled as having some sort of awful contagious
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:11,136	| IOT041 |	How do you handle things like privacy
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,904	| IOT041 |	And identify
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,536	| IOT041 |	Yes absolutely it's really important
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,048	| IOT041 |	To us
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,864	| IOT041 |	Engender the trust of our users
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:24,192	| IOT041 |	Xiamen certainly one of our highest priorities and buildings product in
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,520	| IOT041 |	People are sensitive to the fact that there is health information
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:32,128	| IOT041 |	So first we adhere to all regulation
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,152	| IOT041 |	State local
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,968	| IOT041 |	I'm in Federal Regulations around health information
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:41,088	| IOT041 |	And we have a policy of never sharing anyone's individual information without their Express
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,368	| IOT041 |	That will never happen
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:45,184	| IOT041 |	The more importantly I think it's important to understand what kind of information
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:47,488	| IOT041 |	These are ensuring by using prod
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,024	| IOT041 |	It's really common
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,096	| IOT041 |	Fever and Common Sense
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,656	| IOT041 |	Things that everyone has it's not very sensitive
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,240	| IOT041 |	We're not asking you for whether you're
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:04,384	| IOT041 |	Cancer positive HIV positive excetera not if there's nothing like that it's it's very common symptoms and it's
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,408	| IOT041 |	Yunnan temperature
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,992	| IOT041 |	Second by default we don't actually ask
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,272	| IOT041 |	Personal
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,064	| IOT041 |	You don't have to create a login to
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,576	| IOT041 |	Use the product
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:19,744	| IOT041 |	That's again to engender The Trusted user really help everyone to understand that what our goal is to add
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,280	| IOT041 |	Target population data
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:24,096	| IOT041 |	Should we understand the spread of disease it's not about
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,376	| IOT041 |	Marketing information
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:29,984	| IOT041 |	Necessarily to you it's not about collecting your information it's about this broader mission
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,544	| IOT041 |	That will not only help you but will help societies
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:33,824	| IOT041 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| IOT041 |	I'll keep that in mind
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,896	| IOT041 |	Your history is very
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,176	| IOT041 |	Very interesting
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:41,504	| IOT041 |	You actually worked for the clintons help finish it for a while
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,040	| IOT041 |	Yes so
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,832	| IOT041 |	How did all this kind of come into being
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,112	| IOT041 |	In a place because
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,624	| IOT041 |	It's kind of a good story
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:48,928	| IOT041 |	Yeah it was really born
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,744	| IOT041 |	Are my experiences there was born out of my frustration
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:58,912	| IOT041 |	I'm in my final year there was there for about 5 years my final year I remember being in this meeting
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,680	| IOT041 |	Where
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:02,240	| IOT041 |	That this was the final meeting to allocate
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,520	| IOT041 |	Almost to
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,800	| IOT041 |	A hundred million dollars
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,360	| IOT041 |	The curb stop or prevent the spread of disease
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,152	| IOT041 |	This was a major funder in that
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,200	| IOT041 |	In a global health wealth and I remember being in this meeting
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,736	| IOT041 |	And scene
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,272	| IOT041 |	Some of the people that were providing
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:20,928	| IOT041 |	I remember there was an expert malaria that stood up and said you know they're 280 million cases somewhere in the realm tears were there
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:25,024	| IOT041 |	And I remember the next expert which is a professor at a major ivy league Institution
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:28,864	| IOT041 |	I'm still up and said there are over a million cases of malaria
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,168	| IOT041 |	I thought to myself
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:31,936	| IOT041 |	Wow
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:36,032	| IOT041 |	You have no idea we're talking about it more than three factors
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,312	| IOT041 |	Difference in the projections
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,896	| IOT041 |	And it became really clear
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,944	| IOT041 |	Stats on the world doesn't have
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,224	| IOT041 |	That system
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:49,088	| IOT041 |	To really understand where and when does this disease is spread spreading in real time was really really frustrated
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:55,744	| IOT041 |	I'm not the most patient person to world but I was increasingly frustrated I remember I pulled out my phone cuz I thought to myself man
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:57,792	| IOT041 |	Is very quickly
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,840	| IOT041 |	I was looking Google Maps
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,120	| IOT041 |	Trying to figure out how to get
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,680	| IOT041 |	I'm looking Google Maps
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:04,960	| IOT041 |	And I'm watching him out
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,544	| IOT041 |	And I'm looking Google Maps
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,824	| IOT041 |	Money and it struck me that
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| IOT041 |	We have so much
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,384	| IOT041 |	Real-time information
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,176	| IOT041 |	Every other ass
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,456	| IOT041 |	Burl Ives
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,016	| IOT041 |	We know we know what our neighbor's house cost
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:21,344	| IOT041 |	Through price of Zillow and Trulia we know
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,392	| IOT041 |	How to get downtown fastest
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,160	| IOT041 |	Google Maps
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,464	| IOT041 |	In ways we know what our neighbors dog is
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,744	| IOT041 |	Feeling like through Facebook
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:30,048	| IOT041 |	And yet we have almost zero in French
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,584	| IOT041 |	When it comes to
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,120	| IOT041 |	The health situation around us
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,168	| IOT041 |	Not situation effects of intimately
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:39,008	| IOT041 |	And it was a travesty it was complete travesty.
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,824	| IOT041 |	The world spins so much
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| IOT041 |	Money I mean if you aggregate
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,408	| IOT041 |	The amount of money spent
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:51,808	| IOT041 |	I'm trying to curb stop or prevent the spread of illness whether it's the flu whether it's strep throat whether it's croup or
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,576	| IOT041 |	Whooping cough
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,856	| IOT041 |	Or malaria age
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,672	| IOT041 |	Is TB a respiratory infection will you add that up
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,952	| IOT041 |	We're talking about
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:59,232	| IOT041 |	Several GDP
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,000	| IOT041 |	Key points of the world
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,608	| IOT041 |	Massive amount of money hundreds of billions of dollars
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:06,912	| IOT041 |	And so how do you allocate
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,448	| IOT041 |	How do you put the Reese
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,240	| IOT041 |	The drugs a diagnostic
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,544	| IOT041 |	The vaccines that work that we know work
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:14,080	| IOT041 |	How do you direct those
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,360	| IOT041 |	The people who need the most
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,128	| IOT041 |	In a timely manner
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,408	| IOT041 |	That was sort of work answer was
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,456	| IOT041 |	Well that was the first pillar
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,992	| IOT041 |	How cancer came to be
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:23,808	| IOT041 |	We believe that stopping the spread of disease
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,600	| IOT041 |	Is one of the biggest
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:29,440	| IOT041 |	Ways to change the base of a world in which there was no
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:29,952	| IOT041 |	Spreading
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,768	| IOT041 |	We also believe that the way to do that
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,048	| IOT041 |	Is with better information
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:34,816	| IOT041 |	About wearing
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,864	| IOT041 |	When it's spreading so you can intervene early
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:40,448	| IOT041 |	With the drugs that Diagnostics to vaccines and other products that work
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:43,008	| IOT041 |	You can stop it before it affects the larger
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:46,592	| IOT041 |	So I still feel like you're going to have to just quarantine all the chill
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:51,200	| IOT041 |	With that in mind you guys are started
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:53,504	| IOT041 |	A really interesting program where you
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,552	| IOT041 |	You pass out the cheaper version
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:58,624	| IOT041 |	And here's why I should say that you guys have two versions of your product right
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,672	| IOT041 |	Be smart
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,464	| IOT041 |	I guess it's the cancer
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,488	| IOT041 |	Smart Stick
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,512	| IOT041 |	Thermometer
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:07,072	| IOT041 |	I need to call the thermostat so if I do that tell me
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:12,192	| IOT041 |	It is $20 and then you have the ear thermometer which is $60 in the ear thermometer
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,496	| IOT041 |	Pop it in the rear end
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:18,848	| IOT041 |	And it works and then the Smart Stick is a traditional you stick it under your tongue
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,128	| IOT041 |	Thermometer
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:20,896	| IOT041 |	Kind of thing
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,664	| IOT041 |	So
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:24,992	| IOT041 |	The cheaper version is the one that you guys give out to schools
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:30,368	| IOT041 |	And you know it had those in schools for about 18 months and some places yes
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,648	| IOT041 |	That's right
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:38,048	| IOT041 |	So we threw our fluency program we give the kinsa smart thermometer the stickers in a way and we give it to school
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:41,376	| IOT041 |	Schools around the country that are deserving of its where they are really enthusiastic
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,704	| IOT041 |	And it's a philanthropic program
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:48,800	| IOT041 |	And we see how those small clusters of parents use the product
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,592	| IOT041 |	And we've had about
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:57,504	| IOT041 |	9 schools have been using for 18 months and then we increased the size of the program this year and we
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:02,112	| IOT041 |	By the end of this flu season they'll be more than a hundred schools using the products are really excited about that
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:04,160	| IOT041 |	We have this great story I love this
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,208	| IOT041 |	Within a week and a half of launching is program
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:10,304	| IOT041 |	A 1-carat went under their school group and posted saying
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,584	| IOT041 |	My chemistry in the morning
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,120	| IOT041 |	My child has rosy red cheeks and
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,656	| IOT041 |	Checking the origin
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:19,008	| IOT041 |	Another person responded still in the middle of the night
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:19,776	| IOT041 |	Another person
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,800	| IOT041 |	Responded and said
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,080	| IOT041 |	My child has
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:22,592	| IOT041 |	The same thing
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,384	| IOT041 |	They had a rash
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,408	| IOT041 |	Interfacing
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:29,248	| IOT041 |	Inner chest with red and a fever and the doctor diagnose this
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:34,112	| IOT041 |	Disease and he basically told us there's not much you can do but it's highly contagious
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:38,208	| IOT041 |	The first person respondents said so no need to take them to the Urgent Care Facility
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,232	| IOT041 |	? right
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:45,632	| IOT041 |	It's exactly the kind of information you need right she was basically saying to seeking information to make a decision
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:49,984	| IOT041 |	Do I need to go in right away is this really deeply concerning or can I wait till the morning
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,800	| IOT041 |	To book an appoint with my normal pediatrician
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:55,104	| IOT041 |	How do you see the stuffing illness
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,664	| IOT041 |	Because that is kind of cool right
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,432	| IOT041 |	And then
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:02,272	| IOT041 |	What comes next do you need more devices
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:04,832	| IOT041 |	Or is it just how do you change behaviors
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:06,880	| IOT041 |	Yes they see we're just getting
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,928	| IOT041 |	We believe that when we reach
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,976	| IOT041 |	A level of penetration
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,536	| IOT041 |	Between a quarter and a half of 1
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,840	| IOT041 |	We will have in
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:17,632	| IOT041 |	Information to the tap to start taking into
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,144	| IOT041 |	Flu season
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,680	| IOT041 |	Faster and better than any
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,752	| IOT041 |	Hyperlocal bases in really empowering the system
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,312	| IOT041 |	I'm going to answer your question
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:29,152	| IOT041 |	What does this particular program do parents with information
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,712	| IOT041 |	To respond early
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,272	| IOT041 |	And ultimately we believe that that's going to result
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,296	| IOT041 |	Unless
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,064	| IOT041 |	Children matter of fact
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,344	| IOT041 |	If you get
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:39,904	| IOT041 |	Your child to the doctors office early
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,952	| IOT041 |	Then it's less likely to affect other children
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:48,096	| IOT041 |	But the earlier you texted me earlier you were likely to stop at whether that's affecting another person or whether that's progressing to significantly
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,936	| IOT041 |	If you guys are excited about this
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:54,752	| IOT041 |	You can get cancer thermometer
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:36:01,664	| IOT041 |	In Target you can get both kinds you can get the $20 stick in CVS stores I believe
