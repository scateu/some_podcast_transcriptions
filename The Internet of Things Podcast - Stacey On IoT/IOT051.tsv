EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:05,792	| IOT051 |	Taking it off
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:06,816	| IOT051 |	Apple
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:09,632	| IOT051 |	Monday new smaller iPad
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:10,400	| IOT051 |	Smaller iPhone
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:11,680	| IOT051 |	No homekit
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,192	| IOT051 |	Were you surprised
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:13,728	| IOT051 |	I wasn't
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:15,776	| IOT051 |	I mean I think the last big
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:19,872	| IOT051 |	Apple shindig that had conference they mentioned it once in almost in passing
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,432	| IOT051 |	And I knew from coming
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:25,248	| IOT051 |	The previews are going to be about mobile devices and so
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,528	| IOT051 |	I didn't even TuneIn
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,552	| IOT051 |	Cuz at this point
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,600	| IOT051 |	I'm not expecting homekit news
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:31,392	| IOT051 |	So I wasn't surprised it didn't announce homekit news
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:35,232	| IOT051 |	Man I'm really disappointed mean if you were betting on homekit
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:39,072	| IOT051 |	It feels like we should be a little further along or am I just going to crazy
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:43,936	| IOT051 |	Well think back a year ago coming out of Cs last year
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:46,752	| IOT051 |	It felt like the story of the year
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,776	| IOT051 |	4 smart on this going to be
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,056	| IOT051 |	Homekit
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,080	| IOT051 |	There's so much excitement
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:54,176	| IOT051 |	A lot of companies were really a lot of startups for investing Alder
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,968	| IOT051 |	Development hours in Oak get in
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,248	| IOT051 |	The year went by
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:02:01,088	| IOT051 |	It was it was fairly disappointing cuz there's a lack of news things move very slowly
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,624	| IOT051 |	And so
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,392	| IOT051 |	I think
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:06,464	| IOT051 |	I went to the energy Industries moved on but a lot of startups
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,232	| IOT051 |	Who were betting
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,024	| IOT051 |	I don't get a year ago
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,328	| IOT051 |	Have turn all of their resources elsewhere
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| IOT051 |	For this point
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| IOT051 |	They're turning the resources to
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:16,960	| IOT051 |	She Who Shall Not Be Named the Amazon Echo its
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,472	| IOT051 |	It seems like
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,288	| IOT051 |	Of all the smartphone platform set feels like
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| IOT051 |	Where I'm seeing
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,128	| IOT051 |	The most kind of traction
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,176	| IOT051 |	I agree I mean the reality is
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:30,272	| IOT051 |	To roll out a hunka device is a little more involved in integration with
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:30,784	| IOT051 |	Amazon
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:34,880	| IOT051 |	Echo as simple as more of a software integration you do cloud-to-cloud with
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,416	| IOT051 |	Homekit it actually involves
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| IOT051 |	Hardware near me
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,976	| IOT051 |	Balls of chips o
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,280	| IOT051 |	And if you're waiting for Apple to give you the green light
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:45,888	| IOT051 |	On that thing you're going to be trouble you can have a lot of money stuck in inventory
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,984	| IOT051 |	That isn't available ship so I see why companies moving on
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,312	| IOT051 |	Man so can apple come back from this do you think
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,384	| IOT051 |	It's Apple so you can't right now blog
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,664	| IOT051 |	Mom I think that
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| IOT051 |	You know if they decide
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,992	| IOT051 |	Serious about this
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,528	| IOT051 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,320	| IOT051 |	It's funny I was talking to someone
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:08,160	| IOT051 |	Could meet some folks from Apple they said something to the effect like
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,440	| IOT051 |	Wow homekit
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,744	| IOT051 |	So you guys are really into the smart home and
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,768	| IOT051 |	I think the response was like
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:16,096	| IOT051 |	Well we're not really into the smart home so
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| IOT051 |	It just feels like
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,424	| IOT051 |	There it was almost I bring this before
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:25,824	| IOT051 |	It feels like it's going to head for them they basically wanted their toe in the water to say hey were going to do something here in for bookmarking this
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,872	| IOT051 |	But they haven't really
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:31,968	| IOT051 |	Taking it too seriously and I think quite frankly it was more complicated than they thought I think
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| IOT051 |	It's what's up with a rollout
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,320	| IOT051 |	Like a new accessory or new
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT051 |	Interface like
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:41,696	| IOT051 |	You know that dinner is about to do a smart on platform I think it's Walmart, catechism
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,488	| IOT051 |	Ecosystem have to juggle
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,280	| IOT051 |	Right and
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,072	| IOT051 |	The way they're going about it with
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:50,400	| IOT051 |	Security efforts and then having profiles for each individual device that
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,216	| IOT051 |	Built up and then certified is
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,728	| IOT051 |	Pretty
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:04:00,640	| IOT051 |	That's pretty laborious both for apple and for the people who are going through the companies that are going to be home kits or
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,408	| IOT051 |	Daiso
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:06,528	| IOT051 |	Yeah I get it and see no just speaking of someone who's trying to make things work in her own house
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:09,088	| IOT051 |	You don't need things to play nicely together is not
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,672	| IOT051 |	It's not easy maybe we won't see this and maybe I should give up
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:18,559	| IOT051 |	Don't give up me to the credit I think that you know we should say that
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| IOT051 |	Good for them for considering
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,935	| IOT051 |	Security and making out like that the number one priority cuz I think that's
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:26,239	| IOT051 |	Really it's first and foremost thing in their mind
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| IOT051 |	That is so
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,799	| IOT051 |	I think that's probably why
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:31,103	| IOT051 |	A big reason why the movie Sully so I bought that
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,127	| IOT051 |	But also
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,151	| IOT051 |	You know seems like
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,175	| IOT051 |	Then she's moving on all of it
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:38,271	| IOT051 |	Yeah and they require a hardware that require an mfi search
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,039	| IOT051 |	Certified ship so
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,831	| IOT051 |	If your Hardware isn't
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,599	| IOT051 |	Going to be built with that
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT051 |	Then
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,695	| IOT051 |	You're never going to be
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,231	| IOT051 |	That device is never going to be home
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,511	| IOT051 |	So
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,839	| IOT051 |	All right moving on to
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:57,983	| IOT051 |	New things in retail when I was at South by I actually sat on a panel with someone from beta and I kicked myself
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| IOT051 |	For not
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,799	| IOT051 |	Because the week before I was in Palo Alto
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,359	| IOT051 |	And I didn't go into the store
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,431	| IOT051 |	So for listeners who are like what the heck
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,455	| IOT051 |	This is beta
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,015	| IOT051 |	80
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,367	| IOT051 |	And it's a new kind of retail Concepts that
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,439	| IOT051 |	Shows off the connected devices
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,999	| IOT051 |	Before you buy them and they don't actually care if you buy them there
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,047	| IOT051 |	It's really all about the data for the
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,095	| IOT051 |	Mike you said you had written a bit about them
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| IOT051 |	Yeah it is
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,655	| IOT051 |	Beta I believe it
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT051 |	A lowercase b
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,471	| IOT051 |	Please don't don't put a capital B on their Stacy
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,103	| IOT051 |	I always have trouble writing when I start them with the
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:36,895	| IOT051 |	But
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,175	| IOT051 |	I
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:41,503	| IOT051 |	Hammer and about them that you know the way they pitch the service is
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,807	| IOT051 |	Retail as a service so they basically
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,391	| IOT051 |	Biking it to it like a cloud where you basically can rent
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:50,207	| IOT051 |	Capacity in the form of shelf space
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,511	| IOT051 |	What I like about that is it's much
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,047	| IOT051 |	It's a showroom concept
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,071	| IOT051 |	So you can
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| IOT051 |	Beastly
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:59,167	| IOT051 |	Take a product put it on the store shelves they don't only Midori
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,751	| IOT051 |	And say you're a big company or small company you want to see if you
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:05,055	| IOT051 |	Your company or your product is resonating with consumers
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:09,919	| IOT051 |	You can base it put it in beta and see how consumers react to it cuz they've invested a lot into
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,455	| IOT051 |	In the store
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,735	| IOT051 |	Engagement Analytics
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| IOT051 |	So you can
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:17,087	| IOT051 |	Shopkins how much time consumers are spending in front of your device
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:19,903	| IOT051 |	I think that you did a blog post or an infographic
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,719	| IOT051 |	Or I can award at Israel Oscar
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| IOT051 |	Can Oscars
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,607	| IOT051 |	Awarding the most engaging smart on products or more smart devices
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:33,215	| IOT051 |	Until they have really fine-tune analytics around how many time
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,775	| IOT051 |	Time people are spending with the price if you think it's really important in
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,567	| IOT051 |	It's a different kind of concept
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:40,383	| IOT051 |	Compared to regular retail which I don't think they get that detail
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,919	| IOT051 |	So I think it's
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,967	| IOT051 |	Victor Nutra Scott up for the iot age
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,015	| IOT051 |	Yeah a lot of the so
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,831	| IOT051 |	Kind of some of the things that are little bit different
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| IOT051 |	From talking to the guy from beta
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:58,559	| IOT051 |	Ido if you wanted to do an order with Like Home Depot or Lowe's or another big box retailer
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| IOT051 |	You know
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:02,911	| IOT051 |	You will sit they ask you for a set amount of product so
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| IOT051 |	How many units and it's usually quite a bit
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,495	| IOT051 |	And you ship it to them
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,519	| IOT051 |	And then
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:13,151	| IOT051 |	You actually don't have any sense of how it's doing as a manufacturer unless you like
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,199	| IOT051 |	Wander around all the stores and check out
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| IOT051 |	Which is empty which is
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:20,063	| IOT051 |	Which cells are full that you don't get a lot of that data from the retailer
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:25,951	| IOT051 |	And the beta model is that you will get a lot of data it's not the same kind of data cuz
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,487	| IOT051 |	Betta isn't is concerned
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,255	| IOT051 |	But actually selling
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,023	| IOT051 |	Through
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,535	| IOT051 |	But
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,815	| IOT051 |	If your
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,887	| IOT051 |	If you've got a product that's kind of young
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,399	| IOT051 |	And you're like
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,215	| IOT051 |	Hey people are clicking on your video
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,263	| IOT051 |	But then they're just walking away and
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,567	| IOT051 |	Where they walk away in the middle of your video
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,615	| IOT051 |	You know that you was not properly
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,639	| IOT051 |	Only done well right
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,687	| IOT051 |	That people never pick up your device
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,735	| IOT051 |	You don't those kind of things are
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,759	| IOT051 |	Kind of really interesting
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:54,111	| IOT051 |	I will see if there correlated to higher sales or not I think that's still to be proven
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,463	| IOT051 |	Yeah I love what they're doing a mean one of the other things are requires that
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:03,327	| IOT051 |	The Product Company spend time in the store training their salespeople cuz
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,119	| IOT051 |	Unite no we go to the lake
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,143	| IOT051 |	Angelo's we go to
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,983	| IOT051 |	Some of these other stores big box retailers
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:12,031	| IOT051 |	A representative on the floor by the connect
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,335	| IOT051 |	They don't know what they're talking about but
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,663	| IOT051 |	Bouillabaisse reindeers make sure everyone on the show four is almost like someone
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| IOT051 |	At a Genius Bar
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,991	| IOT051 |	And then Apple Store like really knows the product
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,271	| IOT051 |	I think that's
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,807	| IOT051 |	Really important
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,135	| IOT051 |	Cuz these products are so different and they require so much consumer education
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,183	| IOT051 |	Another thought I have is
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:33,535	| IOT051 |	I think this is going to be really interesting if the expanded footprint Beyond Silicon Valley
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,559	| IOT051 |	Impertinent
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,607	| IOT051 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:43,007	| IOT051 |	We all know if there's a better Google Engineers going in there that's a lot of a different than someone going in the middle Cleveland or or
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,823	| IOT051 |	Your Miami so I would be really interested to see how this
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:50,175	| IOT051 |	Scales as they moved to different geographies and I think it be hugely valuable to get data
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,967	| IOT051 |	From different cities
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,759	| IOT051 |	Around different products cuz I
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,063	| IOT051 |	You know something on Research I do
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,343	| IOT051 |	People react differently
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,879	| IOT051 |	Caprock stiffening what region they're from
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,415	| IOT051 |	Cuz I bring a lot of
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,743	| IOT051 |	Baggage depending on where they're from and they're kind of a lot of
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:07,327	| IOT051 |	The ways to think about products probably shaped by the way they're from
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,887	| IOT051 |	So I think it'll be interesting to see how they expand this outward
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,679	| IOT051 |	Yeah and this is
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:16,543	| IOT051 |	This is kind of in contrast to Target has their Smart Home store which I did pop my head into
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,335	| IOT051 |	Just to see what was there
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,663	| IOT051 |	Which is bear lab space for showing off Connect
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,687	| IOT051 |	Attitude products in
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:25,759	| IOT051 |	Their vision is all about showing how these products work
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,271	| IOT051 |	Together
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| IOT051 |	The beta vision is just
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| IOT051 |	The products individually
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:33,439	| IOT051 |	So I don't know if you have any thoughts on that the beta guy was like you know
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:36,511	| IOT051 |	I don't think people are really that's too big of a sail to be like
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,791	| IOT051 |	Hey this is going to work with this and this
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,327	| IOT051 |	The song
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| IOT051 |	Play together
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:44,191	| IOT051 |	He's like you know people just want a one-off device for the most part today
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,519	| IOT051 |	So he he's like I don't think
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,103	| IOT051 |	Well I think they're different things I think
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,127	| IOT051 |	IPod idea
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| IOT051 |	Showing consumers
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,455	| IOT051 |	Scenes and how things work together
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,783	| IOT051 |	Around consecrated use cases like in a baby's room
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,087	| IOT051 |	Waikiki tonight teens time to go to bed hers baby
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,391	| IOT051 |	But will you bring up Target
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:07,999	| IOT051 |	I just want to mention the secret of project that was in the news a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| IOT051 |	Call Project goldfish
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,631	| IOT051 |	It's a secret project headed up by a guy named West Stringfellow
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,471	| IOT051 |	Have you heard about that Stacy
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,263	| IOT051 |	Heads down focused on some other stuff
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,799	| IOT051 |	Between now and then so
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| IOT051 |	What is Project fi
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:26,943	| IOT051 |	Free which publication first broke I think it's movie twice or maybe actually Mini
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,967	| IOT051 |	Minnesota
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,479	| IOT051 |	Newspaper
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,015	| IOT051 |	It was discovered
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,551	| IOT051 |	Via a job posting on the
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,087	| IOT051 |	I'm a Target website
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,183	| IOT051 |	Or at a head of engineering sent you a CTL for a
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| IOT051 |	Prodigal prodigal fish
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,255	| IOT051 |	The description was
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,559	| IOT051 |	Around the park was they wanted to reinvent retail
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| IOT051 |	And use technology
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,631	| IOT051 |	Did you bring new experiences in
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,679	| IOT051 |	New products to Market
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| IOT051 |	Is based in Silicon Valley
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,031	| IOT051 |	And it makes me wonder if there may be
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,871	| IOT051 |	Taking some of the things or warning in this lab which we talked about the connector
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,663	| IOT051 |	They're home store and maybe
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:01,759	| IOT051 |	Taking some other things maybe they're taking some contest from what they're seeing a betta who knows
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,831	| IOT051 |	It just will be interesting to see what they do is
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,135	| IOT051 |	It's a curious thing to look at each check it out
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,719	| IOT051 |	I am checking it out right now so yes I see West Stringfellow
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,999	| IOT051 |	Who is
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,047	| IOT051 |	Doing this it's pretty secretive
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,607	| IOT051 |	It came out while I was at South by so now I
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,679	| IOT051 |	Yeah there's not a lot of detail
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:25,055	| IOT051 |	That's looking at ways to streamline order fulfillment better manage inventory across all channels
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,335	| IOT051 |	That seems
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| IOT051 |	I don't know I know that
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,943	| IOT051 |	Holiday season Target had been
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,735	| IOT051 |	Working on
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,271	| IOT051 |	Ways to manage inventory so
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:39,135	| IOT051 |	It's sometimes with ship items from the stores as opposed to from the
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,207	| IOT051 |	Warehouses to meet kind of demand
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:45,023	| IOT051 |	Especially if things weren't selling well in an area
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,559	| IOT051 |	But that is pretty in a
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:49,631	| IOT051 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:53,215	| IOT051 |	So it was also West repos one of their entrepreneurs in Residence
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,519	| IOT051 |	Another on Frontier residence
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,311	| IOT051 |	There is nothing called
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,847	| IOT051 |	Future future collab
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,639	| IOT051 |	Which is being put on by
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,967	| IOT051 |	Panda Adventure back by Target and audio
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,015	| IOT051 |	About Reinventing the food ecosystem
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| IOT051 |	And that was
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,087	| IOT051 |	Being shepherded by another
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,135	| IOT051 |	Afternoon residence from Target to
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:17,535	| IOT051 |	It's interesting to see the stuff they're doing there they're trying to reinvent the food system another trying to create a new franchise with in Target
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,047	| IOT051 |	Targeted at
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,095	| IOT051 |	Recreating retail innocence
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,143	| IOT051 |	So pretty
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,911	| IOT051 |	I can't wait
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| IOT051 |	OK in speaking of food
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,239	| IOT051 |	And food Tech
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,519	| IOT051 |	At South by Southwest
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:32,383	| IOT051 |	I ran into some cool companies and I thought of you because I went to your smart Kitchen Summit
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| IOT051 |	Last November and it was awesome
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,735	| IOT051 |	And I saw a lot of these guys here
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:40,831	| IOT051 |	Size of Southwest that I've seen at the Smart Kitchen Summit such as teforia
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,159	| IOT051 |	Which makes the connected teapot for
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,695	| IOT051 |	Got it sells for an ungodly amount of money
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,023	| IOT051 |	I think it was pre-order for $700 at
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,815	| IOT051 |	MSRP is like
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| IOT051 |	$1,400
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,631	| IOT051 |	Did you happen to eat
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,679	| IOT051 |	I did have some tea and
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:58,751	| IOT051 |	She made me green tea because I told her I didn't like green
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,799	| IOT051 |	She's like you will like the screen t
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| IOT051 |	Like that green tea
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:08,223	| IOT051 |	If we did not hit did not turn me into a Believer I could tell it was different than the other green tea but
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,735	| IOT051 |	Yeah I wasn't
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,063	| IOT051 |	Truly honest was not sold
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| IOT051 |	Are you seoul
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,135	| IOT051 |	Do you have one
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:16,415	| IOT051 |	It's a lot of money
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,951	| IOT051 |	So I probably won't buy one
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| IOT051 |	I do have a
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| IOT051 |	PECO
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:24,351	| IOT051 |	Brewberry Appliance coming soon I think they were there as well so I'm excited about that
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,143	| IOT051 |	I'm excited to brew my own beer cuz
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,679	| IOT051 |	I can see paint fabric
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,447	| IOT051 |	Preparing machine
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,471	| IOT051 |	I like beer
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,311	| IOT051 |	800 dollars for coffee maker that is not cam
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,103	| IOT051 |	So
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,127	| IOT051 |	I am totally fine
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,407	| IOT051 |	Spending a lot
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:37,919	| IOT051 |	And something that I really
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,551	| IOT051 |	Jacob Bernoulli
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,623	| IOT051 |	I was going to say speaking of alcohol
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,647	| IOT051 |	A company that
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:53,023	| IOT051 |	I was super pumped about this listeners of the show know that I am
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,607	| IOT051 |	Was there there a company that makes
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,143	| IOT051 |	These bottles
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,959	| IOT051 |	Toppers East Bluetooth powered bottle stoppers for your bar
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:01,983	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:06,847	| IOT051 |	In conjunction with an app you basically look up the cocktail you're trying to make so
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,151	| IOT051 |	Example that used with a sidecar
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,943	| IOT051 |	So you use cognac
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:13,247	| IOT051 |	In orange liqueur like a Grand Marnier or something
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,271	| IOT051 |	Lemon juice
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,039	| IOT051 |	So
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:20,671	| IOT051 |	I would have these Bernoulli bottle caps on top of my bottle of Cognac and on top of my bottle of Grand Marnier
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,767	| IOT051 |	Basically when I start pouring it
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,303	| IOT051 |	The app will tell the bottle cap
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,839	| IOT051 |	When to stop pouring
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| IOT051 |	And then
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,399	| IOT051 |	It would be done
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,703	| IOT051 |	And then I picked up the other one and
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,495	| IOT051 |	It would be like I was she's got the
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,775	| IOT051 |	Grand Marnier
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:41,407	| IOT051 |	And I pour it and then the bottle cap stops the flow of liquid when I got however many ounces I think it's a
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,711	| IOT051 |	121 Conner a show there
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:48,319	| IOT051 |	I was just like yes this is awesome and it was eight of these bottle caps for
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,343	| IOT051 |	$300
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,367	| IOT051 |	But they won't ship
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:52,927	| IOT051 |	For a while they said the end of the year which I always add
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,463	| IOT051 |	Three months to
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,767	| IOT051 |	Yeah it's a different approach to
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,303	| IOT051 |	Common automated or smart bar
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:04,703	| IOT051 |	I mean another one to be the one from perfect company which they're also at the Summer Wars more descale ProScan like the Dropkick
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,519	| IOT051 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,543	| IOT051 |	In the Paso
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,567	| IOT051 |	Just tickets
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:14,687	| IOT051 |	It's a different approach I like the idea and I actually see commercial applications for the Bernoulli
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:19,551	| IOT051 |	ABC would love this because you couldn't have a heavy pour on your
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,831	| IOT051 |	You don't see all your alcohol with
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,159	| IOT051 |	Oh yeah you can also monitor how much liquor your
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:29,535	| IOT051 |	You're playing like if you're if you're trying to monitor how much alcohol is coming out like that might be like one way to do it
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,327	| IOT051 |	And make sure you get the Perfect Pour every time
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,887	| IOT051 |	Although I would say
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,679	| IOT051 |	My thoughts on this are kind
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,727	| IOT051 |	Conflicted because
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,031	| IOT051 |	I've use the cocktail function on the drop
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,567	| IOT051 |	Scale which is like the perfect
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:42,847	| IOT051 |	Do they have another
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| IOT051 |	Perfect bacon
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,663	| IOT051 |	Pink Drink
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,687	| IOT051 |	Perfect drink
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,247	| IOT051 |	A perfect drink actually just do the deal with absolute
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,527	| IOT051 |	Sparta
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,551	| IOT051 |	To make better cocktails
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,063	| IOT051 |	Anyway
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,879	| IOT051 |	I kind of like the idea of doing
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:16:00,767	| IOT051 |	Scale approach because if you want to make your cocktails and batch and then bulk you can
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,327	| IOT051 |	Kind of adjust the recipe in a way that I'm not sure you
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| IOT051 |	You could do with
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,631	| IOT051 |	Bratayley house I haven't played with it
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,679	| IOT051 |	And I think
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,471	| IOT051 |	Pictures are way better than the massive
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,543	| IOT051 |	Robot bartending kind of machines that you
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| IOT051 |	Keep cut your liquor into
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:14,847	| IOT051 |	And then
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,663	| IOT051 |	You program that basically the drinks are
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,199	| IOT051 |	It's like oh I got the following six
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,991	| IOT051 |	In a bottles in the back of
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,271	| IOT051 |	Here's what I can make
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,135	| IOT051 |	Yeah they drink robots are interesting
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,183	| IOT051 |	Did you try the Keurig kold
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,231	| IOT051 |	Cat CSI had a cocktail
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:35,327	| IOT051 |	Made For Me by the Kirkwood I left you that is pretty good that's obviously
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| IOT051 |	They're mixing
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,631	| IOT051 |	It is a pond a system
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,655	| IOT051 |	Mixing like a
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:41,215	| IOT051 |	Margarita mix into a
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:42,239	| IOT051 |	Some liquor but
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:45,823	| IOT051 |	There's lots of different ways I think bars becoming interesting as we applied technology to it
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:49,151	| IOT051 |	Final news element for us is Bosch
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,199	| IOT051 |	Which is the Robert Bosch company in Germany
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,015	| IOT051 |	You guys maybe like what
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:57,343	| IOT051 |	But they've actually done a lot of really cool stuff with Kinect
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:00,927	| IOT051 |	Two containers connected industry they call it industrie 4.0
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,719	| IOT051 |	All the German company Siemens
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,303	| IOT051 |	Bosch they're all like industry for a where I live
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:06,815	| IOT051 |	We are Manufacturing
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:08,351	| IOT051 |	My sensors
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:13,983	| IOT051 |	Bosch earlier this month they had their connection world event and they launched an iot cloud
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,519	| IOT051 |	Compete with
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:19,103	| IOT051 |	Looks like Kayla IBM's iot Cloud Amazon.
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:19,615	| IOT051 |	Pcloud
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,151	| IOT051 |	Azure has their eye on
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,455	| IOT051 |	So worth noting
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:26,015	| IOT051 |	Because Bob has such a play in
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:29,087	| IOT051 |	Automotive check-in sensors in manufacturing
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,879	| IOT051 |	Also because by golly
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,927	| IOT051 |	Who would have iot cloud
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,231	| IOT051 |	Take the GED
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,767	| IOT051 |	Of Europe you know they've been
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,303	| IOT051 |	Eating their own dog food
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:43,935	| IOT051 |	Could run iot for notices 2000-2018 they start requiring companies to get that expertise in house
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,215	| IOT051 |	And the other
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,775	| IOT051 |	Crater like these European Union wide
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,615	| IOT051 |	Charging networks with auto recharging all the stuff where they use iot technology
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,151	| IOT051 |	Looks like they're basically commercializing
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:56,735	| IOT051 |	I want what they've been warning or the past few years into their own cloud
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:02,879	| IOT051 |	Yeah and Bayliss we are spending 548 million dollars on Innovation and connected stuff
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,415	| IOT051 |	Which
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,207	| IOT051 |	Is maybe a lot
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:12,607	| IOT051 |	You're like what
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,375	| IOT051 |	So
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:15,935	| IOT051 |	It's a no less than 1% of their actual Revenue
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,447	| IOT051 |	But still
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| IOT051 |	I'm not going to stop at it be
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:18,751	| IOT051 |	Because
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,823	| IOT051 |	They're clearly big Believers in the technology
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,663	| IOT051 |	We should I pay attention to them I don't know
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:30,527	| IOT051 |	That's it for this week show and less Mikey
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| IOT051 |	You got anything else you want to share
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,111	| IOT051 |	Now this is been a lot of fun
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| IOT051 |	I'm glad to catch up with
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:38,463	| IOT051 |	Yeah it's been used to work together
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:42,303	| IOT051 |	Always followed him because he's such a smart home expert
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:46,143	| IOT051 |	Smart home show iTunes
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,959	| IOT051 |	And he does a lot of stuff with the connected kitchen
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,471	| IOT051 |	Which
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:50,495	| IOT051 |	I love so
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,543	| IOT051 |	Yeah we're having another event
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,079	| IOT051 |	This year what happened in October
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,847	| IOT051 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,871	| IOT051 |	I know where I'm going to be
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| IOT051 |	Is in Seattle
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,663	| IOT051 |	Yes you're coming out
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,687	| IOT051 |	I am there
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,247	| IOT051 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:06,367	| IOT051 |	So stay tuned because next up is Daniel Conrad the CEO of beat networks and we going to talk about
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| IOT051 |	1
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:10,719	| IOT051 |	How hard it was for him to actually get into building a network
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,255	| IOT051 |	Or that he was building a
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,023	| IOT051 |	Connected speaker
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:19,679	| IOT051 |	So entrepreneurs listen up and then to we're going to learn about Laura which is one of the low-power wireless area Networks
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,471	| IOT051 |	Yay
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:32,479	| IOT051 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I have your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,759	| IOT051 |	Is Daniel Conrad
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,783	| IOT051 |	Who is the
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:37,087	| IOT051 |	Co-founder and CEO of BP
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,599	| IOT051 |	Networks
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,903	| IOT051 |	Hey Stacy
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,463	| IOT051 |	I am super excited to have because
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:45,535	| IOT051 |	We are going to talk about low power Wireless
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:49,375	| IOT051 |	Area networks which is so hard to say about your
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,143	| IOT051 |	Torturous Journey
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| IOT051 |	Torturous
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| IOT051 |	Torturous
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,031	| IOT051 |	Maybe I'll find it
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,079	| IOT051 |	Cruise
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:02,943	| IOT051 |	From any entrepreneur is the journey is a bit torque rest so I'll take it
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,479	| IOT051 |	Okay alright so
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,271	| IOT051 |	Google first started
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,575	| IOT051 |	It wasn't deep networks it was just beep
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| IOT051 |	Correct
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,647	| IOT051 |	Okay and so
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,207	| IOT051 |	You may remember beef is this tiny beautiful
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,487	| IOT051 |	Basically
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,279	| IOT051 |	Wifi-connected speaker
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:17,791	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,631	| IOT051 |	Now it doesn't exist or it exists for
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:24,959	| IOT051 |	For a couple customers who bought it but Daniels you want to tell us what happened
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:32,127	| IOT051 |	Sure you are motivation throughout the history theater around like what is going to be the next
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,175	| IOT051 |	Platform
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,455	| IOT051 |	Transition that we see
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,015	| IOT051 |	And ever really excited up packet
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:40,319	| IOT051 |	The computers are a few bucks now
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,343	| IOT051 |	And they can be put inside of it
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:47,743	| IOT051 |	And what
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,047	| IOT051 |	First incarnation of
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,863	| IOT051 |	Deep was to take the functionality of Sonos
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,399	| IOT051 |	Put it on a check
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| IOT051 |	And then
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,751	| IOT051 |	Bake that into
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,799	| IOT051 |	Every speaker that isn't Sonos
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| IOT051 |	In the world
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,103	| IOT051 |	What's that connect everything
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,663	| IOT051 |	So it's kind of like we're going to be
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,967	| IOT051 |	The other speakers
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:10,015	| IOT051 |	What's first shot across the bow was the
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:14,623	| IOT051 |	Nexus line instead of the reference design which is this
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,159	| IOT051 |	The Shining
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,952	| IOT051 |	Copper on dial
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:26,144	| IOT051 |	Simultaneous
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:29,984	| IOT051 |	Music streaming is one of the most difficult things that you can do online
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,592	| IOT051 |	For any
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,360	| IOT051 |	Problems with it
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT051 |	Really really low
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:39,200	| IOT051 |	Virginia Russian music
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,712	| IOT051 |	You want to
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,760	| IOT051 |	You want to throw that thing out the window
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,392	| IOT051 |	Interesting technically challenging project
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:50,208	| IOT051 |	The problem was Ben Larkin
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,000	| IOT051 |	In a while we're working
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| IOT051 |	Apple and Google
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,608	| IOT051 |	Amazon removing A Space Odyssey
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,656	| IOT051 |	You know the goal wasn't just to be
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,496	| IOT051 |	Computers
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:07,104	| IOT051 |	And speakers typically have microphones and to move in the direction where
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,664	| IOT051 |	In multiple rooms of the house you have a difference
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,456	| IOT051 |	Facing west
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:16,064	| IOT051 |	That are with with Chromecast
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:21,184	| IOT051 |	Google News aggressively into the space with Amazon moving into voice
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:25,024	| IOT051 |	It was pretty clear that the market opportunity for us is going away
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,304	| IOT051 |	So
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,328	| IOT051 |	We ended up
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,608	| IOT051 |	Having a sunset
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,912	| IOT051 |	Doctors
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,192	| IOT051 |	Give me
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:36,032	| IOT051 |	Couple of years into developing a shipping product
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,080	| IOT051 |	How many dollars investors money
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,104	| IOT051 |	When is the bad Andre
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:41,920	| IOT051 |	That was the other day
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,200	| IOT051 |	So that were
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:46,528	| IOT051 |	Really sad to see us go
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:49,600	| IOT051 |	Is this reality was able to build a large
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,416	| IOT051 |	Music streaming product
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,464	| IOT051 |	We're going to need to go in a different direction
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,280	| IOT051 |	So that has got to be
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:04,448	| IOT051 |	Tough how did your investors driving did your investors tell you this did you guys just wake up one day and realize it like
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,264	| IOT051 |	How did you both come to this realization and then how
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| IOT051 |	Did you communicate it
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,568	| IOT051 |	2
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:10,848	| IOT051 |	Your masters
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,384	| IOT051 |	Customers in
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,408	| IOT051 |	To your employees
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:17,248	| IOT051 |	Realizations don't ever really happen overnight
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:23,392	| IOT051 |	Build over time and then something clicks and you have a decision to make
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,000	| IOT051 |	Came from our own understanding the market we
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,048	| IOT051 |	Do it better than anyone
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,376	| IOT051 |	Face the reality that
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:37,728	| IOT051 |	With a team are size trying to go up against Giants who
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,776	| IOT051 |	We're willing to lose money on every device
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:45,920	| IOT051 |	And then try to push distribution and Partnerships with the love of Louie needs to be successful
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,200	| IOT051 |	Was
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,016	| IOT051 |	Not going to be the best use of the team that we assembled
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,296	| IOT051 |	So then you decided
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,088	| IOT051 |	Oh my gosh look
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,368	| IOT051 |	Let's do a low-power wide area network
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:24:01,280	| IOT051 |	Not quite that simple recently Actiontec sometimes I sent an email to my investor
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,816	| IOT051 |	And basically
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,608	| IOT051 |	Given the reasons that
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,656	| IOT051 |	We were going to pull off of music
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:11,520	| IOT051 |	Then we set ourselves a very tight timeline to explore other options
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,312	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:19,200	| IOT051 |	To find UniFirst a technical Direction I'm a business Direction and then to get the point where we thought
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:22,272	| IOT051 |	We were convinced that there would be the smallest
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:27,904	| IOT051 |	So we were familiar we are aware of
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,184	| IOT051 |	Somebody's radio technology
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,280	| IOT051 |	We heard the specs and we didn't believe him
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:34,560	| IOT051 |	Because
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:40,960	| IOT051 |	That's always the case of me radio technology we explored a few other things we are building drones here for a while
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,264	| IOT051 |	Define radios
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,032	| IOT051 |	As well
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,312	| IOT051 |	A few things
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,104	| IOT051 |	Eventually couldn't get
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,896	| IOT051 |	Lora radios
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,944	| IOT051 |	At the time that we start looking at this
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:55,040	| IOT051 |	So some books in Europe that had
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| IOT051 |	Souderton chips out on board we got those
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,624	| IOT051 |	Shipt
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| IOT051 |	Over here
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:05,792	| IOT051 |	And I dropped one of my desk and started driving
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| IOT051 |	We got about a mile away
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,144	| IOT051 |	And we're still getting signal through and we said
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| IOT051 |	I think there's something here
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,496	| IOT051 |	Alright so
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:19,104	| IOT051 |	For the people who are not aware of the we've talked about it a couple times on the show Laura is
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,896	| IOT051 |	One type of radio
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| IOT051 |	Technology for these low power
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| IOT051 |	Wide area Networks
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:28,064	| IOT051 |	Others are put forth by sick Fox
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:29,088	| IOT051 |	There is
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,856	| IOT051 |	Ingenue
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| IOT051 |	Which is doing
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,440	| IOT051 |	Completely different standard
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:36,000	| IOT051 |	And then there's also things like lte-m
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,144	| IOT051 |	So other standards and those are for the cellular
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,704	| IOT051 |	Maverick so basically there's a bunch of different ways
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,472	| IOT051 |	If you want to send
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,264	| IOT051 |	Very small amount of data
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,592	| IOT051 |	A certain distance usually a far distance
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| IOT051 |	Away
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:53,408	| IOT051 |	This is what we're talking about doing
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:55,200	| IOT051 |	And so
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,224	| IOT051 |	To help people out
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,248	| IOT051 |	Why
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,272	| IOT051 |	Why do we need
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,600	| IOT051 |	So the first thing is
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,696	| IOT051 |	AR
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,512	| IOT051 |	We saw some the couches Wi-Fi reliability
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:12,608	| IOT051 |	That's complicated annoying
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,144	| IOT051 |	Cellular is
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:19,008	| IOT051 |	You just
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:22,848	| IOT051 |	You'll get a SIM card and stick it in and or or activate your device in
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:28,480	| IOT051 |	And you're good to go for you
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,504	| IOT051 |	But
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,808	| IOT051 |	Cellular has a limitation
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,344	| IOT051 |	The matter a lot
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,136	| IOT051 |	When you're talking about
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:38,208	| IOT051 |	Devices that don't need a lot of bandwidth that do need
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:39,744	| IOT051 |	To be battery powered
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,280	| IOT051 |	So you guys
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,048	| IOT051 |	Focused on
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:44,352	| IOT051 |	Basically sending small amounts of data
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,120	| IOT051 |	Step wooden
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:49,216	| IOT051 |	Consume battery power
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:49,728	| IOT051 |	Video
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,520	| IOT051 |	Is chyler Leigh
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,800	| IOT051 |	Cancel Google messaging
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:57,152	| IOT051 |	Or
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,176	| IOT051 |	Anything like that
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:02,528	| IOT051 |	It's complicated to build a wireless network so what are the challenges that you guys have to
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,552	| IOT051 |	To deal with cuz I'm thinking
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,136	| IOT051 |	You know in a traditional cellular network you got Tower sighting
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,160	| IOT051 |	You got to deal with
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,440	| IOT051 |	Multiple radios
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:10,976	| IOT051 |	Fourier
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,000	| IOT051 |	PlayStation speaker
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,304	| IOT051 |	If the client devices
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:20,192	| IOT051 |	Is all of that the same and then I guess we can talk about the authentication and billing cuz that's another big problem
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,472	| IOT051 |	So
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:24,544	| IOT051 |	It's easier for the developer but it's not easy for the network operator
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,056	| IOT051 |	Which is what you're trying
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,640	| IOT051 |	Kind of
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,432	| IOT051 |	I believe so
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,200	| IOT051 |	And I think that
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,248	| IOT051 |	Persistent
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:37,088	| IOT051 |	The benefits are you can get two years of battery life
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,624	| IOT051 |	On an implant device
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,392	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:42,976	| IOT051 |	You're not going to be able to do that was a lot
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:47,072	| IOT051 |	Or a number of different applications were actually installing sensors in
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,376	| IOT051 |	Warehouses right now
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:53,472	| IOT051 |	Last for 5 plus years into the installation
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:56,032	| IOT051 |	When I say installation I mean we just put them where we want them
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:28:02,176	| IOT051 |	And the networks that are out
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,992	| IOT051 |	It's just like
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:07,808	| IOT051 |	Dissenters and don't think about it for 5 years
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,600	| IOT051 |	There are other things like
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:14,208	| IOT051 |	If you need productivity in an area that Verizon isn't
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,000	| IOT051 |	If you have an area that Verizon
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,048	| IOT051 |	Cover you never will
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:24,192	| IOT051 |	Get them to cover it right
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:26,752	| IOT051 |	Put a sensor that you pay a buckle up for
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,056	| IOT051 |	I'm in your Fielder
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,592	| IOT051 |	So there a couple things
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,872	| IOT051 |	There are few of these
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:32,896	| IOT051 |	Value areas
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,200	| IOT051 |	Taylor just doesn't work
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:37,760	| IOT051 |	And the reason that we have the standards
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,320	| IOT051 |	The developing things like
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:46,208	| IOT051 |	A bureau in all of the new coyote standard for cellular is because they recognized
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,000	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,536	| IOT051 |	They know that they need to get one
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,352	| IOT051 |	Questions when will they do it
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,888	| IOT051 |	Royalty ever really
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:56,448	| IOT051 |	Become a first-class citizen on cellular data
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,472	| IOT051 |	Smart Start
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:11,296	| IOT051 |	So the technology that we're building what we're focused on here
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,088	| IOT051 |	Deep Network
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,136	| IOT051 |	Is is about
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:18,464	| IOT051 |	Basically making not as easy as possible
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,536	| IOT051 |	As simple as possible
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,328	| IOT051 |	Either so that means
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,120	| IOT051 |	Maximizing the range
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,656	| IOT051 |	Small
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,936	| IOT051 |	Changes in
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,216	| IOT051 |	Range
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,752	| IOT051 |	Huge impact
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,032	| IOT051 |	On the number of
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:35,104	| IOT051 |	Powers that you need to cover an area like where
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,640	| IOT051 |	Working here in San Francisco
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:39,712	| IOT051 |	Weed in the early testing
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,480	| IOT051 |	About a mile range
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,296	| IOT051 |	Our current testing we're getting as much
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,344	| IOT051 |	Outdoors
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:48,160	| IOT051 |	This has been a very high interference environment
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,696	| IOT051 |	Out in
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:54,048	| IOT051 |	Rural areas New Egypt
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:01,984	| IOT051 |	Situation
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,008	| IOT051 |	Maricela
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:03,776	| IOT051 |	Wow
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:09,152	| IOT051 |	So yeah so this is
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,224	| IOT051 |	Unlicensed spectrum and yet they have better range than
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:17,600	| IOT051 |	Cellular Sales
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,112	| IOT051 |	Is
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,648	| IOT051 |	Crazy low power
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,672	| IOT051 |	Weave
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,744	| IOT051 |	You said between 1 kilobyte of data
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,536	| IOT051 |	Are kilobits per second to
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:28,864	| IOT051 |	300 kilobits per second but we haven't achieved that because that's
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,144	| IOT051 |	Really close
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:33,216	| IOT051 |	What are people doing with this in
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,776	| IOT051 |	One of my big issues
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:38,336	| IOT051 |	With these kind of low-power Wireless
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,616	| IOT051 |	Area networks is
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:42,688	| IOT051 |	I just have a hard time believing that someone who
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,992	| IOT051 |	Has connectivity is going to be like
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,504	| IOT051 |	Hey
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,552	| IOT051 |	We're good that's enough connectivity
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:50,368	| IOT051 |	I cool just sending this one piece of data over
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,648	| IOT051 |	Cuz usually people are like
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:54,208	| IOT051 |	In tennis one piece of data over
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,232	| IOT051 |	What if I want to send
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,024	| IOT051 |	Another sensor
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:31:01,632	| IOT051 |	Or what if I want to send multiple pieces of data or maybe collect that data more times a day
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:02,912	| IOT051 |	How does that go
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,728	| IOT051 |	And I look at it the same way I
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,264	| IOT051 |	I think that what you just said is
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,104	| IOT051 |	Dr. orsi
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:14,944	| IOT051 |	I have a sensor the telling me what temperature it is in suddenly I
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,480	| IOT051 |	I need videos
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,296	| IOT051 |	I have one sensor
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:21,600	| IOT051 |	And I want Chad and I want 200
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,112	| IOT051 |	And so
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,696	| IOT051 |	Architecture that we're working with
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:30,816	| IOT051 |	The network Protocols are built on top of these radios are designed to scale on number of devices
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,608	| IOT051 |	Device
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,632	| IOT051 |	You get
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,424	| IOT051 |	Tens of thousands of devices
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,448	| IOT051 |	Connecting to a gateway
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,216	| IOT051 |	That's how we think
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,520	| IOT051 |	Now frequency
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:45,664	| IOT051 |	What's great is that when you can actually
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,200	| IOT051 |	We need the same thing.
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,016	| IOT051 |	Effectively
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:53,600	| IOT051 |	I just got just fill-in more gateways as we get to capacity so
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:58,720	| IOT051 |	And how do you think about the competing networks cuz you guys are building your network
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:01,024	| IOT051 |	The first net worth you have in San Francisco
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:03,328	| IOT051 |	Can you guys all coexist does that make sense
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,656	| IOT051 |	The technologies have different advantages
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:08,704	| IOT051 |	Sigfox
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:11,264	| IOT051 |	Is a very low data rate
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,056	| IOT051 |	Radio Sol
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:22,016	| IOT051 |	The Laura has has been more flexibility you can actually change the data rate and trade it also
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:26,368	| IOT051 |	Range and software function of the radio
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,416	| IOT051 |	And then in
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:31,744	| IOT051 |	Ingenue ingenu is working with her on
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,024	| IOT051 |	Critical Ops
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,840	| IOT051 |	Thailand house in the building on a network on it and
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:39,168	| IOT051 |	So if you end up with a different kind of ecosystem when you're
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,960	| IOT051 |	When you're doing that when the
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,752	| IOT051 |	The chips are available from the carrier
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,800	| IOT051 |	What kind of all
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,824	| IOT051 |	Apartments together
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:49,152	| IOT051 |	I think that there I have not
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,456	| IOT051 |	Got any testing with their technology I believe it's
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,760	| IOT051 |	For my understanding from
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,528	| IOT051 |	The way there
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,064	| IOT051 |	Describe it as entire throughput
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:33:00,672	| IOT051 |	Operate on 2.4 Spectre witches or Wi-Fi is so their pluses and minus
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:01,696	| IOT051 |	SLAP 2
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:07,840	| IOT051 |	What's exciting is ever going to get a new kinds of networks that aren't cellular that have different structures we're going to get
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:11,680	| IOT051 |	A variety of competitors and we're building up its Network
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,312	| IOT051 |	So
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| IOT051 |	It's not about
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:22,688	| IOT051 |	Being limited to the conductivity auctions we have today
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:26,784	| IOT051 |	Explosion of new opportunities and new ways to
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,808	| IOT051 |	Connect devices it
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:28,576	| IOT051 |	We're not available.
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:37,024	| IOT051 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,304	| IOT051 |	Digikey
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,352	| IOT051 |	What was crazy to me
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:43,168	| IOT051 |	Few companies in Silicon Valley
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:45,728	| IOT051 |	Are aware of or working on
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,776	| IOT051 |	The psychology because
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:51,360	| IOT051 |	So from your perspective if it's so easy to start up this network
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:54,176	| IOT051 |	And I can go out and buy these chips and
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,200	| IOT051 |	Volume
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,992	| IOT051 |	They're relatively inexpensive
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:34:01,344	| IOT051 |	Your expertise what are you going to be selling what your business model and then what's your competitive advantage
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:09,536	| IOT051 |	The hardware you like that you know you by the chip in at Dunston masne and communicates the
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,816	| IOT051 |	Leslie Erin
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:11,328	| IOT051 |	And receive them
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,632	| IOT051 |	The network protocol that sits
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:17,728	| IOT051 |	Implemented
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,264	| IOT051 |	I'm in any
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:19,776	| IOT051 |	Like
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,312	| IOT051 |	Play open
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,080	| IOT051 |	What are
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:25,664	| IOT051 |	So we've done our own implementation of the network protocol is that
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:27,968	| IOT051 |	Radios
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:29,504	| IOT051 |	So then what do you sell
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:33,088	| IOT051 |	Since the day we have we are your date appointments
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:33,600	| IOT051 |	Sensor
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,648	| IOT051 |	Solutions.
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:41,536	| IOT051 |	Solutions like we Droppin hardware and give you a login to a. Where the shows your
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,072	| IOT051 |	Your data
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:46,656	| IOT051 |	For some customers that's what they're going to want
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:53,056	| IOT051 |	Four four other customers going to want it she said that so they might want to do
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:53,568	| IOT051 |	They might want
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:57,664	| IOT051 |	The Builder of sensor and use steroid hardware and just
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:59,200	| IOT051 |	Connecticut.
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:01,248	| IOT051 |	Are libraries to basically
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,272	| IOT051 |	Activity
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:04,320	| IOT051 |	Hard thing that were solving is
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,088	| IOT051 |	Getting
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,672	| IOT051 |	Where we see our value is doing
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:12,256	| IOT051 |	The hard work of conductivity making that really seamless
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,280	| IOT051 |	That was a long way of saying
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:14,304	| IOT051 |	Flexible
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:17,120	| IOT051 |	Start up
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:17,632	| IOT051 |	Figuring it out
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,192	| IOT051 |	That's the moron
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:21,728	| IOT051 |	We accept
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:23,008	| IOT051 |	On the show
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| IOT051 |	Okay
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,336	| IOT051 |	So now we have a sense of why this matter
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,360	| IOT051 |	What's your doing
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,384	| IOT051 |	What Laura is
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:29,664	| IOT051 |	And
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:34,016	| IOT051 |	Possibly how you're going to make money and apparently a very passionate call to action for other people
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:35,296	| IOT051 |	This is great radio technology
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,856	| IOT051 |	You should look at it Daniel thank you so much
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| IOT051 |	For coming on the show today
