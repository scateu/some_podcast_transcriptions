EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| IOT197 |	And on that
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,304	| IOT197 |	Episode
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,328	| IOT197 |	You will hear
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:51,168	| IOT197 |	From people we met at CES talking again about consumer trends
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,216	| IOT197 |	But
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,728	| IOT197 |	We're going to do it
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:04:00,896	| IOT197 |	We kind of have to logistically is her tricky because CES is still going on as we're going to be recording the show
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:04,224	| IOT197 |	From CVS Oster maybe new things we find out
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| IOT197 |	After the show for example again
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:09,088	| IOT197 |	Interviewing and talking to people we've got to edit and so on and so forth
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,880	| IOT197 |	I think that's a good approach
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,904	| IOT197 |	Two weeks of CBS coverage
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| IOT197 |	Yay

EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,280	| IOT197 |	We'll go down some we won't go too much
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,559	| IOT197 |	Listen to it but I think it's worth
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,607	| IOT197 |	Giving you a heads up on things that I say
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| IOT197 |	Super nuts
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,167	| IOT197 |	So 1
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,959	| IOT197 |	Connected bathroom
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| IOT197 |	You guys
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| IOT197 |	I
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,799	| IOT197 |	Expect I told you this and I was like I regret to
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,615	| IOT197 |	We are going to see smart toilets at CES
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,175	| IOT197 |	We are we are going to see them from
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,967	| IOT197 |	Many of the major brands and
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| IOT197 |	They're going to have
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,015	| IOT197 |	Some crazy feet
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:41,855	| IOT197 |	And I can't give you too many details about all of these
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,135	| IOT197 |	Plus I'm sure I'm going to see
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| IOT197 |	Evenboer
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| IOT197 |	But
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:49,023	| IOT197 |	You should expect some smart speaker toilets maybe some flights may be soon
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,047	| IOT197 |	Interesting
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,583	| IOT197 |	Cleaning technology
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:52,863	| IOT197 |	It's going to be wild
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,167	| IOT197 |	I'm going to let you hit those boots
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,799	| IOT197 |	Cuz that's not my jam that's all I'm going to say
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,823	| IOT197 |	We're going to shoot
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,591	| IOT197 |	Video
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,871	| IOT197 |	It's going to be fine
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:07,711	| IOT197 |	So that's it in in addition to toilets
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,759	| IOT197 |	You're going to see a lot happening in the bath
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,087	| IOT197 |	So smart mirrors going to be a thing
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:15,391	| IOT197 |	Lot of smart Health technology that
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| IOT197 |	It's going to try to
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,719	| IOT197 |	Incorporate things from your scale and
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:19,999	| IOT197 |	Mirror's Edge
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,071	| IOT197 |	Other new devices that are going to be out
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,351	| IOT197 |	I hope all is
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,679	| IOT197 |	Bathroom essentials in the smart home are
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,519	| IOT197 |	Battery power because I don't feel like rewiring electricity in my bathroom
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,799	| IOT197 |	Or something like a smart
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,847	| IOT197 |	Mirror for example
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,871	| IOT197 |	That is a point
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,663	| IOT197 |	So and we saw this actually
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:43,039	| IOT197 |	It was a two years ago that Moen launch there they had a smart shower
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| IOT197 |	Thing in the last year
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,367	| IOT197 |	Kohler launched
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| IOT197 |	Couple smart bathroom thing
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,671	| IOT197 |	As well
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:53,279	| IOT197 |	The challenge with a lot of these is people do not have electricity like you have to
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,047	| IOT197 |	To put
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,607	| IOT197 |	To put the Moen smart shower thing and you had to
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:59,679	| IOT197 |	Install basically a touch screen in Your Shower
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,239	| IOT197 |	And you had to wire electricity to your shower
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:02,751	| IOT197 |	And that's
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:06,335	| IOT197 |	Yeah do that with the water off is my recommendation
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| IOT197 |	I would have sent you
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,663	| IOT197 |	Hire a professional for this
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT197 |	Particular
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,199	| IOT197 |	Insomnia
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,759	| IOT197 |	So that'll be kind of
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,807	| IOT197 |	I said not to do it
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:21,183	| IOT197 |	Another thing I think we're going to see are some really crazy cool headphone
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,975	| IOT197 |	I think we're going to see a lot of
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:25,023	| IOT197 |	We talked in the past about getting
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,047	| IOT197 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,863	| IOT197 |	Madame de all of these in anime
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,143	| IOT197 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,983	| IOT197 |	Getting that into headphones I think we're even going to see some
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,007	| IOT197 |	Cool sensors
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,799	| IOT197 |	If not at CES
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,823	| IOT197 |	I think we're going to see it
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,871	| IOT197 |	This coming year in
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,383	| IOT197 |	2019
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,687	| IOT197 |	You know what there's a bunch of
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,991	| IOT197 |	Smart headphones incurables
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| IOT197 |	Out now
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:50,367	| IOT197 |	And it's early in this market for sure and companies have integrated assistance
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,903	| IOT197 |	Listen to headphones
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,231	| IOT197 |	Cordless headphones need to be connected by Bluetooth to some
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| IOT197 |	Smarter device
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,303	| IOT197 |	To get the information from the
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:01,119	| IOT197 |	Cloud I wonder you think maybe there's a wave
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:01,631	| IOT197 |	For these
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,167	| IOT197 |	Headphone makers
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:08,287	| IOT197 |	To make headphones almost always connected but not with Bluetooth met with Wi-Fi but
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,591	| IOT197 |	Get the Wi-Fi off when you're not using the assistant parts
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,383	| IOT197 |	Just cuz of Wifi battery drain I mean
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,431	| IOT197 |	I'll try to think of what could Advance this
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,967	| IOT197 |	I'm thinking more of the Thai
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,551	| IOT197 |	So I think it'll offer Health and Wellness
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:25,695	| IOT197 |	I'm thinking we'll probably see you know you can actually get a lot of really interesting information for me
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,463	| IOT197 |	Ear
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:28,511	| IOT197 |	So I think we're going to see something
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,535	| IOT197 |	Like that
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,071	| IOT197 |	As opposed to an always
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,583	| IOT197 |	On
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:36,191	| IOT197 |	Individual I think you're right when you frame it that way but I'm going to
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,239	| IOT197 |	Say that I don't think they'll be a big thing
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:42,847	| IOT197 |	And the reason I think that is because headphones aren't something you wear all the time
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,895	| IOT197 |	Like my Apple watch for example
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,431	| IOT197 |	Take an Android Wear watch doesn't matter
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,711	| IOT197 |	That's
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,783	| IOT197 |	True now I could see it for more accurately
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,551	| IOT197 |	Like a heart rate monitor
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,111	| IOT197 |	In your Apple watch actually
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,135	| IOT197 |	For people who don't have
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:59,231	| IOT197 |	This may be in a baby more power efficient or better place
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,255	| IOT197 |	To put it I don't know
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,815	| IOT197 |	There's definitely in it and accuracy benefit in certain
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,375	| IOT197 |	Thanks no doubt about it I just I don't know
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,911	| IOT197 |	Maybe four people don't wear watch
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,935	| IOT197 |	Watches or other wearable
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| IOT197 |	Keith Whitley
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:09,983	| IOT197 |	Interesting
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,055	| IOT197 |	Yeah so and they are way more accurate
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,079	| IOT197 |	Speaking of
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:15,359	| IOT197 |	Icing
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| IOT197 |	In 29
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,663	| IOT197 |	18
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,455	| IOT197 |	And you know also at CVS
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| IOT197 |	We're going to see
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,759	| IOT197 |	Sea change
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,527	| IOT197 |	In the number of
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,295	| IOT197 |	Appel
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,599	| IOT197 |	And wellness-related devices
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,623	| IOT197 |	Algorithm
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,695	| IOT197 |	And we're going to start seeing FDA approval
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,207	| IOT197 |	On a lot of
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,487	| IOT197 |	Thor on some of them
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| IOT197 |	And that's going to be really
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,095	| IOT197 |	Cuz we see right now you know some of its
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| IOT197 |	Snake oil right you're like
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,447	| IOT197 |	You can track this it'll be amazing but
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,751	| IOT197 |	You don't really know if it's actually doing anything or
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,567	| IOT197 |	You know what this heart rate monitor is actually
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,335	| IOT197 |	We accurate enough
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,359	| IOT197 |	But
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:51,455	| IOT197 |	With Amazon they've got actually Omron is a blood pressure cuff
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,991	| IOT197 |	Apus monitor there actually making
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:55,039	| IOT197 |	A wristband that's going to
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,319	| IOT197 |	Check your blood pressure constant
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,623	| IOT197 |	So if you look at something like that
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,135	| IOT197 |	You can now ask
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,927	| IOT197 |	You know Madam a what
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| IOT197 |	My blood pressure
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,719	| IOT197 |	That becomes really
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:06,303	| IOT197 |	Kind of exciting and then I also see
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,583	| IOT197 |	A lot of research
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,375	| IOT197 |	Husband going into things
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:13,983	| IOT197 |	Looks like gate detection for various illnesses and then things like
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,007	| IOT197 |	Using your voice
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,031	| IOT197 |	Understand if you're
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,799	| IOT197 |	Depressed
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:20,127	| IOT197 |	If you have Parkinson's if you have some other medical condition
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:24,991	| IOT197 |	And I think we're going to start to see that in FDA-approved Fashions on our
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,015	| IOT197 |	Smartphones and device
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,063	| IOT197 |	And that's going to be
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,087	| IOT197 |	Freaking awesome
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:29,599	| IOT197 |	Splashtown
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,183	| IOT197 |	I think you're right and I also would add to it
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,743	| IOT197 |	I hope they say I'm not going to text back
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,791	| IOT197 |	PC but I hope to see more
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,327	| IOT197 |	Simple ways to
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,119	| IOT197 |	Share this data with
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| IOT197 |	Your health provider
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,935	| IOT197 |	I think that's going to take a little bit low
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,215	| IOT197 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,031	| IOT197 |	And I think I could stew actually the next thing
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,799	| IOT197 |	That I have on my list
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,079	| IOT197 |	Privacy
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:55,455	| IOT197 |	I think we're going to have to come up with ways to understand how the state is being used and
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,223	| IOT197 |	We're going to have to
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,991	| IOT197 |	To figure out
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| IOT197 |	How to protect
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,039	| IOT197 |	Consumers
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| IOT197 |	And how far we want to go
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,391	| IOT197 |	With like health insurance and pre-existing conditions
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,183	| IOT197 |	Because
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| IOT197 |	This is going to
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| IOT197 |	Exposed
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| IOT197 |	A whole new area
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,279	| IOT197 |	Risk
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,327	| IOT197 |	And that's scary for health
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,399	| IOT197 |	And I don't know how we're going to handle
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,983	| IOT197 |	That I mean if you can tell if someone's having Parkinson's symptoms
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,031	| IOT197 |	Super early this is not something that
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT197 |	Security camera
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| IOT197 |	Managed right
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,639	| IOT197 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,175	| IOT197 |	If you can detect it
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,687	| IOT197 |	Early
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,759	| IOT197 |	How does it affect rates coverage
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,319	| IOT197 |	Can you get coverage absolutely
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,367	| IOT197 |	I think this is more of a long-term
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,135	| IOT197 |	Problem
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,695	| IOT197 |	We're going to see those things
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,231	| IOT197 |	Start to happen
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,047	| IOT197 |	When we vote me out because we've started to see this already
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,839	| IOT197 |	In terms of with driving Percocet
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,375	| IOT197 |	Safe driver
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:45,887	| IOT197 |	Monitoring
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,935	| IOT197 |	Devices that you put in a car first
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:50,751	| IOT197 |	You can get ready to sit down or up
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,775	| IOT197 |	Based on how are you
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,567	| IOT197 |	Try for 60 days or 30 days
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| IOT197 |	But you're right
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,127	| IOT197 |	The reason I say it's a longer-term
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| IOT197 |	Being is because
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,431	| IOT197 |	You get into it
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,735	| IOT197 |	Policy now and governments and
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:03,551	| IOT197 |	The healthcare industry is so slow.
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:06,367	| IOT197 |	To change as are the laws that regulated
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,183	| IOT197 |	Where it is regulated so but you're right this is
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,207	| IOT197 |	Where we start to see
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,255	| IOT197 |	How that's going to shake out in the coming years
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:15,071	| IOT197 |	Yasso in John Hancock for example
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| IOT197 |	Bill has a
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,655	| IOT197 |	Insurance policy that requires you to have
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,679	| IOT197 |	Connect
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,447	| IOT197 |	Wearable device
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,727	| IOT197 |	Yes it is so
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,263	| IOT197 |	Not to
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,031	| IOT197 |	Crazy
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,055	| IOT197 |	Also the privacy
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,871	| IOT197 |	We're going to see some sort of Regulation I guarantee it
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,895	| IOT197 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| IOT197 |	Probably pretty crappy
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,711	| IOT197 |	Lot of negotiations back
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,759	| IOT197 |	Back and forth but I
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,319	| IOT197 |	In 2019 we're going to get our version of
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,367	| IOT197 |	PR
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:38,879	| IOT197 |	Close enough
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,159	| IOT197 |	I passed like a
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,207	| IOT197 |	Or maybe
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,535	| IOT197 |	Let's just not even talk about that
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,327	| IOT197 |	Okay other two big things
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,399	| IOT197 |	One is mvnos for iot
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| IOT197 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,191	| IOT197 |	I think
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,727	| IOT197 |	There's a whole effort
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| IOT197 |	Taking place
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,799	| IOT197 |	With the platform companies like
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,871	| IOT197 |	Like a lion particle and those guys are introducing
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| IOT197 |	Cellular
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:05,759	| IOT197 |	Platform cellular services for iot device makers in their acting
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,039	| IOT197 |	Kind of is an mvno
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,063	| IOT197 |	You're seeing them
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| IOT197 |	Bucket a lot of options for
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,135	| IOT197 |	Carrier so
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| IOT197 |	You don't have to do that yourself as
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,207	| IOT197 |	As a client
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:16,511	| IOT197 |	I think we're going to see an advancement on that
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,303	| IOT197 |	From other new entrance
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,375	| IOT197 |	Set the market like twilio there's some interesting things happen
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,679	| IOT197 |	And you're up here so I think we're going to see
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,959	| IOT197 |	Canada Slayer
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,495	| IOT197 |	This abstraction layer on
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,007	| IOT197 |	On top
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:30,591	| IOT197 |	Cellular connectivity the basically
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,615	| IOT197 |	Allows
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,431	| IOT197 |	People to connect your devices without having to
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:34,943	| IOT197 |	Negotiate
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,223	| IOT197 |	The carriers
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,247	| IOT197 |	And that'll be
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:37,759	| IOT197 |	Worthwhile
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:41,599	| IOT197 |	I agreement already seen twilio for example start to do this
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,647	| IOT197 |	Put a data SIM cards at
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,415	| IOT197 |	You can use
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,439	| IOT197 |	Variety device
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,463	| IOT197 |	Testing and so on
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,999	| IOT197 |	This is definitely
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:48,767	| IOT197 |	A shift from
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,839	| IOT197 |	What mvnos have done in the past which is offered
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,935	| IOT197 |	Were you would they would bundle up maybe text
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,983	| IOT197 |	Talk voice and
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,263	| IOT197 |	Data from
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,823	| IOT197 |	Bigger carriers Envy cell and smaller chunks
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,359	| IOT197 |	Fourier
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,151	| IOT197 |	Cell phone plan for disabled
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:08,735	| IOT197 |	This is more I think you're towards industrial towards device makers
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,015	| IOT197 |	And so forth so
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,783	| IOT197 |	I would think
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:13,599	| IOT197 |	But that service would come with some devices and fat
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,671	| IOT197 |	I don't know if you probably pay a monthly subscription but
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| IOT197 |	Yeah maybe they you don't have to provision
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:22,559	| IOT197 |	And some companies are basically saying hey
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,839	| IOT197 |	What connect your device
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,655	| IOT197 |	As long as it doesn't do more than this if this many mags
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,167	| IOT197 |	Data
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:28,959	| IOT197 |	And this is the
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| IOT197 |	And then they just
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| IOT197 |	That allows come
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,055	| IOT197 |	To say all right
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,335	| IOT197 |	We're going to charge you this
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:34,847	| IOT197 |	And we
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,383	| IOT197 |	Got to stay the same
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:39,455	| IOT197 |	So that'll be good and then there's also things like satellite
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,551	| IOT197 |	I think we'll hear a lot about in 2019
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,111	| IOT197 |	I'm curious how far will get into Act
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:46,879	| IOT197 |	Well Services
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,695	| IOT197 |	But they're definitely launching satellites and hoping to
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,231	| IOT197 |	Provide some sort of iot
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,255	| IOT197 |	Key service I just don't think
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,791	| IOT197 |	But I still question was busy
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,839	| IOT197 |	So
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,911	| IOT197 |	Just for me power consumption from a demand from
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,423	| IOT197 |	Armacost
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,215	| IOT197 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,775	| IOT197 |	Well and then and I'm going to say and you're going to
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:04,543	| IOT197 |	Cringe
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| IOT197 |	I got a mansion 5G cuz
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:11,711	| IOT197 |	If the big HuHot the end of 2018 with the first devices and hot spots and so on and so forth
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,503	| IOT197 |	And how it's going to change the out to world
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,551	| IOT197 |	No I don't think so in 29th
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,159	| IOT197 |	The world is not
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:21,695	| IOT197 |	It'll get gradually
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:26,047	| IOT197 |	All right and then my final prediction which will be really interesting
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| IOT197 |	I think or in this is
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:31,935	| IOT197 |	But I think we're going to see a lot happening with voice program
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:37,311	| IOT197 |	Not necessarily for consumers although we seen that actually in the smart home but I think we're going to start seeing it
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,615	| IOT197 |	In like Amazon's AWS
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,199	| IOT197 |	I think you're going to start to be able to ask things of
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:45,503	| IOT197 |	Mattamy or maybe even Cortana
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:50,879	| IOT197 |	And you ask the assistant in the assistant will give you information about like your cloud
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,647	| IOT197 |	Settings
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,415	| IOT197 |	What not
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,439	| IOT197 |	And that's going to be
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:53,951	| IOT197 |	Really
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,999	| IOT197 |	Fun interesting
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| IOT197 |	We'll see
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:00,095	| IOT197 |	It's interesting to me a minute and just from a programming standpoint
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,655	| IOT197 |	Can you interface a voice interface for
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,447	| IOT197 |	Making things happen better not
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,239	| IOT197 |	Let's say
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| IOT197 |	Static information
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| IOT197 |	Is there any interest
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:11,871	| IOT197 |	Probably not for like your typical consumer but
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,919	| IOT197 |	Ouija collector stuff
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,479	| IOT197 |	Yeah well and I think consumers like it too cuz it makes me
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:21,599	| IOT197 |	Easier in so I'm interested like how is the syntax going to develop how do we actually implement this
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,135	| IOT197 |	Will there be a standard
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,231	| IOT197 |	Yes yes yes
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,535	| IOT197 |	Those are interesting I have a
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:35,935	| IOT197 |	Couple that I'll run through pretty quickly things that we may hear see etcetera at Cas and maybe some
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,727	| IOT197 |	Hopes and expectations for the year in the
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,287	| IOT197 |	I have to mention like we do every year
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:44,895	| IOT197 |	Siri and homekit because maybe 2019 will be the year for these
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,663	| IOT197 |	Do you think
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,711	| IOT197 |	No I don't think so
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:54,111	| IOT197 |	Mention something just before the show and then neglected to put in the show notes but one of the Google headhunter
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,159	| IOT197 |	Just went over to Apple to work on
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,439	| IOT197 |	Voice interface AI
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,487	| IOT197 |	Yes yes John giannandrea
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,047	| IOT197 |	He actually had gone over there while back
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,095	| IOT197 |	I think he joined Apple
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,887	| IOT197 |	It was in April
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:09,983	| IOT197 |	A 2018 he went there from Google but now he's been promoted to their executive
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,287	| IOT197 |	So I think Apple's getting
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,055	| IOT197 |	Serious
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:13,823	| IOT197 |	About
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,335	| IOT197 |	Siri
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,431	| IOT197 |	Yeah well I have to say 2018 was a bust
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| IOT197 |	On that front for them
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,295	| IOT197 |	Because couple reasons I think most of them are obvious
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:28,671	| IOT197 |	And there's one that's maybe not so obviously wouldn't think it is the speakers and digital citizen cider
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,719	| IOT197 |	Proceeding aren't is the smartest ones
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| IOT197 |	Are the most widely available
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,535	| IOT197 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,815	| IOT197 |	Not everyone has
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,863	| IOT197 |	And iOS device for a homepod which
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,167	| IOT197 |	Really I mean I spell for a year now folks
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| IOT197 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,775	| IOT197 |	Yeah that's almost say about that
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,335	| IOT197 |	Something started do I start to see in
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:49,407	| IOT197 |	2018 actually has been happening long as I suspect
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,431	| IOT197 |	I'm kind of
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,711	| IOT197 |	I don't say worried
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:56,319	| IOT197 |	About to be in Z-Wave but I'm seeing less of a place for them in this
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,879	| IOT197 |	Cloud connected API Centric
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,671	| IOT197 |	World of the Smart Hub
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,487	| IOT197 |	And it's funny because somebody just asked me the other day
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,279	| IOT197 |	I think I'm going to get the new
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,815	| IOT197 |	Echo hub
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,631	| IOT197 |	It has that extra radio and like what are you going to use it with
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,911	| IOT197 |	It'll do you have something to eat
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,447	| IOT197 |	ESAT radio
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,727	| IOT197 |	You like will know what do you use
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,495	| IOT197 |	For unlike
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,031	| IOT197 |	Yxz1000r
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,079	| IOT197 |	Sensors and things that are low power but
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| IOT197 |	You don't have those no plan add those
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| IOT197 |	Why are you buying the subpoena
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,199	| IOT197 |	You think I'm crazy on that
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,991	| IOT197 |	No no I have been
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,015	| IOT197 |	I've been thinking this
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:29,599	| IOT197 |	4 years right and it's still I mean Vivian Z-Wave silky
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:32,415	| IOT197 |	Trucking along but I do think they're going to find themselves
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| IOT197 |	As mortgage
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,719	| IOT197 |	Especially
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,255	| IOT197 |	Especially is Bluetooth
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:36,767	| IOT197 |	Izhmash kit
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| IOT197 |	Yep better
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:43,167	| IOT197 |	And integrated and more sensors cuz that's where you see zigbee and Z-Wave is in
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,447	| IOT197 |	Lights and sensors
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:46,239	| IOT197 |	Because you need low power in
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:46,751	| IOT197 |	Wifikill
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| IOT197 |	So
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:53,151	| IOT197 |	Yeah I know some people would be happy to hear that and hopefully I'm wrong
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,943	| IOT197 |	Maestro's people that's on my side
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:58,271	| IOT197 |	This year ended with an interesting twist
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,319	| IOT197 |	On the smart home user interface
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,599	| IOT197 |	It's not just voicemail
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,391	| IOT197 |	We're really getting more into
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,927	| IOT197 |	Displays and I suspect
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,487	| IOT197 |	In 2019 will Seymour home dashboards
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:11,583	| IOT197 |	It may not just be like a smart displays from Google or the
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,119	| IOT197 |	Echo shows and so on
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:15,423	| IOT197 |	More integration with TVs and other display
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| IOT197 |	Will Ferrell
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| IOT197 |	Yeah and I think
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,007	| IOT197 |	Contacts
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,031	| IOT197 |	Just going to really
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,567	| IOT197 |	You know we've talked about this for like
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| IOT197 |	Using context is going to be the key to make
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| IOT197 |	That work
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,943	| IOT197 |	Feel almost match
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,503	| IOT197 |	Ability to say oh this is the
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,015	| IOT197 |	Kind of contents
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,367	| IOT197 |	And that I should leads to another
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,695	| IOT197 |	Thought I have and I've been single for a couple years now.
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,999	| IOT197 |	The smart ones we have are actually not that smart
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:44,351	| IOT197 |	They just respond to things when we tell them to respond the things that respond to her voice with
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:46,143	| IOT197 |	Somewhat canned responses in
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,447	| IOT197 |	Skills and so on and so forth and actions
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,239	| IOT197 |	Yes you can set up routines and
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,775	| IOT197 |	Things like that I get that but
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,311	| IOT197 |	Where's the machine learning
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,103	| IOT197 |	Where is the Smart Hub getting
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:58,431	| IOT197 |	Smarter where maybe it notices a trend or pattern
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:00,479	| IOT197 |	Like you come home every day between 5 and 5
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,783	| IOT197 |	15 Saudi really need to have a
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:05,855	| IOT197 |	Smart light routine that turns the outside lights on at 5
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,647	| IOT197 |	No you know maybe you don't
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,183	| IOT197 |	You don't need to manually do that at
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,207	| IOT197 |	I can start doing things
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:13,791	| IOT197 |	Right now the smart home doesn't do much on its own
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,071	| IOT197 |	So I think
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:18,143	| IOT197 |	And hope that we'll see more in the AI and ml area
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:18,911	| IOT197 |	Here
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,447	| IOT197 |	And then laugh
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,983	| IOT197 |	Will two things
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:27,359	| IOT197 |	Smart speaker overload I'm already sick of it I have more smart speakers than I have room to put them in that
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| IOT197 |	Could lead towards
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,175	| IOT197 |	Other devices
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| IOT197 |	Mobile devices robots and sex
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:33,247	| IOT197 |	But have a speaker
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:36,063	| IOT197 |	And a microphone so we can get rid of all of these speakers
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,623	| IOT197 |	Don't know we want microphones everywhere speakers
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,903	| IOT197 |	Microphones
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,719	| IOT197 |	I don't think we need that and I'm not lying
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,743	| IOT197 |	Sorry
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:50,911	| IOT197 |	Okay I'm going to trust me I'm going to I'm going to be all over that robot section c you looking for this
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:54,239	| IOT197 |	You know I may come short but if not I'm going to say huh
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,055	| IOT197 |	Last week
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,847	| IOT197 |	Something that we talked about our last show
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,175	| IOT197 |	I don't think a lot of these smart home device makers were really
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,199	| IOT197 |	Prepare for the fast
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,479	| IOT197 |	I'll take a mesh Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,271	| IOT197 |	So I really think this year
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,295	| IOT197 |	Newer products
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:10,111	| IOT197 |	Are just going to work with mesh WiFi and the reason is
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,391	| IOT197 |	Allow these devices have
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:15,231	| IOT197 |	Less capable Wi-Fi chips maybe only 2.4 gigahertz support
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:18,559	| IOT197 |	And so on and then you have dedicated network name and
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,095	| IOT197 |	On that channel or on that
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,143	| IOT197 |	How that would match so
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,423	| IOT197 |	I really think
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,959	| IOT197 |	That problem starts going away in
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,007	| IOT197 |	I hope
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:27,519	| IOT197 |	So
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:28,543	| IOT197 |	B2
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,591	| IOT197 |	Me too
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,151	| IOT197 |	All right
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,175	| IOT197 |	And I also
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:38,015	| IOT197 |	We're probably going to see I mean we've already seen this year I don't think
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:43,135	| IOT197 |	Less consolidation now I think we've established that Google home
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,159	| IOT197 |	And Amazon
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,439	| IOT197 |	Anime
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,999	| IOT197 |	I pretty much the King of the Hill when it comes to the
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,023	| IOT197 |	The kings of hell
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,559	| IOT197 |	When it comes to the consumer
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| IOT197 |	King and queen
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,655	| IOT197 |	My
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:57,727	| IOT197 |	Yeah alright you could send you could have changed the voices
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:02,335	| IOT197 |	I was thinking of Google is but he and Madame a is but she I don't know why
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:02,847	| IOT197 |	We should not
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:09,503	| IOT197 |	It's hard to do when you have a robot though they can actually speak to one of these
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,295	| IOT197 |	Delta Fire
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,575	| IOT197 |	IRobot
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,623	| IOT197 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,647	| IOT197 |	But
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,696	| IOT197 |	You don't Bixby
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,720	| IOT197 |	Cortana
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| IOT197 |	Who else is up
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,256	| IOT197 |	Siri
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| IOT197 |	So
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,560	| IOT197 |	Who is our best and smartest
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:27,168	| IOT197 |	Smart speaker and we actually talked about this the newsletter. Last
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:27,936	| IOT197 |	Because we didn't have one last
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,216	| IOT197 |	But the way
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,008	| IOT197 |	Prior adventurous today
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,312	| IOT197 |	What color did i q test for
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:33,824	| IOT197 |	Smart speakers
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,616	| IOT197 |	And they discovered that
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:38,688	| IOT197 |	They tested both understanding of the inquiry
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,712	| IOT197 |	And then the ability to act
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,504	| IOT197 |	And Google
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,272	| IOT197 |	One out
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,832	| IOT197 |	Lake in a major way but
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,624	| IOT197 |	Where that bad I was actually pretty impressed
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,160	| IOT197 |	No no
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,928	| IOT197 |	I mean
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:54,560	| IOT197 |	When it comes to understanding the queries all of them at 99% or better which is good and just to be clear
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:57,120	| IOT197 |	The same questions were asked of each of these
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:59,168	| IOT197 |	General assistance
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,984	| IOT197 |	Hundred question so I think that's a pretty reasonable
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:04,288	| IOT197 |	Sample size actually unimpressive they did this
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:08,128	| IOT197 |	When it comes to answering correctly that tells you a lot
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:10,944	| IOT197 |	About who is truly smart and who is not in the
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:14,272	| IOT197 |	Space Google Assistant led the way with eighty seven point nine percent
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:14,784	| IOT197 |	Incorrectly
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,856	| IOT197 |	Siri was actually second at 74.6
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,624	| IOT197 |	1%
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| IOT197 |	Surprise me
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:24,256	| IOT197 |	And then Madame a 72 and 1/2 in Cortana unfortunately 63.4%
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,304	| IOT197 |	Questions were answered correctly
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,328	| IOT197 |	But this leads
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,656	| IOT197 |	2y the big two are the big two in general
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,192	| IOT197 |	They have the biggest knowledge
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,216	| IOT197 |	Crafts I think
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,240	| IOT197 |	And they are against
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| IOT197 |	Sinner lyrics
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,848	| IOT197 |	The most widely available to capture data as well so
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,176	| IOT197 |	Bixby is not even part of the conversation here
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:48,064	| IOT197 |	Will Bixby has been out on phones for well over
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,576	| IOT197 |	2 years
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:53,440	| IOT197 |	On a Samsung phone again you're limited just like Siri or limit iOS
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,232	| IOT197 |	So that's a problem for Samsung
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:59,328	| IOT197 |	Additionally they don't have a search engine of their own they have a browser
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,096	| IOT197 |	On
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| IOT197 |	Samsung devices but I don't
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,656	| IOT197 |	Tingting capture
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,960	| IOT197 |	Nearly as much data as anybody else
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,752	| IOT197 |	Honestly they have new
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,568	| IOT197 |	I'm going to say this is both a new business being in the space
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:14,944	| IOT197 |	They just don't inspect and in fact that Samsung Galaxy home speaker that looks like
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:17,248	| IOT197 |	Fondue pot
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,528	| IOT197 |	Coming soon I said
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:22,112	| IOT197 |	Which presently was before the end of the year I'm pretty sure they said before the end of the year
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:26,464	| IOT197 |	It is not available for sale yet and it is now 2019
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,000	| IOT197 |	A top of that
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| IOT197 |	This is very telling to me
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:31,072	| IOT197 |	It was reported just
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:31,840	| IOT197 |	Last week
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:34,144	| IOT197 |	Apparently
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:38,240	| IOT197 |	Samsung may be partnering with Google to add Google Assistant to its
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,520	| IOT197 |	Smart TVs
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,056	| IOT197 |	Instead of or I guess
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,104	| IOT197 |	Alongside of Bixby
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,872	| IOT197 |	That's
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,408	| IOT197 |	Waving the white flag with right there
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,200	| IOT197 |	Yes
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,480	| IOT197 |	That is
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,016	| IOT197 |	But I mean it's kind of necessary
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,040	| IOT197 |	Yukata
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,344	| IOT197 |	If necessary if your
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:55,136	| IOT197 |	Google assistant is junk yes
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:57,952	| IOT197 |	I mean I know I sound cranky about this but I sat
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,232	| IOT197 |	Through a 90 minutes
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,768	| IOT197 |	Samsung CES press event
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,840	| IOT197 |	Last year and it was all SmartThings
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,864	| IOT197 |	It was all
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,376	| IOT197 |	Bixby
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,424	| IOT197 |	Higher primate
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,704	| IOT197 |	Lifeline ovens
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,216	| IOT197 |	Bridges
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,032	| IOT197 |	Sode and 28
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,056	| IOT197 |	18 did
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:17,920	| IOT197 |	Switch from the original SmartThings to the new integrated SmartThings that can talk to lots of
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,456	| IOT197 |	Samsung
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,272	| IOT197 |	You're so they did in a great and that's
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:27,136	| IOT197 |	If you think about it they had special apps for the refrigerator special apps for their
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,952	| IOT197 |	Televisions and they brought it all under the smart
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,256	| IOT197 |	Plan was bring it all into SmartThings
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,536	| IOT197 |	In that app
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:34,816	| IOT197 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,840	| IOT197 |	Everything is very yet
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:36,864	| IOT197 |	But a lot of it is
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:41,472	| IOT197 |	Well I haven't looked at the app in a while several months I should say and
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:45,056	| IOT197 |	Just transitioning from the SmartThings classic app to the new one was
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,568	| IOT197 |	Horrendous
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,360	| IOT197 |	Horrendous user experience
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,408	| IOT197 |	And if you look at the reviews of those apps
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:53,760	| IOT197 |	A lot of people are not happy we're not happy at the time with the new app
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:57,088	| IOT197 |	So it's probably worth a revisit I'm going to wait until
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,624	| IOT197 |	The dog and pony show at CES
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,416	| IOT197 |	And then I will take another look at it
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| IOT197 |	Take a gander
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,512	| IOT197 |	Yes I have been playing I played with SmartThings
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,024	| IOT197 |	Just a month.
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,560	| IOT197 |	It was
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,352	| IOT197 |	The transition was horrendous
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,120	| IOT197 |	Yes you're right
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,632	| IOT197 |	Things
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:16,032	| IOT197 |	Still work as anticipated I don't have any smart Samsung appliances so I couldn't bring anything
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:20,640	| IOT197 |	I just don't have anything that I could have brought over and I was going to buy a new washer and dryer or anything crazy
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,968	| IOT197 |	So it's a little hard for me
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,248	| IOT197 |	How to test exactly
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,040	| IOT197 |	What it's like to break in the news
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,856	| IOT197 |	But the old stuff they smoothed it out
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,880	| IOT197 |	So it works
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,392	| IOT197 |	For the most
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,696	| IOT197 |	Right and I'm not
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:39,072	| IOT197 |	I want it kind of exclude like a SmartThings ecosystem and the Hub and products because
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:39,840	| IOT197 |	It's really good
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,936	| IOT197 |	It's not bad it's the whole Bixby thing that aspect of it
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:46,240	| IOT197 |	Has rubbed me the wrong way since they launched it
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,056	| IOT197 |	And all of my experience with it as backup my
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,616	| IOT197 |	You know I guess you could say preconception
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:54,432	| IOT197 |	Which maybe isn't fair but still it just isn't
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:26:00,832	| IOT197 |	It's good they cannot yet compete I don't see how they can compete again they don't have the back end of information
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,624	| IOT197 |	Google or an Amazon have
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,160	| IOT197 |	Okay well
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,184	| IOT197 |	That was a lot of cranky
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,232	| IOT197 |	Kevin we don't see a little cranky Kevin
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,792	| IOT197 |	I had to get it all out
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:12,096	| IOT197 |	I'll be good for the rest of the year I promise
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,376	| IOT197 |	Senior and Kevin
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:16,704	| IOT197 |	Okay well let's blow through some news.
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,240	| IOT197 |	Real fast
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,776	| IOT197 |	So we got a test
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,312	| IOT197 |	Or drone deliveries
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,384	| IOT197 |	And oh people love the fact that they can get their stuff in
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,664	| IOT197 |	A few hours
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,224	| IOT197 |	And other people who are not getting their stuff
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| IOT197 |	Few hours hate
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,016	| IOT197 |	The fact that drones are noisy
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:34,112	| IOT197 |	Yeah the funny thing is this is happening now in Australia
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| IOT197 |	These are up past
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,184	| IOT197 |	Program from wings
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:39,488	| IOT197 |	Which is a subsidiary of alphabet
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:45,888	| IOT197 |	And I've had drugs before and one of the things is yeah they can be a little noisy but I think the bigger issue and some people are
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:46,912	| IOT197 |	Complaining about it
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,448	| IOT197 |	The ultrasonic frequencies
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,240	| IOT197 |	From a drone motor
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:50,752	| IOT197 |	Tribes
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,288	| IOT197 |	McCann Drive
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,056	| IOT197 |	Pets
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,568	| IOT197 |	Crazy
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,360	| IOT197 |	Scares the bejesus out of
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,688	| IOT197 |	My dog for example I actually got rid of my drone because
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:02,016	| IOT197 |	At the dog I couldn't hear what he was hearing but boy he did not like it
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,040	| IOT197 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| IOT197 |	We also have
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,880	| IOT197 |	Research for the University of Singapore on
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,160	| IOT197 |	Power saving
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,696	| IOT197 |	Powri
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| IOT197 |	How would you describe
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:17,376	| IOT197 |	I would say that this is a addition to sensor technology that could
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:20,192	| IOT197 |	Allow the sensor to wake up when it's needed
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:23,008	| IOT197 |	Basically cut the power consumption down
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,800	| IOT197 |	Apparently by at least
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,824	| IOT197 |	1000 time
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,616	| IOT197 |	Down to the Pika watt range
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,640	| IOT197 |	And that's because
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:35,040	| IOT197 |	You don't in certain use cases need a sensor on all the time it doesn't need to be drawing power from its battery
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,064	| IOT197 |	Turn electricity Etc
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:41,184	| IOT197 |	You just need it when it's needed and I know that's hard to predict so I don't know how this is going to be
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:41,952	| IOT197 |	Implemented
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,000	| IOT197 |	But the technology seems to be promising
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,304	| IOT197 |	Thanks for that if we can figure out the right algorithm
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,120	| IOT197 |	Sensors will be using nearly as much
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,632	| IOT197 |	Battery power
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,680	| IOT197 |	Always
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,448	| IOT197 |	Always
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,216	| IOT197 |	It's a good thing
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,008	| IOT197 |	We got some new samsara
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:55,776	| IOT197 |	Which
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:28:00,640	| IOT197 |	They launched a while back they've been an iot platform they were going to be very generic
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,688	| IOT197 |	And then they really honed in on
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,200	| IOT197 |	Honda vehicles
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,480	| IOT197 |	They have raised
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,016	| IOT197 |	A hundred million dollars
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:09,088	| IOT197 |	At a 3.6 billion dollar valuation
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,880	| IOT197 |	This is mostly for fleet manager
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,696	| IOT197 |	And cars and trucks and
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,000	| IOT197 |	It makes a lot of sense the guys who found a Sims
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| IOT197 |	Sorrow with the founders
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:20,096	| IOT197 |	Meraki in the idea that they had there was
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,376	| IOT197 |	You basically
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,680	| IOT197 |	Wife I was getting really complicated as people
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,984	| IOT197 |	Brought more devices into an Enterprise
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:26,752	| IOT197 |	Corporate Network
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,032	| IOT197 |	MBA Rocky they built
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT197 |	Special
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,568	| IOT197 |	Router Xanax
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,128	| IOT197 |	Plus software that made that a lot
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:35,200	| IOT197 |	That's kind of the idea with samsara
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:38,016	| IOT197 |	Oh my gosh will bring you all these connected
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:40,832	| IOT197 |	Sensors on board and we need both a new
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,368	| IOT197 |	Radio technology in
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,392	| IOT197 |	Software to manage the
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,976	| IOT197 |	Ended up going with was saying okay
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,000	| IOT197 |	That's too big that's
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:48,768	| IOT197 |	Debride
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,304	| IOT197 |	We're just going to do this for
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:50,816	| IOT197 |	Fleet manager
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,096	| IOT197 |	So
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,376	| IOT197 |	This is a good thing it's
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,936	| IOT197 |	Glad to hear it I have been cut
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:00,800	| IOT197 |	I have worried about them but there's a lot of iot platforms out there that are not going to make it so I'm glad to see
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:04,384	| IOT197 |	These guys well-funded and apparently doing really well in their selected
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:08,480	| IOT197 |	They aren't they are very well-funded because this
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:11,296	| IOT197 |	Raises their total funding UPS 230 million
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:16,160	| IOT197 |	And the company says they haven't even used any other previous round of funding
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,976	| IOT197 |	So I don't know what kind of plans they have it must be big
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,512	| IOT197 |	Yeah it a lot of
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,304	| IOT197 |	Companies are anticipating a
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,840	| IOT197 |	A big Market turn down
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,120	| IOT197 |	2019
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,656	| IOT197 |	So it's probably wise up
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,960	| IOT197 |	Get the money while you can
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,032	| IOT197 |	Especially in an area like iot platforms
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:36,896	| IOT197 |	Okay and another news Google they got FCC approval at the
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,432	| IOT197 |	Fairy end-of-the-year witch
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:40,480	| IOT197 |	Good actually cuz the FCC is going
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,528	| IOT197 |	Part of the government shutdown
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:44,320	| IOT197 |	They got RCC approval for
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,880	| IOT197 |	A project soli which uses
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,648	| IOT197 |	Radar
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,672	| IOT197 |	Is a 60 gigahertz
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:53,536	| IOT197 |	To detect your gestures so the idea that used it
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,584	| IOT197 |	QQ sisters tag gestures
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,352	| IOT197 |	On fabric
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,656	| IOT197 |	Skin on whatever
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:01,984	| IOT197 |	You want and you can use it to control screen
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,032	| IOT197 |	This was actually launched at
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,056	| IOT197 |	Same time project
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,080	| IOT197 |	Card was
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:08,384	| IOT197 |	Wei Wei Wei back in like
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,664	| IOT197 |	The 2015
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,736	| IOT197 |	I think so I think so at the Levi's jacket
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,528	| IOT197 |	Yeah and so
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:17,856	| IOT197 |	So we haven't gone places and one of the reasons is
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:20,416	| IOT197 |	That they couldn't get it at a high enough power
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,720	| IOT197 |	Experimental license
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,256	| IOT197 |	Search for the SEC to play with this
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,024	| IOT197 |	But they couldn't get
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,072	| IOT197 |	Enough power to get accuracy
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,096	| IOT197 |	The Chester
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,376	| IOT197 |	So this
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,400	| IOT197 |	Latest
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,192	| IOT197 |	Approval gives them
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:32,960	| IOT197 |	Basically
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT197 |	Moore DDS
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:39,616	| IOT197 |	It lets them transmit at a higher power so hopefully that will improve the resolution
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,128	| IOT197 |	Of
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,408	| IOT197 |	The gesture
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:41,920	| IOT197 |	Understand
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,712	| IOT197 |	That's being nice
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,760	| IOT197 |	I can see the
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:46,528	| IOT197 |	Immediate use
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,552	| IOT197 |	For people who have
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,856	| IOT197 |	In fact in the news release dimensions
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:53,440	| IOT197 |	This could benefit users with Mobility or speech impairment cuz
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:56,256	| IOT197 |	Can you speak to the great you are but not everybody can use it
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,280	| IOT197 |	So I get that
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,328	| IOT197 |	I wonder if it has to be
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:01,632	| IOT197 |	Combined with something physical like a
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,168	| IOT197 |	Jacquard project
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,704	| IOT197 |	Jacquard jacket for example
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,984	| IOT197 |	I'm thinking not
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:10,336	| IOT197 |	I'm thinking because it's right are you could literally have a virtual on off switch
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:13,152	| IOT197 |	Ukraine yes mr. fingers in the air and
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:16,480	| IOT197 |	Something turn on in your house for example so it's in a sentence
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:20,832	| IOT197 |	Like voice as always said as the invisible interface innocent This truly is
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,112	| IOT197 |	Invisible interface
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,136	| IOT197 |	Yes and
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,952	| IOT197 |	Right now they're using 60 gigahertz in a couple
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:31,584	| IOT197 |	I think last month I wrote about likewise 60 gigahertz was so interesting for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:34,656	| IOT197 |	And I talked about like fall detection and some of the other
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| IOT197 |	Cool things
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,704	| IOT197 |	The companies are doing with this
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,984	| IOT197 |	Can somebody actually pointed out
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,776	| IOT197 |	Comments that project soli
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,544	| IOT197 |	Uses it
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| IOT197 |	As well so you're right
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:45,408	| IOT197 |	And it's a very prescient statement this could be like the other invisible
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,480	| IOT197 |	All right and now
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,016	| IOT197 |	It is time for our
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,808	| IOT197 |	Iot podcast
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,344	| IOT197 |	Hotline before we get to
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:57,440	| IOT197 |	This week's question I have to fix an answer
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,976	| IOT197 |	From last week's episode
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,000	| IOT197 |	Our answer was
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,536	| IOT197 |	Drawing a chest
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,072	| IOT197 |	It was like the wrong way
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,864	| IOT197 |	And I apologize
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,888	| IOT197 |	Price for that you guys I
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,680	| IOT197 |	I don't know why my brain decides to
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,496	| IOT197 |	Things to post difficult way except it's
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:14,080	| IOT197 |	It's on me to both of us neglected to recognize the native
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:17,152	| IOT197 |	Madam a says function that's in the matinee app
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,688	| IOT197 |	I will defend myself
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,968	| IOT197 |	Anime app
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,480	| IOT197 |	Experience is
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:23,040	| IOT197 |	Horrible trap rap
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,832	| IOT197 |	Mine even the guy who I
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:27,904	| IOT197 |	I hired someone from Amazon to come and play with matinee at my house
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,696	| IOT197 |	Probably a couple months ago
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,280	| IOT197 |	Wow you're a prime so slow it's
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:35,328	| IOT197 |	Terrible and I was like I know
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,096	| IOT197 |	But
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| IOT197 |	The question was
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:40,704	| IOT197 |	Basically how can I have an audible notification that
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:42,752	| IOT197 |	Like my door is open or a sensor status is
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,544	| IOT197 |	And the answer
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:45,824	| IOT197 |	Is
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:49,152	| IOT197 |	You can use a routine so a lot of people are using
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,664	| IOT197 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,200	| IOT197 |	For like
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:54,784	| IOT197 |	Their sensor management cuz Madame a does not handle a lot of sensor
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,320	| IOT197 |	But you
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:58,880	| IOT197 |	Basically use SmartThings for
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,160	| IOT197 |	This sensor has
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,184	| IOT197 |	Change state
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:03,232	| IOT197 |	Right so you put that in there
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:03,744	| IOT197 |	As part of your route
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,024	| IOT197 |	When this happens
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:06,560	| IOT197 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,584	| IOT197 |	That's your trigger event
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,400	| IOT197 |	SmartThings motion sensor triggered
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,168	| IOT197 |	Then do this
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,728	| IOT197 |	And then do this you just go to
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,776	| IOT197 |	It's called I'm going to say it you guys
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,312	| IOT197 |	Cover her ears
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,336	| IOT197 |	Alexa says
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,896	| IOT197 |	So you so like that and then you say
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,432	| IOT197 |	What does she say so you can write down
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:23,456	| IOT197 |	The door is open
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,016	| IOT197 |	I saw a dog whatever you want
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,320	| IOT197 |	How to say and you can set the volume
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,600	| IOT197 |	End
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,368	| IOT197 |	That's how this works
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,416	| IOT197 |	And it actually is easy yes
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:35,488	| IOT197 |	Samantha River before
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:37,280	| IOT197 |	Like notifications we hated it
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,328	| IOT197 |	We thought it was clunky as all get-out
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:42,144	| IOT197 |	And realize there are some pre-canned
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:44,960	| IOT197 |	The responses in there you have to use the custom command if you want
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:47,776	| IOT197 |	Something like he knows the back door it's open
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:52,640	| IOT197 |	This light was left on for more than 15 minutes excetera this is a great feature yes we missed it
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:56,480	| IOT197 |	It gets back to my smart home really isn't that smart
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,784	| IOT197 |	Thinking out this stuff chew just happened in a sense
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,320	| IOT197 |	LOD irritating
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,112	| IOT197 |	Felix shut up

EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:28,992	| IOT197 |	All right

EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,200	| IOT197 |	My questions really about
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:31,712	| IOT197 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,528	| IOT197 |	We have the ring doorbell
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,552	| IOT197 |	And now as a
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,088	| IOT197 |	Scarcity
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,184	| IOT197 |	Everything else in the house
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| IOT197 |	Is Google Assistant
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,256	| IOT197 |	Parts for the iPhone but that's
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:48,864	| IOT197 |	Question is my going to have to
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:50,912	| IOT197 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:01,664	| IOT197 |	At work
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,456	| IOT197 |	To actually be able to do things like
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,248	| IOT197 |	Go in the back door
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,392	| IOT197 |	Podcast
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:16,000	| IOT197 |	Kevin this is such an important topic that I asked
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,024	| IOT197 |	She was going to write a post about it be
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,560	| IOT197 |	I'm so frustrated
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,864	| IOT197 |	The short answer is you
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,656	| IOT197 |	Can't connect your ring doorbell
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:23,936	| IOT197 |	To your Google
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,592	| IOT197 |	But you can't do what you probably most want to do
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,616	| IOT197 |	Which is C
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,128	| IOT197 |	Who's at the door
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:33,664	| IOT197 |	Right now
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,432	| IOT197 |	Google
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,712	| IOT197 |	Support
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,736	| IOT197 |	The ability to
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,272	| IOT197 |	Take a video doorbell in
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,296	| IOT197 |	Connected to
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,576	| IOT197 |	What your Google home device
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,624	| IOT197 |	And even Google displays
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,904	| IOT197 |	And Google Chromecast
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,696	| IOT197 |	But ring
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:47,232	| IOT197 |	Does not allow for
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,792	| IOT197 |	So and I don't know if that's because
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,584	| IOT197 |	Has Google and ring are talking
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:55,680	| IOT197 |	Or what the deal is but ring right now in ring actually for a while did not come
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:58,240	| IOT197 |	But the Amazon stuff easily as well so it may be a
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,544	| IOT197 |	But ring will let you
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:04,128	| IOT197 |	Talk to your ring doorbell through Google home you can ask it about
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:04,896	| IOT197 |	When your doorbell
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,664	| IOT197 |	A string
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,944	| IOT197 |	You can ask it starting to
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,712	| IOT197 |	Recording
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:09,760	| IOT197 |	Ask it to turn on motion alerts
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,296	| IOT197 |	But you can't see who's at your door
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:12,832	| IOT197 |	Right
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,112	| IOT197 |	And I suspect
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:17,184	| IOT197 |	It's less about Ring not talking to Google then it is about
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:21,280	| IOT197 |	Amazon not wanting to talk to Google about this since Amazon bought ring last year
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:24,864	| IOT197 |	So yes the short answer is you can connect it
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:27,168	| IOT197 |	The longer answer is you can connect it and get
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,704	| IOT197 |	Some basic information
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,240	| IOT197 |	Probably not the visual and
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:30,752	| IOT197 |	Information your look
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,544	| IOT197 |	Dissolution
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,080	| IOT197 |	I hate to say it you guys
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,104	| IOT197 |	Is Topeka Niko
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,664	| IOT197 |	Google home
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:39,200	| IOT197 |	If you're going to be on Google home
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:41,760	| IOT197 |	The Nest hello doorbell which is an awesome door
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,808	| IOT197 |	Both the ring and the nest
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:44,832	| IOT197 |	Storehouse RS
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,392	| IOT197 |	Excellent I think the nest is actually a better doorbell because
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,952	| IOT197 |	It's a little bit faster in the
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,488	| IOT197 |	Facial recognition on it is
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,512	| IOT197 |	Phenomenal
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,048	| IOT197 |	So I'm actually
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:57,888	| IOT197 |	You're looking for the best video doorbell and that's your focus I say go with the nest hello
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:00,192	| IOT197 |	Which means you'd be a Google Echo
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:00,960	| IOT197 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,288	| IOT197 |	And so if you're in the Google ecosystem already
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:05,824	| IOT197 |	Take back your ring man
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,896	| IOT197 |	Captain's get the nest hello
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,944	| IOT197 |	It's going to do everything you want
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,552	| IOT197 |	Are the echo ecosystem
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,368	| IOT197 |	Yeah don't get a nest
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,136	| IOT197 |	Because
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,416	| IOT197 |	Google is not going to
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,696	| IOT197 |	It goes so far and I don't
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,232	| IOT197 |	Time soon
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,000	| IOT197 |	Will give
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:24,768	| IOT197 |	The video app
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,536	| IOT197 |	AP Iced Out
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,304	| IOT197 |	So
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,328	| IOT197 |	Then you want to be in the ring
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:29,632	| IOT197 |	Which is a really good doorbell in
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:33,216	| IOT197 |	They have to be getting closer on the better
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:33,984	| IOT197 |	Facial
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,008	| IOT197 |	Recognition and understand
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:36,800	| IOT197 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:41,152	| IOT197 |	I mean it's just disappointing though that you have to pick an ecosystem for
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,432	| IOT197 |	Akira lock your
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,200	| IOT197 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:45,504	| IOT197 |	I would say
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:47,552	| IOT197 |	It's really only for those.
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,856	| IOT197 |	Like video cameras
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,160	| IOT197 |	If you want to see it on your home display
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,672	| IOT197 |	And your door
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:57,024	| IOT197 |	Like sensors you can pull in through a variety of platforms
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:58,816	| IOT197 |	Even Arlo if you want to
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,584	| IOT197 |	You know maybe
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,376	| IOT197 |	I want to get the video doorbell just
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,656	| IOT197 |	Popping Arlo out there and
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,960	| IOT197 |	Then you can do a lot of things
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:05,728	| IOT197 |	I don't know
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,496	| IOT197 |	It's not everything
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,008	| IOT197 |	It's just those thing
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:08,800	| IOT197 |	Store
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:12,384	| IOT197 |	And at the shame that all while it could be an alarm system
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,944	| IOT197 |	To but the shame of it all is
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:17,504	| IOT197 |	We should have seen this coming because
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:21,344	| IOT197 |	Google Nest came from Google and then went back in to Google
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,624	| IOT197 |	Spun out
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,928	| IOT197 |	Alphabet and then went back to Google and then
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:28,768	| IOT197 |	As we said Amazon bought ring that's when you start seeing the sideways go up
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,048	| IOT197 |	And that's that's the disappointing
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:32,864	| IOT197 |	So yes we are in Silo territory
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,912	| IOT197 |	Kevin I'm sorry to tell you this
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,960	| IOT197 |	That is our advice on this
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:37,472	| IOT197 |	And
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,032	| IOT197 |	Guys if you have a question for us
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:40,544	| IOT197 |	Please

EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:48,224	| IOT197 |	The answer may not always be what you want to hear
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,344	| IOT197 |	It would guarantee an answer we just can't guarantee one that you like
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:55,392	| IOT197 |	All right
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:57,696	| IOT197 |	Well that concludes this portion of the show
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:03,328	| IOT197 |	And stay tuned for Scott MacDonald of mcrock capital who is going to be talking about
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,352	| IOT197 |	The big shift

EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,664	| IOT197 |	After a message for this week sponsor
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:25,088	| IOT197 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:28,928	| IOT197 |	Sweet sponsor is digicert and I have Mike Nelson who is VP
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,720	| IOT197 |	Of iot security at
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,280	| IOT197 |	Can you remind our listeners
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,560	| IOT197 |	What it is that digicert
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,376	| IOT197 |	Dad the desert is the world's
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,400	| IOT197 |	Leading provider of
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:43,264	| IOT197 |	Scalable Security Solutions for identity and encryption and we provide these Solutions
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,544	| IOT197 |	Search for web servers
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:47,360	| IOT197 |	Enterprise security and my favorite
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,640	| IOT197 |	Of course iot
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,432	| IOT197 |	Mike we learned a lot about the survey.
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:55,552	| IOT197 |	Theraclear benefits to organizations prioritizing and implementing iot
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,320	| IOT197 |	Security
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:58,368	| IOT197 |	Can you tell us about some of the ways that the
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:03,232	| IOT197 |	Successful organizations are benefiting to a handful of group
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:07,072	| IOT197 |	They were talk to your organization's that demonstrated a Mastery of iotc
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:13,472	| IOT197 |	Security middle-tier and then the bottom tier of courts are organizations that really struggling to master coyotes
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:16,800	| IOT197 |	Security and the difference between the top and the bottom tier
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,824	| IOT197 |	Was shocking
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:21,664	| IOT197 |	Every one of the bottom chair organizations have experienced a security mishap
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,456	| IOT197 |	Things like denial
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:27,296	| IOT197 |	Service or malware compared to just 32%
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,320	| IOT197 |	Of the top-tier
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:31,904	| IOT197 |	The bottom tier was much more likely to have reported problems
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,928	| IOT197 |	In those areas
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,696	| IOT197 |	They were
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:36,512	| IOT197 |	Nearly six times as likely to experience
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| IOT197 |	Data breaches
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,352	| IOT197 |	And unauthorized access to iot devices
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:44,960	| IOT197 |	Compared to the top care and spell the survey for my perspective it really highlights that
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:47,776	| IOT197 |	The things of the top-tier organizations are doing
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:51,360	| IOT197 |	Priority security are working and in protecting their organizations
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:55,711	| IOT197 |	So where should organizations start when building an iot security strategy
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:42:02,623	| IOT197 |	My recommendation for organizations is there looking to stand up and iot security practices first of all to make
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:03,903	| IOT197 |	Make sure that they build
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:06,207	| IOT197 |	Security into the DNA of the way there
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:12,607	| IOT197 |	Developing their products and that would mean everything from making sure that they think about cyber security in the architecture in the design
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:15,423	| IOT197 |	Testing for cyber security man in the
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:18,751	| IOT197 |	Employment making sure that you're doing the things that are continually
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,799	| IOT197 |	And keep your devices secure
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:26,431	| IOT197 |	So we asked to talk to your organization's the things that they were doing that were leading them to be successful without you
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,967	| IOT197 |	Security and they gave us five
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,503	| IOT197 |	Sphinx the first was
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,527	| IOT197 |	Scalability
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:36,927	| IOT197 |	Of their solution to making sure that the scale of the solution they put in place will just meet their needs for today
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:41,023	| IOT197 |	But also five years down the road making sure that they're doing Integrity check
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:43,583	| IOT197 |	On any package that's being sent to the device
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:47,679	| IOT197 |	Doing authentication on all connections coming to and from the device
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:52,543	| IOT197 |	To make sure no unauthenticated connection or person can get into the device
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:55,103	| IOT197 |	Reviewing and Performing risk assessment
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:59,967	| IOT197 |	Is always important to understand the vulnerabilities of the device and then finally and of course
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:01,759	| IOT197 |	Encryption of sensitive data
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:05,855	| IOT197 |	And making sure that you're encrypting data both at rest and also in transit
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:07,903	| IOT197 |	Thanks bike that's excellent advice
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:11,487	| IOT197 |	So where can people go to learn more about the survey and Digicel
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:16,863	| IOT197 |	Yeah the full details of the survey can be found on our website at digicert. Com

EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:54,751	| IOT197 |	Partially because you have a great theory that I think it's going to set us up nicely for a big trend
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:56,031	| IOT197 |	In 2009
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:58,847	| IOT197 |	18 and also because your firm invests
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,407	| IOT197 |	Heavily in industrial iot
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,967	| IOT197 |	Let's just get this started
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:07,807	| IOT197 |	Talk to us a little bit about what you've been investing in in the last
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,319	| IOT197 |	Few years
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,855	| IOT197 |	And what you think is
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:10,879	| IOT197 |	Is going to change
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:11,391	| IOT197 |	In the coming year
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,439	| IOT197 |	Well I'm excited to be on
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:17,535	| IOT197 |	Thank you for having me and what weight on my shoulders
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,303	| IOT197 |	Takeoff
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:21,631	| IOT197 |	2019 talking about all things iot
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,679	| IOT197 |	You're right mcrock capital has
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:27,519	| IOT197 |	Exclusively on the industrial side of the IRT
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,543	| IOT197 |	The past 7 years
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:32,639	| IOT197 |	Was raised in 15
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:36,991	| IOT197 |	70 million-dollar spoke exclusively on the industrial side of the iot
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:37,759	| IOT197 |	2 back then
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:39,807	| IOT197 |	What we really were looking at
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:43,135	| IOT197 |	Was the collection of data
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,159	| IOT197 |	Machines
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:49,023	| IOT197 |	And the conductivity of that data so I have an analogy that I use
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:50,815	| IOT197 |	That the coyote
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:53,119	| IOT197 |	Can be the body and the Brain
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,655	| IOT197 |	Are there two different portions
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,447	| IOT197 |	As we evolve through the iot
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,263	| IOT197 |	And the last five years has been about
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:04,639	| IOT197 |	Data from equipment machines and sensors and connecting it and in some ways
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:05,663	| IOT197 |	Cleansing data
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:07,967	| IOT197 |	But it really has been a data play
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:08,735	| IOT197 |	Setopati
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:11,551	| IOT197 |	And in the next 5 years were singing
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:12,575	| IOT197 |	Just now
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:18,207	| IOT197 |	To the real disruptor side of iot which is the analytics I now that we have all this
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:18,975	| IOT197 |	Is dark data
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:22,303	| IOT197 |	Start to do things with it using machine learning and AI
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:24,095	| IOT197 |	General Analytics
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,119	| IOT197 |	It's going to drive
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:28,447	| IOT197 |	Huge disruption in Big Industry and it's going to drive
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:30,239	| IOT197 |	Productivity
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:33,567	| IOT197 |	Okay and you just use the phrase dark data
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,079	| IOT197 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:36,127	| IOT197 |	The dark data is
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,151	| IOT197 |	Unintelligent
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:37,919	| IOT197 |	It's just
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:39,199	| IOT197 |	Tech data
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:42,015	| IOT197 |	Is a building block of some value creation
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,575	| IOT197 |	But until you do something with the data and
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:45,343	| IOT197 |	Recognize
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:46,879	| IOT197 |	Patterns are deaf.
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:48,671	| IOT197 |	So what
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,231	| IOT197 |	Which is dark data
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:56,095	| IOT197 |	State of it's not doing anything it doesn't have any meaning to it that's where analytics comes into play
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:57,119	| IOT197 |	We've been hearing a lot of
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:59,167	| IOT197 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:00,191	| IOT197 |	But we're starting
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:03,775	| IOT197 |	Really see a lot of connection technology
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:04,287	| IOT197 |	Become intelligent
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,567	| IOT197 |	So that's me
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:06,847	| IOT197 |	Take that dark data
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,127	| IOT197 |	You apply Analytics
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:09,407	| IOT197 |	And now
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:13,759	| IOT197 |	You know but she was are not only being able to send their actually becoming aware
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:15,295	| IOT197 |	They're starting to
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,599	| IOT197 |	Make predictions are starting to act
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:20,671	| IOT197 |	So it's one thing to have a recognition of what
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,975	| IOT197 |	Call it
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:25,279	| IOT197 |	Current state
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:26,815	| IOT197 |	Telling people they suck
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:30,655	| IOT197 |	So you think about a machine that's running
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,935	| IOT197 |	It's not optimized
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:35,775	| IOT197 |	It's not doing a very good job it's that your production line is not very efficient
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:36,799	| IOT197 |	Is there a y
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:43,711	| IOT197 |	What you really need to do is now take corrective action and automate the whole process not swear this
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:45,759	| IOT197 |	Play
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,783	| IOT197 |	So we go from
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:47,551	| IOT197 |	Learning
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:52,927	| IOT197 |	From the data from the machines what's actually happening as they talks to us then we need
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:54,975	| IOT197 |	Better way to operate them through AI
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,511	| IOT197 |	Now the finals
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:47:00,607	| IOT197 |	Feedback loop is when software also then take the autocorrect option
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:05,471	| IOT197 |	And changes the way that they're behaving in this is not using the word machine
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:08,287	| IOT197 |	Traffic light so that you can have it
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,567	| IOT197 |	Control in a city
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:11,615	| IOT197 |	And start to figure out how many
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:13,407	| IOT197 |	Cars are at an intersection
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:15,711	| IOT197 |	2 * 2
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,991	| IOT197 |	In real time
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,759	| IOT197 |	Traffic lights
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:19,039	| IOT197 |	I like that
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:21,599	| IOT197 |	There's no Roi in telling someone that they say
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,391	| IOT197 |	I like that a lot
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:26,719	| IOT197 |	So if we go by the story which I think is totally accurate
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:28,511	| IOT197 |	Which must be why I had
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:29,279	| IOT197 |	You come on that show
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:31,839	| IOT197 |	The last five years have been about hooking up
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:34,399	| IOT197 |	Machines getting the data
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:34,911	| IOT197 |	Getting the body
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:35,935	| IOT197 |	Of the iot
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,983	| IOT197 |	And then the AIS pek
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:40,287	| IOT197 |	Back to being the brain and then starting to do something
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:43,871	| IOT197 |	What that what if in the last 5 years you've been reading about the
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:46,687	| IOT197 |	Maybe we should try that
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:49,503	| IOT197 |	Kind of dipping your toe in the water but you're not there yet
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:52,319	| IOT197 |	Are these companies that have not built out the body yet are they behind
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:53,855	| IOT197 |	Skylark
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:55,647	| IOT197 |	Companies that build up the body
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:57,183	| IOT197 |	You know we speak a lot
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:59,743	| IOT197 |	Large corporations that say things like
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:00,767	| IOT197 |	We want
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:05,119	| IOT197 |	Cuz they have the angle they know what they want cuz there's r a y
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:07,167	| IOT197 |	So they go to the
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:08,447	| IOT197 |	Thing that they need
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:10,239	| IOT197 |	What they don't have is
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,519	| IOT197 |	Everything
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:12,287	| IOT197 |	Equipment
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,055	| IOT197 |	Connected
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:14,335	| IOT197 |	Whether it's wired on
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:17,151	| IOT197 |	Leflore weather it's wireless
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:17,919	| IOT197 |	Pieces of equipment
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:19,199	| IOT197 |	We've been monitoring
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,735	| IOT197 |	Will high levels
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:25,087	| IOT197 |	Statistics try to map out where we are in the evolution of the eye
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:29,695	| IOT197 |	For the first time have dropped below 100% kegger so
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,743	| IOT197 |	This year they were about 91:4
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:33,791	| IOT197 |	Sam Insidious years they were
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:35,327	| IOT197 |	Hop in the hundred and thirty
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:37,119	| IOT197 |	Percent growth rate now
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:39,679	| IOT197 |	Other areas like monthly Revenue
EDL	00:48:39,679	00:48:44,031	| IOT197 |	As it relates to machine machine is still in the early days and it's
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:45,311	| IOT197 |	Just starting to grow
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:47,359	| IOT197 |	Is that monthly revenue for providing cut
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:48,127	| IOT197 |	Activity
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:48,895	| IOT197 |	To these machines
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:50,687	| IOT197 |	It's hard
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,967	| IOT197 |	Coppell glass
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:56,319	| IOT197 |	Be careful with that one because it is hard to tell whether it's just connectivity or that serve
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:59,135	| IOT197 |	But it is M2M Market Revenue
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:03,743	| IOT197 |	Is got 12% kegger and you know we're still at planet in the
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:05,535	| IOT197 |	300 billion range
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:08,351	| IOT197 |	Which is again I suspect probably has
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:11,935	| IOT197 |	Large number already
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:16,031	| IOT197 |	Your question around where are companies
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:18,079	| IOT197 |	That may not be
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:20,383	| IOT197 |	Including instrumented and sensor Dell
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:21,663	| IOT197 |	I think they're not
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:22,943	| IOT197 |	Far behind
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:25,247	| IOT197 |	Because of technology and Innovation now
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:26,015	| IOT197 |	Shekinah
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:32,415	| IOT197 |	Walk-in different ways to access machine data and a lot of equipment is being built with sensor
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:34,463	| IOT197 |	It just wasn't used for different
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:37,535	| IOT197 |	Again I go back to my turn
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:39,839	| IOT197 |	This there it's sitting there it's sort of
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:40,351	| IOT197 |	Trout
EDL	00:49:41,631	00:49:42,399	| IOT197 |	And now
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:43,423	| IOT197 |	Dilaudid
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:45,215	| IOT197 |	Spiders that are helping me
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:46,239	| IOT197 |	Operations
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:47,007	| IOT197 |	Connect
EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:48,799	| IOT197 |	An access. Data
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:50,591	| IOT197 |	So you could catch up really quick
EDL	00:49:50,591	00:49:51,871	| IOT197 |	I don't think anyone is
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:53,407	| IOT197 |	Materially behind the best
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:57,759	| IOT197 |	If I'm thinking about making Investments
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:49:59,295	| IOT197 |	And I'm looking at
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:01,599	| IOT197 |	Getting to the dark date or even maybe
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:02,367	| IOT197 |	Doing something
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:05,439	| IOT197 |	Is it too late for me to invest in those
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:08,767	| IOT197 |	Company should I be starting up an analytics company this pointer
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:11,071	| IOT197 |	A data cleansing company where should I be sinking
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:13,375	| IOT197 |	If I'm doing something
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:14,143	| IOT197 |	Now
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:20,287	| IOT197 |	Going forward and looking into the future and that's sort of our prediction that are from
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:24,127	| IOT197 |	Seeing a lot of Hardware a lot of what we would call the body type in Destiny
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:27,199	| IOT197 |	We dabbled into the brain side into
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:27,967	| IOT197 |	Analytics
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:31,807	| IOT197 |	With a company called noodle in Montreal
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:36,671	| IOT197 |	We were waiting for a lot of people to
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:39,231	| IOT197 |	Septic systems up and running before they were ready
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:41,791	| IOT197 |	Sirius Analytics
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,327	| IOT197 |	They had to get the body though
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:44,607	| IOT197 |	Looking forward
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:47,423	| IOT197 |	You're crashing but we're looking for in the future
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:50,239	| IOT197 |	I think we really looking at the analytics I
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:52,031	| IOT197 |	Looking at companies that actually can
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:54,079	| IOT197 |	A call that dating now in a lot of these companies
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:55,871	| IOT197 |	Will be at your place awkward
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:58,175	| IOT197 |	Some will still have a hard-working
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:02,271	| IOT197 |	And there's also another area that I kind of put
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:04,575	| IOT197 |	Andaman with analytics which is
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:05,599	| IOT197 |	Cyber security
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:07,391	| IOT197 |	And that's a whole nother area but
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:08,415	| IOT197 |	Need that is
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:10,207	| IOT197 |	Analogy body in the brain
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:11,743	| IOT197 |	Cyber security
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:13,023	| IOT197 |	Analytics
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,047	| IOT197 |	Are the brain
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:18,655	| IOT197 |	And they are becoming more and more important as one cementation
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:20,191	| IOT197 |	Elmer conductivity
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:23,007	| IOT197 |	Got it and let's take him to some of this
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:27,871	| IOT197 |	So what's important if you're going to be the analytics or the brain side
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:29,151	| IOT197 |	Let's break this down a little bit
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:30,687	| IOT197 |	Got to have
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,711	| IOT197 |	I talked to
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:33,503	| IOT197 |	Dozens of companies each week that
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:37,855	| IOT197 |	If they're like we're doing AI for iot your AI for business transformation
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:39,903	| IOT197 |	What do they do
EDL	00:51:40,415	00:51:41,183	| IOT197 |	Be able to
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:43,743	| IOT197 |	Tudo how much room is in there for a variety of different
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:46,559	| IOT197 |	Well
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:48,095	| IOT197 |	If I broke down the Analytics
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:49,631	| IOT197 |	Landscape
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:54,495	| IOT197 |	There are number of companies that are doing well almost call Professional Services
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:55,263	| IOT197 |	So
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:56,287	| IOT197 |	They have hired
EDL	00:51:56,287	00:51:58,335	| IOT197 |	Very intelligent data scientist
EDL	00:51:58,847	00:52:00,895	| IOT197 |	And they work with corporations
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:01,663	| IOT197 |	2
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:03,199	| IOT197 |	Analyze data sets
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:03,967	| IOT197 |	To try to
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:10,367	| IOT197 |	Understand what the angle of the customer to say why do you want a eye what are you trying to accomplish
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:14,207	| IOT197 |	And there's a few different reactions in the biggest ones come to
EDL	00:52:14,207	00:52:15,231	| IOT197 |	Well we think there's
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:19,327	| IOT197 |	Value Adder productivity gains that can be hot if we analyze how our operation
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:26,751	| IOT197 |	The other one is usually around people and how people interface and maybe customizing the way someone engages effect now
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:28,543	| IOT197 |	Ecology on a personal level
EDL	00:52:28,543	00:52:31,871	| IOT197 |	It's a different people at different angles for Yai
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:33,663	| IOT197 |	But when you look back at the pipes
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:34,431	| IOT197 |	Companies there are
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:35,967	| IOT197 |	You have a
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:37,247	| IOT197 |	Handful
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:40,575	| IOT197 |	Of Technology businesses that are developing software
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:41,599	| IOT197 |	Not very many
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:45,183	| IOT197 |	Which are almost plug-and-play like jamming to dataset in
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:48,767	| IOT197 |	And it's going to go look for pattern recognition and it's going to start to discover things
EDL	00:52:49,791	00:52:52,351	| IOT197 |	There are other companies that have
EDL	00:52:52,351	00:52:54,911	| IOT197 |	Really sophisticated teams of smart people
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:56,191	| IOT197 |	Where they are at
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:59,007	| IOT197 |	Assisting in the learning of the AI
EDL	00:52:59,007	00:53:00,031	| IOT197 |	Solar still
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:06,431	| IOT197 |	Humans are still handling the data and the touch is still higher than everyone believes marketing wise you wouldn't know that but
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:07,455	| IOT197 |	Experian
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:08,991	| IOT197 |	And says it's very
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:10,271	| IOT197 |	Hand holding
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:11,551	| IOT197 |	AI data analytics
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:12,575	| IOT197 |	So we're getting there
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:13,855	| IOT197 |	Denver RC
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:16,671	| IOT197 |	True revolutionary
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:21,279	| IOT197 |	The Shelf software technologies that are designed for here let me give you a real example
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:22,303	| IOT197 |	Something around
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:23,583	| IOT197 |	A specific type of
EDL	00:53:23,583	00:53:26,911	| IOT197 |	And so it will have an agent machine learning agent
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:30,751	| IOT197 |	It starts to recognize certain situations and correlate
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:31,519	| IOT197 |	Failure
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:35,359	| IOT197 |	I'm a piece of equipment based on things like temperature vibration
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:37,663	| IOT197 |	The different sensor readings
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:39,199	| IOT197 |	And it will start to map
EDL	00:53:39,199	00:53:40,735	| IOT197 |	Predictions on
EDL	00:53:40,735	00:53:41,759	| IOT197 |	Tell your time
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:45,855	| IOT197 |	Weather 7 Days 15 days 30 days and it's a
EDL	00:53:45,855	00:53:47,647	| IOT197 |	Self-learning algorithm
EDL	00:53:47,647	00:53:49,183	| IOT197 |	So and it's run on
EDL	00:53:49,183	00:53:50,975	| IOT197 |	Bunch of different machines
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:52,511	| IOT197 |	Across the world
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,279	| IOT197 |	Pacific time
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:56,095	| IOT197 |	And every time there's a new state that identify
EDL	00:53:56,863	00:53:58,911	| IOT197 |	Turtle runs parallel experiment
EDL	00:53:58,911	00:54:02,239	| IOT197 |	To see if it's just a new statement the new operating State that's fine
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:05,567	| IOT197 |	Or if it's actually a failure mode and indication of failure mode
EDL	00:54:05,567	00:54:06,335	| IOT197 |	And so
EDL	00:54:06,335	00:54:07,871	| IOT197 |	That truly is
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:10,175	| IOT197 |	Predictive Analytics cuz you're actually running
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:13,247	| IOT197 |	Algorithm that constantly learning
EDL	00:54:13,247	00:54:15,551	| IOT197 |	About every different type of sensor
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:17,599	| IOT197 |	Be back and then trying to the
EDL	00:54:17,599	00:54:19,647	| IOT197 |	Text when there's an anomaly
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:20,415	| IOT197 |	That actually
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:21,951	| IOT197 |	Can lead to failure and then
EDL	00:54:21,951	00:54:23,999	| IOT197 |	True experience of data
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:26,303	| IOT197 |	Figure out if it's 5 days or if its 50 days
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:28,351	| IOT197 |	And then she can start to take real action
EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:29,631	| IOT197 |	Got it
EDL	00:54:29,631	00:54:30,399	| IOT197 |	Okay
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:31,935	| IOT197 |	That does sound actually really cool
EDL	00:54:32,447	00:54:34,239	| IOT197 |	So now let's turn to Cyrus
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:35,007	| IOT197 |	Security
EDL	00:54:35,007	00:54:35,775	| IOT197 |	It's kind of the same Quest
EDL	00:54:36,287	00:54:40,383	| IOT197 |	Which is when we're thinking about industrial iot or just
EDL	00:54:40,383	00:54:41,663	| IOT197 |	Iot in general
EDL	00:54:41,663	00:54:44,735	| IOT197 |	Cybersecurity is a huge field what are the types of
EDL	00:54:45,247	00:54:48,063	| IOT197 |	Solutions that we really need what is different
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:48,831	| IOT197 |	About Cyprus
EDL	00:54:48,831	00:54:51,647	| IOT197 |	Security for industrial iot that we should be thick
EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:52,159	| IOT197 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:54,975	| IOT197 |	Well the one area that I'm really excited
EDL	00:54:54,975	00:54:58,559	| IOT197 |	2019 S10
EDL	00:54:59,071	00:55:01,631	| IOT197 |	That anytime a device connect
EDL	00:55:01,631	00:55:02,143	| IOT197 |	Turn Network
EDL	00:55:02,655	00:55:09,055	| IOT197 |	And you see the devices we see that are vulnerable the ones that are outside the firewall of Noah traditional
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:10,079	| IOT197 |	Security system
EDL	00:55:10,079	00:55:11,871	| IOT197 |	Inside of a cyber kind
EDL	00:55:12,383	00:55:14,687	| IOT197 |	Security perimeter
EDL	00:55:14,687	00:55:15,967	| IOT197 |	To the network wireless
EDL	00:55:15,967	00:55:17,503	| IOT197 |	Whatever way that wireless
EDL	00:55:17,503	00:55:20,831	| IOT197 |	I know everyone thinks wife I usually when we say Wireless
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:21,855	| IOT197 |	There are different types
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:24,927	| IOT197 |	Analogies in the Spectrum
EDL	00:55:24,927	00:55:29,023	| IOT197 |	Just like a new open window any device connected the new open window
EDL	00:55:29,023	00:55:32,095	| IOT197 |	That hackers can get into and call around and what we
EDL	00:55:32,095	00:55:33,887	| IOT197 |	Seen so far in the last couple years
EDL	00:55:34,399	00:55:36,703	| IOT197 |	Is that the weaponizing devices
EDL	00:55:36,703	00:55:40,031	| IOT197 |	Just anything from routers the back of police cars 2
EDL	00:55:40,031	00:55:41,311	| IOT197 |	Smart TV
EDL	00:55:41,311	00:55:42,591	| IOT197 |	Those can be used
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:46,175	| IOT197 |	Kind of tax where they just tryna
EDL	00:55:46,175	00:55:47,199	| IOT197 |	You just trying to
EDL	00:55:47,711	00:55:48,991	| IOT197 |	Clogged
EDL	00:55:48,991	00:55:50,783	| IOT197 |	The internet and take down certain
EDL	00:55:51,807	00:55:57,183	| IOT197 |	So they're trying to be clever and sneaky that way in there as I call it weaponizing iot device
EDL	00:55:57,695	00:56:00,255	| IOT197 |	But it's not really trying to hack the device
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:02,559	| IOT197 |	So now we're starting to see more
EDL	00:56:02,559	00:56:03,327	| IOT197 |	Pacific
EDL	00:56:03,327	00:56:04,095	| IOT197 |	Cases
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:05,631	| IOT197 |	I guess attacks
EDL	00:56:05,631	00:56:07,935	| IOT197 |	That are much more professionally done
EDL	00:56:07,935	00:56:08,959	| IOT197 |	And there
EDL	00:56:08,959	00:56:10,751	| IOT197 |	Dedicated and targeted
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:12,287	| IOT197 |	So they know what the device is
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:14,591	| IOT197 |	Listening to be really simple like
EDL	00:56:14,591	00:56:18,175	| IOT197 |	Taking over the screens inside a airport
EDL	00:56:18,175	00:56:20,735	| IOT197 |	Taking it down and then holding them for ransom to say
EDL	00:56:20,735	00:56:25,599	| IOT197 |	No one knows what gates are going to Orlando flights are leaving our departing in a large Airport
EDL	00:56:25,599	00:56:26,367	| IOT197 |	Because
EDL	00:56:26,367	00:56:28,927	| IOT197 |	We basically take control of all that displays
EDL	00:56:28,927	00:56:30,463	| IOT197 |	And again Wireless
EDL	00:56:30,463	00:56:32,255	| IOT197 |	Tends to be the area of vulnerability
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:33,279	| IOT197 |	The word
EDL	00:56:33,791	00:56:35,327	| IOT197 |	Wishing very little
EDL	00:56:35,327	00:56:37,631	| IOT197 |	Quickest way most companies don't even
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:40,191	| IOT197 |	Have an idea of what the wireless
EDL	00:56:40,191	00:56:43,263	| IOT197 |	The structure that they're running the networks have no idea
EDL	00:56:43,263	00:56:48,895	| IOT197 |	What devices are connected to the network and it's pretty interesting when you start to have technology
EDL	00:56:48,895	00:56:53,503	| IOT197 |	But then looks at the types of devices that are connecting people surprise
EDL	00:56:53,503	00:56:55,039	| IOT197 |	It's just even in the audit
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:57,855	| IOT197 |	Of what they even have a wireless perspective
EDL	00:56:57,855	00:57:00,671	| IOT197 |	Even companies that don't think they have much find out
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:03,743	| IOT197 |	That people run spy cameras that there are
EDL	00:57:03,743	00:57:06,303	| IOT197 |	Drones in the vicinity that hook up to their Network
EDL	00:57:06,303	00:57:08,607	| IOT197 |	We had CEOs that have found that
EDL	00:57:08,607	00:57:09,631	| IOT197 |	You know when they're
EDL	00:57:09,631	00:57:14,239	| IOT197 |	Automatically hooking up to their you know they think they're hooking up to a Cellular Tower
EDL	00:57:14,239	00:57:15,007	| IOT197 |	From there
EDL	00:57:15,007	00:57:15,775	| IOT197 |	Cell phone
EDL	00:57:15,775	00:57:18,591	| IOT197 |	Someone can actually replicate that cell tower
EDL	00:57:19,103	00:57:21,663	| IOT197 |	In a device in a car parked out Sun
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:23,455	| IOT197 |	Update seniors home
EDL	00:57:23,455	00:57:26,783	| IOT197 |	And now you're going to start to put data directly where you don't think you're putting it
EDL	00:57:27,295	00:57:29,087	| IOT197 |	The whole idea round Wireless
EDL	00:57:29,599	00:57:31,135	| IOT197 |	Cybersaint
EDL	00:57:32,159	00:57:35,743	| IOT197 |	All these different devices that are connecting it's just fascinating
EDL	00:57:35,743	00:57:36,511	| IOT197 |	And something that
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:37,535	| IOT197 |	To be done
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:40,863	| IOT197 |	A lot of the companies
EDL	00:57:41,887	00:57:43,423	| IOT197 |	Putting Warren Moore
EDL	00:57:43,423	00:57:45,983	| IOT197 |	Wirelessly connected devices into the universe
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:53,663	| IOT197 |	Will probably making our last investment in someone
EDL	00:57:53,663	00:57:54,943	| IOT197 |	In a wireless fabric
EDL	00:57:54,943	00:57:56,223	| IOT197 |	Good company for this day
EDL	00:57:56,735	00:57:59,551	| IOT197 |	Got it and you guys are raising fun too

EDL	00:58:02,623	00:58:03,647	| IOT197 |	And analytics Focus
EDL	00:58:03,647	00:58:04,415	| IOT197 |	Christian vestments correct
EDL	00:58:04,927	00:58:05,695	| IOT197 |	Exactly
EDL	00:58:05,695	00:58:08,511	| IOT197 |	In the new year will be finishing up the last
EDL	00:58:08,511	00:58:09,791	| IOT197 |	Investment fund 1
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:11,839	| IOT197 |	And will be launching the second
EDL	00:58:11,839	00:58:13,631	| IOT197 |	The same strategy
EDL	00:58:13,631	00:58:20,031	| IOT197 |	Sandusky industrial side of the it will be working with a number of corporate groups that are currently investor
EDL	00:58:20,031	00:58:21,823	| IOT197 |	Continue on with us
EDL	00:58:22,335	00:58:25,407	| IOT197 |	Our sun is largely made up by a dollar amount
EDL	00:58:25,407	00:58:27,455	| IOT197 |	Institutional Financial investors
EDL	00:58:27,455	00:58:30,271	| IOT197 |	We're looking for strong returns but we do have
EDL	00:58:30,271	00:58:36,671	| IOT197 |	Select group of very strategic limited partners
EDL	00:58:36,671	00:58:37,695	| IOT197 |	Cisco Systems
EDL	00:58:37,695	00:58:38,719	| IOT197 |	Caterpillar
EDL	00:58:38,719	00:58:41,791	| IOT197 |	And electricity de France which is the world's largest
EDL	00:58:41,791	00:58:42,303	| IOT197 |	Power utility
EDL	00:58:42,815	00:58:44,095	| IOT197 |	As we go into Fun
EDL	00:58:44,095	00:58:45,887	| IOT197 |	2 will decrease the size
EDL	00:58:45,887	00:58:46,911	| IOT197 |	Spike Lee
EDL	00:58:46,911	00:58:51,007	| IOT197 |	Up from 70 million and fun one to a hundred million and fun too
EDL	00:58:51,007	00:58:53,823	| IOT197 |	The focus will again start to
EDL	00:58:53,823	00:58:56,383	| IOT197 |	Shift a little bit as we see the IP of all things
EDL	00:58:56,383	00:58:59,455	| IOT197 |	I'm going to start to move into a little bit more of that
EDL	00:58:59,455	00:59:00,479	| IOT197 |	Blaine Anderson
EDL	00:59:00,479	00:59:02,527	| IOT197 |	We've been talking about where we have
EDL	00:59:02,527	00:59:05,599	| IOT197 |	Few more companies on the analytics side
EDL	00:59:05,599	00:59:07,391	| IOT197 |	We have been mapping a host
EDL	00:59:07,391	00:59:11,999	| IOT197 |	Cyber security companies that we also think are going to be urgently needed us
EDL	00:59:12,511	00:59:14,047	| IOT197 |	People develop a variety
EDL	00:59:14,047	00:59:15,583	| IOT197 |	She strategy and then
EDL	00:59:15,583	00:59:17,119	| IOT197 |	They start to realize they have
EDL	00:59:17,119	00:59:22,751	| IOT197 |	Have cyber resiliency baked in so that they make sure they're doing it safely and that they don't have embarrassing moments
EDL	00:59:22,751	00:59:25,055	| IOT197 |	What about things like Edge Computing this
EDL	00:59:25,055	00:59:25,823	| IOT197 |	Does people talk
EDL	00:59:25,823	00:59:26,591	| IOT197 |	So much about
EDL	00:59:27,103	00:59:31,199	| IOT197 |	Does that fit in with your current pieces or is that kind of a side project
EDL	00:59:31,199	00:59:31,967	| IOT197 |	Are you guys just aren't Focus
EDL	00:59:32,735	00:59:36,319	| IOT197 |	Stacy I mean clearly Cisco's very interested in
EDL	00:59:36,831	00:59:38,111	| IOT197 |	Anyone that makes a box
EDL	00:59:38,111	00:59:39,903	| IOT197 |	It's it's remotely somewhere
EDL	00:59:39,903	00:59:43,231	| IOT197 |	Wants to put computer power on and have it make decisions in
EDL	00:59:43,231	00:59:43,999	| IOT197 |	Crate
EDL	00:59:43,999	00:59:48,095	| IOT197 |	Increase Value Guide for it and I think there are applications that make total sense
EDL	00:59:48,095	00:59:49,375	| IOT197 |	Right where you don't want it
EDL	00:59:49,375	00:59:50,143	| IOT197 |	Descending
EDL	00:59:50,143	00:59:51,423	| IOT197 |	Tons and tons of data
EDL	00:59:51,935	00:59:53,727	| IOT197 |	Into the cloud when
EDL	00:59:53,727	00:59:55,007	| IOT197 |	There's not a lot of changes on
EDL	00:59:55,519	00:59:57,055	| IOT197 |	You know and so
EDL	00:59:57,055	00:59:58,847	| IOT197 |	You need the data but it doesn't itch
EDL	00:59:58,847	01:00:01,407	| IOT197 |	Is pretty static data now when it does change it
EDL	01:00:01,407	01:00:02,431	| IOT197 |	Usually catastrophic
EDL	01:00:02,431	01:00:03,199	| IOT197 |	Second Sole
EDL	01:00:03,199	01:00:05,503	| IOT197 |	You want to know about that so I think there are a lot of
EDL	01:00:05,503	01:00:08,319	| IOT197 |	Locations where you can have Edge compute
EDL	01:00:08,319	01:00:14,719	| IOT197 |	And devices will kind of do their own software analysis on the edge and if there is that where except
EDL	01:00:14,719	01:00:15,743	| IOT197 |	Russian. Ghost
EDL	01:00:15,743	01:00:16,767	| IOT197 |	The cloud or starts
EDL	01:00:16,767	01:00:18,303	| IOT197 |	To be alerted to people
EDL	01:00:18,303	01:00:21,631	| IOT197 |	Independently but yeah I know
EDL	01:00:21,631	01:00:23,423	| IOT197 |	I just think that use cases are very
EDL	01:00:23,423	01:00:24,959	| IOT197 |	Pacific Ranch Computing make sense
EDL	01:00:25,471	01:00:26,751	| IOT197 |	Got it all right
EDL	01:00:26,751	01:00:28,799	| IOT197 |	Will Scott thank you so much
EDL	01:00:28,799	01:00:32,639	| IOT197 |	For coming on the show today I feel much smarter already and very excited
EDL	01:00:32,639	01:00:33,407	| IOT197 |	About 2019
