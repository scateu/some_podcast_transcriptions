EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:20,800	| IOT229 |	Kevin
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,640	| IOT229 |	You know the last couple shows we've kicked off with the news that
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,152	| IOT229 |	Hey
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,736	| IOT229 |	Insert tech company here listen to your voice recording for
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:31,808	| IOT229 |	Quality assurance and has contractors paid to do that
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,112	| IOT229 |	And this week we find out that
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,160	| IOT229 |	Facebook
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| IOT229 |	Insert Facebook here
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,000	| IOT229 |	As we've been talking about it
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,816	| IOT229 |	The biggest she was leasing for going to contractors
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,120	| IOT229 |	And people are listening to things that P
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| IOT229 |	People thought only machines
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:50,496	| IOT229 |	I would say the other issue is that it's going to contractors and not him
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,800	| IOT229 |	Please because contractors have a little bit less
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,384	| IOT229 |	You know loyalty I would say to a
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:56,896	| IOT229 |	Company sold
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:00,224	| IOT229 |	They may sign an NDA but they may feel free to share the
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,016	| IOT229 |	Did you see pets with their friends wearing
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:05,088	| IOT229 |	Employee-employer relationship has
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| IOT229 |	Little bit more
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,136	| IOT229 |	Heft
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:07,904	| IOT229 |	2in lights
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:11,744	| IOT229 |	Right yeah this is found out by Bloomberg
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,792	| IOT229 |	According to
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:19,168	| IOT229 |	Them Facebook has told them that they actually stopped his practice about a week ago so
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:24,544	| IOT229 |	It's not that they're currently doing it none of the company's alright I believe doing it now that we talked about
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,592	| IOT229 |	Including Apple Google and Amazon
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:30,432	| IOT229 |	But yeah some contractors even named the
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,016	| IOT229 |	Company taskus was the name of the contractor
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,552	| IOT229 |	Some of those employees Hertz
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:39,648	| IOT229 |	Conversations and other things they probably shouldn't have heard and
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,720	| IOT229 |	Kind of spoke to Bloomberg anonymously on this
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,280	| IOT229 |	The issue is that that
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,840	| IOT229 |	It's gone cuz this isn't happening anymore
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:51,680	| IOT229 |	But it's nice to see that we saw these companies are updating their terms of service
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,984	| IOT229 |	To be explicit about
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:57,824	| IOT229 |	Transcription Services people could be listening and so on and
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,896	| IOT229 |	Facebook does not have that in their terms of service yet I don't believe it
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,944	| IOT229 |	Added it so I am not sure how they're going to handle
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,504	| IOT229 |	And I thought some companies
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,600	| IOT229 |	They would let you opt out but they were still sending a small amount
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| IOT229 |	If their work
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:10,880	| IOT229 |	Glad it's over.
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,208	| IOT229 |	I know Apple said they stopped
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,000	| IOT229 |	But I believe Google and Amazon stick
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,559	| IOT229 |	Google let's shoot
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:22,143	| IOT229 |	An Amazon Alexa to opt-out
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:25,727	| IOT229 |	Facebook doesn't let you opt out but they have apparently stopped
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:30,335	| IOT229 |	Is Facebook's case I think it's a little more specific because this all started when they
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,407	| IOT229 |	Adding voice transcription to Messenger
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,735	| IOT229 |	So you can have your voice chats transcribed and I
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:39,039	| IOT229 |	Where's the other companies were doing it too
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,087	| IOT229 |	Verify that
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,183	| IOT229 |	The Voice Services were working as expected so to speak
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,207	| IOT229 |	That is a live
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:50,815	| IOT229 |	But yeah I need anytime we're going to have a eye or
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,863	| IOT229 |	Any sort of computer
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,679	| IOT229 |	Do something for us there's going to be a human in the loop
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,959	| IOT229 |	Eventually to check
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,239	| IOT229 |	To make sure things are proceeding
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,263	| IOT229 |	You're supposed to
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,543	| IOT229 |	It's just basically
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:05,151	| IOT229 |	It's testing Avenue want to test that the system you design is working as intended
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,967	| IOT229 |	And it doesn't get weird
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| IOT229 |	Piss
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,551	| IOT229 |	The thing we know about any sort of a eyes
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,855	| IOT229 |	You know left to his own devices for long enough
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,367	| IOT229 |	Can't get weird
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| IOT229 |	CD tree
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,207	| IOT229 |	Well actually see our next topic
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,767	| IOT229 |	Excellent you're right
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,279	| IOT229 |	All right
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,863	| IOT229 |	Just keep going let's keep going
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:29,471	| IOT229 |	Scariest continues its Amazon rekognition this time which is
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:34,335	| IOT229 |	Amazon's face analysis system that we took
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:38,687	| IOT229 |	Police agencies have actually used the there's been a lot of
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:43,295	| IOT229 |	Debate over it because their facial recognition is not as accurate as
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,343	| IOT229 |	Definitely skewed
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:48,927	| IOT229 |	When their people colors that are being analyzed
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,951	| IOT229 |	It's not a
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,999	| IOT229 |	A great thing in my opinion
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,815	| IOT229 |	But they have
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,095	| IOT229 |	They added
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,655	| IOT229 |	A new emotion that Amazon rekognition can
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| IOT229 |	Detect
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,703	| IOT229 |	Beer
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,519	| IOT229 |	And that's real
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,823	| IOT229 |	They've already been able to
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:10,431	| IOT229 |	Look for happy sad angry surprised disgusted comment confused
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,991	| IOT229 |	We can prove that your emotions
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| IOT229 |	But now they've added
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| IOT229 |	Pierce
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:18,623	| IOT229 |	I just worry when a system can do this hoot how it will be used
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| IOT229 |	I guess against us
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:21,695	| IOT229 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,487	| IOT229 |	Or even just to manipulate us
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| IOT229 |	I mean it doesn't have to be
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,071	| IOT229 |	Malicious it could just be
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,167	| IOT229 |	Just to bring up
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:36,287	| IOT229 |	Hot Topic here in the States you could have political ads for example when you could see it
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,311	| IOT229 |	They tried fear
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,103	| IOT229 |	With people or
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,615	| IOT229 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,151	| IOT229 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,175	| IOT229 |	Can you sell fewer products
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,711	| IOT229 |	With happy ads than you do
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,479	| IOT229 |	Do with that
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:44,991	| IOT229 |	Engender
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:46,783	| IOT229 |	So
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,087	| IOT229 |	There's that but there's also things like
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| IOT229 |	Hey if you're
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:53,695	| IOT229 |	If your phone early nearby camera recognizes that you're
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,231	| IOT229 |	You're sad
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,023	| IOT229 |	Maybe it'll send you
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,815	| IOT229 |	Coupon for an ice cream
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| IOT229 |	Even though maybe you don't want the ice cream
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:01,887	| IOT229 |	But you're sad
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,935	| IOT229 |	Add and you don't make it feel better
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,239	| IOT229 |	And those kind of things I think
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:06,751	| IOT229 |	Really
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,543	| IOT229 |	Insidious
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,847	| IOT229 |	Insidious good word
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:15,199	| IOT229 |	Isn't it though I bet we'll use that again
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,479	| IOT229 |	That's where we're going
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| IOT229 |	With all of this
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:21,855	| IOT229 |	And I also would like to see so this is just a little blog item for
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,135	| IOT229 |	AWS butt
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,207	| IOT229 |	When they talk about improving accuracy
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,999	| IOT229 |	I would like to see their percentages
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:32,351	| IOT229 |	You know so anytime you're dealing with something like this you're getting up probability
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,631	| IOT229 |	Anytime you got a machine
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,399	| IOT229 |	Learning
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,423	| IOT229 |	Something you're getting
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,215	| IOT229 |	I'm ninety something percent
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,495	| IOT229 |	Sure
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,031	| IOT229 |	That this person is
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| IOT229 |	I think we should start
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,103	| IOT229 |	Calling
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,127	| IOT229 |	For that sort of
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| IOT229 |	Information
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,175	| IOT229 |	I know that they're going to say
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,967	| IOT229 |	Proprietary and they don't want to talk about it
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,039	| IOT229 |	But I think that's actually really important especially if we're going to be
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:51,807	| IOT229 |	Pulling the center
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| IOT229 |	Service for
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,111	| IOT229 |	Policing
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,159	| IOT229 |	I want to know that
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:58,207	| IOT229 |	If someone says they're surprised
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT229 |	Disgusted
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,511	| IOT229 |	Before
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,607	| IOT229 |	Does facial recognition said they were disgusted and angry beforehand
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,655	| IOT229 |	And I really think it's important if we're going to
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,983	| IOT229 |	Decided that's valid that we get percentages about
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,775	| IOT229 |	How sure the system is
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,079	| IOT229 |	And how short is for
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,359	| IOT229 |	Men vs women
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| IOT229 |	White people versus black people
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,759	| IOT229 |	That's just me thinking about down the road is a
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,271	| IOT229 |	Lyerly figure
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,575	| IOT229 |	Cuz I think that's going to
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,135	| IOT229 |	Color people's Perceptions in a way that
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,207	| IOT229 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:34,047	| IOT229 |	I feel like a six-year-old I don't think it's fair if it's not right
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,863	| IOT229 |	Excuse me is that what you think
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:37,887	| IOT229 |	So
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,935	| IOT229 |	Well I guess let's move on to some
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,495	| IOT229 |	Happy news
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:47,871	| IOT229 |	Brilliant the light switches that are very expensive and become a point of integration for your entire smart
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,711	| IOT229 |	They have now added native lifx support
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,271	| IOT229 |	Participative right lifx Wi-Fi
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:54,783	| IOT229 |	And other
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,831	| IOT229 |	This is
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,879	| IOT229 |	Useful so I tried Brillion
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,415	| IOT229 |	Probably a year ago
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,207	| IOT229 |	I had a really bad experience because they were
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,743	| IOT229 |	Really tricky
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,511	| IOT229 |	To install
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:07,583	| IOT229 |	And then I had a brilliant person come out and install a new panel for me
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,119	| IOT229 |	He even said it was trick
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,191	| IOT229 |	But
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| IOT229 |	When they were working properly
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,311	| IOT229 |	They were little too much for me
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,079	| IOT229 |	Personally
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,895	| IOT229 |	But I could integrate all of my life
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,943	| IOT229 |	Is my Nest to my Sonos
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:27,551	| IOT229 |	I could actually do a lot from these light switches it was a big upfront
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,319	| IOT229 |	Time investment
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,135	| IOT229 |	But for someone who wants to have
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,671	| IOT229 |	Instead of like a
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT229 |	Amazon Echo 2
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,559	| IOT229 |	It felt almost like having like a savant or a
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,839	| IOT229 |	Control 4 system
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,887	| IOT229 |	That you programmed yourself
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| IOT229 |	It didn't have the AP
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| IOT229 |	Functionality but
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,007	| IOT229 |	This is probably
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:51,359	| IOT229 |	No switch for everybody because as you said it's for you is too much I mean it's got to
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,639	| IOT229 |	Touch screen
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,663	| IOT229 |	Scott sensors
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| IOT229 |	That's
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| IOT229 |	Would you call him
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| IOT229 |	Touch sliders like
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,063	| IOT229 |	2-din sliders dim there at
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,599	| IOT229 |	Capacitive touch Sliders in
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,903	| IOT229 |	Actually one of the biggest you I can
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,927	| IOT229 |	Complaints I had about toes
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:09,535	| IOT229 |	Sometimes you just want to slap a light switch and have it work it this I had to
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,303	| IOT229 |	Look at your finger in the groove
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,327	| IOT229 |	At the same time
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:16,959	| IOT229 |	They're nice yeah they're very contemporary modern looking in
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:20,287	| IOT229 |	If you like that look it's obviously a larger than a regular
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,567	| IOT229 |	Switch because that
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:24,639	| IOT229 |	Touchscreen independent divots for the dinning
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| IOT229 |	Uncensored
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| IOT229 |	To become a
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,199	| IOT229 |	Whole home internet
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,271	| IOT229 |	If you have them all over your home they become a whole home
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| IOT229 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:35,135	| IOT229 |	I wouldn't want these in every room that's what I would say
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| IOT229 |	But I'm intrigued because I do
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,207	| IOT229 |	Adopted for Life X
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| IOT229 |	Extra color bulb
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,255	| IOT229 |	Versus you with
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,279	| IOT229 |	Junior color bulbs
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:44,095	| IOT229 |	Maybe now's the time how much are they
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,143	| IOT229 |	Brilliant light switches
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:50,751	| IOT229 |	Okay for a single switch control which is essentially just a touch screen
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,799	| IOT229 |	That is 299
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:58,175	| IOT229 |	When you go to a two switch control 34093 switches a399 for switches
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,223	| IOT229 |	Is 449
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| IOT229 |	These are not cheap
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,367	| IOT229 |	But they do act as this integration
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,647	| IOT229 |	Again
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,159	| IOT229 |	Them too much
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,975	| IOT229 |	Yeah they work with a ton of stop
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,767	| IOT229 |	Connect to Sonos nest
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| IOT229 |	Ring hue ecobee
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,351	| IOT229 |	Hilton madhumeh
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,119	| IOT229 |	Very nice
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,679	| IOT229 |	Yeah once you install them correctly which I have
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,191	| IOT229 |	Recommend
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,543	| IOT229 |	All right
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,103	| IOT229 |	They have left EXO Now Kevin there may not be
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,383	| IOT229 |	I think they're a little too
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:34,271	| IOT229 |	I think so considering that really only have one life Expo
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| IOT229 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:39,135	| IOT229 |	Other Partnerships or Integrations LG and Lumia
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,647	| IOT229 |	This is something
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,183	| IOT229 |	China
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:47,071	| IOT229 |	But LG and Lemme have collaborated to create AI based smart home services
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,607	| IOT229 |	What is this mean
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,887	| IOT229 |	But first we should tell you who
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,399	| IOT229 |	Lumia
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:54,239	| IOT229 |	Yeah Lumi is considered by one of the largest
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,543	| IOT229 |	Iot companies in China
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,359	| IOT229 |	It was founded in Shenzhen which is like the
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,943	| IOT229 |	Electronics capital of the world everything is made knocked off
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,223	| IOT229 |	Sold Etc
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,759	| IOT229 |	Horses eating at
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:09,343	| IOT229 |	Lumia sold 100 million devices
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| IOT229 |	As of the end of 2018
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,975	| IOT229 |	They've got smart sensors and Gateway so get ahold of ecosystem
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,815	| IOT229 |	United States
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,863	| IOT229 |	But now I know I haven't seen the prize it's it's
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,887	| IOT229 |	China sails
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,679	| IOT229 |	Yes but
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,215	| IOT229 |	Bradley
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,775	| IOT229 |	I like this deal cuz it's like hey
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,079	| IOT229 |	These two big companies have
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| IOT229 |	Created
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,383	| IOT229 |	Automations that work automatic
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,943	| IOT229 |	Your stuff so you don't have to set it up
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:38,527	| IOT229 |	But if you have this Lumi sensor and have the LG air conditioning
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,087	| IOT229 |	You didn't you can turn it on so it basically
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,903	| IOT229 |	Uses that sensor is an external sensor
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,183	| IOT229 |	Your air conditioning
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,975	| IOT229 |	This is cool
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:50,559	| IOT229 |	In many ways because it makes the smart home easier for
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,119	| IOT229 |	People it's a bummer in the sense that
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,679	| IOT229 |	Oh my gosh you're going to have to rely on all of your
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:01,055	| IOT229 |	Device makers and Appliance makers to decide to opt into in
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,567	| IOT229 |	Integration testing
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:02,847	| IOT229 |	Which
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,383	| IOT229 |	Psy
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| IOT229 |	It's going to take awhile
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,991	| IOT229 |	And has a possibility of going away as we
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:09,503	| IOT229 |	We see with
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,527	| IOT229 |	What will happen if you
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,575	| IOT229 |	This month with Nest shutting down at work
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:18,975	| IOT229 |	You know it's kind of interesting and I don't know the answer to this question but I'm wondering
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,047	| IOT229 |	What Louise voice
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| IOT229 |	+ smart speaker integration Tsar
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,911	| IOT229 |	Because it's China
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,447	| IOT229 |	I don't know
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,471	| IOT229 |	Number one but never
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,543	| IOT229 |	Probably but then again
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:36,127	| IOT229 |	Here we have LG has integrated with
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| IOT229 |	Padme and some tablets
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,735	| IOT229 |	Take me to we turn your tablet into a smart
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:43,807	| IOT229 |	Speaker Echo Show like device so
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:48,671	| IOT229 |	But you're probably right I would imagine a Chinese just Baidu maybe not in the Amazon integration
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,719	| IOT229 |	Google
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,511	| IOT229 |	Ask if they have contra
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,607	| IOT229 |	Will add them to the list when they do
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:57,887	| IOT229 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,679	| IOT229 |	And in a partnership
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,447	| IOT229 |	Breakdown
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,495	| IOT229 |	Cortana
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,055	| IOT229 |	Was removed from the glass thermostat
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,847	| IOT229 |	How many people bought this
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,895	| IOT229 |	Is a Johnson Controls
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,919	| IOT229 |	Glass
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,711	| IOT229 |	Glass thermostat
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,735	| IOT229 |	Is beautiful
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,271	| IOT229 |	It is beautiful
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:14,783	| IOT229 |	But
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| IOT229 |	It came with Microsoft Cortana we were
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:23,743	| IOT229 |	And Johnson Controls then bought Lux products which is a smart home thermostats
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,511	| IOT229 |	Maker
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,303	| IOT229 |	And take that deals with both Google
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| IOT229 |	In Amazon
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,119	| IOT229 |	And I'm sure that
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,679	| IOT229 |	Anybody who brought the glass with love Frances ha
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:32,959	| IOT229 |	Google Earth
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,543	| IOT229 |	And Microsoft is getting out of the smart home a spy
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,615	| IOT229 |	Cortana she's going to be virtual assistant for the Enterprise
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:40,895	| IOT229 |	So this totally makes
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:48,063	| IOT229 |	Did you have one of these have been notified about this yet but it looks like glass I said moving forward you have other voices
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,391	| IOT229 |	Distance through the works with functionality of Madame a and
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,183	| IOT229 |	Awesome
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| IOT229 |	Another breakdown
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:58,303	| IOT229 |	We've been getting reports that the Google home and wink
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| IOT229 |	The wink link
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,399	| IOT229 |	Is now week
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,191	| IOT229 |	No it's non-existent
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,495	| IOT229 |	Somewhere between those two clouds
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,519	| IOT229 |	There was a breakdown
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:10,079	| IOT229 |	And both Google and pink thought it would be
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,615	| IOT229 |	Be fixed but so far
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:16,479	| IOT229 |	Right before we started this show recording I
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:19,295	| IOT229 |	Testing mine again cuz I noticed it for about 3 days and
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,087	| IOT229 |	Now she says that
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,879	| IOT229 |	I cannot connect to wink right now
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:23,903	| IOT229 |	That is a bummer
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,183	| IOT229 |	And
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,487	| IOT229 |	Be aware that both parties are
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,767	| IOT229 |	Aware of it
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| IOT229 |	And they're working on it
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,327	| IOT229 |	It's a little disconcerting.
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:37,471	| IOT229 |	And what I'm doing in the meantime as I'm just using my Wink app
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:40,287	| IOT229 |	Getting out your phone
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| IOT229 |	It's always happening
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,871	| IOT229 |	And
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:47,199	| IOT229 |	Another breakdown cash so many divorces
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,991	| IOT229 |	The tp-link
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,527	| IOT229 |	Casa
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,295	| IOT229 |	System
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,087	| IOT229 |	Which makes a line of wonderful smart
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,599	| IOT229 |	Ground plugs
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,623	| IOT229 |	They
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,647	| IOT229 |	Are not going to
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:01,023	| IOT229 |	Yeah and they said back in January that they were so it's a total reversal at this point
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,327	| IOT229 |	It's not going to get the update the smart plug Mini
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:07,167	| IOT229 |	Get updates in the future
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,215	| IOT229 |	Right so
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,495	| IOT229 |	We are sad
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,031	| IOT229 |	Or at least kind of
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,311	| IOT229 |	Flummoxed
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,335	| IOT229 |	Mend
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,895	| IOT229 |	I feel like we're like TMZ or something
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,223	| IOT229 |	Like that has dating show
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| IOT229 |	The iot paparazzi are out
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,087	| IOT229 |	But
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,623	| IOT229 |	Removing off
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,159	| IOT229 |	Partnerships
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,207	| IOT229 |	More scary stuff
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,743	| IOT229 |	Monster High stuff
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,303	| IOT229 |	A break from our light and happy news to
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| IOT229 |	Alright at Defcon
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:41,471	| IOT229 |	My favorite show that I would never attend because I'm terrified of getting
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,239	| IOT229 |	Completely hacked
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,775	| IOT229 |	We're screwed over at some point in time
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,055	| IOT229 |	Sorry y'all
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,615	| IOT229 |	But I do love you and I love talking to
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,639	| IOT229 |	To all the people who do this
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,919	| IOT229 |	But
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:54,271	| IOT229 |	There was a researcher who basically demonstrated malware that they could stick
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:57,343	| IOT229 |	On any sort of speaker system
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,367	| IOT229 |	And then use that
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,975	| IOT229 |	It said I need physical or remote access to the device but once it's on there
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,999	| IOT229 |	They can actually
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:07,327	| IOT229 |	Melt the speaker components
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:11,935	| IOT229 |	By sending out these high-pitched frequencies and also possibly damage
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT229 |	People in
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,007	| IOT229 |	I don't know animals they didn't test it on
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,799	| IOT229 |	People are animals so we're not sure how that damage
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,615	| IOT229 |	It wasn't good
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:25,247	| IOT229 |	Yeah I just like smart speakers as you said any speaker so a laptop speaker
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,039	| IOT229 |	Your phone speaker a Bluetooth speaker
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,599	| IOT229 |	Headstones xiamen
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,623	| IOT229 |	I mean all kinds
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| IOT229 |	Speakers
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,231	| IOT229 |	Yeah like if we were at the Muse the work
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:37,535	| IOT229 |	Insidious we could actually insert the
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:41,119	| IOT229 |	Frequency in this podcast and melt everybody smart speakers
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,399	| IOT229 |	So we're not.
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,935	| IOT229 |	But we could do that
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,751	| IOT229 |	You would have known that's true
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,263	| IOT229 |	But yes
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,799	| IOT229 |	We could be in City
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,103	| IOT229 |	Play it
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,615	| IOT229 |	Terrifying
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:56,991	| IOT229 |	I'll link is back to the mystery of Cuba where we had us diplomats in Cuba
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,039	| IOT229 |	Had something
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,551	| IOT229 |	Happen
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,575	| IOT229 |	Weather
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,647	| IOT229 |	Carrying their heads I don't even know
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:06,975	| IOT229 |	Nobody knows
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| IOT229 |	It's it's like the Bermuda Triangle
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,071	| IOT229 |	Don't know their butt
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,095	| IOT229 |	Keep an eye out
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,631	| IOT229 |	On that and then the other thing from
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,423	| IOT229 |	Defcon did I just
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:18,751	| IOT229 |	I don't think it's funny I just think it's a case of
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,263	| IOT229 |	Old people
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,543	| IOT229 |	Look at us
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:24,639	| IOT229 |	Was this idea I'm sure you guys saw that the Avaya desk phones
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,663	| IOT229 |	Now are vulnerable
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,735	| IOT229 |	What's interesting about it isn't that you're invited us phone is wrong
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| IOT229 |	Logo patch
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,855	| IOT229 |	It's that this is a vulnerability that is 10 years old
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,879	| IOT229 |	When it was found
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,927	| IOT229 |	Avaya actually issued a patch
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:40,255	| IOT229 |	What happened then is some point in time later
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:46,655	| IOT229 |	The forked the code for the phones and use the old unpatched version
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,191	| IOT229 |	So then
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,239	| IOT229 |	Reintroduce the vulnerability
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,799	| IOT229 |	Good news is they have a patch
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,383	| IOT229 |	Version Control revision Control
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,455	| IOT229 |	I just thought this was a perfect example I picture it like
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:07,391	| IOT229 |	If you're dealing with code inside
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,671	| IOT229 |	Source code
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:11,231	| IOT229 |	Control system whatever you use
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,535	| IOT229 |	And you got 10 years or so
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:16,095	| IOT229 |	Cotrip single devices or devices
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,399	| IOT229 |	This kind of oversight
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,423	| IOT229 |	Unfortunate going to happen
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:26,079	| IOT229 |	Outside of Defcon we also got news late last week about hallways new operating
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:27,871	| IOT229 |	This is the
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,407	| IOT229 |	Harmony OS
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,711	| IOT229 |	Are humming OS
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,503	| IOT229 |	In Chinese
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,271	| IOT229 |	Speaking Mandarin
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,551	| IOT229 |	But
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:39,135	| IOT229 |	They say they can switch over from Android and this is a big deal because
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,903	| IOT229 |	Cuz
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,975	| IOT229 |	The US government has decided that no Huawei
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:47,839	| IOT229 |	Short version of that which means companies from the US like Google
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,911	| IOT229 |	Have to pull their stuff from Huawei they can't
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,191	| IOT229 |	What's my name
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:52,959	| IOT229 |	Which means
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,727	| IOT229 |	No Android
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,263	| IOT229 |	This is bad
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,311	| IOT229 |	What ways has
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,407	| IOT229 |	That's okay cuz we've got the harmony iOS which is actually designed for the
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,223	| IOT229 |	And
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:09,087	| IOT229 |	Also smartphones but it'll be smart phone smart speakers sensors blah blah blah
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:13,183	| IOT229 |	And it makes me wonder like this is what Google's fuchsia OS has you know
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:20,351	| IOT229 |	I was just going to say that because why we've been working on this since 2017 we've since found out we know
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,935	| IOT229 |	That's this is their back-up plan to Android and as you said
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,263	| IOT229 |	It's going to actually start on smart TVs
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:31,615	| IOT229 |	But it is a microcurrent when open source microkernel
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:34,175	| IOT229 |	Which fuchsia is also a
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,687	| IOT229 |	Source
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,223	| IOT229 |	Maybe
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:43,391	| IOT229 |	I think Google's been working on and we still don't know a lot about that but I suspect these are like mirror
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,671	| IOT229 |	Like approaches
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,463	| IOT229 |	To bring a
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,231	| IOT229 |	Standard
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,511	| IOT229 |	Corset of
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,607	| IOT229 |	Features and functions that can scale across any device by size or
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,631	| IOT229 |	Screen
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,167	| IOT229 |	Size as well
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:56,959	| IOT229 |	Even though scream
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:00,543	| IOT229 |	Exactly
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:05,151	| IOT229 |	And that makes sense because that's where we are going we're going to need a OS is that
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,223	| IOT229 |	Work across everything because otherwise developers are going to
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| IOT229 |	Hate your butt for
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:16,416	| IOT229 |	Seeking a developer setting platform so I did catch some interesting information that
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:18,720	| IOT229 |	If and when we bring this to
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| IOT229 |	Phones work
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,280	| IOT229 |	Things that run Android today
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:26,912	| IOT229 |	That Huawei has a conversion program to convert an Android APK which is a
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:31,008	| IOT229 |	Basically zip file of all the Android components for programs
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,056	| IOT229 |	That will work on Harmony OS
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,592	| IOT229 |	Nice
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:39,712	| IOT229 |	And our final bit of news today is from
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,760	| IOT229 |	The nrdc
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| IOT229 |	This is an environmental
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:44,832	| IOT229 |	NGO
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,368	| IOT229 |	And
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,904	| IOT229 |	They protect the animals protect
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,928	| IOT229 |	Environment protect Airport
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| IOT229 |	Somebody has to do so
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,512	| IOT229 |	We're not
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:58,400	| IOT229 |	So they actually retained a company called Pacific Crest labs to test the power consumption
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,704	| IOT229 |	Smart speakers and video streaming
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,264	| IOT229 |	And as you can imagine
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,800	| IOT229 |	There are
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| IOT229 |	Problems
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:06,848	| IOT229 |	Efficiency
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,896	| IOT229 |	Generally the research says
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,408	| IOT229 |	Hey
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,968	| IOT229 |	These devices are pretty energy efficient
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,736	| IOT229 |	But
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,784	| IOT229 |	When you link for example a smart speaker
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,552	| IOT229 |	Television
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:19,648	| IOT229 |	It causes it standby power in overall annual
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,928	| IOT229 |	Energy used to Skyrock
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,256	| IOT229 |	That's because basically the TV doesn't go to sleep
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,792	| IOT229 |	So they're saying hey
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:28,352	| IOT229 |	Maybe you can make the TV models go to sleep
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:28,864	| IOT229 |	When
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,424	| IOT229 |	They're connected to a Smart speaker
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,472	| IOT229 |	Some people do this some
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,240	| IOT229 |	People don't
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,008	| IOT229 |	But
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,776	| IOT229 |	I was like oh
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:38,336	| IOT229 |	That's kind of a bummer cuz I'm sitting here
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,664	| IOT229 |	Because I've got a Chromecast plugged in and
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,200	| IOT229 |	I've got it connected to my
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,968	| IOT229 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:47,040	| IOT229 |	I don't know if Google is one of those people
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,624	| IOT229 |	Yeah I don't know I mean since a guideline that they're trying to get
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,952	| IOT229 |	Device makers to start following because they say
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:57,536	| IOT229 |	The spike in energy consumption from the always listening bits
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,840	| IOT229 |	Could exceed a billion dollars annually
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:05,728	| IOT229 |	The device makers could actually Implement something that you know that makes it more efficient as you were saying
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:09,312	| IOT229 |	You can just give us a scheduling thing
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,592	| IOT229 |	Smart speakers that says hey
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:14,176	| IOT229 |	Pretty much asleep for my 10 at night till 6 p.m.
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:16,736	| IOT229 |	No he's downstairs watching TV
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,552	| IOT229 |	Can you just not be listening from 10 to 6 p.m.
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,088	| IOT229 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,624	| IOT229 |	Exactly and
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,392	| IOT229 |	There we go
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,184	| IOT229 |	They gave a chart full of
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:29,536	| IOT229 |	On Power vs standby power in a variety of devices
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,072	| IOT229 |	And some of them
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,864	| IOT229 |	Surprisingly
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,632	| IOT229 |	The Apple homepod
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,424	| IOT229 |	Consumes a lot
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,448	| IOT229 |	Of energy
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,752	| IOT229 |	Turn on power mode
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,032	| IOT229 |	In terms of Watts
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:45,920	| IOT229 |	The Google home is 2.2 the Amazon Echo is 2.4 Watts
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:48,480	| IOT229 |	Apple homepod as 5.91
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,040	| IOT229 |	Which
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,552	| IOT229 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,576	| IOT229 |	What is it doing
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:57,696	| IOT229 |	I don't know I know it's a very heavy and have to device but not that I had much to do with it
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:04,608	| IOT229 |	I see if these devices get bigger they seem to be using more power like the Google home mini the smallest amongst this test
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,912	| IOT229 |	Purposely 1.7 watch when it's on
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,704	| IOT229 |	Yeah but that's
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:09,984	| IOT229 |	1.7 vs
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,032	| IOT229 |	2.46
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,592	| IOT229 |	Yeah 2.44 the Hub
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,640	| IOT229 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,408	| IOT229 |	Well
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,688	| IOT229 |	I don't know about that
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,968	| IOT229 |	Unplug everything
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:23,040	| IOT229 |	We are plugging in a lot more things I thought we would stop plugging
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:27,904	| IOT229 |	Note this is why I'm changing all my Outlets to add like USB
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,720	| IOT229 |	Reports and such because I'm running out of outlets
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:37,120	| IOT229 |	Well and if you imagine something like the wireless power Consortium like bringing the tri-power not just to like
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| IOT229 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| IOT229 |	Imagine they have an effort to put it in
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,216	| IOT229 |	Kitchens
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,776	| IOT229 |	If you're not even aware
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,104	| IOT229 |	Of what has wires you just said it in places
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,664	| IOT229 |	Imagine how that might Skyrocket
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,176	| IOT229 |	The use of things
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,200	| IOT229 |	Need to be charged
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,992	| IOT229 |	Well I say
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,296	| IOT229 |	Is wireless charging
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,600	| IOT229 |	Under the floors and everything will just
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,880	| IOT229 |	Wirelessly magically
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,928	| IOT229 |	Evil be baked in
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,464	| IOT229 |	NRF Olga
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:06,048	| IOT229 |	I might lose my hair and grow a third arm but hey everything's chart
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,584	| IOT229 |	It might be warm
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,632	| IOT229 |	History like radiant heat
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:15,520	| IOT229 |	Pick up good for news we didn't have a ton of great news this week
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,312	| IOT229 |	Attentive

EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| IOT229 |	And it's a good Smart Switch
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| IOT229 |	Yep
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:16,192	| IOT229 |	If you're into that sort of thing
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,704	| IOT229 |	Go for it
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,240	| IOT229 |	So
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:21,056	| IOT229 |	This week's question is from
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:21,568	| IOT229 |	Rent
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,640	| IOT229 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:27,200	| IOT229 |	Hello this is Brent from Utah I am
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:31,296	| IOT229 |	I have an older home and very small bathroom
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,600	| IOT229 |	With no fan
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,136	| IOT229 |	And the humidity gets
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,184	| IOT229 |	And then I gets crazy cuz up to six
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,976	| IOT229 |	60 65%
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,256	| IOT229 |	Listen to take a shower or bath
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,072	| IOT229 |	And a fan but I'd love to her
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,120	| IOT229 |	The fan run automatically
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,192	| IOT229 |	Until it produces dantu
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,544	| IOT229 |	30% humidity temp step point
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:56,384	| IOT229 |	I think also that would want to be able to hit the fan and have it run
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:59,456	| IOT229 |	For 15 minutes or just turn the fan on and leave it running
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,248	| IOT229 |	CC IMAX
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,296	| IOT229 |	Accessing turning it on leaving it on
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,576	| IOT229 |	Until it drops
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,880	| IOT229 |	And also way to trigger it is
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,672	| IOT229 |	It's not even at the humidity so I can get
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,720	| IOT229 |	Bad smells out of the way
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,000	| IOT229 |	Thanks for your help
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:17,376	| IOT229 |	Oh Brent this is such a good question because Kevin has already done the research because he wanted to
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,144	| IOT229 |	You do the same thing
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:21,728	| IOT229 |	I did half of it actually bought a product I just didn't install it yet
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,520	| IOT229 |	Basically
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:26,848	| IOT229 |	You can go to your local Lowe's Home Depot Etc
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:30,688	| IOT229 |	And check the shelves for bathroom exhaust fans
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:33,248	| IOT229 |	But have integrated humidity sensors in them
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,784	| IOT229 |	Again I bought ones
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,808	| IOT229 |	I did not
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:39,136	| IOT229 |	Actually install it yes I can't tell you how well it works but there's a range of these
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,184	| IOT229 |	Depending on the
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:45,792	| IOT229 |	Amount of air that you need moved any features you want some headlights in them and such
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,560	| IOT229 |	I found one
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:49,888	| IOT229 |	Kind of like better than one I bought it's a NuTone
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,936	| IOT229 |	Odyssey 1
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,216	| IOT229 |	10
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:56,288	| IOT229 |	CFM ceiling bathroom exhaust fan with humidity sensor
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:28:01,664	| IOT229 |	He's $139 it has a small integrated light in it which is just a nice add-on
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:06,016	| IOT229 |	And basically I think this will do what you needed to do
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:08,064	| IOT229 |	I say that because I look at the specs
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:11,136	| IOT229 |	You can adjust the set point of humidity
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:14,720	| IOT229 |	So that it's anywhere between 50 and 80% and if
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:19,584	| IOT229 |	Can recognize that the humidity levels in that range that you said
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,376	| IOT229 |	He will automatically turn on
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,144	| IOT229 |	For you
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:27,520	| IOT229 |	He will also stay on for user adjustable 5 to 60 minutes once the set point
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:32,640	| IOT229 |	Is Matt so once the humidity drops say below 50% if you want it set for the max
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,432	| IOT229 |	You can have it stay on for 5 to 60 minutes
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,992	| IOT229 |	And since it automatically goes on
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,040	| IOT229 |	You don't have to like turn it on when there's
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,344	| IOT229 |	It just will do it for you
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:44,160	| IOT229 |	So I think that will really meet your needs however
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:46,464	| IOT229 |	I know Stacy was looking at another potential option
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,744	| IOT229 |	Yes there are two
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:52,096	| IOT229 |	The first is if you want to make this whole thing smart
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:55,168	| IOT229 |	You can buy a normal exhaust fan
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,192	| IOT229 |	Install it
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,752	| IOT229 |	And then put a Smart Switch on it
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,032	| IOT229 |	And then buy a humidity sensor
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,312	| IOT229 |	Connect those two
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:04,384	| IOT229 |	That's a lot of work and you said you had an old home
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,920	| IOT229 |	So you may not have a neutral wire
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,944	| IOT229 |	Smart Switch
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,224	| IOT229 |	So I found something even easier
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,528	| IOT229 |	You can buy an awair glow
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,344	| IOT229 |	For about 90 bucks they might even be 79
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:14,880	| IOT229 |	Buy this thing
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,160	| IOT229 |	It's a
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,440	| IOT229 |	Indoor air quality monitor
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,488	| IOT229 |	Plug-in
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,816	| IOT229 |	A dehumidifier so you have to buy a separate little dehumidify
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:27,936	| IOT229 |	And then when the humidity gets to a certain point that the aware says it's not great
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,216	| IOT229 |	And I think you can actually set that
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,008	| IOT229 |	Do I actually turn on
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,312	| IOT229 |	Your dehumidifier for you and then turn it off
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,872	| IOT229 |	Either at a time setting or when the
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| IOT229 |	Humidity has dropped
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,968	| IOT229 |	That is the no install
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,296	| IOT229 |	Way but it's going to be super easy
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,344	| IOT229 |	Then you have like a dehumidifier sitting in your bathroom
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,904	| IOT229 |	It doesn't address your
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,440	| IOT229 |	Automatic
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,208	| IOT229 |	Fan
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,744	| IOT229 |	Question exactly
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,304	| IOT229 |	Because it's a dehumidifier only
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,840	| IOT229 |	Then you're still
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,608	| IOT229 |	Kind of stuck with that
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:02,496	| IOT229 |	Right but it is simple and that does not require any Hub everything
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,544	| IOT229 |	It just requires two
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,848	| IOT229 |	Basic dehumidifier and
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,128	| IOT229 |	Ace Mart
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:08,640	| IOT229 |	Outlet
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:14,016	| IOT229 |	Right and if you went with the other option of a switching humidity sensor
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,296	| IOT229 |	You're looking at a property
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:17,856	| IOT229 |	And I'm thinking you're going to need a hug because of the sensor
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,416	| IOT229 |	Oh yeah you will need a
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,952	| IOT229 |	You're really looking like two hundred bucks
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:24,512	| IOT229 |	What's plus an install plus you've actually got to put the fan on
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| IOT229 |	None of that
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,120	| IOT229 |	Options
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:32,448	| IOT229 |	There's some options depending on what you think you want and need
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| IOT229 |	And can
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,008	| IOT229 |	A four-door reasonably
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,032	| IOT229 |	Expect to do
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,824	| IOT229 |	As you can see Kevin
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,104	| IOT229 |	Afforded something
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:44,480	| IOT229 |	I just haven't got around to it it's been 3 years Mike my deal is
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,504	| IOT229 |	It's not that I'm five years that's
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,296	| IOT229 |	Then you sell it at a garage sale
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,320	| IOT229 |	Exactly
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,648	| IOT229 |	That's a way to yours brand you can just buy my phone
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,160	| IOT229 |	There you go
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:56,512	| IOT229 |	Okay well this is great thanks Kevin for helping me out with the news I would
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:59,072	| IOT229 |	Encourage everyone to stay tuned
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,144	| IOT229 |	For Adam Smith of light point Who's going to be talking about the
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,680	| IOT229 |	Brand New fira Consortium
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:04,960	| IOT229 |	How is secure
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,496	| IOT229 |	How does location
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,032	| IOT229 |	And
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:13,920	| IOT229 |	How other companies can assess what makes a good Wireless technology like how they know where they should be
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,688	| IOT229 |	Investing
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,968	| IOT229 |	It's going to be fun
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:20,064	| IOT229 |	Staging for that but first a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,904	| IOT229 |	Hey everyone we're taking a quick break from The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:30,304	| IOT229 |	Message from our sponsor sponsor is nutanix and I have such a Bugatti
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,328	| IOT229 |	Botanics here
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:31,840	| IOT229 |	What to talk about
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,144	| IOT229 |	Hi Sachin how are you doing
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,448	| IOT229 |	Hi Stacy I'm good thanks for having me on
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:41,312	| IOT229 |	So such an eye associate nutanix with Hyper converged infrastructure
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:44,384	| IOT229 |	What is it specifically that you guys offer in The Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,016	| IOT229 |	It is called
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,040	| IOT229 |	Vallarta
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:55,392	| IOT229 |	That allows users to
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,952	| IOT229 |	Modernity application
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,256	| IOT229 |	Flextime manager
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:03,584	| IOT229 |	Literally Atlantic Scale from a central point of control
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,864	| IOT229 |	And last but not least
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:10,496	| IOT229 |	It enables users to do data processing across the aisle in the clock for ideas
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,568	| IOT229 |	Excellent so what is nutanix is
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,592	| IOT229 |	Core mission
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,104	| IOT229 |	In the iot
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,664	| IOT229 |	They say it's about getting
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:24,064	| IOT229 |	Insights out of raw data as soon as possible
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,624	| IOT229 |	600 billion terabytes of information next year
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:30,464	| IOT229 |	This is compared to 15 billion
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:34,304	| IOT229 |	That's kind of excited in all the public and private clubs combined
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:38,656	| IOT229 |	Cesar Perez possible
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:41,984	| IOT229 |	And very close to other states created end of year ideas
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,544	| IOT229 |	All right
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,080	| IOT229 |	There's a lot of data
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:50,688	| IOT229 |	You got to deal with it if so can you walk us through a customer story to illustrate the sconce
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:54,784	| IOT229 |	Smart cities customer and
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:59,136	| IOT229 |	Thinking about applying new type of cameras
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:02,208	| IOT229 |	License plate recognition cameras and AI cameras
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:05,536	| IOT229 |	To figure out traffic violation Center track cars and son
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,560	| IOT229 |	And
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:12,704	| IOT229 |	American listen to use their existing cameras and all that they that they were already collecting
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:20,640	| IOT229 |	Go get all those insights anyway
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:25,248	| IOT229 |	Ki Base traffic management project
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:29,344	| IOT229 |	Apply new devices for it

EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:09,024	| IOT229 |	Today's guest is Adam Smith
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:11,584	| IOT229 |	Who is director of marketing at
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,888	| IOT229 |	Hi I don't know how are you
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,704	| IOT229 |	Tight 18 doing great how are you doing
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:20,800	| IOT229 |	Excellent
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,312	| IOT229 |	Testing for
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:24,384	| IOT229 |	And you guys have tested all kinds of dip
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:28,224	| IOT229 |	Standards and you recently joined the fear of Consortium
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:30,528	| IOT229 |	And I shouldn't say you I should say your
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,344	| IOT229 |	So before we get into
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,880	| IOT229 |	Ciara let's talk about
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:37,184	| IOT229 |	Why you guys join the alliance
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,464	| IOT229 |	Your
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,744	| IOT229 |	Business case for doing sex
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:46,656	| IOT229 |	Yes so we recently joined be up here at the Consortium there are relatively new organization and we are a
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,448	| IOT229 |	Entirely Wireless
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:52,288	| IOT229 |	And I'd like to say that if there's like a product out there
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:55,360	| IOT229 |	Consumer Industrial
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| IOT229 |	In some capacity
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,200	| IOT229 |	What we look to do is we look to help companies
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,480	| IOT229 |	Bring devices to Market
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:02,272	| IOT229 |	In the rectum into the manufacturer
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:04,064	| IOT229 |	Industrial
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:07,136	| IOT229 |	Actually
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:11,232	| IOT229 |	Put some structure and organization around a new technology
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:19,680	| IOT229 |	As the 15.4 IEEE
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,776	| IOT229 |	Here is doing is putting together an ecosystem
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,592	| IOT229 |	Bringing multiple players together to help bring
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:29,152	| IOT229 |	Some structure and organization and
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,944	| IOT229 |	Certified products
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,736	| IOT229 |	To make sure that they operate with each other
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,016	| IOT229 |	Okay
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:36,832	| IOT229 |	So this is important obviously to you guys because this is
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:37,856	| IOT229 |	Businesses
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,696	| IOT229 |	How many standards organizations do the guys
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:46,304	| IOT229 |	What part of a few organizations that lot of would like
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,352	| IOT229 |	Businesses has been historically in Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:54,496	| IOT229 |	Remember the Wi-Fi Alliance today and we are currently bringing Wi-Fi six Market as part of
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,824	| IOT229 |	We're not going to talk about that
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,616	| IOT229 |	We are going to go back to Sarah
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:02,432	| IOT229 |	The fear Consortium was started
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,736	| IOT229 |	Bear recently by nxp
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:05,504	| IOT229 |	Assa abloy
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:09,088	| IOT229 |	And Samsung and one of the things that it's
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:11,904	| IOT229 |	Same as provide
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,440	| IOT229 |	Ranging
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,208	| IOT229 |	Location
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:14,976	| IOT229 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,816	| IOT229 |	This is one of the reasons why we're excited about this
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:24,960	| IOT229 |	Historically when we think about Wireless technology
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:26,752	| IOT229 |	And this is a little different
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:32,128	| IOT229 |	So this is not so much about how do I get gigabytes of data through the air this is more about how do I
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:35,712	| IOT229 |	Precisely position to devices relative to each other
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:38,272	| IOT229 |	And so it's about knowing
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,040	| IOT229 |	Bachelorette
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:39,552	| IOT229 |	Positioning
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,856	| IOT229 |	If you will so it's not so much about
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:46,208	| IOT229 |	We got megabits to gigabits per second going through the air it's more about I can very accurately
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,840	| IOT229 |	Of two devices that are that are talking to
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,424	| IOT229 |	That's what it's opened up some really interesting use cases
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:37:00,800	| IOT229 |	List of existing Technologies
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,080	| IOT229 |	In products moving forward
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:07,200	| IOT229 |	All right so I'm going to quibble with you just a little bit because I feel
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:09,760	| IOT229 |	In the industrial iot in Enterprise iot
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,808	| IOT229 |	Location is a big deal
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:14,112	| IOT229 |	And I see all kinds of wirelessly
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,624	| IOT229 |	Location app
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,672	| IOT229 |	Tell me the most popular game
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,184	| IOT229 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:20,000	| IOT229 |	How is fira maybe better than blue shoes
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,024	| IOT229 |	For Enterprise
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:28,448	| IOT229 |	I'm thinking the same thing as multiple Technologies I need Wi-Fi
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,776	| IOT229 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:36,384	| IOT229 |	5.1 is looking to enhance the capability
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:38,176	| IOT229 |	And then client conversation that goes on their phone
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,600	| IOT229 |	Different
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,160	| IOT229 |	Personals very very very white
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,720	| IOT229 |	So it's it's about 5
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:55,072	| IOT229 |	You can cut up the Bluetooth which is only
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:59,680	| IOT229 |	You have some more precise you can be with position answer what people are looking to achieve with ultra-wideband is
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:07,616	| IOT229 |	That is super impressive accuracy
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:10,944	| IOT229 |	It makes a lot of sense and the fact that it's
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,712	| IOT229 |	It comes out
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:13,504	| IOT229 |	Pulses as opposed to greetings
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,528	| IOT229 |	Between
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:16,832	| IOT229 |	Radios is definitely going to help with power
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,512	| IOT229 |	Secure access
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:26,816	| IOT229 |	I'm assuming this is why I said blaze
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:29,632	| IOT229 |	Right now I might walk by my
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:34,496	| IOT229 |	Connected door locks and it'll open with Bluetooth
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,824	| IOT229 |	Consumer applications but also things like
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:42,176	| IOT229 |	Yes definitely have heard of this technology being used in the context
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:47,296	| IOT229 |	Buildings
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:53,184	| IOT229 |	With the precise positioning you can't be a person that's not trying to do good that's sitting next to the car and
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:56,000	| IOT229 |	That basically do what's called relay hack where you be rebroadcast
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,048	| IOT229 |	Unique about
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:00,608	| IOT229 |	Why is this concept
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:07,520	| IOT229 |	Just because you're free broadcasting a signal in the other radio receives it you need to also messed that up with the value of the season
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:11,104	| IOT229 |	So it knows that you're not spoofing
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:16,992	| IOT229 |	You physically right there at the door of the car it's not somebody hiding over in the bushes after you leave Andre broadcasting the signal
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,784	| IOT229 |	So then the question becomes
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,600	| IOT229 |	You're experienced in the world
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,368	| IOT229 |	Wireless
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:26,208	| IOT229 |	How do we determine if something like this is going to be a success
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:32,352	| IOT229 |	I feel like Wireless standards pop up all the time and some of them are amazing and some of them just going to die a slow death
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,400	| IOT229 |	Whichever
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:41,312	| IOT229 |	A great migration is so many different times I mean
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:43,616	| IOT229 |	I've been Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,432	| IOT229 |	And some of this is a little bit of
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:50,784	| IOT229 |	The technology was waiting for an application in the application just hit a really sweet spot
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:54,624	| IOT229 |	Minnesota's the smartphone came out pretty much Wi-Fi Bluetooth
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:57,952	| IOT229 |	Just had cemented a place in history
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:40:00,000	| IOT229 |	Looking forward of backwards compatibility
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:06,144	| IOT229 |	But what does it take for a new technology to get adoption cuz we're seeing all kinds of industrial iot technology
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:08,704	| IOT229 |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:11,776	| IOT229 |	No one tool is the best one out there they're all just
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,312	| IOT229 |	Different tools in the toolbox
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:17,408	| IOT229 |	And depending on the millions of applications in the industrial space
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,944	| IOT229 |	One might be better than the other
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,992	| IOT229 |	Ultra wideband
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:27,392	| IOT229 |	A particular you'll have some interesting advantages
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,416	| IOT229 |	Nice about it is that
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:31,232	| IOT229 |	It can operate in
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:31,744	| IOT229 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:35,072	| IOT229 |	But it's operating under the FCC part 15 limit
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,608	| IOT229 |	So it's allowed
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,896	| IOT229 |	Because it is very wide bandwidth
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,432	| IOT229 |	Very low power
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,504	| IOT229 |	Call me when you can notice it
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:57,600	| IOT229 |	And it because it's white van with its it's not very susceptible to near Bandon or
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:01,696	| IOT229 |	You're not going to jam the signal
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,720	| IOT229 |	500 + 9
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:07,072	| IOT229 |	Listen interesting things about the physical layer part of
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:09,120	| IOT229 |	The technology
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,400	| IOT229 |	The thing that were excited about it
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,704	| IOT229 |	Thumbs up this new use cases
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,776	| IOT229 |	Actually I almost
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,312	| IOT229 |	To The Internet of Things
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:20,640	| IOT229 |	Because you can precisely know where something is
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,944	| IOT229 |	Sensors can touch and feel and see relative
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:30,880	| IOT229 |	You're also not looking to displace Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:37,792	| IOT229 |	It's looking there to enhance the use cases that can be done to products so there's this
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,072	| IOT229 |	High point of view because
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:42,912	| IOT229 |	Interesting
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:49,056	| IOT229 |	You don't have to worry about some of these other things with historically worried about that intercepting signals
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:55,199	| IOT229 |	Okay that is a lot so let's break that down a little bit
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:55,967	| IOT229 |	So
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:59,551	| IOT229 |	I'm going to use a fancy word that I hate trying to stay up Podcast but I'm going to go for
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:03,391	| IOT229 |	With this idea of nerve endings you're basically giving things
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,927	| IOT229 |	Proprioception
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:07,231	| IOT229 |	Which is the sense of where you are in space
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:14,911	| IOT229 |	You can do with that but I'd be curious to see if you have ideas about taking that forward what that means
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:17,471	| IOT229 |	It was a Enterprise in industrial custom
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:20,543	| IOT229 |	To be honest this is one of these things where
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:25,151	| IOT229 |	It's a new technology
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,199	| IOT229 |	But I can certainly Envision things
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:32,575	| IOT229 |	Maybe a medical industrial application where you're wearing some sort of identification
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:34,367	| IOT229 |	Batch that have the technology in it
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:37,951	| IOT229 |	And there's some sensor on a door and senses that you're walking towards it
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,719	| IOT229 |	And
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,535	| IOT229 |	You're authenticated to go in that door so it open
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,071	| IOT229 |	Your colleagues
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:46,655	| IOT229 |	Walking around the corner has their own badge and they're not
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:53,055	| IOT229 |	It's somewhat of a new way of thinking about
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:54,591	| IOT229 |	Building access
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:43:00,991	| IOT229 |	Security access in the automotive space that this is being discussed in in multiple ways I mean
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:07,135	| IOT229 |	People talking about
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:09,183	| IOT229 |	Know your wallet
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:09,951	| IOT229 |	If your car keys
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:12,511	| IOT229 |	Interesting use cases out there that I think
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,303	| IOT229 |	Interesting
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:15,583	| IOT229 |	See what happens with the forward
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,375	| IOT229 |	No broccoli
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,935	| IOT229 |	As a person who is seeing many Wireless standards
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:21,471	| IOT229 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:24,287	| IOT229 |	Success in the consumer realm vs the Enterprise
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:27,103	| IOT229 |	Because the consumer realm it feels like
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:29,407	| IOT229 |	That is everyone's Holy Grail but I could be wrong
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:31,199	| IOT229 |	What does it mean
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:35,039	| IOT229 |	If your pushing a wireless standard for Consumer versus Inter
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,831	| IOT229 |	Success what are those look like
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:37,855	| IOT229 |	What are the impacts on the cup
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:41,695	| IOT229 |	If we're talking about specifically around the iot
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:45,279	| IOT229 |	In the consumer space frankly what you wanted to put your product to be adopted
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,071	| IOT229 |	And so what you're going to want to take your time
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,095	| IOT229 |	The technology that is
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,631	| IOT229 |	Has a high rate of adoption
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:52,447	| IOT229 |	Any type of product
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:55,775	| IOT229 |	It's going to have
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:03,967	| IOT229 |	Wi-Fi as well
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:08,319	| IOT229 |	You're not going to have to force your way into the ecosystem
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,599	| IOT229 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,135	| IOT229 |	And in the Enterprise
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:15,743	| IOT229 |	It feels like there's already so many Technologies and they're very purpose-built
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:18,303	| IOT229 |	So maybe this will be fine there and
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,327	| IOT229 |	What does success look like
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:23,167	| IOT229 |	The Enterprise is a wild animal
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:26,751	| IOT229 |	Wireless technology
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,543	| IOT229 |	So if I look at for example
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:32,383	| IOT229 |	Why don't we just take these well adopted consumer Technologies and put them in the industrial space
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:34,687	| IOT229 |	What are the challenges are
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,295	| IOT229 |	So Wi-Fi to me is this elegant
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:42,879	| IOT229 |	Technology that was really designed to be super robust in the fact that
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:48,767	| IOT229 |	Descended from an industrial and Enterprise
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,351	| IOT229 |	The pragmatic Pro
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:02,591	| IOT229 |	Networks that you don't know
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:06,431	| IOT229 |	Spectrum so if you set up a private Network where nobody else can be on there
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:10,783	| IOT229 |	Christine
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:13,087	| IOT229 |	Okay as someone who evaluates
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:16,415	| IOT229 |	What do you look for when trying to figure out which Wireless
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:22,559	| IOT229 |	I might answer this in two different ways because in a way point is
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:23,583	| IOT229 |	Agnostic
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:28,191	| IOT229 |	To the wireless technology
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:34,079	| IOT229 |	And we're not there to make judgment
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:36,639	| IOT229 |	That being said certainly we need to choose
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:39,199	| IOT229 |	Where we spend our investment dollars onto which technology
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,735	| IOT229 |	And so when we are
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:41,503	| IOT229 |	Evaluating
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,831	| IOT229 |	Where should we put our dollars
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:46,111	| IOT229 |	We have to make some judgments
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:55,327	| IOT229 |	Different Wireless personalities on
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:57,887	| IOT229 |	We design a flexible platform
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:45:59,167	| IOT229 |	Can be programmed to be a differ
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:06,847	| IOT229 |	I hate the term software-defined radio but if you will
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,383	| IOT229 |	We are at the end of the day
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:12,223	| IOT229 |	Then from a software development point of view clearly we prioritize based on where we think
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:16,575	| IOT229 |	Receive momentum that we will check our checks and we check our checks in our checks
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:25,535	| IOT229 |	And that's the beginning of this will work with some Consortium
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,863	| IOT229 |	Got it and I like this idea of Wireless personnel
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:31,167	| IOT229 |	I'm trying to sit here and efficiently
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:32,191	| IOT229 |	2 personalities
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:36,031	| IOT229 |	Given your view with the market
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:39,359	| IOT229 |	What are you excited about for The Internet of Things specifically
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:40,383	| IOT229 |	Coming up
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,175	| IOT229 |	What is the next big Tech
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:42,687	| IOT229 |	Technology
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:51,135	| IOT229 |	I don't want to focus so much on what's the next big technology because there's always
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:52,671	| IOT229 |	The wireless Market in two different sites
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:54,207	| IOT229 |	Spectrum Technologies
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:06,239	| IOT229 |	Most recently things like sigfox Lora and in the
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:06,751	| IOT229 |	Industrial
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,199	| IOT229 |	They tend to be governed by not only
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:18,527	| IOT229 |	From the government
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:22,879	| IOT229 |	They're also typically working with standard bodies that move on a slower
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:29,791	| IOT229 |	Did it pretty quickly
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,583	| IOT229 |	In the volume
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,143	| IOT229 |	It's one thing to say
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,167	| IOT229 |	Consumer space
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:38,751	| IOT229 |	7 billion people the planet of everybody's hands
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:42,079	| IOT229 |	Ciot just kind of exponentially growing
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:45,151	| IOT229 |	For me as a marketer
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:48,479	| IOT229 |	What we try to look for our high-value at Coyote
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:49,759	| IOT229 |	Devices so we're looking for things
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:53,087	| IOT229 |	It does matter where
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:56,415	| IOT229 |	Security or safety quality
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:58,463	| IOT229 |	That's where we tend to focus on the industrial space
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:00,255	| IOT229 |	Okay so
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:02,559	| IOT229 |	That doesn't answer the question of what you're excited about
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,631	| IOT229 |	I'm always excited
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,399	| IOT229 |	To be constantly
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:11,775	| IOT229 |	So as we move into the 5G World here I think 5G
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:16,895	| IOT229 |	Akira but 5G working with multiple different Technologies is going to be a pretty cool thing
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:24,575	| IOT229 |	But some of the things that people are looking at with private Networks
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:30,207	| IOT229 |	Is opening up some new business cases that we have
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:36,095	| IOT229 |	Okay I agree with you I look at like 5G plus like the cbrs band radio
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:39,679	| IOT229 |	Spectrum auction that were thinking about how to do something like that and like oh my gosh
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,727	| IOT229 |	I can have my own corporate Network
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,263	| IOT229 |	What is that mean
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:48,383	| IOT229 |	In my career I've never seen so much Spectrum activity as we've seen it the last two years it's just
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:50,175	| IOT229 |	Wild how much Spectrum
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:51,199	| IOT229 |	Motion is going on
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:57,855	| IOT229 |	Some of the
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:04,511	| IOT229 |	Unlicensed bands in SEC should be hopefully
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:07,583	| IOT229 |	Adopting either later this year into the middle of next
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:13,215	| IOT229 |	I just opened up new Spectrum where devices can operate more networks and makes the world go round
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:19,103	| IOT229 |	And we'll see hopefully
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:20,127	| IOT229 |	Wireless radios
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:21,663	| IOT229 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:28,063	| IOT229 |	All right well I don't think so much for coming on the show this week I really appreciate it
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:34,463	| IOT229 |	That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot news sign up
