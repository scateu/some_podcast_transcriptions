EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:19,456	| IOT212 |	And we have
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:21,760	| IOT212 |	At a astonishing show for you today
EDL	00:00:23,808	00:00:26,112	| IOT212 |	This week we're going to be talking about a new
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:32,768	| IOT212 |	Program that you can load on your back book that will actually help you understand what iot devices are running
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:33,792	| IOT212 |	In your network
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:35,584	| IOT212 |	And how
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:36,352	| IOT212 |	Well behaved
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:39,168	| IOT212 |	Where else would I be talking about
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:42,752	| IOT212 |	Scary scary stories in the New York Times about
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:44,800	| IOT212 |	Facial recognition and overall privacy
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:47,872	| IOT212 |	Their supplies related to that plus
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:52,224	| IOT212 |	Intel's big news about getting out of modems doesn't apply to SMS
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:55,808	| IOT212 |	Inside but it does apply maybe on the iot side
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:56,576	| IOT212 |	We'll talk about that
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:01:01,696	| IOT212 |	We got a lot of self-driving car news you love news from Apple the US Army and wave
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:03,488	| IOT212 |	We've got
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,512	| IOT212 |	News about
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,304	| IOT212 |	Madame de and how to become

EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:41,536	| IOT212 |	Okay Kevin let's get this show started
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| IOT212 |	First step
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,352	| IOT212 |	We saw it last week
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,656	| IOT212 |	A couple of new stories about
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:48,448	| IOT212 |	Service called iot inspector
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,984	| IOT212 |	Everything about this
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,800	| IOT212 |	I realize that we'd actually talked about this
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,848	| IOT212 |	Almost a year ago we had a
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,640	| IOT212 |	Nick feamster over at Princeton
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,688	| IOT212 |	He and I talked about this
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,224	| IOT212 |	Program called iot inspector
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:03,040	| IOT212 |	An idea was he wanted to build something
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,136	| IOT212 |	That would monitor the iot devices on a user's Network
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,928	| IOT212 |	And see how they behave
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| IOT212 |	And lo and behold
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,000	| IOT212 |	Last week
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| IOT212 |	He launched
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,304	| IOT212 |	That app
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,352	| IOT212 |	So this is a
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:16,864	| IOT212 |	Princeton
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,400	| IOT212 |	Research project
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:24,288	| IOT212 |	Basically so when you download this to see how your devices Behavior also going to be in sharing that device data
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| IOT212 |	With the research
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:33,760	| IOT212 |	It is important to know if anybody does plan to use it Princeton does list all of the data that i r t s
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,272	| IOT212 |	Spectre collect
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,320	| IOT212 |	It's actually a lengthy list
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,600	| IOT212 |	I don't
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:42,976	| IOT212 |	Think I would person be concerned about it but if you're not willing to share any of that information
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,768	| IOT212 |	Certainly this is not something you want to run
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| IOT212 |	Well actually
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,352	| IOT212 |	You can delete
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:48,864	| IOT212 |	All of your day
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,680	| IOT212 |	At the end so you could just for yourself
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,704	| IOT212 |	And then you could
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:54,752	| IOT212 |	But
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,776	| IOT212 |	It's nice of you
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| IOT212 |	If you don't have qualms about it
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,336	| IOT212 |	This is the sort of
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:01,664	| IOT212 |	Third-party research that is hopefully going to
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,432	| IOT212 |	24 scumpa
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,200	| IOT212 |	I needs to be better
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,784	| IOT212 |	You can fight it iot - Inspector.
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT212 |	Princeton
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,064	| IOT212 |	. EDU
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,112	| IOT212 |	I downloaded it
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,160	| IOT212 |	And had it running for a while
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,672	| IOT212 |	Meister
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:17,536	| IOT212 |	Now I'm going to tell you my network is a little wacky right now because I am
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,815	| IOT212 |	In the midst of the moving
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,607	| IOT212 |	Time dismantling all of my iot device
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,143	| IOT212 |	So not everything is
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,167	| IOT212 |	Giving data
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| IOT212 |	But the things that are
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,239	| IOT212 |	Giving data or actually
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| IOT212 |	That's a pretty good devices on my
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,311	| IOT212 |	On my network
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,335	| IOT212 |	Believe it or not
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,615	| IOT212 |	They're good actors
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| IOT212 |	They are good at
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,663	| IOT212 |	So
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,479	| IOT212 |	Many of them such as some of the
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| IOT212 |	The better actors
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| IOT212 |	Where's that I see so
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,807	| IOT212 |	So far my Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,599	| IOT212 |	That behaves very well
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:46,207	| IOT212 |	Talking about encryption we're talking about not going weird places on the internet
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:49,023	| IOT212 |	Amazon Echo is actually doing
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,815	| IOT212 |	Pretty well and so is my Roku
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,095	| IOT212 |	So
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:52,863	| IOT212 |	Who knew
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:54,143	| IOT212 |	I would love to see my
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,935	| IOT212 |	Google devices but unfortunately May
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,983	| IOT212 |	Family unplugged
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,287	| IOT212 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:04,127	| IOT212 |	Well they're not sending any data that's the good news
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,455	| IOT212 |	Some things that are a little bit trouble
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,479	| IOT212 |	Not Troublesome but
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,783	| IOT212 |	Not user-friendly
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,575	| IOT212 |	The things that this program
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| IOT212 |	Picks up
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,135	| IOT212 |	They're not labeled
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,463	| IOT212 |	So like for me to figure out that my August video doorbell
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,999	| IOT212 |	Was listed on
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,023	| IOT212 |	I'm here I had to go and see
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,583	| IOT212 |	What that particular mystery device was talking
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| IOT212 |	The fact that I was talking
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,679	| IOT212 |	Into august.com at Rackspace CDN
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| IOT212 |	And some other
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,215	| IOT212 |	Video sites
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:30,751	| IOT212 |	That's my dawg
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,031	| IOT212 |	So there is that
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| IOT212 |	It is hard to tell this is not like
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| IOT212 |	Odoo user
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| IOT212 |	Most user
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,967	| IOT212 |	And some of my iot devices such as my wink
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,759	| IOT212 |	Carmi Ikea tradfri Gateway
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,063	| IOT212 |	Those are labeled as non iot
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,391	| IOT212 |	And if it thinks
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,671	| IOT212 |	That something is a
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,231	| IOT212 |	A phone or a tablet it actually doesn't
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| IOT212 |	Collect the data you need on it
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,583	| IOT212 |	So you have to enter the MAC address of these divide
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,351	| IOT212 |	Spices
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,631	| IOT212 |	To get it to download
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,679	| IOT212 |	Which is kind of frustrating
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:09,919	| IOT212 |	It is but I can understand why they took that approach it as there's a lot of a lot more personal information on people's phones and
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,967	| IOT212 |	What so if they don't want to
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,015	| IOT212 |	Cross that line and I totally respect that
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,807	| IOT212 |	Yes but as a warning
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,623	| IOT212 |	Do all of you guys were like yes I totally wanted
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,183	| IOT212 |	I do this you're probably going to want to you know have the Mac
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,743	| IOT212 |	Prefer some of your hub
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,535	| IOT212 |	Devices that most of the ones that
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| IOT212 |	It seems to think
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,327	| IOT212 |	ARROW computers
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,863	| IOT212 |	Are hubs
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,911	| IOT212 |	And in one case there's a thermostat that is
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,215	| IOT212 |	Homekit enabled so I'm not sure if it's
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,495	| IOT212 |	Homekit functionality that
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,799	| IOT212 |	That seems to be a common denominator here
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,871	| IOT212 |	I've got a couple devices that are using
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,639	| IOT212 |	Weekend
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,407	| IOT212 |	Scription butt
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:46,783	| IOT212 |	Actually I was surprised out of the 31 devices I have only 5 or using week or no in crib
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT212 |	So
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,087	| IOT212 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:57,279	| IOT212 |	No that's good that's very good to me then everybody smart home is different so obviously your results will vary if you use this but
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,583	| IOT212 |	It's nice that this is
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,887	| IOT212 |	The types of information that says checking
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,655	| IOT212 |	Such as
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,727	| IOT212 |	Who is contact who are the devices
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| IOT212 |	Pinging servers
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,287	| IOT212 |	Vagina is itchy
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,335	| IOT212 |	In the middle of nowhere or is it where you would expect
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,895	| IOT212 |	How much data is exchanged
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,967	| IOT212 |	Between the devices and how often
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:20,319	| IOT212 |	I think it looks for hard-coded passwords and such to but I'm not a hundred percent sure
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,599	| IOT212 |	Well we will get Shore
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,391	| IOT212 |	Because next week's guest is actually go
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,439	| IOT212 |	When are the creators of
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,999	| IOT212 |	So we'll get a lot
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| IOT212 |	Information on
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:35,423	| IOT212 |	What does is going to be used for so if you're a little uncertain you're like how I don't know if I want to download this yet until I really know I'm doing good in the world
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,215	| IOT212 |	Think you can wait
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| IOT212 |	And
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:38,751	| IOT212 |	We will
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| IOT212 |	Put that question
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,543	| IOT212 |	2
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,567	| IOT212 |	Danny who is one
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,591	| IOT212 |	The creators
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:48,991	| IOT212 |	And if you don't want to wait because right now this is only available for Mac OS
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,063	| IOT212 |	It is coming to Linux and coming to Windows
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:55,647	| IOT212 |	So you can sign up for waitlist if you're on either of those platforms
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:01,023	| IOT212 |	Or if you like me I just noticed that the source code is available written in Python
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,815	| IOT212 |	And I might put it together
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,351	| IOT212 |	Linux and
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,119	| IOT212 |	See if I can get a ride
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,959	| IOT212 |	The folks over at Prince
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:14,079	| IOT212 |	NFL say hey great let's give us that and we'll just Distributing
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,871	| IOT212 |	Make a cake
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| IOT212 |	All right
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,455	| IOT212 |	So that's how you can monitor
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,735	| IOT212 |	What devices are
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| IOT212 |	Baby
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,807	| IOT212 |	Giving up some of your privacy and
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,111	| IOT212 |	Security on your own network
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:31,999	| IOT212 |	Let's talk about the loss of privacy in everyday life the New York Times has been doing a story
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,535	| IOT212 |	Are series on privacy
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| IOT212 |	Rio Tierra
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,375	| IOT212 |	Alternatively like
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,911	| IOT212 |	Excited me because
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,191	| IOT212 |	It's great coverage and enrage me
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,215	| IOT212 |	Because it's stupid
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| IOT212 |	So
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,799	| IOT212 |	One of the better stories though
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,311	| IOT212 |	Was
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| IOT212 |	Basically
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,639	| IOT212 |	Reporters at the New York Times
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,919	| IOT212 |	Accessed
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,223	| IOT212 |	Publicly available webcams in the city
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,015	| IOT212 |	And then they ran
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,039	| IOT212 |	That
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| IOT212 |	Data that they had
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,599	| IOT212 |	Against
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,415	| IOT212 |	They used Amazon's recognition
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,999	| IOT212 |	Facial recognition service and they pulled photos from
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:08,095	| IOT212 |	The websites of offices around the places where the cameras were
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,375	| IOT212 |	And then
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,911	| IOT212 |	They were able to identify someone
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:11,935	| IOT212 |	People walking around
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,519	| IOT212 |	As you said they looked at
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:20,895	| IOT212 |	Public data public photos that were available on the web of people that may be in the area supposed to be
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,943	| IOT212 |	People who worked in the area
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,967	| IOT212 |	So it's not like they
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,759	| IOT212 |	You know we're spying
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,783	| IOT212 |	Were using
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:29,087	| IOT212 |	Photo is that working illegally to
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,135	| IOT212 |	Train the model of work yet
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,695	| IOT212 |	Actual results here
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,975	| IOT212 |	Rates
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,743	| IOT212 |	If it's
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,559	| IOT212 |	This is all publicly available photos
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| IOT212 |	Tied to the recognition system
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,423	| IOT212 |	Across from 60 bucks to do this for a day
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,191	| IOT212 |	And
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,727	| IOT212 |	Yeah they recognize actual people
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| IOT212 |	And even talk to her
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:50,591	| IOT212 |	Who was actually on his way to an appointment to meet a
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,615	| IOT212 |	Job candidate
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| IOT212 |	Tencent
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:55,199	| IOT212 |	So the way I look at this is
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,711	| IOT212 |	There's a couple
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,807	| IOT212 |	Personally I look at this and I'm like hey
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| IOT212 |	If someone has my photo
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,927	| IOT212 |	They can actually use a service like this
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,207	| IOT212 |	Pull camera data
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,743	| IOT212 |	From all over the place just to see if they
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,535	| IOT212 |	That's not crazy
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:10,815	| IOT212 |	And
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:13,375	| IOT212 |	As someone who's had a stalker in the fartist
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,399	| IOT212 |	To pass the scariest
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:20,287	| IOT212 |	And even if you think about governments have access to our
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| IOT212 |	Face
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,615	| IOT212 |	Because they have our passports and
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| IOT212 |	Driver's license
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,175	| IOT212 |	A lot of our drivers license
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,991	| IOT212 |	Data is now our face and our names are tied together
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,271	| IOT212 |	Database
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| IOT212 |	There's a new standard of driver's license
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,951	| IOT212 |	So if you imagine law enforcement being able to use the sort of service
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,463	| IOT212 |	Manhunt
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,815	| IOT212 |	Is it if there's a serial killer on the loose
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,327	| IOT212 |	Yay
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,399	| IOT212 |	They're just tracking like a dissident
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,423	| IOT212 |	Oh that's real nice
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,239	| IOT212 |	It really makes the surveillance State cheap
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| IOT212 |	Inaccessible to
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,543	| IOT212 |	More and more people and
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:53,823	| IOT212 |	It also
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:59,711	| IOT212 |	Makes it cheap and accessible to just anyone who wants to find out where you are like maybe your boss is like
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,503	| IOT212 |	Where they really sick
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,831	| IOT212 |	That's kind of where I was going this is not something that
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,599	| IOT212 |	Is
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,391	| IOT212 |	Difficult to do
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,207	| IOT212 |	It is easily accessible both be public
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:14,047	| IOT212 |	Photos liked an image search for me to be a hundred photo serum Shore
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| IOT212 |	And then using
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:19,423	| IOT212 |	Amazon service or any any similar service they want to pin this on Amazon of course
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:22,495	| IOT212 |	As well as publicly available cameras and
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:27,359	| IOT212 |	A New York City and it listen I know when I can have been over to London there's cameras everywhere so I know there
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,663	| IOT212 |	Regions of the world where this is already commonplace
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,735	| IOT212 |	But I'm in New York City in Atlanta's link
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:36,831	| IOT212 |	NYC kiosks which I used to use all the time there were there wi-fi kiosks
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,367	| IOT212 |	Better up and down
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| IOT212 |	Various parts of Manhattan
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:45,791	| IOT212 |	They all have two security cameras on those when you add in the actual traffic cams that are New York City you have access to light
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,095	| IOT212 |	3000 cameras
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,863	| IOT212 |	In
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:49,887	| IOT212 |	New York City
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,423	| IOT212 |	Dying at 2
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,959	| IOT212 |	Publicly available photos
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,007	| IOT212 |	I'm probably pretty easy to track when I go to New York City
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| IOT212 |	I'm so anybody could really do this
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| IOT212 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:11:59,871	| IOT212 |	And
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,639	| IOT212 |	Again
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,919	| IOT212 |	The stalking issue
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:04,479	| IOT212 |	Government surveillance is scary
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,503	| IOT212 |	And I'm definitely
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,527	| IOT212 |	We concerned about that
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,575	| IOT212 |	Imagine using it to profile pic
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,343	| IOT212 |	People who
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,879	| IOT212 |	Are in the ice databases
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,671	| IOT212 |	Sure
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,975	| IOT212 |	Or in just think about all the mistakes that cover
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:15,743	| IOT212 |	Hornets make rate
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,303	| IOT212 |	The people who are on the no-fly list without
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| IOT212 |	Recourse you know when
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,631	| IOT212 |	I got their life turns into a pain
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,911	| IOT212 |	Imagine something
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,935	| IOT212 |	Like a government era
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,471	| IOT212 |	Apply to some
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| IOT212 |	Something like this
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:31,871	| IOT212 |	Suddenly you're being monitored all the time by the government may be without any sort of due process
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,711	| IOT212 |	You don't have to match I just talked to anybody lives in China right now
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,991	| IOT212 |	And I say that because
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,295	| IOT212 |	We've covered what's going on over there with the
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:42,623	| IOT212 |	Cameras in the social scores and so on and so forth but
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:47,999	| IOT212 |	One of my classmates lived in China for 20 years and she's been in the US for the last five
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,535	| IOT212 |	We had a lengthy discussion
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,559	| IOT212 |	Over all of that
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,839	| IOT212 |	What's going on over there
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,399	| IOT212 |	The stories that you told me were scary
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,727	| IOT212 |	She's very careful how she speaks to her parents over
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:00,543	| IOT212 |	Video chat from the US to China I mean it's
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:03,359	| IOT212 |	Really scary so you don't have to imagine it just look what's going on there
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,199	| IOT212 |	Yeah that's my very inarticulate
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,711	| IOT212 |	The cravory
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,783	| IOT212 |	And I do think we need some pushback
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| IOT212 |	On the legislation
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,111	| IOT212 |	I hate when people are like it's too late
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,415	| IOT212 |	Like no it's not too late it is getting late
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,951	| IOT212 |	Don't get me wrong
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,999	| IOT212 |	The horse has run out of the barn
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,279	| IOT212 |	We can still
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:21,791	| IOT212 |	I'll pick some up
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,839	| IOT212 |	But that won't happen anytime soon
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| IOT212 |	Illinois
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:31,775	| IOT212 |	I know it's rather convenient that they were just looking at the keep Internet devices SAFE Act
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,359	| IOT212 |	The Illinois state senate they passed this act on April 10th
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,687	| IOT212 |	And basically it's a bill that would ban internet
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:41,247	| IOT212 |	Device manufacturers from collecting audio
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT212 |	From
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,551	| IOT212 |	Internet-connected devices
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,599	| IOT212 |	But without disclosing it to Consumers
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:50,719	| IOT212 |	Do seem to have a lot of teeth and there's a $50,000 fine and so on so forth
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,023	| IOT212 |	But the actual bill DACA
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,815	| IOT212 |	Past has a lot less
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,583	| IOT212 |	Teeth
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:14:00,191	| IOT212 |	And that's mainly because of two companies that were familiar with Amazon and Google
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,471	| IOT212 |	Who
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,239	| IOT212 |	Where
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,263	| IOT212 |	Kind of against it
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:07,615	| IOT212 |	Because why well they've got their neck microphones all over the place
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,663	| IOT212 |	People dying left and right so
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:10,943	| IOT212 |	Will said
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,223	| IOT212 |	You had to disclose if they
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,039	| IOT212 |	Yay
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,855	| IOT212 |	Creative penalties for accidental
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,391	| IOT212 |	Activations
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,415	| IOT212 |	In required
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| IOT212 |	Companies to explain what happened
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,487	| IOT212 |	And I can't Jackson
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:29,119	| IOT212 |	When suddenly you're sitting there and the TVs on or maybe don't say anything and all of a sudden Madame a pops
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,191	| IOT212 |	The weather in Kazakhstan is
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| IOT212 |	Is cold
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,823	| IOT212 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:41,663	| IOT212 |	You write an n and I've had Phantom digital assistant
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:46,015	| IOT212 |	Answers to questions I did not ask from time to time and it always makes me wonder but
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:47,807	| IOT212 |	You know
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,647	| IOT212 |	Certainly advocate for Consumer privacy
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| IOT212 |	And controls
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,743	| IOT212 |	I also understand that
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,303	| IOT212 |	The technology is not perfect and some things are just
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,351	| IOT212 |	Gosh darn it honest glitches
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,631	| IOT212 |	But there are times when
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:08,799	| IOT212 |	These things are getting hacked and people are listening to us when they shouldn't be well and I don't know if companies are necessarily
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,615	| IOT212 |	Putting in place the right practices to protect our privacy
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,175	| IOT212 |	We just found out that
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,455	| IOT212 |	There's a team of
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,503	| IOT212 |	Oaks at Amazon that
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,527	| IOT212 |	Listening on
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,551	| IOT212 |	Summit
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| IOT212 |	It's a small percentage
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT212 |	On the flip side
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,927	| IOT212 |	It takes the
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,207	| IOT212 |	Voice utterances and
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,975	| IOT212 |	Tries to
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:29,279	| IOT212 |	Warped the the audio so you can't tell
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,303	| IOT212 |	Who it is Amazon just
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,631	| IOT212 |	You need some sort of human accountability
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,191	| IOT212 |	Right humans have two
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,471	| IOT212 |	Check and make sure
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:37,983	| IOT212 |	Birthday is
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,031	| IOT212 |	Health Canada
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,615	| IOT212 |	But you know are there ways you can do it with
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:44,895	| IOT212 |	With more respect
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,431	| IOT212 |	People whose
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,711	| IOT212 |	Voice Taylor you're using problem
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:52,575	| IOT212 |	Yeah and I wonder I'm sure this wasn't the primary impetus of this
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:55,647	| IOT212 |	We spoke a few weeks ago about Google moving
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,207	| IOT212 |	Natural language processing to the edge
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,231	| IOT212 |	On devices
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,023	| IOT212 |	Supposed to being connected and sending it
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,047	| IOT212 |	To the cloud all the time
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,375	| IOT212 |	That's kind of like a benefit in my book that
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,655	| IOT212 |	They're gaining a little bit of
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:12,799	| IOT212 |	Saying hey you know not everything is going in the cloud anymore your data is local and more protected as a result
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:17,407	| IOT212 |	It gives them a chance to say that although again I don't think that was the reason I think the reason was
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:23,551	| IOT212 |	To enable more functionality when you don't have internet access and get more people using the service doesn't feel comfortable with them so
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:24,575	| IOT212 |	All right
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:25,599	| IOT212 |	That's all about connect
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| IOT212 |	Let's talk about until which
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,463	| IOT212 |	Is disconnecting from its modem business
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,279	| IOT212 |	It's actually
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,839	| IOT212 |	It's exiting is 5G smartphone
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:38,143	| IOT212 |	Modem business and then it will evaluate
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,935	| IOT212 |	Its modem business
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,447	| IOT212 |	4
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,983	| IOT212 |	PCS
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,263	| IOT212 |	Iot devices and
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,847	| IOT212 |	Also in line with this
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,407	| IOT212 |	These two stories are definitely related
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,943	| IOT212 |	Qualcomm and Apple
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,479	| IOT212 |	Settled their big
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,247	| IOT212 |	Licensing
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:53,759	| IOT212 |	Lawsuit
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:57,087	| IOT212 |	These are related because Qualcomm is basically
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,391	| IOT212 |	Should I say the best the only
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:02,207	| IOT212 |	The de facto standard when it comes to mobile modem
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,511	| IOT212 |	There you go that was good
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,279	| IOT212 |	The Defector
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,607	| IOT212 |	And Intel got into this business and
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,143	| IOT212 |	We heard a lot
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:14,495	| IOT212 |	Years ago when Intel got into this business and started actually producing these modems
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,287	| IOT212 |	We heard that they weren't very good
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,591	| IOT212 |	And my hunch is
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,407	| IOT212 |	Apple ended up settling with Qualcomm
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| IOT212 |	Because they realize that
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,991	| IOT212 |	They're going to Intel's not producing of Iowa
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT212 |	Basically
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,319	| IOT212 |	So they're just going to have to suck it up
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,343	| IOT212 |	Continue working
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,903	| IOT212 |	I think that's part of it
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,951	| IOT212 |	Intel modems actually have
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:36,767	| IOT212 |	Improved and certainly not to the standard of a
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| IOT212 |	Qualcomm modem but the most recent iPhones
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,631	| IOT212 |	Some models do you use the Intel modem
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,655	| IOT212 |	So Apple at least
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,935	| IOT212 |	Had enough
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,471	| IOT212 |	Faith in the product to
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,751	| IOT212 |	You know actually use them
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,031	| IOT212 |	But there was also talk
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,567	| IOT212 |	Recently about until being
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,127	| IOT212 |	Further behind on developing its 5
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,639	| IOT212 |	Cheap modem
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:53,919	| IOT212 |	Then Qualcomm
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,735	| IOT212 |	That put a pelota
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:01,087	| IOT212 |	I guess across roads like what we going to do here if we rely on them as a supplier
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,391	| IOT212 |	So I think they wanted to just go with
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,439	| IOT212 |	Call Camas results
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:08,511	| IOT212 |	It was just easier to settle and I don't know the settlement terms
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| IOT212 |	But
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,327	| IOT212 |	I believe it dropped all
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:14,911	| IOT212 |	Lawsuits there must be some money changing hands or some deal that says
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,983	| IOT212 |	We will use you as a primary modem supplier
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:20,543	| IOT212 |	Going forward for at least X number of years so
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,311	| IOT212 |	Yeah no
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,383	| IOT212 |	Twenty-something Tyler lights
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,431	| IOT212 |	Versus a $7
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,455	| IOT212 |	Licensing a so
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,247	| IOT212 |	My hunch is they
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,271	| IOT212 |	Damn it in the middle somewhere
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,295	| IOT212 |	Tia
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,343	| IOT212 |	Probably
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:38,975	| IOT212 |	But again it from Mobile standpoint we don't care as much for the show but Intel seems out of that business
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:40,767	| IOT212 |	What does it mean for Intel
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:43,839	| IOT212 |	Connectivity in smaller devices iot devices
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:47,679	| IOT212 |	They're going to look into it my gut says they're just going to exit this Market entirely
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:54,591	| IOT212 |	Because until it's finally after years and years of dominating so many
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,615	| IOT212 |	Key markets
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,127	| IOT212 |	Dave
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:01,759	| IOT212 |	Had a lot of frustration against the smaller upstarts and I wouldn't call arm small I was sleep but
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,551	| IOT212 |	Talk on being an arm licensee
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:08,415	| IOT212 |	I think they finally realized we have to pick and choose our battles a little bit more carefully
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,487	| IOT212 |	And yeah this is
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,559	| IOT212 |	Fun battle in Intel's gotten out of some of the iot
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,583	| IOT212 |	The smaller iot
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,095	| IOT212 |	Teechips in
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,655	| IOT212 |	So it does make sense
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,935	| IOT212 |	Kind of sad
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,727	| IOT212 |	And I don't know why I was never really
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:28,127	| IOT212 |	Sold on this I mean Intel had its a scale business way back in the day that was arm-based and they got rid of that
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,919	| IOT212 |	It really double down on
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,687	| IOT212 |	The current
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| IOT212 |	Conjecture
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,759	| IOT212 |	I see a lot more promise with Intel in there
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,551	| IOT212 |	Fpga business
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:40,671	| IOT212 |	The one thing I will say they do seem to be with movidius doing a lot with
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,975	| IOT212 |	Inference at the edge
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:46,047	| IOT212 |	Anti revisionism
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,607	| IOT212 |	That's not the radio side that's a processor side
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,399	| IOT212 |	So we'll probably still see them
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,423	| IOT212 |	There really were
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,471	| IOT212 |	That makes sense they should really
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,799	| IOT212 |	Hey speaking of
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,311	| IOT212 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,127	| IOT212 |	Apple
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,663	| IOT212 |	Apple apple apple
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,711	| IOT212 |	I still don't hate apples going to build
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:06,015	| IOT212 |	Car but it's clear to me that at the very least
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:11,391	| IOT212 |	Apple wants to be the platform that an autonomous vehicle runs on at some point in the future
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:14,207	| IOT212 |	They have been investing and lidar
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,279	| IOT212 |	Technology with their own internal groups
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,559	| IOT212 |	But
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:23,167	| IOT212 |	According to Reuters they have held talks with four companies are at least four companies
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,703	| IOT212 |	As possible suppliers for
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,263	| IOT212 |	Next-gen lidar sensors so
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:32,639	| IOT212 |	I'm not sure what their overall strategy is I still think it's to be the platform in up the vehicle
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:37,247	| IOT212 |	Per say not not a Tesla they're taking their time getting there for sure
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,063	| IOT212 |	But that's typical Apple will wait till everybody else
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,855	| IOT212 |	Enters the market and then will come in with a
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,367	| IOT212 |	Better product
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,647	| IOT212 |	And
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,927	| IOT212 |	Hopefully everybody will buy it
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,511	| IOT212 |	Everybody being used
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,327	| IOT212 |	Correct
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,351	| IOT212 |	Correct in this case
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,119	| IOT212 |	Is correct
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:58,495	| IOT212 |	You don't seem too enthused though that was a kind of a half-hearted yeah this whole area is so
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,775	| IOT212 |	Up in the air speaking of
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| IOT212 |	Wavo
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,823	| IOT212 |	They have an app
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,127	| IOT212 |	And we might be excited because like
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,175	| IOT212 |	Maybe it's not going to be the car manufacturer
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,479	| IOT212 |	Maybe it's going to be these weird
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:11,551	| IOT212 |	Third-party Transportation providers for self-driving cars
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:12,831	| IOT212 |	And
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,855	| IOT212 |	I don't I don't
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT212 |	So Weymouth
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:19,232	| IOT212 |	You can get it you can get it right now on the Google Play Store
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:24,096	| IOT212 |	And still unless you live in the Phoenix Metro area it really doesn't do you a bit of good
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| IOT212 |	But
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,144	| IOT212 |	It suggests that
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,680	| IOT212 |	Or alphabets waymo division
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:31,520	| IOT212 |	Is ready to start expanding Beyond its test area
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:36,384	| IOT212 |	In the Phoenix Metro area so that's a yay I guess depending on where they roll it out
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:41,248	| IOT212 |	I did not install the app but I saw the screenshots and I don't see any mention of
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,016	| IOT212 |	Cost of a
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:42,784	| IOT212 |	Arrived
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| IOT212 |	0
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT212 |	I don't get that
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,184	| IOT212 |	You know who does have driverless cars
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,744	| IOT212 |	Baidu
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,792	| IOT212 |	And this makes a lot of sense for me the US Army
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,816	| IOT212 |	They actually have
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:58,912	| IOT212 |	I wouldn't call him self-driving cars are more like self-driving
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:01,216	| IOT212 |	Trucks that would deliver supplies
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,008	| IOT212 |	People food and other supplies in
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,520	| IOT212 |	Combat zone
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:06,080	| IOT212 |	That makes total sense I mean why have
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:09,664	| IOT212 |	Why run the risk of injury to somebody or a group of people
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:12,224	| IOT212 |	You're deploying supplies in a Battlefield
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:14,528	| IOT212 |	When you can just have a self-driving
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,832	| IOT212 |	Filled with supplies handle it for you
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,648	| IOT212 |	I think it's selling some wonderful they're moving quickly on this
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:22,208	| IOT212 |	They demonstrated their first 10
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,256	| IOT212 |	Down to your way Fort Bliss Texas
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,584	| IOT212 |	And they have 60 additional trucks
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,400	| IOT212 |	Planning to be deployed it to other US military bases
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,424	| IOT212 |	Over the next year
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,472	| IOT212 |	They're on bases
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,104	| IOT212 |	It will be nice if they didn't have any combat to tuipulotu but yes
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,616	| IOT212 |	Yes
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,432	| IOT212 |	Get rid of the entire defense system
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,456	| IOT212 |	And poo
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:45,760	| IOT212 |	Yay
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,808	| IOT212 |	All right let's do some quick news bits
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:52,416	| IOT212 |	I've actually been looking into certifications I'm going to take my
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,696	| IOT212 |	Google Cloud
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:23:00,864	| IOT212 |	Developer associate certification test in a month or two but I just realized today that you can
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,888	| IOT212 |	Also be
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,912	| IOT212 |	A certified
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,960	| IOT212 |	Madame a skill Builder
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:10,080	| IOT212 |	So if you want to pad your resume and you like building meta mage skills
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:12,896	| IOT212 |	You can take a test to be a certified skill Builder
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,968	| IOT212 |	Speaking of other developments
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,504	| IOT212 |	AI
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:22,624	| IOT212 |	Has actually created a brand new sport that you yes you can play
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:28,000	| IOT212 |	The game is called speedgate I'll talk about the game in a second but what's really interesting is
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,280	| IOT212 |	How this was created
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,328	| IOT212 |	A group of
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,352	| IOT212 |	Developers
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:36,704	| IOT212 |	Akqa which is a global Innovation agency
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,008	| IOT212 |	Has trained a neural network
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| IOT212 |	By feeding it
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:43,616	| IOT212 |	Information on over 400 traditional Sports
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,408	| IOT212 |	And the AI came out
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,944	| IOT212 |	With a sport called
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,504	| IOT212 |	It looks really cool
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:53,088	| IOT212 |	It's got a ball very similar to what rugby has
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,904	| IOT212 |	You kicking pass that ball kind of like
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,928	| IOT212 |	Rugby & Soccer
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,464	| IOT212 |	There is no
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:03,328	| IOT212 |	Kicking hitting biting scratching her than like that allow thank you AI for that
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,400	| IOT212 |	Basically there are three sets of gates
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,704	| IOT212 |	On the field that the AI develops
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,728	| IOT212 |	You kick
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,776	| IOT212 |	Or pass the ball through the center gate
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,800	| IOT212 |	Which lets you then
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:15,360	| IOT212 |	Score you would then have possession to score
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,384	| IOT212 |	In the end gate
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:21,248	| IOT212 |	I wish you can do this by throwing or kicking the rug be blackballed
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:24,064	| IOT212 |	There are three forwards and three Defenders on every team
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:27,136	| IOT212 |	And I think it's kind of cool there's a whole speedgate
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,184	| IOT212 |	Website where you can see the
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:33,280	| IOT212 |	Rules the field and you can say I want spaghetti in my community in
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,560	| IOT212 |	I don't think this will be the next
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,864	| IOT212 |	Sport of America on TV but
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,376	| IOT212 |	It looks like fun
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:43,008	| IOT212 |	When you go
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:46,080	| IOT212 |	Only four more people
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:49,664	| IOT212 |	Yes we can go tell him about it
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,432	| IOT212 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,456	| IOT212 |	Play Quidditch
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,224	| IOT212 |	Is a
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,760	| IOT212 |	Sometimes sponsor the show
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:25:00,160	| IOT212 |	They have their own code lock which is there wi-fi lock and now it works with the ring doorbell so when people come
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| IOT212 |	Senior ring
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| IOT212 |	You can
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,464	| IOT212 |	Unlock your lock
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,744	| IOT212 |	Write 4 with
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,256	| IOT212 |	Open the app
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,048	| IOT212 |	Cool
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,352	| IOT212 |	And mortifications are always good
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,144	| IOT212 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,168	| IOT212 |	I'd love to see that with
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,704	| IOT212 |	Other doorbells I know she likes Ben
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,496	| IOT212 |	With Amazon for their Amazon
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,264	| IOT212 |	Key programmer
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,800	| IOT212 |	I assume this is an outlet
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:17,312	| IOT212 |	Play or something like that
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,616	| IOT212 |	It is this is Amazon key
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| IOT212 |	As someone who
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,664	| IOT212 |	Does not have
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,944	| IOT212 |	Ring doorbell
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,712	| IOT212 |	Right now I have an August
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,552	| IOT212 |	If I had a nest doorbell which is the next
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,320	| IOT212 |	Doorbell I will have
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,600	| IOT212 |	Ben
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,880	| IOT212 |	Love for that
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,392	| IOT212 |	To work together
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:32,672	| IOT212 |	One day I will
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,232	| IOT212 |	Question actually this week
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,024	| IOT212 |	Not for me
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:40,608	| IOT212 |	Loser hotline this was a email question about reading openhab
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,376	| IOT212 |	Or home assistant
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,424	| IOT212 |	We had someone who wanted to run it
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,704	| IOT212 |	In the cloud so
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,472	| IOT212 |	Kevin
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:48,800	| IOT212 |	Can I answer that question on our blog but we also wanted to talk about it
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,896	| IOT212 |	Yeah for those who aren't familiar openhab and homeassistant are
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,712	| IOT212 |	Localized open source
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:59,552	| IOT212 |	Smart home platforms so if you want like total control over everything
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,112	| IOT212 |	And you're a DIY person you can do this with
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,416	| IOT212 |	Like a $35 Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,696	| IOT212 |	What
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,000	| IOT212 |	This was an interesting question because
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:14,400	| IOT212 |	The person who wrote inside is there an easy way to set up a site-to-site VPN to Azure or AWS or I presume Google Play
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,168	| IOT212 |	The platform YouTube
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,448	| IOT212 |	Didn't mention that one
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,728	| IOT212 |	And host my
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:24,128	| IOT212 |	Containers in the cloud that way I could host them and compare them easily until I get a final solution to run
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,640	| IOT212 |	Locally
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,432	| IOT212 |	I love that idea
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:31,552	| IOT212 |	Because yeah I mean you got to set up Ally systems and spend time to figuring them and
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,088	| IOT212 |	By the time you set it all up your kind like
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:37,184	| IOT212 |	It's good enough I'm not going to try the other system cuz I don't have to have more hours to figure this all out but
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,744	| IOT212 |	It's actually quite easy to do this
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,024	| IOT212 |	With openhab
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:43,328	| IOT212 |	It is not so easy if I can
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,376	| IOT212 |	Find a way to do it with home assistant
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,912	| IOT212 |	And the main reason is
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:51,008	| IOT212 |	Homeassistant they don't believe in the cloud as a
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,288	| IOT212 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,568	| IOT212 |	Platform I guess
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,848	| IOT212 |	They have a nice
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:57,152	| IOT212 |	Blog posts that I've liked you in my post
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:59,712	| IOT212 |	Basically saying you know the clouds magical it's great
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| IOT212 |	But if it
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,296	| IOT212 |	Breaks down
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:06,368	| IOT212 |	Your house should be able to continue functioning so
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:11,744	| IOT212 |	It's really an extension of your smart home not running your smart home is what they say so I get why I could not find
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,280	| IOT212 |	Home assistant in the cloud
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:16,608	| IOT212 |	Openhab know you could do it and you can do with containers if you
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:19,936	| IOT212 |	I want to set up a Docker container that are easy to follow instructions
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,984	| IOT212 |	Do you want to set it up yourself
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:24,544	| IOT212 |	Command lines I found tutorials and
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:31,200	| IOT212 |	Most of them are on AWS but the same principles apply to say Google Cloud platform on Microsoft azure
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,504	| IOT212 |	You pretty much have to set up a
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:36,832	| IOT212 |	Computing instance very low power you don't need any massive witch
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:39,904	| IOT212 |	Your cost increase as you add more resources to the cloud
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,696	| IOT212 |	Set everything up in
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,720	| IOT212 |	You you could do it
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,000	| IOT212 |	I'd say just bite the bullet
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,560	| IOT212 |	It's been 35 bucks on a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:47,584	| IOT212 |	Even if
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,864	| IOT212 |	You
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:53,216	| IOT212 |	Don't use it for this long-term there's so many things you can do with a pie so that's just me
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,008	| IOT212 |	I would do that as opposed to
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,800	| IOT212 |	Running in the cloud and entering
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,824	| IOT212 |	Some cost
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,872	| IOT212 |	Although you can get a free 2-year free
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,408	| IOT212 |	Trial of these Cloud products
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,480	| IOT212 |	I cycle with the pie but yes you can do with it with that
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,576	| IOT212 |	Copart
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,344	| IOT212 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,648	| IOT212 |	And I promise you guys a
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:13,696	| IOT212 |	Discussion of iot industrial security
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,464	| IOT212 |	Because
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:14,976	| IOT212 |	Bossman
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,768	| IOT212 |	From the middle of March
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,560	| IOT212 |	We all heard about
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,096	| IOT212 |	In aluminum
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,376	| IOT212 |	Company called norsk Hydro
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:28,288	| IOT212 |	What happened is they had ransomware that infected their systems and shut them down costing them up to 41
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,312	| IOT212 |	Million dollars
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:29,824	| IOT212 |	Is pretty bad
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:36,736	| IOT212 |	And a company called cyberex which does industrial iot security they published a blog post about the ransomware
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,248	| IOT212 |	Which is called
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,784	| IOT212 |	Locker Goga
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,064	| IOT212 |	Basically talking about
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,344	| IOT212 |	What it is
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:44,672	| IOT212 |	Or what they think it is cuz we don't have a full post
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:49,536	| IOT212 |	So what they did is they now can identify Locker go go
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:52,352	| IOT212 |	And they talked about how
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:53,632	| IOT212 |	Attack
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,216	| IOT212 |	So what they think happened
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:00,544	| IOT212 |	Was the attackers gain access to the system
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:03,104	| IOT212 |	Through an exposed remote
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,384	| IOT212 |	Connection so I can RDP
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,968	| IOT212 |	They also likely use stolen credentials or they did it
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:08,992	| IOT212 |	Password at
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,552	| IOT212 |	The stolen credentials if they stole them
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,344	| IOT212 |	In a lot of the Industrial
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,880	| IOT212 |	Hacking attacks
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,928	| IOT212 |	What cyber axes
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,952	| IOT212 |	David Arch tour
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,488	| IOT212 |	This week was that
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,560	| IOT212 |	A lot of times they're getting those passwords
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,864	| IOT212 |	From contractor so third-party contract
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:30,496	| IOT212 |	The IT world is pretty familiar with this after the Sony hack which happened because
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:32,288	| IOT212 |	The attackers got access
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,056	| IOT212 |	Through third-party
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,592	| IOT212 |	Contractors to Sony's
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,104	| IOT212 |	Computer system
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,896	| IOT212 |	So I think a lot of
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:40,480	| IOT212 |	Corporate it Department separately Earth with this but maybe not a lot of
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,504	| IOT212 |	Industrial
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,552	| IOT212 |	Companies and there's a lot of sharing have
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:47,648	| IOT212 |	Not only are there 3rd party contractors that you might share
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:49,440	| IOT212 |	Files and data width and let the money
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,464	| IOT212 |	Corporate Network
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:53,536	| IOT212 |	A lot of times those people can actually come on your OT
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:56,096	| IOT212 |	Your operational Tech Network that isn't even connected to
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,120	| IOT212 |	Internet
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:01,984	| IOT212 |	So those guys might come in and plug their laptops directly into like some equipment so they
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:02,752	| IOT212 |	Can diagnose something
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,056	| IOT212 |	Wrong in that case that's when the mall
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:06,848	| IOT212 |	On your OT Network
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,688	| IOT212 |	This is a big problem it shuts down Manufacturing
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:13,504	| IOT212 |	Cuz like safety issues can cause a
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| IOT212 |	A lot of problems
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,576	| IOT212 |	And it is becoming more
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,624	| IOT212 |	Common because manufacturers
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,928	| IOT212 |	Because it is so expensive to shutdown a Manufacturing
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,976	| IOT212 |	They will pay rental
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,304	| IOT212 |	That makes them a delicious Target
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,120	| IOT212 |	In addition cybrex found that the
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:32,448	| IOT212 |	Rental car here actually increased in sophistication
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,984	| IOT212 |	Over a few months
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,544	| IOT212 |	So earlier versions of the software were not as good
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:40,640	| IOT212 |	And they saw that there was plenty of food that have been
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,944	| IOT212 |	Adapted basically to make it a little bit more
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,968	| IOT212 |	A little bit better
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:45,248	| IOT212 |	We're not going to get too into the weeds here
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,784	| IOT212 |	So
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:49,088	| IOT212 |	Basically this points to the sophistication
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,624	| IOT212 |	The growing sophistication
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,136	| IOT212 |	Attack
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:57,280	| IOT212 |	It also highlights what I would say is a key
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:00,352	| IOT212 |	Best practice if you're going to bring contractors in
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,424	| IOT212 |	Which many many companies do for very good reason
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| IOT212 |	They should be
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:05,984	| IOT212 |	Given
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,056	| IOT212 |	A corporate-owned device
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:09,824	| IOT212 |	That has been
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:13,408	| IOT212 |	You know found to be clean and clear
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,688	| IOT212 |	Sanitizer
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:17,248	| IOT212 |	I'd rather than using maybe their own devices and such which
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,832	| IOT212 |	You know you if you've brought in a potential bad actor by allowing
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:26,208	| IOT212 |	Non manage devices on to your network for good reason you brought them in but still that doesn't justify it
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,744	| IOT212 |	So they mean
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:30,304	| IOT212 |	Particular software for Diagnostics and such but
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:33,888	| IOT212 |	That should be worked out in advance and that should be added to the managed
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:34,400	| IOT212 |	Devices
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:38,240	| IOT212 |	And make sure that they are clean and then that's at the shouldn't be
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,032	| IOT212 |	Using their own devices to connect to network
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,312	| IOT212 |	Or two devices
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:45,152	| IOT212 |	Yeah and I will say in the industrial world
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:48,224	| IOT212 |	Companies like Honeywell and Emerson have done a lot of work with me
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:50,272	| IOT212 |	Like USB drive so they will inspect
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:51,808	| IOT212 |	USB drives
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,856	| IOT212 |	There are devices on the factory
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,392	| IOT212 |	Plug in your us
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:56,928	| IOT212 |	Ensure device
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,488	| IOT212 |	Shoot a text anyting it shuts it
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,280	| IOT212 |	Can't use it
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,560	| IOT212 |	So maybe
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,328	| IOT212 |	Given
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:06,144	| IOT212 |	How highly specific some of the software is and how
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,424	| IOT212 |	Proprietary it is
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,752	| IOT212 |	If you could have some sort of help scan
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:11,520	| IOT212 |	Other device
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,032	| IOT212 |	Before it gets in
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:17,152	| IOT212 |	And the other solution which obviously cybrex is promoting
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,176	| IOT212 |	Because they are in network
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:19,200	| IOT212 |	Work monitoring solution
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,504	| IOT212 |	Is to have some sort of
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:24,064	| IOT212 |	Awareness of what's traversing your network
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:29,440	| IOT212 |	And there are tons of companies not just cybrex doing this but it is becoming increasingly important
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,048	| IOT212 |	How do I coyote inspector for the home
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,096	| IOT212 |	I was just going to say that
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:36,864	| IOT212 |	Full circle
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:39,424	| IOT212 |	Dunedin and the industrial version of that
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,448	| IOT212 |	So

EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,176	| IOT212 |	. IO
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,200	| IOT212 |	Alarm system
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,480	| IOT212 |	Diggy
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:30,624	| IOT212 |	Thinking is a really terrible way to do this but what this device does is it connect to SmartThings Hub and
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,648	| IOT212 |	Your alarm panel
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,440	| IOT212 |	It's a very much a DIY Thing
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:35,488	| IOT212 |	And it allows you
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:40,864	| IOT212 |	To turn your old alarm system your old wired alarm system into something that you can use
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:41,376	| IOT212 |	Command
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,424	| IOT212 |	Very cool
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:45,472	| IOT212 |	Get a lot of questions about that so somebody else can
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:47,776	| IOT212 |	Try this and play with it
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:48,288	| IOT212 |	Aspen device
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:52,384	| IOT212 |	This week's question is from
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:52,896	| IOT212 |	Scott
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:56,992	| IOT212 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin this is Scott in Houston
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:01,344	| IOT212 |	I have a question regarding smart locks which I've been researching
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,368	| IOT212 |	Quite some time
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:05,696	| IOT212 |	Is there any such thing as a double cylinder
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,464	| IOT212 |	Smart Lock
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:12,608	| IOT212 |	I noticed the sealant single-cylinder smart locks but I would like to have a double cylinder Smart Lock
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,632	| IOT212 |	Security
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:16,448	| IOT212 |	And yes this can be used online
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| IOT212 |	Thank you
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:20,544	| IOT212 |	Okay Scott this is actually pretty easy answer
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:26,432	| IOT212 |	Because right now these things don't exist and they don't exist because most modern building codes don't allow
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:27,968	| IOT212 |	Double cylinder
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:31,040	| IOT212 |	These are locks for those of you or not
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,320	| IOT212 |	Two player that need to be
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:35,136	| IOT212 |	Unlocked with a key from both the inside and the outside
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:42,304	| IOT212 |	The reason people tend to gravitate to them is because they are concerned about someone like breaking a window and then reaching in
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:42,816	| IOT212 |	Hainan opening up the
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,120	| IOT212 |	And then getting access to
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,936	| IOT212 |	My in-laws actually had these locks
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:48,448	| IOT212 |	For a long time
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:50,752	| IOT212 |	And I had nightmares about the
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| IOT212 |	I'm dying in fires
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,568	| IOT212 |	Because they never knew where the keys were in
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,080	| IOT212 |	It was such a pain
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:55,616	| IOT212 |	So
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:35:01,248	| IOT212 |	In the case of a connected lock if you had a keypad on both sides that might actually
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,552	| IOT212 |	Address some of the issues in the sense that
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:05,344	| IOT212 |	If you don't know the keypad you can unlock
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,648	| IOT212 |	Leave in a few
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:12,768	| IOT212 |	Broken Window you couldn't get in because you wouldn't know the combinations cuz if you knew the combination you would bring the window
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,304	| IOT212 |	But it does
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:18,656	| IOT212 |	There's still the issue of if you need to get out what if you're a guest in the house if you don't know the cam
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:19,168	| IOT212 |	Combination
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,192	| IOT212 |	How do you get
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:23,264	| IOT212 |	Or the batteries go out on the
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:23,776	| IOT212 |	Lock
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:27,360	| IOT212 |	Yeah it still has a safety concern issue there
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,664	| IOT212 |	I don't I don't love her
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:35,808	| IOT212 |	Yeah I mean some people I know I wouldn't mind locking them in their house but no in general now
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:39,904	| IOT212 |	I'd be shocked if a manufacturer came out with a just because the
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,952	| IOT212 |	Building codes have moved away from this
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:42,976	| IOT212 |	No
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,816	| IOT212 |	And Manuel Roxas
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,424	| IOT212 |	But nobody makes a smart one right now
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,288	| IOT212 |	There you go Scott
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:58,848	| IOT212 |	Alright that concludes this week's News segment

EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:37,984	| IOT212 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is done.
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,800	| IOT212 |	Deer Israel who is the CTO and co-founder
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,592	| IOT212 |	A security firm
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:43,360	| IOT212 |	Arvest
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,640	| IOT212 |	Hi dear how are you doing
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,456	| IOT212 |	Hi Stacy I'm great how are you
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,504	| IOT212 |	I am really excited to talk to you
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,272	| IOT212 |	Although
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:51,552	| IOT212 |	I better not as a
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,600	| IOT212 |	Excited as you guys because you just raised
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:56,672	| IOT212 |	Last week 65 million in funding
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:58,720	| IOT212 |	That is a lot of money what is happening with our
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:02,816	| IOT212 |	Pharmacist doing really great
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:03,840	| IOT212 |	I think it will
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:06,912	| IOT212 |	Great for the company maybe slightly more problematic
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,192	| IOT212 |	The fact that we're seeing a lot of
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:11,008	| IOT212 |	Problems in the world with iot so in that sense
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:14,592	| IOT212 |	There's a lot of space for us to come and help organizations
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,128	| IOT212 |	Help them protect themselves
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:21,504	| IOT212 |	Dangers about but we've had quite a year say that's a lot of new clients
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:24,320	| IOT212 |	A lot of very large organizations that are
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:28,928	| IOT212 |	Using us for disability and security of different devices that they have
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:33,280	| IOT212 |	And I realize that's a made-up word but it's what we're trying to say so
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,048	| IOT212 |	It's been tremendous
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,328	| IOT212 |	In that
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:39,680	| IOT212 |	I think that the new investment is really about doubling down and
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,960	| IOT212 |	Being able to provide that
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,728	| IOT212 |	Solution
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:42,752	| IOT212 |	Better for everybody
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:44,800	| IOT212 |	Okay and I would say
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:48,384	| IOT212 |	How big is actually I'm going to say all the way since Mariah
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,920	| IOT212 |	We've been hearing a lot about diode
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| IOT212 |	Security
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:56,320	| IOT212 |	Now I would love to make the distinction between some of the devices that the original Mirai botnet
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:59,392	| IOT212 |	I took over which word Network video cameras printers routers
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,696	| IOT212 |	They actually were devices that
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:05,280	| IOT212 |	They had more processing power they were little bit smarter
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,560	| IOT212 |	And they had access to more bandwidth
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,096	| IOT212 |	And I think
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:11,936	| IOT212 |	It's worth talking about the distinction between those types of devices
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:15,520	| IOT212 |	And some of the iot devices that were a little bit more worried about
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,800	| IOT212 |	Now which might
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,848	| IOT212 |	Like you say their agent list Maybe
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:21,152	| IOT212 |	If they're resource-constrained maybe there
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:21,920	| IOT212 |	Hard to find
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:24,736	| IOT212 |	So can you kind of make the distinction between
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,016	| IOT212 |	Where We Are
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:30,368	| IOT212 |	In our sophistication when it comes to understanding and securing iot devices
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:33,952	| IOT212 |	Yeah I would separate the world probably
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,976	| IOT212 |	Not So Much by
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:40,096	| IOT212 |	Processing power but by the types of devices are out there and what are they running
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:40,864	| IOT212 |	Basically
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:43,424	| IOT212 |	The world pretty much separates into
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,704	| IOT212 |	Devices that run
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:47,264	| IOT212 |	Standards albeit old operating systems
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,568	| IOT212 |	And then the devices that run
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:52,128	| IOT212 |	Criteri software firmware
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:55,455	| IOT212 |	Now there is a correlation in a way to what you described the wrong kind of
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:56,479	| IOT212 |	Compute power
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:42:01,343	| IOT212 |	Really boils down into what's running really old windows Android limit
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:03,391	| IOT212 |	And what's running very very specific
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:11,071	| IOT212 |	Very big I would say that
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:11,839	| IOT212 |	A lot of device
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,119	| IOT212 |	She's out there that you wouldn't even
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,143	| IOT212 |	Consider
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:15,423	| IOT212 |	Types of Opera
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:18,239	| IOT212 |	All the way to digital microscopes
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:21,311	| IOT212 |	ATMs that you can tour controller that are running Windows
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:23,359	| IOT212 |	There's all kinds of smart assistant
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,639	| IOT212 |	Something like that
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:29,759	| IOT212 |	Old versions of Linux and Android
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:33,087	| IOT212 |	This is the thing where you sign into work every day a lot of those things are
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:39,231	| IOT212 |	Running really old Android well so I would say that the world of those devices actually very very large in the reason I bring them up
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:43,071	| IOT212 |	It's because these are devices that very easily
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:46,143	| IOT212 |	Can track any type of malware that you can imagine
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:54,079	| IOT212 |	Craft something very special they don't need to do something that specifically targets those devices they're just really really easy pickings
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:58,687	| IOT212 |	Because they're vulnerable to things that should have gone away
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,223	| IOT212 |	A long time ago
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,991	| IOT212 |	Operating
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:02,271	| IOT212 |	Up to date and patched
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:05,087	| IOT212 |	Those are
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:11,231	| IOT212 |	For the most part the resurface that organizations are worried about now naturally there's all kinds of things that are
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:14,303	| IOT212 |	And specifically abused devices that have
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:15,071	| IOT212 |	Specific
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:19,679	| IOT212 |	We'd even seen you mention the ride but we've even seen a variant of Mirai in Singapore
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,959	| IOT212 |	Just a month ago
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:25,567	| IOT212 |	What specifically crafted to take advantage of things that are there but for the most part
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:29,407	| IOT212 |	The wannacry is not pictures of the world the variety of different botnets and crypto mining
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,199	| IOT212 |	Ransomware
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:33,759	| IOT212 |	General malware all these things the reason
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:34,783	| IOT212 |	Iot is
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:37,855	| IOT212 |	So so dangerous is because you don't need to do anything
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:44,255	| IOT212 |	Specialty
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:47,327	| IOT212 |	Problems for organization that they try to clean up
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:49,119	| IOT212 |	What is the Trenta
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:53,471	| IOT212 |	Obviously we're reading in surveys there plenty of surveys that come out each month
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:55,007	| IOT212 |	How to say oh my gosh
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:59,871	| IOT212 |	CIO CTO CEOs are all worried about the security of their connected devices
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:02,431	| IOT212 |	And there feels like a sense of panic
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,759	| IOT212 |	And many are not sure what to do about
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,527	| IOT212 |	This
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:08,319	| IOT212 |	But we've been here before
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,111	| IOT212 |	I feel like
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:12,159	| IOT212 |	We've had this Panic before we talked about
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,695	| IOT212 |	Viruses on
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:15,231	| IOT212 |	Computers that sort of thing that says
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:16,255	| IOT212 |	Still happening
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:19,327	| IOT212 |	We've had it with app system so Lake
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,351	| IOT212 |	How should we think about the
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| IOT212 |	This is the world really ending or can we solve
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:27,519	| IOT212 |	I think generally optimistic approach about solving problems I think that this
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,543	| IOT212 |	Pierpoint
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:29,567	| IOT212 |	Comes in Cycles
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:34,431	| IOT212 |	I think that's the best thing to equate this to is 10 years ago the world application
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:39,039	| IOT212 |	Same deal all kinds of applications running on my devices or being accessed by my devices
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:41,599	| IOT212 |	I as a cecilware CIO
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:47,231	| IOT212 |	Have no idea what they are I completely blind into what people use what they tag is transferred into them
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:52,095	| IOT212 |	And specifically the risks around that or the ability to just one anything was a problem
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,631	| IOT212 |	Income
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:45:00,031	| IOT212 |	All kinds of solutions including connection firewalls or things like that which basically gives you a good idea
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:04,895	| IOT212 |	What's running and also provide the Intelligencer on understanding what should run and what should men take action against
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,175	| IOT212 |	I think the
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,711	| IOT212 |	Coyote in essence
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:09,247	| IOT212 |	Is physical application
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:11,039	| IOT212 |	Cytus basically
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:12,831	| IOT212 |	It's purpose-built devices
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:16,671	| IOT212 |	That function is applications except they have a physical reality
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,719	| IOT212 |	And I would say that the same problem
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:22,047	| IOT212 |	That existed 10 years ago for applications exist today for devices
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:26,911	| IOT212 |	Most organizations don't know what devices they have even if they do know all kinds of devices
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,191	| IOT212 |	They have no idea
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,983	| IOT212 |	What they should be worried about with
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,007	| IOT212 |	Princeton
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:37,151	| IOT212 |	They don't necessarily know that a particular brand of Chinese IP camera has a known Chinese government back door built-in
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:39,199	| IOT212 |	And this is something that comes up
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:43,807	| IOT212 |	I would say someone scary time schedule
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:44,575	| IOT212 |	Come up a lot
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:47,903	| IOT212 |	What is various forms in various ways. The point is that
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:49,183	| IOT212 |	Disability
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:51,231	| IOT212 |	Is the first driver in
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,511	| IOT212 |	Security for almost
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,791	| IOT212 |	What do I have
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:55,071	| IOT212 |	And what do I need to know about
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,887	| IOT212 |	Then the second piece of that puzzle is what do I do about it
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:45:59,423	| IOT212 |	Basically what can I do to
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:00,191	| IOT212 |	Securities devices
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:03,263	| IOT212 |	And thankfully a lot of these devices are
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:05,311	| IOT212 |	Bring me reliant on their connectivity
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,615	| IOT212 |	Which is also what creates the resurface
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,383	| IOT212 |	In the first place
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:11,199	| IOT212 |	I would say that being able to intelligently
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:15,039	| IOT212 |	Limited connectivity intelligently police what these devices can do
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:17,343	| IOT212 |	Is a very very effective method at
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:20,159	| IOT212 |	Securing them and that's really the bread and butter of what
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,439	| IOT212 |	Imagine
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:25,279	| IOT212 |	An organization that has no idea what devices they have
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:31,679	| IOT212 |	At all and then you come in and show them if we show them a complete inventory of all the devices that they have
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:35,519	| IOT212 |	On top of that layer in the intelligence of what they should know about all these devices
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:40,127	| IOT212 |	What they know about the risk provide easy steps into
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:40,895	| IOT212 |	Securing them
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:46,783	| IOT212 |	This is really in a nutshell organizations seem to be concerned about also what they're trying to solve
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:52,671	| IOT212 |	So how worried should an organization be I feel like right now when you buy some of these connect
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:53,183	| IOT212 |	Two devices
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:58,815	| IOT212 |	Your elevator company is like a let's do elevators as a service and you're like yeah that sounds great
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:01,119	| IOT212 |	Or maybe someone comes in with a connected lighting pack
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:03,679	| IOT212 |	Are companies aware that their broadening their attack
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:07,519	| IOT212 |	That is a terrific question
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:09,567	| IOT212 |	Because I can throw that in many cases
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:12,639	| IOT212 |	Surprisingly enough no they don't the reason is that
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,407	| IOT212 |	Traditionally
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:14,687	| IOT212 |	Things like
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,711	| IOT212 |	Office spaces
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,735	| IOT212 |	Building automation
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:18,271	| IOT212 |	System seems like that
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:21,087	| IOT212 |	They don't really go through any type of IP
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:24,159	| IOT212 |	Think about TVs in the hallway
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,951	| IOT212 |	For instance of a building for a company
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:29,279	| IOT212 |	Normally the people who install that are third-party contractors
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:32,607	| IOT212 |	The facilities group are the one that can track them in the first place
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:33,887	| IOT212 |	It's not really
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:37,471	| IOT212 |	A process that goes through the general it procurement process
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,519	| IOT212 |	Now not just that
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:44,127	| IOT212 |	You mentioned two different things that happen a lot and I'll focus on the elevator one because it's an interesting
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,711	| IOT212 |	The reason is that
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:48,991	| IOT212 |	It's just a cost reduction
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:50,015	| IOT212 |	Basically
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:52,831	| IOT212 |	The company that sells the elevators wants to go to
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:54,879	| IOT212 |	Support them remotely so they don't have to send
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:59,487	| IOT212 |	Ignition every time there's a problem
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:01,279	| IOT212 |	A very good thing
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,815	| IOT212 |	Up until the point you realize
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:04,607	| IOT212 |	That elevator needs to be connected
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:05,375	| IOT212 |	Somehow
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,143	| IOT212 |	To the internet
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:08,191	| IOT212 |	And usually that somehow is through
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:10,751	| IOT212 |	Other companies infrastructure basically the network
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,519	| IOT212 |	Alba company
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:13,311	| IOT212 |	Spell that presents an interesting dilemma
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,591	| IOT212 |	Because on the one hand
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:16,127	| IOT212 |	It security at that point
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:17,919	| IOT212 |	If they suddenly realize that that's happening
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:23,039	| IOT212 |	Can come and say there's no way I'm connecting an elevator in my building to my network to the internet
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:25,087	| IOT212 |	At that point
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,367	| IOT212 |	The company would come and say
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:29,695	| IOT212 |	But they give us a 20% discount for doing this so of course we're doing
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:35,327	| IOT212 |	I think that it security are increasingly facing these types of issues where the mission of the business
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:38,143	| IOT212 |	Something around the way the business works
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:39,423	| IOT212 |	Is demanding
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:41,215	| IOT212 |	The more and more of these things you put in
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:43,263	| IOT212 |	Digital transformation is creating
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:44,031	| IOT212 |	My conference
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:45,055	| IOT212 |	Screeding
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:47,871	| IOT212 |	Supply chains that have dinner connected devices between the
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:52,735	| IOT212 |	They're creating building automation systems like connected elevators that service all but really
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,039	| IOT212 |	All of these
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:58,879	| IOT212 |	Are creating a mounting resurfaced where the security is put in a position where
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:02,719	| IOT212 |	They don't want want to be the one to say no they want to be the ones who say
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,743	| IOT212 |	How to do it
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:04,255	| IOT212 |	Correctly
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:08,351	| IOT212 |	How to integrate all these things without a proper solution
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:11,935	| IOT212 |	That makes no sense so then the solution for them is
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,727	| IOT212 |	Please do not say by yourself
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:17,055	| IOT212 |	Putting aside for a second
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:18,591	| IOT212 |	Armistead the solution
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:21,407	| IOT212 |	It really comes down to the same principles that
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:22,431	| IOT212 |	Always guide
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,479	| IOT212 |	Security When approaching these types of problem
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:26,527	| IOT212 |	It's around disability
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:28,319	| IOT212 |	Monitoring analytics about proactive
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:31,135	| IOT212 |	Disability means they have to be aware of all the
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:33,695	| IOT212 |	Things we have to be aware of what connected to network
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:35,231	| IOT212 |	There are multiple ways to go about this
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:38,303	| IOT212 |	And a lot of companies are trying out different strategies
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:40,095	| IOT212 |	But the point is that the first step
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:45,471	| IOT212 |	Is for security to realize that there is nothing that's really outside of their scope
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:46,239	| IOT212 |	Responsibility
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:48,031	| IOT212 |	In five years ago
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:48,799	| IOT212 |	Cecil's
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:50,335	| IOT212 |	Expected to protect IP cameras
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:53,151	| IOT212 |	Allan Block metabolism in a lot of other things happening
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:49:59,807	| IOT212 |	And it's the same with everything else
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,855	| IOT212 |	And it starts with visibility
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:02,879	| IOT212 |	Being able to
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:04,927	| IOT212 |	Count for every device that you have
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:08,255	| IOT212 |	Also means being able to account for the risk surface that they create
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:10,815	| IOT212 |	Basically all those folks
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:13,119	| IOT212 |	Got hit by one guy or not text you
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:15,935	| IOT212 |	The device of the godhead were essentially unmanaged devices
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:17,215	| IOT212 |	Every device that has endpoints
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:20,543	| IOT212 |	I would have thought something like that
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:23,103	| IOT212 |	But the problem is that if you have even one device
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:26,431	| IOT212 |	Tucked away in some closet somewhere or sometimes even
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:31,807	| IOT212 |	Buried inside a wall because 10 years ago there was a server running Windows XP
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:34,111	| IOT212 |	All these devices it's an app that you have
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:34,879	| IOT212 |	1
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:38,975	| IOT212 |	Just one device and it to take down an entire facility so the visibility
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:40,255	| IOT212 |	Being able to
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:41,791	| IOT212 |	Account for all these things is key
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,071	| IOT212 |	Elmo 2nd pieces
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:44,351	| IOT212 |	General Lee
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:45,375	| IOT212 |	Airport hygiene
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:47,423	| IOT212 |	Around device is being able to implement policy
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:48,447	| IOT212 |	No matter how you do it
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:50,239	| IOT212 |	You do it automatically if you do it
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:51,007	| IOT212 |	Manually
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:52,287	| IOT212 |	Policies are really important
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:53,055	| IOT212 |	Like I said
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:54,335	| IOT212 |	Connectivity is the main thing
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:56,127	| IOT212 |	The Relief Society
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:58,687	| IOT212 |	The main aspect of what makes them
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:50:59,967	| IOT212 |	Markdown quote on quote
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,759	| IOT212 |	And so limiting
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:03,039	| IOT212 |	Connectivity intelligently
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:04,575	| IOT212 |	Is really really the most
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:05,599	| IOT212 |	Important part in policing
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:08,159	| IOT212 |	And also of course with reducing risk
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:11,487	| IOT212 |	Go back to your question I would say that
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:13,023	| IOT212 |	Getting a good handle
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:16,351	| IOT212 |	And a good comprehensive handle it that at all the assets
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:17,631	| IOT212 |	The organization
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:18,399	| IOT212 |	Is
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:19,935	| IOT212 |	The first step it's
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:21,727	| IOT212 |	So I would say Primary in that
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:23,519	| IOT212 |	Such a basic step
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:25,567	| IOT212 |	That all the rest after that
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:28,127	| IOT212 |	Wolf logo directly from what you find out
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:29,919	| IOT212 |	And trust me organizations find out
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:30,943	| IOT212 |	All kinds of
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:33,759	| IOT212 |	Anything from connecting treadmill
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:36,831	| IOT212 |	All the way to door controllers are running Windows
EDL	00:51:36,831	00:51:38,367	| IOT212 |	From 20 years ago
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,391	| IOT212 |	There's all kinds of ants
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:40,159	| IOT212 |	Interesting stuff
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:41,183	| IOT212 |	Connectnetwork these days
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:45,023	| IOT212 |	Let's break down some of the crazier things you've seen
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:45,791	| IOT212 |	We'll have a little fun here
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:47,327	| IOT212 |	What have you seen running on
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:50,655	| IOT212 |	That you're like oh that's connected and surprise
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:53,983	| IOT212 |	Wow all kinds of things
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:55,007	| IOT212 |	First of all
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:52:01,407	| IOT212 |	The treadmill part is really interesting I mean most companies don't even consider the fact there is such a thing of a connected treadmill
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:02,943	| IOT212 |	That happens more often.
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:04,991	| IOT212 |	I assume these are in company gyms
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:07,551	| IOT212 |	Yeah sometimes it's company gym
EDL	00:52:07,551	00:52:12,159	| IOT212 |	Sometimes by the way it's things that employees are departments bought for themselves
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,183	| IOT212 |	I just connected
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:15,487	| IOT212 |	So not always is at the
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:19,327	| IOT212 |	Play Gym specifically where that but yeah that would be one of them
EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:22,911	| IOT212 |	I think that there's a wide variety of gaming consoles and things like that
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:23,423	| IOT212 |	Peopleconnect
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:24,703	| IOT212 |	Again
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:27,263	| IOT212 |	Things that depending on your point of view it might seem
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:28,799	| IOT212 |	Trivial and it might be very slow
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:32,895	| IOT212 |	Surprisingly surprised to find just how many they have
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:33,663	| IOT212 |	Connected
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:34,687	| IOT212 |	Smart assistant
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:37,503	| IOT212 |	Seems like you know Amazon Echo and Google home
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:38,527	| IOT212 |	Some things like that
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:40,063	| IOT212 |	Absolutely all over the place
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:41,855	| IOT212 |	Digital microscopes
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:42,623	| IOT212 |	You wouldn't
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:44,927	| IOT212 |	Never in a million years think run Windows
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:47,999	| IOT212 |	Not only are these types of things connected to network
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:50,047	| IOT212 |	In some cases they can even be
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:54,911	| IOT212 |	Patient zero in spreading things like wannacry for instance or kind of other types of ransomware
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:53:00,543	| IOT212 |	And by the way you name one example before I think a lot of organizations don't realize just how much of your building automation
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:03,103	| IOT212 |	Just how many
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:04,383	| IOT212 |	Things like
EDL	00:53:04,383	00:53:06,943	| IOT212 |	Door controllers or lighting fixtures or
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:09,503	| IOT212 |	All kinds of other things are connected their Network
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:16,415	| IOT212 |	And just for the heck of it all to say that's a lot of companies don't realize that these kind of emergency call stations like
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:16,927	| IOT212 |	You know how you have them
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:22,303	| IOT212 |	Can always sometimes these defibrillators but kind of emergency nurse call station
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:24,351	| IOT212 |	These types of things are also network-connected
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:26,143	| IOT212 |	No one even knows
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:29,215	| IOT212 |	Definitely interesting things that come up
EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:30,751	| IOT212 |	When you do kind of a discovery like that
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:33,055	| IOT212 |	Okay I like that
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:35,615	| IOT212 |	And let's talk one of the things
EDL	00:53:35,615	00:53:39,711	| IOT212 |	Been talking about recently on the show is this idea of connected medical device
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:41,247	| IOT212 |	Connected medicine
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:42,015	| IOT212 |	And and
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:45,343	| IOT212 |	I worry a lot about this because I feel like hospitals
EDL	00:53:45,855	00:53:47,903	| IOT212 |	It security is not their strong suit
EDL	00:53:48,671	00:53:49,695	| IOT212 |	People's lives
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:50,719	| IOT212 |	Hopefully their strong suit
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:51,487	| IOT212 |	So
EDL	00:53:51,487	00:53:55,839	| IOT212 |	What are you seeing in the medical world because they are really embracing connectivity in ways that
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:57,631	| IOT212 |	Figure very helpful
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:53:58,655	| IOT212 |	But are also
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:53:59,167	| IOT212 |	Little bit scary
EDL	00:53:59,935	00:54:00,959	| IOT212 |	First of all
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:03,775	| IOT212 |	Hospitals have gone through quite the transformation
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:05,055	| IOT212 |	Over the past 2 years
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:07,359	| IOT212 |	From being an install being
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:08,895	| IOT212 |	Very very obviously
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:09,663	| IOT212 |	Patience
EDL	00:54:09,663	00:54:14,271	| IOT212 |	Saving oriented
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:15,551	| IOT212 |	The problem is this
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:18,111	| IOT212 |	That exact orientation also made them Target
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:19,647	| IOT212 |	They're increasingly the target
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:22,207	| IOT212 |	Cyber attacks that are meant to Cripple their operations
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:24,767	| IOT212 |	So where once
EDL	00:54:24,767	00:54:27,839	| IOT212 |	Hospitals mostly have to worry about stealing of patient
EDL	00:54:27,839	00:54:28,351	| IOT212 |	Information
EDL	00:54:29,375	00:54:30,143	| IOT212 |	Something like that
EDL	00:54:30,143	00:54:32,703	| IOT212 |	Today they're handling a much tougher situation
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:33,727	| IOT212 |	What happens
EDL	00:54:33,727	00:54:34,495	| IOT212 |	Someone
EDL	00:54:34,495	00:54:36,287	| IOT212 |	Takes over your MRI machine
EDL	00:54:36,287	00:54:37,311	| IOT212 |	It cost you
EDL	00:54:37,311	00:54:37,823	| IOT212 |	Quite a bit
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:39,615	| IOT212 |	And takes it offline
EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:43,711	| IOT212 |	Most hospitals is a really a really tough one
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:44,479	| IOT212 |	I mean
EDL	00:54:44,479	00:54:46,271	| IOT212 |	They need that device
EDL	00:54:46,271	00:54:47,807	| IOT212 |	Deceit lies they need it back
EDL	00:54:47,807	00:54:49,343	| IOT212 |	What is it
EDL	00:54:49,343	00:54:53,439	| IOT212 |	Statistics show that if you pay ransom for ransomware
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:54,719	| IOT212 |	You're going to get hit again
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:58,303	| IOT212 |	It kind of makes sense in a cynical way but it's just the way the world works
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:55:01,375	| IOT212 |	So increasing over the past two years
EDL	00:55:01,375	00:55:02,911	| IOT212 |	More and more hospitals
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:03,679	| IOT212 |	Realize
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:07,263	| IOT212 |	But they have to get a handle on what's going on with their medical devices
EDL	00:55:07,263	00:55:09,055	| IOT212 |	They have to get a handle on everything
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:09,823	| IOT212 |	Carmen
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:11,103	| IOT212 |	And I have to do it quickly
EDL	00:55:11,103	00:55:12,383	| IOT212 |	So your point
EDL	00:55:12,383	00:55:13,407	| IOT212 |	Understanding
EDL	00:55:13,407	00:55:16,479	| IOT212 |	Network-connected medical devices understanding their weaknesses
EDL	00:55:16,991	00:55:20,831	| IOT212 |	Standing what they should or should not be doing it being able to lock everything down
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:22,367	| IOT212 |	Is a very very
EDL	00:55:22,367	00:55:22,879	| IOT212 |	Big thing
EDL	00:55:23,903	00:55:24,927	| IOT212 |	Large Hospital
EDL	00:55:24,927	00:55:26,975	| IOT212 |	Today and I would answer that
EDL	00:55:26,975	00:55:33,375	| IOT212 |	That's some of the problems that they face is that a lot of the medical devices that they have kind of the earlier points
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:35,935	| IOT212 |	Are running really old
EDL	00:55:35,935	00:55:36,447	| IOT212 |	Standard Opera
EDL	00:55:37,215	00:55:38,751	| IOT212 |	Sothink Windows XP
EDL	00:55:38,751	00:55:40,031	| IOT212 |	Sync Windows 7
EDL	00:55:40,031	00:55:41,055	| IOT212 |	Which is going to be end of life
EDL	00:55:41,567	00:55:43,359	| IOT212 |	These are things that
EDL	00:55:43,359	00:55:44,639	| IOT212 |	Are hard for that because
EDL	00:55:44,639	00:55:45,663	| IOT212 |	Medical devices
EDL	00:55:45,663	00:55:48,223	| IOT212 |	Given everything that they know true
EDL	00:55:48,223	00:55:48,991	| IOT212 |	Application
EDL	00:55:48,991	00:55:51,551	| IOT212 |	All the different certifications of these devices went through
EDL	00:55:51,551	00:55:53,599	| IOT212 |	Names of the hospitals also camp
EDL	00:55:53,599	00:55:58,207	| IOT212 |	Securecrt traditional
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,487	| IOT212 |	Monitor
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:02,559	| IOT212 |	Take a look what they're doing so they're in a very very
EDL	00:56:02,559	00:56:03,583	| IOT212 |	Christine
EDL	00:56:04,351	00:56:05,375	| IOT212 |	Let's spin
EDL	00:56:05,375	00:56:08,703	| IOT212 |	2 second with chatting about maybe what we see happening
EDL	00:56:08,703	00:56:09,727	| IOT212 |	Types of device
EDL	00:56:09,727	00:56:10,751	| IOT212 |	I would say that
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:13,567	| IOT212 |	Beyond the general sense of these are problems
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:15,103	| IOT212 |	I can tell you from our own
EDL	00:56:15,871	00:56:22,271	| IOT212 |	So we've seen anything from MRI machines that were taken over and connected to command and control servers in Russia
EDL	00:56:22,271	00:56:26,879	| IOT212 |	All the way to ransomware spreading across Hospital networks in general
EDL	00:56:27,391	00:56:28,415	| IOT212 |	Even one
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:30,207	| IOT212 |	Fairly elaborate case where
EDL	00:56:30,207	00:56:33,023	| IOT212 |	Client hospital was faced with a situation
EDL	00:56:33,023	00:56:35,839	| IOT212 |	Where infusion pump connected to a live patient
EDL	00:56:35,839	00:56:38,143	| IOT212 |	Have malware running on it but it wasn't
EDL	00:56:38,655	00:56:41,727	| IOT212 |	In the scenario where you can't disconnected because there's a person connected to it
EDL	00:56:42,239	00:56:43,775	| IOT212 |	So they have to have a nurse
EDL	00:56:43,775	00:56:47,871	| IOT212 |	Sit next to me all night and make sure that device is still operational.
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:50,431	| IOT212 |	Shutting down not doing anything weird and
EDL	00:56:50,431	00:56:52,479	| IOT212 |	That's a situation that I think that's most
EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:56,319	| IOT212 |	Hospital that's kind of a doomsday scenario reaching that point
EDL	00:56:56,319	00:56:58,367	| IOT212 |	Kill Point around kind of what to do about all this
EDL	00:56:59,135	00:57:01,951	| IOT212 |	So the answer is that you have to take
EDL	00:57:01,951	00:57:05,535	| IOT212 |	The very design of these devices into account when you're approaching the problem
EDL	00:57:06,815	00:57:08,351	| IOT212 |	All these devices
EDL	00:57:08,351	00:57:11,423	| IOT212 |	At the end of the day the risk surface that they pose
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:11,935	| IOT212 |	Is
EDL	00:57:13,983	00:57:18,335	| IOT212 |	So connectivity is exactly
EDL	00:57:19,103	00:57:20,127	| IOT212 |	A lot of these devices
EDL	00:57:20,639	00:57:22,431	| IOT212 |	We're not designed
EDL	00:57:22,431	00:57:24,223	| IOT212 |	Security in my car not too much security
EDL	00:57:24,735	00:57:26,271	| IOT212 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:57:26,271	00:57:29,087	| IOT212 |	Things like open ports and Communications a lot of things that can be abused
EDL	00:57:29,855	00:57:31,391	| IOT212 |	And what I say is that
EDL	00:57:31,391	00:57:32,671	| IOT212 |	That very connectivity
EDL	00:57:32,671	00:57:36,767	| IOT212 |	Is exactly what any solutions that tries to solve this problem
EDL	00:57:36,767	00:57:37,535	| IOT212 |	Have to look at
EDL	00:57:38,559	00:57:39,327	| IOT212 |	I hope that that has
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:42,911	| IOT212 |	All right we'll do dear thank you so much for coming on the show.
EDL	00:57:43,935	00:57:44,703	| IOT212 |	Thank you very much.
EDL	00:57:45,215	00:57:51,615	| IOT212 |	That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you
