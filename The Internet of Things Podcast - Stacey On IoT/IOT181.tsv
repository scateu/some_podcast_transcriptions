EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,560	| IOT181 |	Let's get started
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,328	| IOT181 |	Which
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| IOT181 |	Voice
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,888	| IOT181 |	We got some new stats from Adobe
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:16,192	| IOT181 |	None of these really surprised me
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,240	| IOT181 |	But I will admit to having
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,800	| IOT181 |	I think I hard voice
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,080	| IOT181 |	Smart speaker user
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:22,848	| IOT181 |	In Seattle came out
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:28,224	| IOT181 |	The big thing is 70% of people report using a voice assistant
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,528	| IOT181 |	Music 64%
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:32,064	| IOT181 |	Museum for weather
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:34,368	| IOT181 |	53% use it to ask fun question
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,648	| IOT181 |	All of that is true
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,184	| IOT181 |	Children laptop
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:43,072	| IOT181 |	The I don't ask fun questions me maybe before the show is we're just kind of goofing off or something
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,352	| IOT181 |	Not so much in everyday life
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:48,704	| IOT181 |	Not so much I know that on my Echo Show sometimes it'll show me
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,472	| IOT181 |	Questions to ask
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,264	| IOT181 |	Ask Madame a
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,592	| IOT181 |	What we call Amazon Echo
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,360	| IOT181 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,128	| IOT181 |	Assistant
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,920	| IOT181 |	So we don't set off yours so it's like
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,736	| IOT181 |	Ask Madame what the big news is today
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,528	| IOT181 |	My daughter in heaven
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,064	| IOT181 |	Oh
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,344	| IOT181 |	What is the big news
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,624	| IOT181 |	And that's usually
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:12,512	| IOT181 |	Yeah and you're right about this report from Adobe they asked 1000 us
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| IOT181 |	Smart
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,840	| IOT181 |	Speaker owners what they do with their devices
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:20,448	| IOT181 |	It wasn't anything any new activities or like old I should try that but what was interesting is
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:23,008	| IOT181 |	Be kind of rank the usage patterns
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,800	| IOT181 |	And those stats you just
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:28,384	| IOT181 |	Phone number for primary activities the ones that I use
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,920	| IOT181 |	Are the emerging use cases
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:33,760	| IOT181 |	Which is weird because I've been using these for so long and I guess
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,296	| IOT181 |	I don't know I just weird but
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,880	| IOT181 |	I'm looking at things like only 31% use them for smart on the commands
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,904	| IOT181 |	4
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,184	| IOT181 |	Yeah or
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:44,000	| IOT181 |	36% from making calls
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,304	| IOT181 |	That is more of an emerging use case because that's
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| IOT181 |	More
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,888	| IOT181 |	Relatively new features I get that one
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,936	| IOT181 |	The people actually asked about their calendar.
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:56,032	| IOT181 |	Schedule for sports scores just as much as I do smart home commands
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,616	| IOT181 |	I'm like wow maybe just cuz we've been doing the smart on things so much
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,896	| IOT181 |	Longer than most people
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:01,664	| IOT181 |	Yeah I think this
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,176	| IOT181 |	Said we're definitely
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:06,016	| IOT181 |	But we are definitely
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,296	| IOT181 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,088	| IOT181 |	And I was actually curious so
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,624	| IOT181 |	Food delivery
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,648	| IOT181 |	Domino's has had
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,976	| IOT181 |	A skill for a while
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,768	| IOT181 |	Hotel and flight research
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| IOT181 |	Are you doing that
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| IOT181 |	No not there
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,351	| IOT181 |	Okay that was my thought
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,167	| IOT181 |	Set a temperature to be like
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:30,335	| IOT181 |	Maybe just maybe it is a really good feature that we're not using because I mean we book travel and when you do it
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,663	| IOT181 |	Later I do it I typically go through an app or through the web
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,199	| IOT181 |	Yeah I'm almost all web
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:39,295	| IOT181 |	Because I want to see all the options in right now
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,319	| IOT181 |	My apps are all like
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT181 |	That's just crazy
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:49,279	| IOT181 |	Yeah so other things to know is 32% of consumers reported owning a smart speaker in August 28th
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,327	| IOT181 |	Looks like a third of
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,095	| IOT181 |	Consumers
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:55,167	| IOT181 |	Here in the US this is compared to 28% in January
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,983	| IOT181 |	Of this year so it's a 14% increase in 8 months
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:03,359	| IOT181 |	I don't know I didn't think that makes total sense to me people are constantly sending in questions
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,127	| IOT181 |	Stop the show they're like
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,407	| IOT181 |	Hey which one should I get
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,687	| IOT181 |	For I just bought one
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| IOT181 |	What should I do now
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,015	| IOT181 |	Basically people are more
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| IOT181 |	Comfortable really curious
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,599	| IOT181 |	Cuz it talks about
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,159	| IOT181 |	How people who have these start becoming
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| IOT181 |	You mentioned
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,743	| IOT181 |	That your family doesn't
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,767	| IOT181 |	Like talking to
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,559	| IOT181 |	Smart speaker is that changing at all
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:23,839	| IOT181 |	You know
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:28,703	| IOT181 |	If you were to just ask me and I can think of that I take that is not changing and all they barely use it
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,239	| IOT181 |	I have to admit
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,775	| IOT181 |	As I think back
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,311	| IOT181 |	Oversaw the past
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,591	| IOT181 |	Seizure year-and-a-half
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,919	| IOT181 |	They probably do and I think of cases like
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:41,503	| IOT181 |	Are downstairs lights come on before dusk every night
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| IOT181 |	Automatic just have
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,855	| IOT181 |	But if it's cloudy out it's a little darker before that
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,391	| IOT181 |	So my wife
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:51,999	| IOT181 |	Is sitting in the living room and it's dark and she will say Madam a turn on the downstairs
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,583	| IOT181 |	Not maybe that's because there's really not much of an alternative for her because
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:59,167	| IOT181 |	You know she knows if she messes or touches switches in the house
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,447	| IOT181 |	That's going to mess things up
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,727	| IOT181 |	So maybe it's by
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:06,079	| IOT181 |	Sheer lack of choices but yeah she's doing it she doesn't seem as self-conscious about it
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:09,407	| IOT181 |	Voyager wife
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,687	| IOT181 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,527	| IOT181 |	It's forced adoption
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,319	| IOT181 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:21,695	| IOT181 |	Not really speaking voice actually but this is the other side of switches
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,487	| IOT181 |	Something else idevice talking to you
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,535	| IOT181 |	Maybe instead of you talking to a device
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,327	| IOT181 |	If this then that or if
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT181 |	We talked about it all the time
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:35,519	| IOT181 |	We use it till I connect web services to devices or web services to other web services
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,799	| IOT181 |	Using simple if this happen
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT181 |	Do that to me
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,895	| IOT181 |	They have an integration now with Sonos
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,455	| IOT181 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,223	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,271	| IOT181 |	Michael was to create
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,807	| IOT181 |	I have a right now I'm testing
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,319	| IOT181 |	Nest
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:55,231	| IOT181 |	It is sometimes the doorbell chime
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| IOT181 |	I think this is the nest issue
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,815	| IOT181 |	I think it's tired
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,839	| IOT181 |	Is that a legitimate
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,607	| IOT181 |	Excuse I don't know
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:03,167	| IOT181 |	But I was like when people press the doorbell
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| IOT181 |	Let's have the Sonos make
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:09,055	| IOT181 |	Unfortunately the nest is not supported and if that particular
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,847	| IOT181 |	Aspect of it
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,639	| IOT181 |	Cameras seem to have support
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT181 |	Vanessa
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:13,919	| IOT181 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:23,391	| IOT181 |	And I just been playing with my weird motion sensors are things happening
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| IOT181 |	X
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,695	| IOT181 |	You do need to be careful
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,511	| IOT181 |	It becomes really irritating really quickly
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,071	| IOT181 |	Like for example when your phone gets into your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,351	| IOT181 |	Zone
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,119	| IOT181 |	Having
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,143	| IOT181 |	George theme song play
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,935	| IOT181 |	It sounds like a lot of fun
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,703	| IOT181 |	But
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,775	| IOT181 |	It kind of sucks when you come into your wife
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:42,591	| IOT181 |	It's like 2 in the morning and everybody Sonos comes on
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:53,343	| IOT181 |	Yeah I could see that being annoying so coming home from say travel or something yet were even like if you hooked it up with
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,135	| IOT181 |	They supported webcam that one
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,159	| IOT181 |	Camera saw you
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,183	| IOT181 |	Walk in the house
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| IOT181 |	It would play your songs or whatever
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,047	| IOT181 |	If somebody taking a nap or something like that that's probably not cool
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,607	| IOT181 |	You can set time limits oh
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,631	| IOT181 |	Unless it is
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,143	| IOT181 |	Between
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,423	| IOT181 |	10:00 at night
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:11,007	| IOT181 |	Sexy morning I have to be careful because my daughter has a Sonos in her
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,799	| IOT181 |	And she goes to bed earlier than everyone
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,663	| IOT181 |	Just little things to think about but you can't have a lot of fun with this
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,735	| IOT181 |	I think an interesting use case would actually be a button
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| IOT181 |	So if you have their lots of
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,831	| IOT181 |	Logitech pop buttons I've tested
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,391	| IOT181 |	Pebblebee buttons a lot of those are supported
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,415	| IOT181 |	On if
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,207	| IOT181 |	And you can actually create a button that plays your
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| IOT181 |	Your favorite song
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,327	| IOT181 |	Your favorite playlist
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,935	| IOT181 |	I feel like coming on
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,447	| IOT181 |	Quick
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,775	| IOT181 |	Aside from choosing like a predefined
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,055	| IOT181 |	Centos favorite
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,615	| IOT181 |	Song album artist cetera playlist
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,383	| IOT181 |	You
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:52,991	| IOT181 |	Get quite a bit of functionality here generation aside from basic playback controls
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,831	| IOT181 |	Pause resume next previous you can even control the volume so
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,903	| IOT181 |	You have a doorbell and supported in the doorbell rings Maybe
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| IOT181 |	They couldn't mute
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:04,767	| IOT181 |	This I know so you can go answer the door and peace and quiet
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,607	| IOT181 |	That is actually one of my favorite things that the yonomi software did
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,399	| IOT181 |	I just started this I'm glad you mentioned that
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,191	| IOT181 |	Whenever my phone would ring
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,519	| IOT181 |	It would actually mute my Sonos has that were playing
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| IOT181 |	Which is kind of sucky if
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,591	| IOT181 |	Like my daughter
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,663	| IOT181 |	My phone re
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:25,503	| IOT181 |	Insert news cases this is actually really nice
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:29,343	| IOT181 |	You know you could actually set that up on your iOS or Android
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:29,855	| IOT181 |	Easily
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:34,719	| IOT181 |	I wonder I haven't looked at the new if denigration but I wonder if you can
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,743	| IOT181 |	Set this to
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,559	| IOT181 |	Specific Sonos devices so that if you have multiple ones
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,351	| IOT181 |	Maybe your daughter is doesn't mute button
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| IOT181 |	The one in your living room
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,983	| IOT181 |	So I kiss you
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| IOT181 |	A lot of options
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,543	| IOT181 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,103	| IOT181 |	Okay next we have a ginormous
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,895	| IOT181 |	Semiconductor deal
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,711	| IOT181 |	You guys know how much I love my semiconductor
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,503	| IOT181 |	So this is Renee sis
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,015	| IOT181 |	It is
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT181 |	Agreed
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:02,623	| IOT181 |	To buy integrated device technology Inc
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,183	| IOT181 |	46.79
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| IOT181 |	This helps
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| IOT181 |	Renee says get into
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| IOT181 |	Semiconductors
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,327	| IOT181 |	Sand
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| IOT181 |	You guys may not be
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,655	| IOT181 |	Here where this but today's cars have
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:17,215	| IOT181 |	So much silicone on them it is a
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,239	| IOT181 |	Huge deal with
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,031	| IOT181 |	Qualcomm CSR
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| IOT181 |	Then later when
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,151	| IOT181 |	Tried to buy nxp automobiles were actually the driving
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:33,599	| IOT181 |	Shell Manassas is second only to nxp in auto-related chips and it's got about 30% of the market
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| IOT181 |	Kit for microcontroller
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,415	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,975	| IOT181 |	It does need the analog chipset integrated device
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| IOT181 |	And just so you guys
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| IOT181 |	Analog chips are those that can
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| IOT181 |	Convert analog stick
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,631	| IOT181 |	Signals like sound waves
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| IOT181 |	Analog day
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| IOT181 |	Any sort of physical
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| IOT181 |	Happening in to digital
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:54,079	| IOT181 |	And that's really important cars for like pressure sensors
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,687	| IOT181 |	So this isn't like a super secret
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,015	| IOT181 |	Kind of deal is part of a larger Trend in
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,831	| IOT181 |	Consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,855	| IOT181 |	Part of this is
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,623	| IOT181 |	Because
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,159	| IOT181 |	As you get into iot
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,207	| IOT181 |	Average selling prices of the
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:10,975	| IOT181 |	The chips
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,743	| IOT181 |	Are much lower
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,047	| IOT181 |	You are selling a whole lot more
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| IOT181 |	But they're cheaper
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| IOT181 |	So you really need a lot more
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| IOT181 |	Is a scale associated
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,983	| IOT181 |	He had two quick notes to the store a man it's good news
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,263	| IOT181 |	For Sure Fit industry
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:26,079	| IOT181 |	This is the second big acquisition
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:31,455	| IOT181 |	Vanessa says made this year and those two Acquisitions including the 6.7 now total 10 billion dollars
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,759	| IOT181 |	That's a big chunk of change they bought
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,551	| IOT181 |	Intersil witch again
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,831	| IOT181 |	Yes analog ships
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,879	| IOT181 |	Free sample but the other thing to know
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,927	| IOT181 |	And I know this IDT which
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,999	| IOT181 |	Okay yes they have chips that they can supply for the automaker's
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:47,327	| IOT181 |	They only generate 11% of their revenue from Automotive
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,631	| IOT181 |	Industrial businesses so I just wonder if
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,935	| IOT181 |	It's a big price to pay for
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,215	| IOT181 |	For what they're getting we'll have to see
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,495	| IOT181 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:59,615	| IOT181 |	Global did put Renee cesana negative credit watch
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,895	| IOT181 |	A lot of crazy stuff
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| IOT181 |	S&P
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,687	| IOT181 |	Did not monitor my
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,807	| IOT181 |	Let's see
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,623	| IOT181 |	Qualcomm introduced a new one for wearable
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,647	| IOT181 |	Devices
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,415	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,183	| IOT181 |	Kevin saunderson
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:20,351	| IOT181 |	So it's good that they are introducing this but I am a little mitt on it I'll tell you why
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,423	| IOT181 |	So for those who don't know just about every single
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT181 |	Google
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:27,007	| IOT181 |	Android wearable now it's called where OS I apologize
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,543	| IOT181 |	Wear OS watch
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,823	| IOT181 |	Runs on a Qualcomm
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,895	| IOT181 |	Snapchat in chat with the old 2100
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,455	| IOT181 |	It came out 2 years ago and even then it was
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| IOT181 |	Kinda getting a little long in the tooth
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| IOT181 |	Now
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,575	| IOT181 |	It's good that Qualcomm Snapdragon wear
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,855	| IOT181 |	3100 is now
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:49,279	| IOT181 |	And there are no devices out with that yet although Montblanc has announced that they will have one very soon and I'm sure
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,327	| IOT181 |	CES but
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:54,143	| IOT181 |	Two thoughts here one is that it's really not that
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,655	| IOT181 |	Chip
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,703	| IOT181 |	Hardware that's been holding
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,727	| IOT181 |	Google smartwatch
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,007	| IOT181 |	Back
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:05,151	| IOT181 |	I'm sales is really been a kind of mediocre user experience with the interface which is changed majorly 2 or 3
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,687	| IOT181 |	Now so that's
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| IOT181 |	Part 1 of this
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,735	| IOT181 |	Part two is
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,271	| IOT181 |	The 3100 chip
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,039	| IOT181 |	It
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:15,903	| IOT181 |	Is good in that it offloads most of the low-power stuff to a low-power
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:22,303	| IOT181 |	Processor that's also on this chick it's like a big little architecture there's two chips one that's heavy-duty processing and
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,583	| IOT181 |	One that's like processing
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:28,703	| IOT181 |	But it's not a major change in that chip technology from the 2100 it's really meant to boost battery life
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,519	| IOT181 |	Be smart watches so don't expect like
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:35,103	| IOT181 |	Major Performance gains although there probably be hard to measure in General on a smartwatch
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:41,503	| IOT181 |	The apps are so small but it just seemed like a very incremental thing for them to do when they could have done it a while ago to be honest
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:42,783	| IOT181 |	So that's why
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT181 |	Me mail
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,111	| IOT181 |	I am
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,439	| IOT181 |	And the reason why
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,719	| IOT181 |	Why is because
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,487	| IOT181 |	They
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,023	| IOT181 |	Qualcomm with this chip
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:57,375	| IOT181 |	They've introduced a low-power coprocessor that uses
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,935	| IOT181 |	What's called near threshold design okay
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,471	| IOT181 |	Are you guys ready
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:01,983	| IOT181 |	To get nerdy
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,543	| IOT181 |	This is a big deal so
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,823	| IOT181 |	Near threshold design
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,359	| IOT181 |	Has been buried
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:10,687	| IOT181 |	Early-stage Cutting Edge
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,711	| IOT181 |	Is
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:15,039	| IOT181 |	That you are basically giving the chip enough voltage
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,063	| IOT181 |	You're getting it
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,855	| IOT181 |	Plenty of voltage so you know it work
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,647	| IOT181 |	It's going to flip the switch
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,415	| IOT181 |	Which RAID is going to happen
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,695	| IOT181 |	Plenty of house
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,743	| IOT181 |	Your threshold says
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,279	| IOT181 |	We're just going to give you
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,071	| IOT181 |	Just enough
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,863	| IOT181 |	It's really hard
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,935	| IOT181 |	To do tight transistor design
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,727	| IOT181 |	Things like leakage become really important
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,519	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,543	| IOT181 |	There's no margin
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,079	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,359	| IOT181 |	It's pretty cool
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,431	| IOT181 |	And the fact that welcomes doing it because they do a lot of there
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,711	| IOT181 |	Manufacturing process
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,039	| IOT181 |	That means this is going to be accessible
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,319	| IOT181 |	To a lot of company
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,623	| IOT181 |	Significantly
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,159	| IOT181 |	The power
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,999	| IOT181 |	I'm going to tell you there's another chip company
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,559	| IOT181 |	And they actually do
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,095	| IOT181 |	Sub-threshold design
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| IOT181 |	Just like this
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,143	| IOT181 |	Even more so
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,167	| IOT181 |	And those guys
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,191	| IOT181 |	Are in
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,495	| IOT181 |	Huawei wearables
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,031	| IOT181 |	Aspire
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,847	| IOT181 |	Wearable that you basically tape into your underwear
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| IOT181 |	Tracks your activity
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| IOT181 |	And other stuff that lasts for like a year and a half
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,479	| IOT181 |	So this is a really
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,503	| IOT181 |	Big deal
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT181 |	What Kevin sizes of matcha
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,343	| IOT181 |	In that is going to bring
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,623	| IOT181 |	Lower power
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,391	| IOT181 |	Coyote
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:24,671	| IOT181 |	Devices
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:29,535	| IOT181 |	I'm a little less may now
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,047	| IOT181 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:36,703	| IOT181 |	My Buddy Lee Ratliff who's an analyst he explains it really well he says power consumption is
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,239	| IOT181 |	Proportional to the square of the
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,311	| IOT181 |	So even a small decrease in voltage
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,079	| IOT181 |	Have a really big impact
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,687	| IOT181 |	If you slept through all of that
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| IOT181 |	Wake up
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:50,015	| IOT181 |	Because nxp has announced a security chip for
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| IOT181 |	Google iot Cloud
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,575	| IOT181 |	With an exciting name
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,343	| IOT181 |	Bissell wave people
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,159	| IOT181 |	Can I say
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,975	| IOT181 |	Let me see if I pronounce this correctly this is tricky
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,279	| IOT181 |	A71 ch
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,327	| IOT181 |	Nailed it
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| IOT181 |	Thank you
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| IOT181 |	So we don't have practice
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:11,263	| IOT181 |	We don't necessarily care about the name of the chip so much as we care about what this is this is linking
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,543	| IOT181 |	Security keys
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| IOT181 |	To Google's cloud
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,383	| IOT181 |	This is very similar to the design
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| IOT181 |	Microsoft azure
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,967	| IOT181 |	Project Sopris in the
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:20,735	| IOT181 |	You're linking
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,527	| IOT181 |	Particular cloud
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| IOT181 |	Cloud OS
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,087	| IOT181 |	2
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,111	| IOT181 |	Security hard
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,903	| IOT181 |	Onnit ship
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:31,743	| IOT181 |	That's actually a lot of people look at that as the future of how we're going to develop
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,279	| IOT181 |	More secure iot devices
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,583	| IOT181 |	The fact now that
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| IOT181 |	An excuse doing this for Google
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,887	| IOT181 |	Hey that's worth something
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,911	| IOT181 |	So that's why we
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:46,335	| IOT181 |	Now this this is a big deal named kidding aside is this a big deal nxp says that device credentials are pre injected in
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,359	| IOT181 |	Into the chip
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,175	| IOT181 |	And public keys are sent to the end-user through
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,967	| IOT181 |	Whatever interface is required etcetera
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| IOT181 |	Security
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,343	| IOT181 |	The First iot Security bill
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| IOT181 |	Has been approved in California
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,207	| IOT181 |	And is waiting at the governor's desk to be signed into
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,023	| IOT181 |	This is SB 327
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:10,655	| IOT181 |	Yeah so basically the big provision in this bill is that a manufacturer of a connected device
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,935	| IOT181 |	Shell
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:14,751	| IOT181 |	Equip the device with a reasonable security feature
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,263	| IOT181 |	Four features
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,799	| IOT181 |	That's a little
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:23,711	| IOT181 |	So that's concerning to me because what is reasonable security it just talked about authentication procedures such as
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:30,111	| IOT181 |	If it connected devices equipped for the means for authentication outside a local network there are two criteria that they Authentication
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:33,183	| IOT181 |	Systems must meet so unique passwords for example
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,511	| IOT181 |	Or it must proper user to set their own password
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| IOT181 |	So this is
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,559	| IOT181 |	A good step forward
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,631	| IOT181 |	That's true in things like reusing Keys looks like it may not be
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,423	| IOT181 |	Acceptable
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,191	| IOT181 |	Under the sea
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:54,175	| IOT181 |	Password is 1 1 1 1
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,711	| IOT181 |	However
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,503	| IOT181 |	This is not an end all be all week
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,527	| IOT181 |	Because it does not deal with
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,039	| IOT181 |	Show me
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,343	| IOT181 |	TC security
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,391	| IOT181 |	But it is a start
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,671	| IOT181 |	We'll see how it is and
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,463	| IOT181 |	By the way we should update you on
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,535	| IOT181 |	Internet of Things cybersecurity
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,815	| IOT181 |	Improvement Act
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| IOT181 |	Was in the US Senate
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,655	| IOT181 |	I didn't think this bill was all that other piece of cake basic
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,983	| IOT181 |	We talked about what devices the government should buy in the security standards
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:21,055	| IOT181 |	Pretty minimal but that isn't going anywhere right now
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:24,383	| IOT181 |	This is what we have in California's laws do actually 10 minutes
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| IOT181 |	Enchiladas
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,431	| IOT181 |	Developments around the country B
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,247	| IOT181 |	Central State
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,527	| IOT181 |	So keep an eye on that
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| IOT181 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,599	| IOT181 |	Moving on where security
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,903	| IOT181 |	Morbidness actually
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,439	| IOT181 |	Well one of them is the same button
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,463	| IOT181 |	And the other one
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:44,095	| IOT181 |	I think it's gasket and obviously everyone is Mariah and I
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:46,911	| IOT181 |	I tell you I'm wonderful ever stop talking about Mirai
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:47,935	| IOT181 |	Maybe in like
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| IOT181 |	We just like
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,567	| IOT181 |	But tell us about
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,591	| IOT181 |	What's happening now
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:59,711	| IOT181 |	So the Palo Alto networks unit 42 has a new report out
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,991	| IOT181 |	MRI and
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| IOT181 |	Gadget
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:05,087	| IOT181 |	Are basically moving beyond
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:09,695	| IOT181 |	The typical Target switch in the past we talked about such as connected cameras
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,463	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:15,327	| IOT181 |	Security systems and routers now it's moving into the Enterprise
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,351	| IOT181 |	It's because
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,399	| IOT181 |	The open
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,167	| IOT181 |	Source
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,935	| IOT181 |	Framework
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,959	| IOT181 |	Apache struts
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:27,359	| IOT181 |	Which is used for Java platform Enterprise Edition there's your Enterprise hook and was also what way
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:32,735	| IOT181 |	Was attacked in the Equifax breach last year they still unpatch Samurai is now targeting those systems
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:36,319	| IOT181 |	So now it's getting into potentially Enterprise job apps
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:40,671	| IOT181 |	That is not good so that's an expansion of targets there and then
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,695	| IOT181 |	Gasket
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:47,839	| IOT181 |	Which is also known as bad as light which is probably easier to say is attacking unsupported versions of
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,143	| IOT181 |	SonicWALL Global Management
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:50,911	| IOT181 |	System so
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:53,471	| IOT181 |	This is bad because it's going
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,239	| IOT181 |	Again Beyond
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:20:00,895	| IOT181 |	Yeah that's firewall product for networks in Enterprises and such so that is
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,919	| IOT181 |	Also bad
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,455	| IOT181 |	Extra bad
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,479	| IOT181 |	Okay well
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,807	| IOT181 |	Alright so any
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:09,343	| IOT181 |	Good news on that for
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,159	| IOT181 |	Not till these things get patched
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,487	| IOT181 |	UNF it just speaks to a bigger issue here
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,303	| IOT181 |	Add button that's another iot device
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,327	| IOT181 |	Hacks and attacks
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:25,727	| IOT181 |	They're not limited to a specific type of device or a specific client or a consumer or Enterprise
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:28,031	| IOT181 |	There were widespread and then we'll just keep
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,079	| IOT181 |	Looking for things to in fact
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:36,479	| IOT181 |	And it's really scary when you think about how many connected devices are out there we talked about this all the time billions and billions and you know it just
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,527	| IOT181 |	How do you patch everything is the question
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,391	| IOT181 |	Bummer
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,183	| IOT181 |	But let's talk about some quick updates
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:45,695	| IOT181 |	Newspaper
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:46,975	| IOT181 |	All right
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,535	| IOT181 |	Kevin I'm going to give this to you cuz you're the guy who found it
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:53,887	| IOT181 |	You know nobody seems to remember that but you're right and that we talked about in the podcast
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,447	| IOT181 |	Yes probably early August maybe Late July
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:01,567	| IOT181 |	Yeah I noticed an FCC filing for Samsung SmartThings tracker
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:05,919	| IOT181 |	And it was going to work with both Verizon and AT&T s
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,199	| IOT181 |	LTE
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,735	| IOT181 |	M1 Networks
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,295	| IOT181 |	And sure enough it just got an ounce this week
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,343	| IOT181 |	So think of this like a
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,623	| IOT181 |	Bluetooth tracker
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:17,184	| IOT181 |	Only doesn't use Bluetooth but if you have a tile or
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:23,072	| IOT181 |	Some other similar tracking device this is just like that except it has a GPS and it connects to
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,608	| IOT181 |	The in first case
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,144	| IOT181 |	AT&T network
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,936	| IOT181 |	It will cost you $99
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:34,336	| IOT181 |	It's real-time tracking again because of GPS you can set geofencing with it works with SmartThings and there's even a panic but
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:37,408	| IOT181 |	Just nice so you can use it as a personal tracker if you don't want to
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,688	| IOT181 |	Attach it to your luggage
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,760	| IOT181 |	$99 includes AT&T service
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,832	| IOT181 |	The first year after the first year you're going to be paying
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,856	| IOT181 |	$5 a month
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| IOT181 |	Or $50 a year
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,440	| IOT181 |	Available later this
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,000	| IOT181 |	Tweek actually at select AT&T stores and
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,768	| IOT181 |	Samsung.
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:58,656	| IOT181 |	Compsych resume my Verizon model follow very soon because the FCC tested also for Verizon's
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,960	| IOT181 |	Those prices
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,496	| IOT181 |	Cesare kind of insane for tracking my luggage
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,288	| IOT181 |	Put
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,592	| IOT181 |	I mean in your kids backpack
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,616	| IOT181 |	If I were kidnapped
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,176	| IOT181 |	Which I am not doing if I were
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,456	| IOT181 |	The first thing I would do is throw away the
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:14,272	| IOT181 |	It might work
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:18,880	| IOT181 |	I would actually my dog used to be able to escape my fence and run all over the place I would put it on my dog
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,696	| IOT181 |	I love these case for it I mean
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:25,536	| IOT181 |	Again because it's Tyler and so expensive you really have to have
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,328	| IOT181 |	A high-cost or high value
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT181 |	Item
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,608	| IOT181 |	To attach this to
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,912	| IOT181 |	Exactly I probably have to put this on my
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| IOT181 |	Keys to my car
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:37,824	| IOT181 |	Even though that is a high-value thing because I have a spare key and so on so forth but I'm one of a kind item that it is
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,360	| IOT181 |	How to replace or has
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:43,968	| IOT181 |	Things that you need for an essay trip in your luggage yeah I would do that
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:46,016	| IOT181 |	It's just that $5 a month through
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,296	| IOT181 |	It's me
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,320	| IOT181 |	The first years included
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,256	| IOT181 |	I paid $10 for that what I get for that for me personally is
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,816	| IOT181 |	My family knows where I am all the time because
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:05,216	| IOT181 |	It is tracking the GPS and so on in there and they in is uploading information to them if they need it I also get
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,752	| IOT181 |	Get all my calls and my texts
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:13,152	| IOT181 |	My notifications I don't care about that when I'm out and about running or something but it's nice to have the ability to even make it
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,200	| IOT181 |	A call from my wrist without my phone
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,224	| IOT181 |	If I get hurt while I'm running
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,272	| IOT181 |	So you're buying
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:22,112	| IOT181 |	I'm not buying peace of mind because darn it I'm worth it
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,392	| IOT181 |	You are worth
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:26,208	| IOT181 |	Maybe 15 a month I wouldn't I wouldn't do it
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:26,720	| IOT181 |	59 net worth
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:35,168	| IOT181 |	Alright here's an update I complained last week
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,984	| IOT181 |	Two weeks ago I think about my June oven
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,752	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,520	| IOT181 |	How
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:42,080	| IOT181 |	I felt like it a chain recognize my toast anymore
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,384	| IOT181 |	It turns out
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,688	| IOT181 |	That June check the logs because they can do that on a
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,992	| IOT181 |	Device and they're like Stacy
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,016	| IOT181 |	You have a giant
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:50,784	| IOT181 |	Greece
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,368	| IOT181 |	Which is exactly what Kevin told me
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,672	| IOT181 |	How to say that Kevin
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,000	| IOT181 |	I checked your logs to just so you know
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,304	| IOT181 |	John Kerry
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,096	| IOT181 |	You know exactly how many waffles
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:08,192	| IOT181 |	Is a little disturbing to know that if June wants to they could be like
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,216	| IOT181 |	Ayo Stacy
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| IOT181 |	You cook a lot of
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,776	| IOT181 |	Eggo waffles
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,848	| IOT181 |	But you know what they always whenever you
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,640	| IOT181 |	Request support help they asked
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,408	| IOT181 |	Commission
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,688	| IOT181 |	To view your logs
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:21,760	| IOT181 |	Are they doing the behind-the-scenes I doubt it could that yeah
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:25,088	| IOT181 |	But I mean any company could look at the date of their getting from the device
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,160	| IOT181 |	You know I'm making a baked potato or
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,744	| IOT181 |	I'm not cooking anything
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:38,656	| IOT181 |	So you also and complaints we talked about the nest by Yale lock
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:45,824	| IOT181 |	Yeah that was our complaint show a week or two ago that's right the Google home integration with the nest by Yale lock
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,360	| IOT181 |	I know we talked about it cuz it was
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,152	| IOT181 |	Announce right before the podcast
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| IOT181 |	A week or two ago
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:52,480	| IOT181 |	I couldn't get it to work no matter what I did and
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,504	| IOT181 |	Stacy it sent me a
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:59,392	| IOT181 |	Great set of troubleshooting steps from when she had works with nest for troubleshooting something similar in the past
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,184	| IOT181 |	I was just about to do that
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,208	| IOT181 |	When
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,512	| IOT181 |	All of a sudden I went to my Nest app
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,536	| IOT181 |	And it
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:09,120	| IOT181 |	Said there's a new application permission that we'd like
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,400	| IOT181 |	Access to
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,984	| IOT181 |	Really what is that and sure enough it was for
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,544	| IOT181 |	The ability to see the state and information
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:22,432	| IOT181 |	In from the nest by yella so the integration just hadn't ruled out to me yet so I did not have to do anything
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:27,808	| IOT181 |	So my complaining was kind for nothing cuz I was impatient but it does work now and I can speak to my
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:31,136	| IOT181 |	Home devices right now I'm not going to cuz I want to set PeopleSoft
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:31,904	| IOT181 |	And ask it
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:36,256	| IOT181 |	If the front door is locked I can tell it to lock the door and
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:40,864	| IOT181 |	I think that's it you might be able to assign specific codes cuz it is a touchpad lock
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:43,424	| IOT181 |	And two different people and then I could tell you who's home
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,984	| IOT181 |	Think that's a possibility but I want to check on me
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,872	| IOT181 |	Can you couldn't create a routine with it now though too
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,384	| IOT181 |	Oh yeah that's
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,688	| IOT181 |	Set up
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,456	| IOT181 |	Movie times
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:55,968	| IOT181 |	Lower the thermostat
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,272	| IOT181 |	Turn on my Sonos
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,040	| IOT181 |	Businesses
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,832	| IOT181 |	No it doesn't work with
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,136	| IOT181 |	All right
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:06,720	| IOT181 |	Okay quick update for everybody who follows
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,744	| IOT181 |	He connected blinds
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:13,120	| IOT181 |	Story it turns out that Ikea has submitted documentation to the FCC
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,656	| IOT181 |	Did blinds
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:17,984	| IOT181 |	Okay you guys have everything
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,800	| IOT181 |	The most common show question but we do actually get this question about
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,080	| IOT181 |	Hey I want smart blinds
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:25,664	| IOT181 |	And so this being Ikea I expected to work with the truck
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:30,784	| IOT181 |	I also expect it to be cheaper than the current options which are
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,600	| IOT181 |	Are kind of expensive there is my smart blinds which is one of the cheaper one
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,648	| IOT181 |	Works with wooden slat blinds
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:36,928	| IOT181 |	The big one
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:38,976	| IOT181 |	And that is $99
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,280	| IOT181 |	Window
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,304	| IOT181 |	And there's a limit
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,840	| IOT181 |	How big that blind
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,608	| IOT181 |	Dang it will move
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,960	| IOT181 |	There is a Lutron Serena Shades Hunter Douglas has somebody has some
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,496	| IOT181 |	Soompi
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,288	| IOT181 |	Has Raquel expensive
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,824	| IOT181 |	Which is why I don't have them
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:56,384	| IOT181 |	Will post the motorized shades are expensive
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:58,432	| IOT181 |	Adding connectivity to motorized Shades is not
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,736	| IOT181 |	A big cost Sterrett
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,016	| IOT181 |	Motorized
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,576	| IOT181 |	The shade coz motors have to
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,880	| IOT181 |	In some cases a lot of cloth
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,392	| IOT181 |	And they have to be
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,928	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:11,744	| IOT181 |	In some of the fancier iteration so I have motorized shades
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,256	| IOT181 |	To my house
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,792	| IOT181 |	Ginormous
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,584	| IOT181 |	Windows and those were $10,000
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,608	| IOT181 |	Which is
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,144	| IOT181 |	Bonkers so
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,168	| IOT181 |	But they cover
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,448	| IOT181 |	A 10 x 40
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,984	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:24,800	| IOT181 |	There's a lot of fabric to move they actually plug into
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,592	| IOT181 |	Dedicated low voltage
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,384	| IOT181 |	It was a quiet
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:30,176	| IOT181 |	But most people are good
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:37,088	| IOT181 |	Agreed well I'm not so that's why I don't have them and Ikea products do tend to be less expensive I mean
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,624	| IOT181 |	Look at the Tron freeline it's
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:41,952	| IOT181 |	Cheaper than most other smart home device lines
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,464	| IOT181 |	So I'm hoping
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:48,352	| IOT181 |	And I don't think we'll have to wait too long because IQ usually announces their new products in
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:50,912	| IOT181 |	Stay
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,216	| IOT181 |	Real quick
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,008	| IOT181 |	Question about the trophy
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,032	| IOT181 |	Hub
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,080	| IOT181 |	The radios that supports
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:04,736	| IOT181 |	I'm assuming it's zigbee FaceTime looking at the FCC report and based on that frequency that they tested High assume this is
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,112	| IOT181 |	You can
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:13,696	| IOT181 |	The custom music me I can't remember if Sha
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,256	| IOT181 |	Something else yes
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,536	| IOT181 |	You have to have
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:19,072	| IOT181 |	Particular hub
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,864	| IOT181 |	You can't link it I could not link my
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,400	| IOT181 |	Tri-C lights to other
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:26,752	| IOT181 |	Even if you have a zigbee hub if it's not
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,032	| IOT181 |	I tried freehub you won't be
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT181 |	Able to use these person
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:30,592	| IOT181 |	Boo
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:33,664	| IOT181 |	So yeah
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,992	| IOT181 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,528	| IOT181 |	Let's talk quickly about
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,576	| IOT181 |	The new brilliant
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,856	| IOT181 |	Light switch and
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,392	| IOT181 |	Smart home control devices
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,184	| IOT181 |	I've actually been testing it
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,696	| IOT181 |	It came out
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:49,536	| IOT181 |	Not a good time for us cuz it was after his last week's podcast
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,304	| IOT181 |	Live
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,072	| IOT181 |	We can talk about it
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,864	| IOT181 |	But I have been testing it
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,144	| IOT181 |	It is a
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:54,912	| IOT181 |	Light switch
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:29:00,032	| IOT181 |	Which one switch panel so that replaces when switch is $300
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:02,336	| IOT181 |	And it goes all the way to 4 switch panels
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,872	| IOT181 |	449
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:08,736	| IOT181 |	So what these are they replace your existing light switch you do have to be
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,528	| IOT181 |	Comfortable turning off your power and
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,576	| IOT181 |	But it's not hard
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,880	| IOT181 |	I'm not going to recommend these just yet
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,928	| IOT181 |	We're going to have the CEO on the show
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,952	| IOT181 |	And we'll talk more about WhatsApp
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:18,976	| IOT181 |	I think
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,792	| IOT181 |	In a few months this is going to be a very different product
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| IOT181 |	I would recommend
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:26,400	| IOT181 |	But for right now it has a lot going
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,448	| IOT181 |	And DUI is in
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:29,984	| IOT181 |	It's not great yet
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,544	| IOT181 |	So I think it be confusing for most Norm
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:35,360	| IOT181 |	People if you are dedicated smart home user
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,152	| IOT181 |	It'll go ahead you're used to
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,176	| IOT181 |	Playing around with stuff
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,968	| IOT181 |	Things improving over time
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:41,504	| IOT181 |	This is fine
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,040	| IOT181 |	What it does is
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:45,088	| IOT181 |	Access a light switch
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,368	| IOT181 |	Also acts as an intercom
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:47,904	| IOT181 |	Taxes
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:52,256	| IOT181 |	A Madam a device and it ties into a variety smart
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,792	| IOT181 |	Products like the ring doorbell
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,840	| IOT181 |	The Sonos WeMo
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,120	| IOT181 |	Hue Lights
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,144	| IOT181 |	Nest
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,424	| IOT181 |	Coming soon
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,704	| IOT181 |	And also smart thing
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:01,728	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,544	| IOT181 |	That's a lot of things that you can do with it
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,592	| IOT181 |	You can set scenes in idea is
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:09,408	| IOT181 |	You walk in and you can use this
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:12,480	| IOT181 |	To control your home via voice or via a touchpad
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| IOT181 |	Touchpad
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:14,784	| IOT181 |	Screen
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,832	| IOT181 |	What I found
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:20,416	| IOT181 |	The touch pads too small to control all the devices
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,184	| IOT181 |	Really easily
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:23,232	| IOT181 |	What I think is really interesting though
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,512	| IOT181 |	Is you could install this in
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,816	| IOT181 |	A couple places in your home and actually control all the lights
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,096	| IOT181 |	Which
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,144	| IOT181 |	When they figure out the user interface in
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,216	| IOT181 |	Easy I think this could be real
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:40,640	| IOT181 |	It could be anyone shown me we did a video hangout you show me a little bit of the usage in
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:47,040	| IOT181 |	It reminds me of the old wink relay in some regards which had a touch screen and was able to
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,368	| IOT181 |	To literally show that your wink shortcuts in your devices on there
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:54,976	| IOT181 |	But I still think there might be a little bit of work left on the southwest side for the brilliant
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,560	| IOT181 |	Okay so now let's talk about the integration
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:01,888	| IOT181 |	I started out just played with a plane
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:02,656	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,704	| IOT181 |	I will say one of the nicer features because
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:08,032	| IOT181 |	Casitas way it was being able to upload my own photos
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:10,848	| IOT181 |	Taranis panel so it's like this neat little digital photo frame
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:13,920	| IOT181 |	You can only do 25 and it's kind of time-consuming youku
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:15,200	| IOT181 |	Individually upload each photo
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,736	| IOT181 |	But it is really nice to like
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,760	| IOT181 |	Walk by the slice
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,272	| IOT181 |	Pictures of my
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,600	| IOT181 |	Some things that were
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,160	| IOT181 |	Hard is once I brought in my Hue Lights
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,952	| IOT181 |	There's a little glitch Inus in bringing in
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,000	| IOT181 |	One of them didn't show up
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:31,072	| IOT181 |	And then to control all of them is
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:31,840	| IOT181 |	1 unit
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,632	| IOT181 |	Was a bit time consuming
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,168	| IOT181 |	Like to actually create
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:38,240	| IOT181 |	Make a schedule for my living room because there's no way to group
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,800	| IOT181 |	Light bulbs yet
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,080	| IOT181 |	There's no way to group light bulbs into
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,128	| IOT181 |	And that's
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:46,944	| IOT181 |	Kind of frustrating cuz I don't no one really wants to control
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,296	| IOT181 |	Not in the same room
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:52,576	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:55,648	| IOT181 |	That's one thing they do say that that's coming in two to three weeks
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,952	| IOT181 |	So is a non hacked
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,000	| IOT181 |	Nest integration
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:00,512	| IOT181 |	And they're just waiting for
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:04,864	| IOT181 |	And you can create scenes and those are interesting in the Sonos integration
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,704	| IOT181 |	Is actually doing really well for them it only likes to
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,240	| IOT181 |	Favorites R radio station
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:17,152	| IOT181 |	And if you need to control for like deep dives into specific songs
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,200	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,480	| IOT181 |	Do I love it
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:21,760	| IOT181 |	It's all right
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,320	| IOT181 |	Do I think it's going to get better
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:27,136	| IOT181 |	Yes oh and SmartThings the SmartThings integration is
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:29,952	| IOT181 |	You can't control all of the devices
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,488	| IOT181 |	You can put into your smart
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,560	| IOT181 |	And then with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:35,840	| IOT181 |	Croatian
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,376	| IOT181 |	It actually sometimes
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:38,400	| IOT181 |	It won't play music
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:43,008	| IOT181 |	But it does do things like when you ask it for the weather it'll show you the weather
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:46,848	| IOT181 |	It doesn't do all the things
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:51,456	| IOT181 |	Very much reminds me that wink relay cuz you could do a lot of things
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,736	| IOT181 |	Similar things in
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,248	| IOT181 |	Displace
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:56,064	| IOT181 |	Interesting Lee the photos is nice
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:59,392	| IOT181 |	Having to manually upload them somewhere is kind of
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:05,536	| IOT181 |	I don't know mm Forest to me but I understand why you need some kind of integration I only mention this because just
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,816	| IOT181 |	Earlier this week
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:13,216	| IOT181 |	Google opened up its Google photos API and that means apps can men have Integrations to
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,240	| IOT181 |	People's Google photos
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,776	| IOT181 |	The other reason I mention it is
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:22,176	| IOT181 |	Because for the next podcast you're going to have something that will automatically pull in your Google photos for you you want
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,712	| IOT181 |	Upload them it'll just be there
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:25,504	| IOT181 |	You know I'm talking about
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,576	| IOT181 |	Set me a Lenovo display
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:37,024	| IOT181 |	So that's what we'll talk about for now and how much is it that today
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:38,816	| IOT181 |	9 for the
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:39,840	| IOT181 |	1 gang
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| IOT181 |	So the one switch
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,936	| IOT181 |	Which comparison like The $99 price for the wing
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:47,776	| IOT181 |	Yeah I was 99 and even came down in price after
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,360	| IOT181 |	Not install they still have
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:54,688	| IOT181 |	2 switch panel which is probably the most common
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,712	| IOT181 |	Is 340
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,736	| IOT181 |	And they will bundle stuff
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,040	| IOT181 |	Oh and also works with
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,856	| IOT181 |	It looks
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,904	| IOT181 |	I mean I've only seen it on the Hangouts
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,952	| IOT181 |	But it looks like it's
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:08,512	| IOT181 |	Work that money just really pretty
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:12,608	| IOT181 |	It's a very nice device in the microphone on it is crazy
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:13,888	| IOT181 |	Search for
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,912	| IOT181 |	Kingdom anime
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,424	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,216	| IOT181 |	Actually turn that potion
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:18,240	| IOT181 |	Because
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:19,776	| IOT181 |	It was fighting with my other
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,592	| IOT181 |	Batman that a debate does more things so it's like
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:24,384	| IOT181 |	I want you
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,456	| IOT181 |	That's just me

EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:02,528	| IOT181 |	And this week we have a question from an unknown individual
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:04,320	| IOT181 |	But it's still a really good question
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,088	| IOT181 |	So let's hear it
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,624	| IOT181 |	Stacey and Kevin
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:13,536	| IOT181 |	Long time listener and you guys had an episode while ago where Kevin talked about using his
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,072	| IOT181 |	Hue bulbs the color ones
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:16,608	| IOT181 |	2
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:18,144	| IOT181 |	Show different shade of
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:18,912	| IOT181 |	Colorlink
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,960	| IOT181 |	Red or blue I think Bass
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:22,240	| IOT181 |	On whether or not
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,544	| IOT181 |	Kevin stocks were trading well
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:28,128	| IOT181 |	I want to employ similar use but with temperature
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:32,224	| IOT181 |	So when I wake up I'd like for one of my color bulb to display
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:35,040	| IOT181 |	A blue or red in Greater intensity
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,064	| IOT181 |	Gymnast
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:36,832	| IOT181 |	Based on
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,856	| IOT181 |	Current temperature
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,648	| IOT181 |	I would love to know if this is possible
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:43,744	| IOT181 |	Philips Hue bulbs I use Google home and
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:46,048	| IOT181 |	And willing to do pretty much anything
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,840	| IOT181 |	Alright thanks so much
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,376	| IOT181 |	Okay
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,144	| IOT181 |	This is a great
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:52,192	| IOT181 |	Question and Kevin and I have actually both
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,984	| IOT181 |	Dumbest or variations of this in our
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,032	| IOT181 |	I've actually done literally what
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:57,824	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,104	| IOT181 |	I'm going to give you the easy answer
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,384	| IOT181 |	Kevin is going to give you a hug
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,456	| IOT181 |	Bez more fun
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:05,760	| IOT181 |	Yours is more fun and it has the potential to be
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,576	| IOT181 |	So my answer is
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:11,136	| IOT181 |	I set up my Hue bulbs
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:12,672	| IOT181 |	If
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,208	| IOT181 |	And then I just set up a
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,488	| IOT181 |	Basic rule that if
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,792	| IOT181 |	If the weather is
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,560	| IOT181 |	Above
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,888	| IOT181 |	You said do it in the winter so I do if the weather is above 40
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,424	| IOT181 |	Turn red
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:25,216	| IOT181 |	And if the weather is below
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,240	| IOT181 |	32
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:28,800	| IOT181 |	I did this in a light
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:31,616	| IOT181 |	Closet for a while cuz then I was like oh now I know how to dress in the morning
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:36,480	| IOT181 |	Is it perfect no cuz you have to set your temperature parameters
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:43,136	| IOT181 |	You're lying out of Weather Service that may not be directly outside your house you could if you have like a netatmo device you can link directly
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,184	| IOT181 |	The weather station
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,720	| IOT181 |	Right outside your door
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,512	| IOT181 |	Sometimes you have temperature sensors
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,304	| IOT181 |	Doorbells
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:50,816	| IOT181 |	Access them
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,864	| IOT181 |	So that's ways to get
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,656	| IOT181 |	Granular
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,936	| IOT181 |	At your house weather
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,472	| IOT181 |	But you also then after that you have
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,264	| IOT181 |	Reset the light
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,800	| IOT181 |	Or create another recipe.
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:02,848	| IOT181 |	Beckett
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:03,360	| IOT181 |	Go back to Norm
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:07,200	| IOT181 |	But that is an easy way to do it it doesn't cost you a thing
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,992	| IOT181 |	It works with your existing stuff
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,784	| IOT181 |	Play around with it till you get something
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:12,320	| IOT181 |	Luther's Cafe
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:17,184	| IOT181 |	The hardest way to do something simple that's my motto
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,464	| IOT181 |	So
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:22,048	| IOT181 |	What I did just to refresh everybody I literally created a
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,328	| IOT181 |	Python program
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,096	| IOT181 |	That
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,912	| IOT181 |	Reads information from an API
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:29,984	| IOT181 |	Other side Bitcoin cryptocurrency Trading
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:30,752	| IOT181 |	Services
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:33,568	| IOT181 |	So it's constantly every minute getting up-to-date
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:35,104	| IOT181 |	Numbers on the actual
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,128	| IOT181 |	Currency prices
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:38,944	| IOT181 |	And then I use another API based on information
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,224	| IOT181 |	And said hey
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:42,528	| IOT181 |	Turn on my lifx bulb to Green if
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:47,392	| IOT181 |	The price is up and even increase the brightness if it's up over certain percentage
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:50,208	| IOT181 |	So I have a super fine granular amount of
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,976	| IOT181 |	Control
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:51,744	| IOT181 |	Where
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,512	| IOT181 |	Yiking
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,280	| IOT181 |	Literally get
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,584	| IOT181 |	More precise India notification
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,608	| IOT181 |	Obviously
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:57,632	| IOT181 |	This is
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:38:02,752	| IOT181 |	A program exercise and you need to have something to run that program on I use a Raspberry Pi for example
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:07,360	| IOT181 |	So you know you have to add something to your smart home you would have to do some programming
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:09,920	| IOT181 |	I've shared most of the code on our sites
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,968	| IOT181 |	It's a good stub to get started
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:16,832	| IOT181 |	But you also need to make sure that apis for your products are available
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,880	| IOT181 |	And in case of Philips Hue
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,904	| IOT181 |	Yacht there are
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,928	| IOT181 |	Apis
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,952	| IOT181 |	How to control lights
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:25,280	| IOT181 |	So it literally you could get temperature information using
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:28,864	| IOT181 |	The program and set parameters out of those will be your trigger events
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,888	| IOT181 |	If you
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:32,960	| IOT181 |	Compared to F and then what you want to happen
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:37,312	| IOT181 |	Would be an API that sends data to your Philips Hue Lights
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:40,128	| IOT181 |	It's going to require some effort on your part but it's
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,920	| IOT181 |	Stacy said it's something like a
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:48,320	| IOT181 |	Do a lot more and could be reused in many other cases dirty easily just changing a few lines
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,624	| IOT181 |	Zip code could information from another
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,392	| IOT181 |	Source
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,184	| IOT181 |	Maybe it's stockmarkets maybe it's
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:55,744	| IOT181 |	If your mailbox
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,792	| IOT181 |	Have been open in your sensor on it for example
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,608	| IOT181 |	You can get a light to Blink when the mail is here
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,216	| IOT181 |	Okay okay but I'm just coming up with
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,496	| IOT181 |	Random examples
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:11,104	| IOT181 |	But you're right yeah you know there's lots of ways to do this if it would be what I would recommend from us
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:11,616	| IOT181 |	People yes
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:16,480	| IOT181 |	So I would start their shirt into programmer you want to learn about apis
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:17,760	| IOT181 |	You know it's a fun experience
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:22,368	| IOT181 |	Two ways to go
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,904	| IOT181 |	Just in case
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,928	| IOT181 |	You're that kind of purse
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:26,464	| IOT181 |	Yes
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:30,304	| IOT181 |	I hate to be that guy but I don't want to be the only bad guy so please
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,144	| IOT181 |	All right
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:35,680	| IOT181 |	Now
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,704	| IOT181 |	It's time for
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:40,544	| IOT181 |	A word from our sponsor but stay tuned because our guest this week is an Bashi
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:43,360	| IOT181 |	She's going to talk about why
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:49,504	| IOT181 |	Iot providers need to focus on just a few use-cases what vendors need to do to mm
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,272	| IOT181 |	Prove
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,088	| IOT181 |	Their services or companies buying iot Solutions
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,368	| IOT181 |	And
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,928	| IOT181 |	Who's going to get wet chunks of the 502
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,720	| IOT181 |	Million-dollar pie
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,232	| IOT181 |	For the internet
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:03,072	| IOT181 |	You're going to like it
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:09,472	| IOT181 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,752	| IOT181 |	Is that
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,288	| IOT181 |	And I have json Van
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:14,848	| IOT181 |	Who is VP of iot
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:15,616	| IOT181 |	With sass
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:19,456	| IOT181 |	Last week we talked about SAS creating a new division for iot
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,992	| IOT181 |	This week we're going to talk about
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,272	| IOT181 |	The edge
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:23,552	| IOT181 |	So let's kick it off
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:24,832	| IOT181 |	What is the value
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,856	| IOT181 |	Us the edge
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,624	| IOT181 |	In The Internet of Things
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,184	| IOT181 |	I think the value can change
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:31,744	| IOT181 |	Based on use case that the first element is
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,024	| IOT181 |	Just a reduction
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:33,792	| IOT181 |	Encaustic
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:36,352	| IOT181 |	Transport and storage of data everyone sees
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,120	| IOT181 |	Projections
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:37,888	| IOT181 |	The number of
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:40,192	| IOT181 |	Sensors that are going to be deployed in the edges
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:40,960	| IOT181 |	The amount of data
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:43,264	| IOT181 |	It's being generated in the fact is even
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:45,568	| IOT181 |	Commodity transport commodity storage
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:47,104	| IOT181 |	If you move everything to the network
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,384	| IOT181 |	Into storage
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:51,712	| IOT181 |	It's going to be quite expensive in the fact is most of the data is not valid
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:55,552	| IOT181 |	The first capability is reduce that footprint of data you movie
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:57,088	| IOT181 |	Through your network and then it really gets
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,112	| IOT181 |	Listen to the youth cases
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,136	| IOT181 |	Surround reduce lighting
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:01,440	| IOT181 |	Ucn decisioning failure identification
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,464	| IOT181 |	And yield Improvement
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:04,000	| IOT181 |	And then within our cuss
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,792	| IOT181 |	Centric Industries I like
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,096	| IOT181 |	Betel or Healthcare it really provides the
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:10,656	| IOT181 |	The basis for a unique engagement model with
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:14,240	| IOT181 |	Unique messaging based on what you know about your customer
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:14,752	| IOT181 |	Where they meet
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,032	| IOT181 |	There you go
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,824	| IOT181 |	It really does dairy buyer
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:21,664	| IOT181 |	So everybody's talking about the edge these days
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:23,200	| IOT181 |	What are the SAS differentiate
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,528	| IOT181 |	So I talked a little bit about this
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:29,088	| IOT181 |	In our last topic but it really has been about the invest
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,368	| IOT181 |	And being able tax
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:33,952	| IOT181 |	A lot of people talk at 10000 feet around the ability
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,720	| IOT181 |	Push
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:36,512	| IOT181 |	Assisting to the edge but it's quite
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,024	| IOT181 |	Duplex
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,304	| IOT181 |	Davis-standard
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,840	| IOT181 |	Device configuration
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,888	| IOT181 |	Invested
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,912	| IOT181 |	Chablis in that
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,960	| IOT181 |	With this verification validation effort
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:45,984	| IOT181 |	To make sure that when we say
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,800	| IOT181 |	Push a robust set of Analytics
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:51,104	| IOT181 |	Capabilities to the edge that we can ask
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:51,872	| IOT181 |	We do that
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:55,967	| IOT181 |	And we talked briefly about them but what other industry verticals are working
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:59,551	| IOT181 |	We're starting to see adoption across multiple
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:03,903	| IOT181 |	There are those industries that have a long history with sensor data so we
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,927	| IOT181 |	Racine early adoption
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:08,767	| IOT181 |	Spaces things like energy both generation and distribution
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:09,535	| IOT181 |	Transportation
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:11,839	| IOT181 |	Is an area for wide adoption bothan
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,119	| IOT181 |	Fleet Management and
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,143	| IOT181 |	Autonomous cars
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,191	| IOT181 |	So it's really not one industry that I
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:16,959	| IOT181 |	.2
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:18,751	| IOT181 |	To say they are leader in the space
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:19,519	| IOT181 |	But there's white adopt
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:24,383	| IOT181 |	Great if you want to learn more about what's ass is doing at the edge
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,151	| IOT181 |	Where can we go
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,455	| IOT181 |	We had a great landing page setup
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,759	| IOT181 |	Or additional information whether it's Industries
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:35,903	| IOT181 |	Specific or more horizontal capabilities that can be found at stats.com
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:49,727	| IOT181 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is an
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:50,495	| IOT181 |	Vashi
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:54,079	| IOT181 |	Who is a partner and leader in the iot practice
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,359	| IOT181 |	With pain in calf
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:57,151	| IOT181 |	Hi and how are you today
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:43:00,479	| IOT181 |	Angry Stacey thanks so much for having me on
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:04,063	| IOT181 |	Super excited you guys have done some great report
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:04,831	| IOT181 |	I just love
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,111	| IOT181 |	Wow
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:09,951	| IOT181 |	Lots of money and iot you talked about all kinds of really challenging issues
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:11,743	| IOT181 |	So let's just get this started
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:14,047	| IOT181 |	A level set where are we
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:15,071	| IOT181 |	Industrial
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:16,095	| IOT181 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,423	| IOT181 |	We have done Recent research
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:25,823	| IOT181 |	Over the course of the last two years in Time series to understand what the big changes are that we've seen in iot
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:29,151	| IOT181 |	And the first one is
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,687	| IOT181 |	It still is
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,967	| IOT181 |	Really attractive
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:34,271	| IOT181 |	Which I think most of your
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:37,343	| IOT181 |	Listeners would agree with the market Revenue
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,879	| IOT181 |	Circulation providers
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| IOT181 |	Thor Solutions
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:44,255	| IOT181 |	2 / 500 billion dollar
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,535	| IOT181 |	Aa2021
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,815	| IOT181 |	Which is more than Java
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,655	| IOT181 |	Today but that is a tremendous thought
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,703	| IOT181 |	Also what we found
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,495	| IOT181 |	Customers are really planning
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,263	| IOT181 |	A lot more
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,799	| IOT181 |	Contact
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,079	| IOT181 |	Kidding
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:58,847	| IOT181 |	Contacts
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:01,407	| IOT181 |	Fantastic it's really accelerate
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:04,223	| IOT181 |	The other thing that we found out is that many
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:05,247	| IOT181 |	Temperature
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:08,831	| IOT181 |	Haitian so it's really interesting that they could do anymore
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:10,111	| IOT181 |	But really
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:10,879	| IOT181 |	Location of
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:13,695	| IOT181 |	Piece of rolling out and the pace of
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:16,767	| IOT181 |	Inexpensive implementation
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,047	| IOT181 |	Has actually Fallen
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,839	| IOT181 |	It's a lot of energy but I see
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,119	| IOT181 |	September
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:23,679	| IOT181 |	And so some of this is really adjusting
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:27,007	| IOT181 |	That there was probably in mm
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,775	| IOT181 |	16
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:30,591	| IOT181 |	Birthday today
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:33,919	| IOT181 |	Continued barriers to adoption but people are finding
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:35,199	| IOT181 |	As they're starting
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,479	| IOT181 |	And engaging on Twitter
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:39,039	| IOT181 |	We can talk a little bit more about those
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,063	| IOT181 |	Okay and we will
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:44,159	| IOT181 |	But first I want to dig into this 500 I think is 520 billion
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,439	| IOT181 |	Was the number that
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:46,207	| IOT181 |	You guys
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:47,743	| IOT181 |	So who gets that
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:50,815	| IOT181 |	Because there are a lot of different players happening right now
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,583	| IOT181 |	In
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:53,887	| IOT181 |	The industrial iot in Enterprise iot
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,167	| IOT181 |	Teethers the big kind of
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:56,959	| IOT181 |	Traditional it guys
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:45:01,567	| IOT181 |	There's a bunch of steps and then there's the traditional old school
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:03,103	| IOT181 |	Honeywell emerson-johnson
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:05,663	| IOT181 |	Zeidman's all of these guys so
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,687	| IOT181 |	How does that money kind of
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,479	| IOT181 |	Divvy up yeah I guess
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:09,503	| IOT181 |	I would say there's a lot of
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:12,063	| IOT181 |	For many different pocket
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,367	| IOT181 |	The first one is
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:20,767	| IOT181 |	There is actually very interesting opportunities for the traditional technology players especially when it comes to
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:24,351	| IOT181 |	Kill a couple of things conductivity obviously for the
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:27,935	| IOT181 |	Cisco's in Ericsson but the world as well as the
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:33,311	| IOT181 |	Spiders obviously this opportunity
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,591	| IOT181 |	84
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,871	| IOT181 |	The cloud provider
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:39,199	| IOT181 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:41,247	| IOT181 |	As well as the private
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:44,319	| IOT181 |	Providers that companies like idea
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:46,879	| IOT181 |	For example and then
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,647	| IOT181 |	I think the other is
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,207	| IOT181 |	Providers
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:53,279	| IOT181 |	Now I think you've mentioned it so there's a lot of
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,119	| IOT181 |	Point you kids application
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:02,495	| IOT181 |	And then there's also application development
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:06,847	| IOT181 |	Integrators
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:09,407	| IOT181 |	And then of course you can't
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:12,735	| IOT181 |	Leave the felt that you were talking about like a Honeywell or
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:18,367	| IOT181 |	Schneider or GE that are providing Industrial Equipment because they also have
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:22,719	| IOT181 |	Unity to music operational Technologies
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:25,535	| IOT181 |	Stand not to use iot data
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,815	| IOT181 |	Really there's a lot of money
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,655	| IOT181 |	Starview at Bain is that there is not
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,775	| IOT181 |	Billy broad-market Steve
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:37,055	| IOT181 |	I would say there is many
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:41,919	| IOT181 |	Vertical here and there's opportunity for many winners across is vertical
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:44,479	| IOT181 |	Awesome yes I would be terrified if you said one
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,271	| IOT181 |	Get it all or even to really
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:53,695	| IOT181 |	Funny baby I feel like we get that question a lot who's going to be the winner and IRT
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,975	| IOT181 |	Everyone does love a winner
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:57,279	| IOT181 |	Just a singular winner so
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,583	| IOT181 |	Okay what's the point of this concept of
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,631	| IOT181 |	Pilot purgatory
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:05,727	| IOT181 |	Because it's fun to say and you talked about maybe reality setting
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:06,751	| IOT181 |	A little bit more
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,031	| IOT181 |	In this field soap
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:09,311	| IOT181 |	What exactly is
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:11,103	| IOT181 |	Going on as these projects
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:13,663	| IOT181 |	Get halted at the pilot stage we're going to stay there indefinitely
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,711	| IOT181 |	Yeah sure
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,991	| IOT181 |	So I think that
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,759	| IOT181 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:21,087	| IOT181 |	Obviously
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,367	| IOT181 |	Search with customer
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:24,927	| IOT181 |	And our findings at the
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:26,975	| IOT181 |	Billy around mm
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:34,143	| IOT181 |	About 40% of the executives that we interviewed
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:34,911	| IOT181 |	More likely
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:39,519	| IOT181 |	Getting proof of concept
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:45,919	| IOT181 |	20%
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,967	| IOT181 |	In the number of tfv4 happening
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,503	| IOT181 |	Let me talk with the band
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:53,855	| IOT181 |	They talk about how expensive
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:57,951	| IOT181 |	Backpack
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:48:01,279	| IOT181 |	When you say how extensive the asks are
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,303	| IOT181 |	Do you mean like
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:05,887	| IOT181 |	The number of companies a ski or do you mean like they want a whole heck of
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:06,655	| IOT181 |	Save-A-Lot
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:10,495	| IOT181 |	Exactly
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:12,031	| IOT181 |	Okay so these are happening
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:16,895	| IOT181 |	And what's happening inside these companies as they're doing them and they're like oh
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:17,407	| IOT181 |	What is a learning
EDL	00:48:17,919	00:48:22,271	| IOT181 |	While they're learning a few things so the first one is that there's still a lot of beer
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:25,087	| IOT181 |	Adoption that haven't really been broken down
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,623	| IOT181 |	We found at the top
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:29,183	| IOT181 |	3 issues that customers are facing
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:30,463	| IOT181 |	Into the barrier
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:34,815	| IOT181 |	Feeling pretty
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:36,607	| IOT181 |	They were 2 years ago
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:38,911	| IOT181 |	And so the first one is around Sakura
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:41,215	| IOT181 |	It's the most acute
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:42,751	| IOT181 |	Challenge that customers are facing
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:47,103	| IOT181 |	They might be okay
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:48,895	| IOT181 |	Contact that is a ringtone
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,687	| IOT181 |	But then thinking about
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,711	| IOT181 |	Scaling out
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:53,247	| IOT181 |	Without me
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:56,063	| IOT181 |	Security capabilities on the device or the app
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:57,087	| IOT181 |	What concern
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:49:02,207	| IOT181 |	Protecting the data is something that keeping them from
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,231	| IOT181 |	Probably at least
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:06,047	| IOT181 |	Extensively I think that people are implementing
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,327	| IOT181 |	But there's
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:08,095	| IOT181 |	Probably.
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:11,167	| IOT181 |	Practice security
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:12,447	| IOT181 |	Challenge
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,727	| IOT181 |	Concern
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:16,799	| IOT181 |	To increase the number of devices
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:20,127	| IOT181 |	And actually even probably
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:23,455	| IOT181 |	And for those of you guys
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:26,015	| IOT181 |	Who don't speak chart in ASP is average selling price
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,623	| IOT181 |	The second one is around
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:31,647	| IOT181 |	Return on it
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:34,719	| IOT181 |	And so I think the safety you might have heard that
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:37,535	| IOT181 |	Folks that are implementing
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:41,887	| IOT181 |	New kinds of ukases that you dial TJ.
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:43,167	| IOT181 |	Problems on both sides
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:44,191	| IOT181 |	The Returned

EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:51,359	| IOT181 |	I got on
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:51,871	| IOT181 |	What
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:55,711	| IOT181 |	In terms of upside and I think benders-hadi
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:58,271	| IOT181 |	To really characterized
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:49:59,295	| IOT181 |	What the value is

EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:22,335	| IOT181 |	Customers make better decisions and showed up in the prison
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:24,383	| IOT181 |	Cut that flips on The Returned
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:25,919	| IOT181 |	Lack of clarity of
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:26,431	| IOT181 |	What kind of

EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:29,247	| IOT181 |	MMA
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:31,807	| IOT181 |	Cute is that the investment
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:34,623	| IOT181 |	Zhuhai and that's for a couple
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:36,159	| IOT181 |	The first one
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:36,671	| IOT181 |	Really around
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:37,951	| IOT181 |	How much cups
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:42,559	| IOT181 |	Station is happening today each of these implementation Austin
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:43,071	| IOT181 |	Is very
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:47,935	| IOT181 |	Develop to deliver
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:52,031	| IOT181 |	Have less repeatability been in a more mature
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:54,335	| IOT181 |	EXO vendors really need
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:56,639	| IOT181 |	Hate to drive more repeatability across
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:51:00,991	| IOT181 |	Keep it so they can understand some more
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:03,807	| IOT181 |	Common component and you really get them better
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:07,391	| IOT181 |	Out of the box but I think that would help on the
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:08,671	| IOT181 |	Investment side
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:09,951	| IOT181 |	Is that ladder bit
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:15,327	| IOT181 |	Possible because I feel like a lot of the customers are the ones that demanding this customization
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:21,727	| IOT181 |	In part because maybe their workforces and is familiar with it so they're building these highly complex Dash
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:25,823	| IOT181 |	Words for people or it could even be you know just their equipment is so
EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:27,359	| IOT181 |	Particular to them and that
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:28,127	| IOT181 |	Particular
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:30,687	| IOT181 |	Figuration
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:37,343	| IOT181 |	Between
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:39,135	| IOT181 |	There's no way that you
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:43,487	| IOT181 |	Sinnoh customizer are always different
EDL	00:51:43,487	00:51:44,511	| IOT181 |	There's actually value
EDL	00:51:45,279	00:51:46,303	| IOT181 |	Standardization
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:47,327	| IOT181 |	And so
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:49,375	| IOT181 |	How to trade off right
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:52,191	| IOT181 |	Can have a lower investment and more standardization
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:54,239	| IOT181 |	And so I think they're just actually
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:55,263	| IOT181 |	The challenges
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:52:01,407	| IOT181 |	There's not really an offer yet today
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:08,575	| IOT181 |	I think there is some truth in what you say
EDL	00:52:09,599	00:52:11,135	| IOT181 |	To all I got
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:13,695	| IOT181 |	There's going to be
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:17,279	| IOT181 |	Elevation here
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:23,679	| IOT181 |	Rebate application
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:29,055	| IOT181 |	Vibe and then stomach pain walkers on sale software

EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:31,615	| IOT181 |	Tool
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:38,015	| IOT181 |	Paradise more than there has been today I just think the vendors haven't had a
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:43,135	| IOT181 |	Cato's in a particular vertical
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:45,183	| IOT181 |	With a particular type of equipment
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:48,255	| IOT181 |	You know they need to actually identify those little cheese
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,279	| IOT181 |	Parts that actually could be
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:51,071	| IOT181 |	Okay
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:53,375	| IOT181 |	I feel like the vendors
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:56,959	| IOT181 |	You have some strong feelings about what they are and are not doing
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:52:59,007	| IOT181 |	What would you be telling them right now
EDL	00:53:00,799	00:53:01,567	| IOT181 |	Kind of funny
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:02,079	| IOT181 |	Because
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:06,431	| IOT181 |	Same thing just like you said you know pilot Purgatory on the cusp
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:10,015	| IOT181 |	When we talk with vendors
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:10,783	| IOT181 |	All different
EDL	00:53:10,783	00:53:16,415	| IOT181 |	Pollution
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:19,743	| IOT181 |	The concept that are going on and they're trying to figure out why
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:21,023	| IOT181 |	Which one is actually
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:23,327	| IOT181 |	John Deere trying to figure out
EDL	00:53:24,607	00:53:27,167	| IOT181 |	Can be repeatable because from their economic
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:28,703	| IOT181 |	Doesn't work either
EDL	00:53:28,703	00:53:30,239	| IOT181 |	To have something that's custom
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:36,383	| IOT181 |	Time and so they would like to also reduce the amount of customization but they're having
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:38,431	| IOT181 |	What's challenging about this
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:39,967	| IOT181 |	So bright
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:43,039	| IOT181 |	Play it's like an opportunity
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:45,087	| IOT181 |	And so
EDL	00:53:45,087	00:53:46,879	| IOT181 |	Aiden Mesa technology
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:50,975	| IOT181 |	He market like the horizontal technology
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:57,375	| IOT181 |	Vendors that are capturing that 520 billion potentially in the future right there so many of them
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:53:58,399	| IOT181 |	I actually need
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:53:59,167	| IOT181 |	2
EDL	00:53:59,167	00:54:02,495	| IOT181 |	We spoke at
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:03,519	| IOT181 |	That I
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:08,639	| IOT181 |	That's just too many you can't actually figure out how to
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:13,247	| IOT181 |	A particular UK If you're focused on 80th
EDL	00:54:13,247	00:54:14,271	| IOT181 |	Wait
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:20,671	| IOT181 |	And so what we suggested that vendors really reduce the amount of verticals that their focus
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:21,951	| IOT181 |	Initially
EDL	00:54:21,951	00:54:26,303	| IOT181 |	Look at what their customer base actually looks like we're to have to go
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:30,399	| IOT181 |	Where could they have some repeatability and that they're delivering
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:35,775	| IOT181 |	How many verticals should a particular company try to focus on and is it dictated by like
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:37,055	| IOT181 |	If I'm a startup maybe I should pick
EDL	00:54:37,055	00:54:39,359	| IOT181 |	Three if I'm someone like Microsoft maybe I should
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:40,639	| IOT181 |	5 +
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:43,199	| IOT181 |	Work with dedicated Partners how does that actually look in
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:47,295	| IOT181 |	We would actually say that even for a large company
EDL	00:54:47,295	00:54:53,695	| IOT181 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:54:54,463	| IOT181 |	Good night
EDL	00:54:54,463	00:54:57,279	| IOT181 |	Probably two or three UK.
EDL	00:54:57,279	00:54:58,815	| IOT181 |	Target
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:55:00,607	| IOT181 |	And then for a startup Austin
EDL	00:55:12,639	00:55:13,919	| IOT181 |	Repeatability
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:15,711	| IOT181 |	So we suggest I guess
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:18,527	| IOT181 |	If they take a particular
EDL	00:55:21,087	00:55:27,487	| IOT181 |	Just on the horizontal component that they might so you know servers Ark
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:28,255	| IOT181 |	They also looks
EDL	00:55:28,255	00:55:29,279	| IOT181 |	Or how do I act
EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:43,103	| IOT181 |	What are the challenges that we haven't talked about yet is this idea of
EDL	00:55:43,103	00:55:46,175	| IOT181 |	If I am a big industrial manufacturer I may do a
EDL	00:55:46,175	00:55:48,223	| IOT181 |	A proof-of-concept in one area
EDL	00:55:48,223	00:55:50,015	| IOT181 |	And be like this is amazing and
EDL	00:55:50,527	00:55:56,927	| IOT181 |	Roll it out fully but then when I start doing things in other areas I realized that oh maybe my two
EDL	00:55:56,927	00:55:59,231	| IOT181 |	Solutions will never talk to each other or
EDL	00:55:59,231	00:56:02,303	| IOT181 |	Maybe they're not designed to be as flexible as possible
EDL	00:56:02,303	00:56:04,095	| IOT181 |	So how do companies kind of
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:08,191	| IOT181 |	Handle that or how should they be thinking about is future-proofing there
EDL	00:56:08,191	00:56:09,215	| IOT181 |	Iot efforts
EDL	00:56:11,007	00:56:15,103	| IOT181 |	Customers are actually doing many proof-of-concept the same time
EDL	00:56:15,103	00:56:17,663	| IOT181 |	Any given company is
EDL	00:56:18,687	00:56:24,063	| IOT181 |	Two or three different type of concept for different UK
EDL	00:56:24,063	00:56:25,087	| IOT181 |	Exactly what you're saying
EDL	00:56:26,367	00:56:29,183	| IOT181 |	She working with Microsoft and then application
EDL	00:56:29,183	00:56:31,999	| IOT181 |	Provider to actually look for something like an HVAC
EDL	00:56:32,511	00:56:33,535	| IOT181 |	End
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:34,559	| IOT181 |	You're standing pal.
EDL	00:56:35,327	00:56:38,399	| IOT181 |	But I might have another Bender that I
EDL	00:56:39,167	00:56:41,727	| IOT181 |	To think about the transport within the belt
EDL	00:56:46,335	00:56:46,847	| IOT181 |	Contact
EDL	00:56:48,127	00:56:49,407	| IOT181 |	Realized
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,455	| IOT181 |	We think about
EDL	00:56:51,455	00:56:54,015	| IOT181 |	Some industrial providers
EDL	00:56:54,015	00:56:58,111	| IOT181 |	Like a Honeywell or GE
EDL	00:56:58,111	00:57:00,671	| IOT181 |	Interoperability across
EDL	00:57:01,439	00:57:02,719	| IOT181 |	Types of equipment
EDL	00:57:02,719	00:57:05,279	| IOT181 |	And so you know I think one of them think that customer
EDL	00:57:05,279	00:57:09,119	| IOT181 |	What you do is really think about the choice of vendors that they have
EDL	00:57:09,119	00:57:13,471	| IOT181 |	Whether that be a provider like a Microsoft or an Amazon
EDL	00:57:14,495	00:57:16,287	| IOT181 |	Industrial Equipment provider
EDL	00:57:16,287	00:57:19,871	| IOT181 |	And how could they ensure that the data that they have
EDL	00:57:19,871	00:57:22,687	| IOT181 |	Different kinds of devices
EDL	00:57:22,687	00:57:26,271	| IOT181 |	UK that might be usable or shareable I think about it
EDL	00:57:26,783	00:57:28,575	| IOT181 |	Initial proof of concept
EDL	00:57:28,575	00:57:29,599	| IOT181 |	And probably
EDL	00:57:29,599	00:57:33,951	| IOT181 |	I need to think about potentially due to the concept
EDL	00:57:34,463	00:57:34,975	| IOT181 |	Othello
EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:36,255	| IOT181 |	Okay
EDL	00:57:36,255	00:57:38,303	| IOT181 |	I'm going to call you good news Anne
EDL	00:57:38,815	00:57:41,631	| IOT181 |	From now on all right and thanks so much for coming on the show.
