EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:50,688	| IOT066 |	I mean I have crazy gear but none of my gear actually does
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:51,712	| IOT066 |	What is supposed to do
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:52,736	| IOT066 |	His does
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:55,296	| IOT066 |	Distance backflips no no
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:58,880	| IOT066 |	You could have it do backflips but then it probably wouldn't work as
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:00,928	| IOT066 |	You could do one back
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:01,440	| IOT066 |	What
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:07,840	| IOT066 |	So this week in the podcast where you be talking about the end of I-5 and how did end of life

EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,776	| IOT066 |	The end of ice
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,360	| IOT066 |	You told me about this
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:26,944	| IOT066 |	Doing a web search for the letter i v
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:32,320	| IOT066 |	With what are you talkin about I completely forgot because I used to review of the products from
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| IOT066 |	I-5
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,136	| IOT066 |	Spell e y e
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,952	| IOT066 |	Either like
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:41,024	| IOT066 |	SD cards with whip-like Wi-Fi radios in them
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,864	| IOT066 |	And you would use those to get your photos from a non connector camera
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,144	| IOT066 |	2
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,912	| IOT066 |	Some other device
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,496	| IOT066 |	Take the card out just pop it in another computer
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,312	| IOT066 |	Gets rid of the whole sneakernet thing every was literally just
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,104	| IOT066 |	Wireless a transfer tank
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,616	| IOT066 |	But
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,896	| IOT066 |	Obviously
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,968	| IOT066 |	The rise of smartphones and other connected devices
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,016	| IOT066 |	Obviated the need for a lot of
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:04,832	| IOT066 |	Yes I V came out man like in 2000
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,856	| IOT066 |	R2000
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| IOT066 |	6ish
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:16,096	| IOT066 |	Sixth sense about right and
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,864	| IOT066 |	In time 2
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,400	| IOT066 |	An era where
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:22,240	| IOT066 |	People actually had those little point and shoot cameras
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,288	| IOT066 |	Which you know I had one and
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,616	| IOT066 |	It was it was a little frustrated he would you take a picture and then you'd be like
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,688	| IOT066 |	I have a digital picture and if you wanted to you
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,992	| IOT066 |	Method usually with a USB cord and some
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,784	| IOT066 |	Proprietary software
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,344	| IOT066 |	And then you can get it on your computer and then you could do things
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| IOT066 |	Things with it but
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,392	| IOT066 |	Sci-fi was
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,928	| IOT066 |	Pretty awesome and then it made it
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| IOT066 |	Easier
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,512	| IOT066 |	You just shared it
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:47,072	| IOT066 |	It didn't always work I had really iffy experiences with
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| IOT066 |	Will a little because it work
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,168	| IOT066 |	Two different ways and
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,776	| IOT066 |	We said it beginning II the end of I-5 one of the ways sort of will still work
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,312	| IOT066 |	We'll talk about that in a minute
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,384	| IOT066 |	Maine weather in people used it was to
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,664	| IOT066 |	Abbott photos
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,456	| IOT066 |	Send automatically to an
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,248	| IOT066 |	Through a Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,528	| IOT066 |	They were round
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,368	| IOT066 |	After the cloud and then will be synced on whatever devices you wanted set up everything
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:12,672	| IOT066 |	It seems to me as I read the
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:15,488	| IOT066 |	Rachel on I-5 site that after September 6th
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,536	| IOT066 |	Battle Cloud it is
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,815	| IOT066 |	Pretty much defunct
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,607	| IOT066 |	Because you can't sign up for new
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,119	| IOT066 |	Accounts
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| IOT066 |	September 16th
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:27,007	| IOT066 |	There's another piece of it which I think they called director mode
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:31,359	| IOT066 |	Which would set up an ad hoc network so you could just wirelessly transfer
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,895	| IOT066 |	Turn off all devices
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,407	| IOT066 |	Hunt's photo
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,199	| IOT066 |	Set DSLR
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,479	| IOT066 |	Have the card in it
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,271	| IOT066 |	So that is
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:42,367	| IOT066 |	Theoretically still working and it should still work because that doesn't have any do with the cloud
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,463	| IOT066 |	But there's no guarantee it will work so bi people say after September
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,535	| IOT066 |	It so people are really upset because
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:54,143	| IOT066 |	Basically sent out an email last week saying that they were going to
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,471	| IOT066 |	Shut that aspect of the service down basically all the clouds stuff
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| IOT066 |	And people
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,055	| IOT066 |	They had
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,103	| IOT066 |	Stocks development of these cards
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:08,223	| IOT066 |	In 2012 but they were sold through authorized retailers
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,271	| IOT066 |	Through March 2015
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:15,135	| IOT066 |	So people were like hey this is like a little over a year that I've had this if they just bought one
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,463	| IOT066 |	And then apparently unauthorized retailers
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:22,303	| IOT066 |	Still selling them so like you know if you go on Amazon sometimes you can buy something
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| IOT066 |	That isn't available anymore
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,399	| IOT066 |	Those people may have bought it you know
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,447	| IOT066 |	Who knows when they would have bought it
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,543	| IOT066 |	And those people are really upset because they purchase something that
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,103	| IOT066 |	You know maybe they didn't even get a Year's worth of life out of
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:41,503	| IOT066 |	Right and not all of the products are actually being discontinued or unsupported after the 16th of September
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,783	| IOT066 |	And I say that because
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| IOT066 |	The X2 cars that are ghosts
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,879	| IOT066 |	Specifically mentioned herein those of the older ones
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,975	| IOT066 |	And they are they being eyesight they are giving
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,047	| IOT066 |	People the ability to upgrade you there movie Pro 6
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:54,815	| IOT066 |	Citicards
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:58,143	| IOT066 |	After three units at a 20% discount
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,935	| IOT066 |	And you have to do that before September
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,447	| IOT066 |	15
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,263	| IOT066 |	So they still have something
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:08,895	| IOT066 |	Going to happen are in fact I'm looking at the website now the movie promo cards if you buy them now
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,479	| IOT066 |	You get one year of the ice iCloud service so it's literally just
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,247	| IOT066 |	1
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,527	| IOT066 |	Product line that is
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,575	| IOT066 |	Being discontinued here with cloud service
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,111	| IOT066 |	And there is probably their largest
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| IOT066 |	Ryan Reynolds
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,231	| IOT066 |	They say this is a security issue
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,535	| IOT066 |	And this brings up a couple things so
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,839	| IOT066 |	I'm sure going to hear that it is like the second revolve
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,143	| IOT066 |	I think it's worth thinking about
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,447	| IOT066 |	What it means when you buy a connected device
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:37,567	| IOT066 |	How long-term the support is going to be in for the manufacturers
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,127	| IOT066 |	Do they need to put
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:44,479	| IOT066 |	Closer watch on their retail channels authorized retail channels
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,807	| IOT066 |	What kind of plan for if you're going to obsolete something
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,415	| IOT066 |	Maybe you shorten your window and then you go after
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,719	| IOT066 |	Are authorized retailers more aggressively
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,303	| IOT066 |	There's kind of pros and cons to that because you know sometimes
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,375	| IOT066 |	Things aren't so through authorized retailers
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,959	| IOT066 |	Jennifer variety of reasons maybe it's refurbished
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:07,007	| IOT066 |	We'll get to that later that could be bad
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:12,895	| IOT066 |	Mechanism of controlling your channel which sometimes is it the best for the end consumer
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,991	| IOT066 |	That's where I was going by the inventory Channel
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:20,319	| IOT066 |	So it's one thing for a manufacturer or a product
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,367	| IOT066 |	Designer to know that at some point we
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,927	| IOT066 |	Romance obsoletus or whatever but
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:28,255	| IOT066 |	Do they plan for that inventory probably not if people can still buy them
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,535	| IOT066 |	Chances are they going to keep making them
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:34,143	| IOT066 |	I mean they're going to sell what they have
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,727	| IOT066 |	Also consumers don't we don't know
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,287	| IOT066 |	We don't know what's going on behind the scenes what the plans are so it's
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,079	| IOT066 |	It's really frustrating
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,407	| IOT066 |	I guess we'll skip ahead a little bit
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,991	| IOT066 |	Because this ties into
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| IOT066 |	The Arlo
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,295	| IOT066 |	Camera from Netgear
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,879	| IOT066 |	So I've been testing this out and we'll talk about in a minute but
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:58,719	| IOT066 |	It was two weeks ago I want to say it was recently the subject
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,047	| IOT066 |	Security
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| IOT066 |	Thread on Reddit
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:08,959	| IOT066 |	And a tissue was that somebody had bought an Arlo camera decided they didn't like it and returned it
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,751	| IOT066 |	A couple weeks
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| IOT066 |	Slater they log
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:17,663	| IOT066 |	Vacation on the go
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,431	| IOT066 |	Motion
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| IOT066 |	The camera that they
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| IOT066 |	Return to the vendor that they bought it from
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| IOT066 |	I got an email about it
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,063	| IOT066 |	Correct
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| IOT066 |	This person was like well that's terrible that I can see this family
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,671	| IOT066 |	Quit
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| IOT066 |	Purchased
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,975	| IOT066 |	His discarded cameras
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:37,887	| IOT066 |	So daycares response was like we're aware of this which is why we tell our sellers to actually send
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| IOT066 |	The devices back to
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| IOT066 |	Netgear
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,959	| IOT066 |	For hard reset
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,495	| IOT066 |	Which wasn't
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,823	| IOT066 |	That makes me feel like
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| IOT066 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,383	| IOT066 |	Are the retailers
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,711	| IOT066 |	So are your authorized retailers going to be your friend
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,015	| IOT066 |	Your phone and are you going to treat them
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,343	| IOT066 |	If they're going to be such an important Link in the chain here
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:00,415	| IOT066 |	It's got to rethink the relationship between
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:04,511	| IOT066 |	The consumer and retailers and the manufacturers and their authorized retailer
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:11,423	| IOT066 |	I see both sides of this one for one thing we should mention we can already be personal return the cameras
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:14,495	| IOT066 |	He didn't like reset them or do anything he said he forgot to reset the
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,287	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| IOT066 |	There's some burden on the can
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,847	| IOT066 |	Consumer to think ahead
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:24,479	| IOT066 |	Which une iot device if you're no longer going to use it or going to retire it you should be trying to
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,271	| IOT066 |	Factory reset it if it all possible
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,551	| IOT066 |	He did not do that
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:28,831	| IOT066 |	What's your
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| IOT066 |	Yeah we got a level of trust
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,951	| IOT066 |	Third-party vendors worthies middle
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,767	| IOT066 |	Where people that you know sell products
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:41,631	| IOT066 |	I don't know what Memories Are
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,959	| IOT066 |	Can you tell I did it for 15 years a long time ago
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:49,823	| IOT066 |	Middleman in this transaction didn't do their job but the fact of the matter is
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:54,687	| IOT066 |	Retailers don't make money doing things like that retailers make money by selling products
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| IOT066 |	So what's the incentive
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| IOT066 |	For that retailer to
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,063	| IOT066 |	Send it back to Netgear or trying
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:03,135	| IOT066 |	Mulefactory set himself to sell as a refurbished unit
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,463	| IOT066 |	They're does in
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,559	| IOT066 |	With connectivity we actually have a really good way of going about doing this
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,119	| IOT066 |	I will say
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,911	| IOT066 |	It's possible to know
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:18,239	| IOT066 |	When connected device changes networks Wi-Fi networks for example
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,543	| IOT066 |	It could be very easy
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT066 |	4
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,103	| IOT066 |	Maybe not very easy
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:25,407	| IOT066 |	When a new device connects to a new network
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| IOT066 |	Ask the person
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,527	| IOT066 |	Are you XYZ the last known person on this account
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:35,647	| IOT066 |	It's very similar to how if you log onto like a web services account from a different
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,159	| IOT066 |	Computer
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| IOT066 |	Sometimes they will
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:41,279	| IOT066 |	Be like you'll either get an email or some sort of notifications
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,815	| IOT066 |	By the way
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| IOT066 |	You just like
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,863	| IOT066 |	Completely new device
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,143	| IOT066 |	Is issue
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:51,007	| IOT066 |	Or the web service will say I am not logged in here on this computer you know please enter this
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,287	| IOT066 |	Password or whatever
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,335	| IOT066 |	And there's another level of authorization
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| IOT066 |	Exactly so if
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,663	| IOT066 |	Something like that
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,479	| IOT066 |	Is doable that could be a way around something
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,527	| IOT066 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:05,855	| IOT066 |	As someone who tests a lot of these devices
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,927	| IOT066 |	Create counts download stuff
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,767	| IOT066 |	Put things on my network and then I send them back
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,887	| IOT066 |	So I will say that I always
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| IOT066 |	Look for a way
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| IOT066 |	To delete the device
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,007	| IOT066 |	Where do a hard reset on my devices
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,799	| IOT066 |	I will say though
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,847	| IOT066 |	Did not every product offers that
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,687	| IOT066 |	That is also true and every product should any that should be
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:34,015	| IOT066 |	A given for these types of devices
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| IOT066 |	Sometime before you know
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,903	| IOT066 |	Alpha Testing and sending it out for beta you need to have
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,439	| IOT066 |	A way to
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| IOT066 |	At a minimum delete the device
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| IOT066 |	Count in the software
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,351	| IOT066 |	So I guess we're asking for three things here
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:53,215	| IOT066 |	Hard reset button on the device awaited to delete the device from your account
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,239	| IOT066 |	In the app
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:54,751	| IOT066 |	And then
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,031	| IOT066 |	3
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| IOT066 |	Is
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:00,895	| IOT066 |	Do you want to get extra fancy create an extra layer security by noting
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,663	| IOT066 |	When a device change
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:06,271	| IOT066 |	What other got here I want to let Netgear off the hook here
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,575	| IOT066 |	And here's why I'm saying this and you can tell me what you think
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,135	| IOT066 |	The fact of the matter is this guy rich
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,927	| IOT066 |	Camera okay
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,719	| IOT066 |	When he got the email notification
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,279	| IOT066 |	That says hey your camera just detected motion
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,095	| IOT066 |	Obviously the camera is connected somebody else's house
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| IOT066 |	They have their own cow
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,167	| IOT066 |	What is tied to that camera
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,703	| IOT066 |	And yet
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,215	| IOT066 |	His
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,519	| IOT066 |	Account is also tied to that cat
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,567	| IOT066 |	That should never happen
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| IOT066 |	That is true
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,895	| IOT066 |	It should be a one-to-one
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,687	| IOT066 |	Your user to device
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| IOT066 |	Argue
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,271	| IOT066 |	Like right now
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,879	| IOT066 |	Cuz I shared my Arlo camera
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| IOT066 |	I was with you so you could see what
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,671	| IOT066 |	What it's about
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,487	| IOT066 |	Which I forgot to look
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,839	| IOT066 |	Satanic big party for Fourth of July I missed it cuz I was packing
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,935	| IOT066 |	It's not even Skyping it
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,703	| IOT066 |	I'd be watching
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,239	| IOT066 |	The camera
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| IOT066 |	Saints score
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:03,103	| IOT066 |	Shooting off fireworks and drinking while I'm sitting here packing up
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| IOT066 |	U-Haul
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,407	| IOT066 |	I can see why you
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,943	| IOT066 |	Sorry
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:08,991	| IOT066 |	Your
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,295	| IOT066 |	Did you have to create a separate account
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,319	| IOT066 |	Want to get access to it
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,903	| IOT066 |	Yes I do it's easy to accept this invitation I'm reading the email that
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,951	| IOT066 |	When you invited me
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT066 |	I got
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:22,815	| IOT066 |	Advantage of create your own Arlo netgear.com account
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,351	| IOT066 |	So there you go
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,679	| IOT066 |	So it is time multiple accounts
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,191	| IOT066 |	To a device
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,983	| IOT066 |	A better way
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,263	| IOT066 |	Sorry
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,055	| IOT066 |	Okay I was like cuz that's that's a
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,871	| IOT066 |	Semi legit reason to
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,175	| IOT066 |	Do it is if you wanted to invite
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,687	| IOT066 |	You know
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,527	| IOT066 |	Maybe it's something in the baby's room and you want invite the grandparents to see it
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:48,415	| IOT066 |	Oh you're right you're right I mean I don't know what if there's a better way
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,695	| IOT066 |	When it's more secure and sell them
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,023	| IOT066 |	I don't know what just seems like these two accounts
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,839	| IOT066 |	Obviously these folks are not on purpose sharing their
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,375	| IOT066 |	Camera with him
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,423	| IOT066 |	Is account is just still attached to it
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,751	| IOT066 |	Give me some division there between
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,567	| IOT066 |	An account that has access to the camera
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:09,663	| IOT066 |	Because if their camera and an account that is shared
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,175	| IOT066 |	Or temporary
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:13,759	| IOT066 |	Like maybe instruction like I would imagine
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,575	| IOT066 |	If you didn't want me seeing your roof top camper anymore you could shut me off
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:17,599	| IOT066 |	I can I can
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:20,159	| IOT066 |	I wonder if these people can
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,255	| IOT066 |	That is another good question
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,375	| IOT066 |	When you buy a new connected device
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,727	| IOT066 |	Are there things that you should look for as a user to see
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:39,359	| IOT066 |	If it's been bought and sold or if there's other accounts attached to it I imagine there's not
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,687	| IOT066 |	Wrote there a lot of these devices that use
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:46,271	| IOT066 |	Tape to close the boxes and some of them you can tell if it's been opened
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:49,343	| IOT066 |	I suppose you can reseal that particular tape a lot of things have
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,903	| IOT066 |	Ink printer tape it says you know
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:56,767	| IOT066 |	710 Freeway
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:59,327	| IOT066 |	I remember unpacking these things and I was like
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:02,143	| IOT066 |	Holy cow how am I ever going to get this back
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,679	| IOT066 |	Together to send it back
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,447	| IOT066 |	But
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:04,959	| IOT066 |	Sia Magic
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| IOT066 |	Sorry
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:11,871	| IOT066 |	Flashbacks to that cuz I was actually a huge deal
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,919	| IOT066 |	This is just so arduous
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,455	| IOT066 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,479	| IOT066 |	That's probably enough of that
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,319	| IOT066 |	We'll talk about the Arlo cameras next show
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,903	| IOT066 |	Because I've actually got some other cameras we can do like a all cameras all the time
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,207	| IOT066 |	Let's skip to the
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,767	| IOT066 |	Nest connected crib for a moment
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,303	| IOT066 |	Because
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:33,375	| IOT066 |	Dang I got this is pretty cool this is Rico found a patent
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,703	| IOT066 |	So we have no idea if Nest is actually working on this or not
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,775	| IOT066 |	But it is a connected crib
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| IOT066 |	It has
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,615	| IOT066 |	Cameras microphones
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,639	| IOT066 |	Sensors in
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| IOT066 |	Matricide
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,431	| IOT066 |	I mean it
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,199	| IOT066 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,735	| IOT066 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,319	| IOT066 |	No no that's what they're known for
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,391	| IOT066 |	A way to quiet
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:56,927	| IOT066 |	That would be
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,207	| IOT066 |	Worth it
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,743	| IOT066 |	So worth it
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,791	| IOT066 |	So I will say
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,583	| IOT066 |	Parenting is one of those
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:06,399	| IOT066 |	Markets in the iot that feels just
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:11,007	| IOT066 |	Rich because parents new parents will spend
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:15,615	| IOT066 |	Gobs of money on ridiculous stuff and only later when they would like return to sanity they like
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,407	| IOT066 |	Wait did I just drop
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,687	| IOT066 |	$1,000 on a
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,271	| IOT066 |	Oh no no no this is a baby shower wish list
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:25,855	| IOT066 |	You have somebody else by this for you
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,183	| IOT066 |	I did also
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,719	| IOT066 |	I bought a crib
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,767	| IOT066 |	I did buy the mattress and then I bought a baby
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,791	| IOT066 |	Baby monitor
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,095	| IOT066 |	Hey why don't we
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,631	| IOT066 |	Magical system
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:41,983	| IOT066 |	It makes sense to me though I mean it seems like the next logical step baby monitors
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,495	| IOT066 |	Rate
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,311	| IOT066 |	Cameras microphones Etc
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:50,943	| IOT066 |	I mean if you got sensors in there to track the baby's moving so you can tell if a baby is asleep without having to go in there
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:53,247	| IOT066 |	Yeah I guess you can tell from the cameras well unless
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,527	| IOT066 |	I can't see the baby's face
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,575	| IOT066 |	I think a lot of value
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:17:02,719	| IOT066 |	And there are mattresses that like will detect SIDS for you so sudden infant death syndrome
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:11,679	| IOT066 |	Some of them are sensors that are underneath the mattress some of them are mattresses themselves and there's also a whole generation of companies like
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,959	| IOT066 |	Owlet and sproutling in
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,751	| IOT066 |	I know that
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,055	| IOT066 |	Offer some sort of wearables
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:21,919	| IOT066 |	But you either attached to the baby's clothing or you put a sock on them or like a little bracelet around their foot
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,759	| IOT066 |	This is a rich Market
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,295	| IOT066 |	Because people will pay anything
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:29,087	| IOT066 |	There's a lot of information
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:32,671	| IOT066 |	I love the idea of having like you can track your baby's weight
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,207	| IOT066 |	Very well through like
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,719	| IOT066 |	Just putting
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,767	| IOT066 |	A sensor inside the mattress
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,583	| IOT066 |	I think why things
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,119	| IOT066 |	Biggest why things has a
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,143	| IOT066 |	Baby scale
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,215	| IOT066 |	Just a straight-up connecta baby scale so
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,495	| IOT066 |	There's a lot that could be done
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:52,895	| IOT066 |	I wonder if they could even add that I don't think it's listed in the patent but but patent application
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,687	| IOT066 |	Yak to tell the actual
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,991	| IOT066 |	Skin temperature of the baby and then timeout true
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:59,551	| IOT066 |	Just so happens if they make a thermos hepatitis
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:02,879	| IOT066 |	App to view the baby down radhey
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,391	| IOT066 |	As needed
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,023	| IOT066 |	After 30 minutes
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,655	| IOT066 |	I will say though baby cribs
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,727	| IOT066 |	Are one of those things where you're not supposed to resell them
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:21,055	| IOT066 |	Cases because there's a baby cribs are subject to
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,335	| IOT066 |	Crazy numbers of recalls
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,151	| IOT066 |	A lot of people
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,455	| IOT066 |	You know baby crib is not a device that
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:29,247	| IOT066 |	It's like a generational thing like
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,807	| IOT066 |	Literally my daughter slept in my old
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,343	| IOT066 |	Very not safe baby crib
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:36,671	| IOT066 |	That was at my parents house you no one would go visit and
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:37,695	| IOT066 |	Please do not
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,999	| IOT066 |	And the CPS
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:43,583	| IOT066 |	With a connected Crib in like the life cycles were seeing
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,375	| IOT066 |	This is something that
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,423	| IOT066 |	Time is it going to be recyclable or
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:50,751	| IOT066 |	What because this isn't something I feel like you could have for like
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,055	| IOT066 |	25 years and keep it in your attic waiting for grandchild
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,615	| IOT066 |	No it's not it's all integrated in
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,151	| IOT066 |	Benefits add-ons to
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:01,503	| IOT066 |	In frame or something in the mattress that's one thing but it's integrated in no I mean it's like saying
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:05,855	| IOT066 |	Smartphone that I bought this year is going to be my smartphone in 25 years obviously this topic
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,207	| IOT066 |	Yes lot of skepticism here about
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,999	| IOT066 |	If this is a product
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,023	| IOT066 |	What am I look like
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:16,607	| IOT066 |	I will say I talked to a parent and she was like oh that's awesome I can't wait
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:20,447	| IOT066 |	Possible disc
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,727	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:28,127	| IOT066 |	What else do we have let's talk about wink last week we spent a lot of time on wink with the relay switch
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,431	| IOT066 |	Which was the connected Wi-Fi light switch
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:32,735	| IOT066 |	Titan deer week system
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,271	| IOT066 |	Show you all kinds of cool stuff
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:39,135	| IOT066 |	We said that it was $149 for two and $99 for
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,903	| IOT066 |	Reply
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,927	| IOT066 |	Come to find out later
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:44,511	| IOT066 |	The wink had actually done it as a promotional price in
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,303	| IOT066 |	I was not aware of this
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,887	| IOT066 |	So after we launched the podcast we got a bunch of questions for
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:52,703	| IOT066 |	4 people say hundred $49
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:54,495	| IOT066 |	So I reached out to wink and they said
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,079	| IOT066 |	Yes it was initially a promo but we decided to make that the standard
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,103	| IOT066 |	MSRP
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:01,919	| IOT066 |	If you bought it from
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,527	| IOT066 |	Seriously tell him I said
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,439	| IOT066 |	And a lot of you guys seen
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| IOT066 |	Really interested in this product
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,279	| IOT066 |	Your feedback
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:21,631	| IOT066 |	Yeah I was actually disappointed when people started coming back saying I can't get the deal
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,423	| IOT066 |	I actually was online I was able to get the deal
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:26,239	| IOT066 |	Whatever I didn't buy it
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| IOT066 |	Rack up the credit card so
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,663	| IOT066 |	I'm thrilled that it's to Toronto
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,687	| IOT066 |	Yes
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,967	| IOT066 |	So there we go
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,247	| IOT066 |	Russian out
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,271	| IOT066 |	If you are so inclined
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,575	| IOT066 |	Alright final news of note
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,087	| IOT066 |	Is
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,879	| IOT066 |	We got to talk about this
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,439	| IOT066 |	That's cuz I'm a sucker for wireless network
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:50,559	| IOT066 |	Capital keep me from going to.
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,887	| IOT066 |	All right this isn't this is important
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:55,679	| IOT066 |	Laura
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,959	| IOT066 |	Which I think we talked about
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:02,591	| IOT066 |	Daniel Conrad the CEO of beat Network switches alluring at work to talk about the standard
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| IOT066 |	Long distance
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:05,663	| IOT066 |	Lowe's
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,455	| IOT066 |	Network
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,479	| IOT066 |	For The Internet of Things
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:12,063	| IOT066 |	Competitors would include sigfox which is doing kind of proprietary
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,599	| IOT066 |	Same thing
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:19,232	| IOT066 |	Some of the LTE cat 0 lte-m are all efforts to kind of take LTE
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,256	| IOT066 |	And create these
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| IOT066 |	Low data rate Network
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,072	| IOT066 |	And then there's
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:25,120	| IOT066 |	Ingenue and
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,680	| IOT066 |	I want to say there's a couple others running around out there
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,472	| IOT066 |	I don't know what happened with weightless
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:34,592	| IOT066 |	Miley Cyrus older 3-g Networks
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,616	| IOT066 |	Apparently
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:37,408	| IOT066 |	There's more efficiencies and redoing it
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:42,016	| IOT066 |	There are and you know 3geez going to Sunset eventually
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:45,600	| IOT066 |	Not anytime soon 2G is being sunsetted right now
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,392	| IOT066 |	And that's after 115 years
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,464	| IOT066 |	At least
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:50,976	| IOT066 |	If not more
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:57,632	| IOT066 |	This is cheaper there's battery life considerations like 3-g is not the most power-efficient mode
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,424	| IOT066 |	There's
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,960	| IOT066 |	The cost of the modem itself
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,984	| IOT066 |	So it is
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:06,080	| IOT066 |	They're also redesigning for like cellular there we deciding things like
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,896	| IOT066 |	The number of packets that are the header soda
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:12,480	| IOT066 |	Creepy smaller payloads basically to send over the network
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,272	| IOT066 |	So there's a lot happening
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,808	| IOT066 |	Sometimes it's
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,576	| IOT066 |	It's better to start
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,648	| IOT066 |	Dr. Laura
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,952	| IOT066 |	Because a couple big news announcement
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,464	| IOT066 |	Have happened
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,024	| IOT066 |	There's a company in the US called Senate
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,560	| IOT066 |	S e n e t
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,120	| IOT066 |	That has built a network
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,936	| IOT066 |	810 US cities
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,728	| IOT066 |	Before you get too excited
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:40,128	| IOT066 |	I know that these are very small cities and there's only covers about is it's less than 10% of the population
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:41,408	| IOT066 |	But
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:46,016	| IOT066 |	It's really a great start their other companies were trying to build Laura networks in the US so
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,296	| IOT066 |	Ghetto
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:50,112	| IOT066 |	We could see our smoke detectors and
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:54,976	| IOT066 |	Trying to think of other things that you might want at the sensors like parking sensors
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:58,816	| IOT066 |	I was just going to say all the Smart City type devices
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,400	| IOT066 |	Exactly and smart cities
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,680	| IOT066 |	SK Telecom
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,472	| IOT066 |	Is doing a
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,800	| IOT066 |	First I believe Nationwide Lora Network and they're doing it in
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:09,824	| IOT066 |	South Korea
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,360	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| IOT066 |	They actually put out pricing
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:13,920	| IOT066 |	Looks pretty good
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:18,016	| IOT066 |	Interstate at one-tenth the pricing of their LTE based out of
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| IOT066 |	Offering switch
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:24,672	| IOT066 |	No baby gets into creating something new from scratch their able to do so more efficiently but
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,464	| IOT066 |	Es6 different plans for
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:29,280	| IOT066 |	Companies were cities that want to use their
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| IOT066 |	Lora Network
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,328	| IOT066 |	Ranging from
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,912	| IOT066 |	Well the data allowances I should mention
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,960	| IOT066 |	Range from 100
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,984	| IOT066 |	Killing bites
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,288	| IOT066 |	Two 100gb switch
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,872	| IOT066 |	Why are you the cell phone you like nothing
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:46,176	| IOT066 |	Of course these devices really only Center
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:50,784	| IOT066 |	Fixing bleep something of information here and there hopefully depending on the device you know
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,064	| IOT066 |	A water meter doesn't need it
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:54,112	| IOT066 |	Sending outside gig of data every month
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,392	| IOT066 |	No it's not.
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:58,208	| IOT066 |	It's this time and I'm
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,976	| IOT066 |	Open
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| IOT066 |	Enclosed
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,376	| IOT066 |	Exactly exactly not
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,168	| IOT066 |	Continuous streams of data
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,216	| IOT066 |	Where we would use for them for streaming video
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:11,264	| IOT066 |	One example but
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:16,896	| IOT066 |	I'm sipping a pricing standpoint that 100 kilobytes will cost 350 Korean Won
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,408	| IOT066 |	A month
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,944	| IOT066 |	Which is a whopping
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,968	| IOT066 |	$0.30 us
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,504	| IOT066 |	And then if you want
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,576	| IOT066 |	Any plan of 100 megabytes for your devices
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,880	| IOT066 |	It will cost you 2000 Korean Won
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:28,416	| IOT066 |	What is all the dollar 70
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:30,464	| IOT066 |	Now 2
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,000	| IOT066 |	What's crazy is
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,304	| IOT066 |	If you take the
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:34,816	| IOT066 |	$0.30
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:38,400	| IOT066 |	Her hundred kilobyte plan you translate that to megabytes
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| IOT066 |	You had a twin
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,312	| IOT066 |	It was 30 was at $30 for
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,872	| IOT066 |	That was for a hundred megabytes
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,176	| IOT066 |	$0.30 so
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,456	| IOT066 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,736	| IOT066 |	Wow it's adds up quick
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,784	| IOT066 |	So if you're going to
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,576	| IOT066 |	Consume many megabytes
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:58,880	| IOT066 |	Which
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:01,440	| IOT066 |	And again this is what the carriers do with leftover cell
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,512	| IOT066 |	More BiggerPockets cheaper on a
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:07,584	| IOT066 |	Megabyte or kilobyte
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,888	| IOT066 |	And hope that people don't use as much as
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,448	| IOT066 |	I think
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:18,080	| IOT066 |	Haven't had a Colonel Sanders
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,360	| IOT066 |	Chicken bucket in quite a while I've seen
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,664	| IOT066 |	Five different Colonel Sanders in the past too much
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,432	| IOT066 |	What's up
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,736	| IOT066 |	Kept like I'm scarred for life
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,320	| IOT066 |	This is this is pretty cool
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,624	| IOT066 |	So and then there's also in Scotland
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,416	| IOT066 |	The University of Glasgow
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| IOT066 |	Glasgow
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,464	| IOT066 |	Class Portland
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,280	| IOT066 |	Guess I'm not going to
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,048	| IOT066 |	Because it would just be a bear
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,400	| IOT066 |	Network in Glasgow
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,216	| IOT066 |	Dora is really
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| IOT066 |	Taken off
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,312	| IOT066 |	Sigfox which is a French company
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,592	| IOT066 |	Was
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:53,408	| IOT066 |	We heard a lot about that about a year-and-a-half ago
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:54,688	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,760	| IOT066 |	I'll be curious to see how well you know
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,296	| IOT066 |	Laura versus sigfox
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,320	| IOT066 |	How to play this out
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,112	| IOT066 |	I mean there's no one that says we have to
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:02,624	| IOT066 |	At 1
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:06,208	| IOT066 |	But it is nice if you're buying a sensor in
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,976	| IOT066 |	You know
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:11,328	| IOT066 |	These are tiny tiny little devices they're not going to support multiple radio standards on
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,120	| IOT066 |	One of these devices
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:18,752	| IOT066 |	So if you don't have the flexibility might have a tablet or phone we've got room put in
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,800	| IOT066 |	Modems larger modems in different video
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,848	| IOT066 |	Antennas for frequencies
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,896	| IOT066 |	So I should that's a really good point maybe we do need me
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:29,760	| IOT066 |	Maybe we'll get just one I imagine I mean if I was denied once
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:30,528	| IOT066 |	Competition
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| IOT066 |	Ashley between
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,088	| IOT066 |	Linode ideas going
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,904	| IOT066 |	Between a a sick fox versus a
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,184	| IOT066 |	Laura at work
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,256	| IOT066 |	Appeal to me
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,304	| IOT066 |	For Smart City you really wanted to be
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,096	| IOT066 |	You don't have
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,632	| IOT066 |	One radio that works with
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:46,656	| IOT066 |	You're in
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,960	| IOT066 |	Austin and then a different radio that works
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| IOT066 |	Dallas
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,776	| IOT066 |	On your car
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,872	| IOT066 |	You know what they're going to do is they're going to
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:27:00,736	| IOT066 |	There's going to be a whole market for hubs that go on telephone poles that take blue signals in
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,552	| IOT066 |	Jamar hubs
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,088	| IOT066 |	I was like an hour back at the beginning
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:08,416	| IOT066 |	Alright so now that we've come full circle
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| IOT066 |	Please
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,232	| IOT066 |	Stay tuned for our guests Ryan rice
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,000	| IOT066 |	Who is
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,792	| IOT066 |	At American Family Insurance
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:16,352	| IOT066 |	And we were talking about the future of insurance
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,632	| IOT066 |	The future of risk
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,400	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:23,264	| IOT066 |	What technologies ensures might bring into your smartphone
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:27,104	| IOT066 |	Hey this is Stacy I breaking into the iot podcast for a sponsor
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:31,200	| IOT066 |	Search I back with Todd Alka who is the CTO of wolf
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:31,712	| IOT066 |	SSL
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,808	| IOT066 |	Hardware acceleration for securing the internet
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,368	| IOT066 |	You guys have invested a lot
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,416	| IOT066 |	In building software thick
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,464	| IOT066 |	Can take advantage of co-processors
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,744	| IOT066 |	Various devices
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,024	| IOT066 |	Why is that so important
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,864	| IOT066 |	It's really important for our users and makers of devices
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:51,680	| IOT066 |	Because it increases the security level
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:53,728	| IOT066 |	Safety for the users as well
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:55,776	| IOT066 |	The cost
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,592	| IOT066 |	Because I don't have extra memory and fast
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,104	| IOT066 |	Processor
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,432	| IOT066 |	Consumer Buttowski because there's less
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,456	| IOT066 |	Power consumption
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,248	| IOT066 |	So the long run Macy
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:11,648	| IOT066 |	Cheaper priced operate the device it's also huge huge increase in performance
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:16,256	| IOT066 |	Consumer perspective what does it have to do with security
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:22,144	| IOT066 |	The Securities are we done in Hardware so there is less chance for attack
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,192	| IOT066 |	And you can create your safety
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:28,032	| IOT066 |	It's that sounds a little obscure in the home i a t Market you not think of that
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,104	| IOT066 |	Pick up printer attack with someone issues
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,640	| IOT066 |	100000 jobs in a row
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:36,480	| IOT066 |	Duty cycle the printer
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:43,392	| IOT066 |	As a consumer do I have much say or influence in helping make devices more secure
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,440	| IOT066 |	Consumers can have a say is
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:48,256	| IOT066 |	By picking and find bison Sprite that have
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:51,072	| IOT066 |	Locations in this case
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,352	| IOT066 |	CM Security
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:58,240	| IOT066 |	It's highly important to many many users and probably most of your listeners so no one wants to broadcast their
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:02,336	| IOT066 |	Iot devices in vacation mode weather on vacation right or
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,360	| IOT066 |	Stone monster

EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,712	| IOT066 |	So if I'm a manufacturer who cares about
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,224	| IOT066 |	My customers
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,760	| IOT066 |	Why should I
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,040	| IOT066 |	Better security
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| IOT066 |	Good security helps
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:19,232	| IOT066 |	Shimmer with the privacy and risk for the Builder

EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,608	| IOT066 |	So you guys helped implement
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,632	| IOT066 |	All of this
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,704	| IOT066 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,288	| IOT066 |	Where can people find you if they want to call you
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,056	| IOT066 |	For more information
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:39,456	| IOT066 |	Easiest way to reach this is Cam coyote

EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:05,056	| IOT066 |	I am super excited because I think the insurance world has a huge role to play in adoption of the smartphone
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,080	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,360	| IOT066 |	This is going to be fine
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,152	| IOT066 |	Let's get started with
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:11,456	| IOT066 |	You guys have been super innovative
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:14,784	| IOT066 |	Y'all done some Partnerships with ring the door
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:17,856	| IOT066 |	Connect the doorbell company Deltona partnership with Nest protect
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,136	| IOT066 |	And I have subsidized
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,696	| IOT066 |	The cost of the devices in some cases
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,744	| IOT066 |	And you also offer discount for
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,280	| IOT066 |	Companies who are installing
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,816	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| IOT066 |	What is your take on the Smart Home
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,120	| IOT066 |	At Anthem
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:35,008	| IOT066 |	That's why I'd agree with you I think insurance companies have a really unique role to play here I think
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:35,776	| IOT066 |	You know
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,824	| IOT066 |	American Family Insurance
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,104	| IOT066 |	Have been
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:45,504	| IOT066 |	Trying to sort of talk about insurance differently as protecting people's dreams as you know elevated Insurance out of this
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,016	| IOT066 |	Product
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,088	| IOT066 |	Don't really want to use don't know what it is
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:51,648	| IOT066 |	I'm skeptical about it I don't
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,184	| IOT066 |	Interact with it much and
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,976	| IOT066 |	I think the Smart Home
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:55,744	| IOT066 |	MS
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:59,584	| IOT066 |	Huge opportunity for an industry that is going to change a lot
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:01,632	| IOT066 |	In the next I think 10 years
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:08,288	| IOT066 |	Okay well let's breakdown kind of the role of insurance going forward because you're right you guys are thinking about it
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| IOT066 |	When I talk to you guys
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,896	| IOT066 |	You're telling me things like
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:17,248	| IOT066 |	Usually I have to call my insurance company
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:22,880	| IOT066 |	You guys are thinking about making Insurance part of my
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,672	| IOT066 |	More helpful so
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:25,952	| IOT066 |	Can you kind of
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:28,512	| IOT066 |	Break that down and talk about some of the stuff that you guys have
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:33,120	| IOT066 |	Sure so we talked about it this phrase proactive
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,888	| IOT066 |	Protection
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:36,192	| IOT066 |	And I think the opposite of that is reactive reimbursed
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:40,544	| IOT066 |	Which is really what insurance has been for a long long time and if you don't Insurance places
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,568	| IOT066 |	Fundamental role in
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:44,384	| IOT066 |	The economy how many people would own a home if you couldn't get
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,664	| IOT066 |	Insurance
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,432	| IOT066 |	To help
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,480	| IOT066 |	With Banquo
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:51,552	| IOT066 |	Insurance places big rollomatic a little bit of micro-level just
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,576	| IOT066 |	Consumers don't
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:54,112	| IOT066 |	TV everyday value so
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:56,160	| IOT066 |	I think that's a huge opportunity I think
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:32:01,280	| IOT066 |	Today the last year year before I think insurance companies interest was really piqued by the idea of
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,560	| IOT066 |	Loss mitigation
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,096	| IOT066 |	So a home that has
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| IOT066 |	Leak Detectors
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,936	| IOT066 |	Is going to identify and detect a lie
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:12,544	| IOT066 |	And hopefully homeowner will prevent it before it causes massive damage
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:14,080	| IOT066 |	Fires we know that funk
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,848	| IOT066 |	Smoke alarm
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,384	| IOT066 |	Prevent fires
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:21,504	| IOT066 |	So I think the original sort of interest is round loss mitigation I think that's definitely
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,784	| IOT066 |	Thought an angle
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:26,112	| IOT066 |	I think the long-term angle that the better approach is
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| IOT066 |	Product services
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,416	| IOT066 |	Beatrice duchess
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,720	| IOT066 |	Help customers solve problems and all
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,256	| IOT066 |	Okay so
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:37,632	| IOT066 |	What would that look like so let's let's fast-forward three years I've got a bunch of stuff in my home
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,424	| IOT066 |	How would I start to interact
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:39,936	| IOT066 |	With my insurance
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:44,544	| IOT066 |	Church so I think it starts with that sort of same digital
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,056	| IOT066 |	Mobile
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,104	| IOT066 |	Experience that you might
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,896	| IOT066 |	Used for
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:52,736	| IOT066 |	How can I get home products today so I think that could be part of your insurance
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,504	| IOT066 |	Experience I think
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:56,832	| IOT066 |	And iot triggered event like a leak detector
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,392	| IOT066 |	Instead of just notifying you on your home
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,440	| IOT066 |	There might actually be serviced
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:03,744	| IOT066 |	Maybe send somebody else to help you
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,536	| IOT066 |	Check the water offered to help
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,072	| IOT066 |	If you start the process of
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:07,840	| IOT066 |	Cleaning up
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:11,168	| IOT066 |	I think there could be Services that's one example today what we're doing was Ness
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,192	| IOT066 |	Is where
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,984	| IOT066 |	When your batteries
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:14,752	| IOT066 |	Diplo
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,824	| IOT066 |	If you're part of our program American Family automatic
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:18,848	| IOT066 |	We send you replace the battery
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,944	| IOT066 |	Call batteries last long time but that's a cool sort of
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:26,016	| IOT066 |	Think that insurance companies never used to do in the history of insurance
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:29,600	| IOT066 |	You get this data and it's really important to talk about your nest program
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:32,160	| IOT066 |	People at first or like what's happening
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,464	| IOT066 |	Where's if my insurance company seeing all my data
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:36,000	| IOT066 |	That's a little scary so
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:36,768	| IOT066 |	Which nest
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:41,376	| IOT066 |	You don't actually see the data and asked shares the information about
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:49,824	| IOT066 |	Battery life different programs with Masters the works with Nest there's the safety Rewards program is Xavier
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:50,592	| IOT066 |	Doors program was
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:51,872	| IOT066 |	Design for
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,712	| IOT066 |	Insurance industry and we make it very clear when you enroll
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:59,040	| IOT066 |	We ask customers if they're willing to share their data with us
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,808	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,600	| IOT066 |	There's a clear opt-in there's
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,624	| IOT066 |	No way to opt out
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,440	| IOT066 |	And so we are getting battery health data
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,720	| IOT066 |	Top of the people that have
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,256	| IOT066 |	But if I opted into that
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,792	| IOT066 |	Weekend in triggering event
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:15,168	| IOT066 |	Based on low battery so that's an example of a service that I think is really the tip of the iceberg for how weekend
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| IOT066 |	Get to
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,520	| IOT066 |	Adjust notifications popping up
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,568	| IOT066 |	So is part of the nest program
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:28,992	| IOT066 |	The people who opt-in get subsidized Nest protect and they also get a discount on their insurance
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,272	| IOT066 |	What's in it for them other than
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:35,648	| IOT066 |	So they get a discounted product so if
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:39,232	| IOT066 |	Nest it's a free Nest protect right now their work or running in
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,512	| IOT066 |	And state of Minnesota
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,840	| IOT066 |	And in addition to get 5% off of there
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,608	| IOT066 |	Homeowners policy
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:47,168	| IOT066 |	So there's definitely monitoring to a customer
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:49,728	| IOT066 |	But when we talk about it's your cousin
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,008	| IOT066 |	Today's hits about
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,288	| IOT066 |	Helping
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,080	| IOT066 |	People say this. Practice protects
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,104	| IOT066 |	We don't know yet
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:56,640	| IOT066 |	The relationship between
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| IOT066 |	DIY Smart Home
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,456	| IOT066 |	Connected home
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:00,992	| IOT066 |	And insurance
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,040	| IOT066 |	Now we have 85 years of History
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,320	| IOT066 |	All the bad things
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,344	| IOT066 |	Can possibly go wrong
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:05,856	| IOT066 |	When you're home
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:08,416	| IOT066 |	And cause damage and injury
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,184	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:10,976	| IOT066 |	We're trying to figure out what is the relation
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:13,792	| IOT066 |	Shep and can we prevent some of those bad things from happening
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,096	| IOT066 |	What are the next so you got the nest
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,632	| IOT066 |	You got a program with ring
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,168	| IOT066 |	What else are you looking at
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,704	| IOT066 |	Do you know
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:27,104	| IOT066 |	Traditional Going Back 2 years I think there's a few insurance companies looking at the typical losses in the home so fire
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:28,896	| IOT066 |	Are water and staffed and that sort of order
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,688	| IOT066 |	Are the perils
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,712	| IOT066 |	Apparel
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,784	| IOT066 |	60% of the losses are really wind and hail
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:37,088	| IOT066 |	Stuff that happens to your roof and siding the other 40
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,368	| IOT066 |	Percent of stuff inside the home
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,904	| IOT066 |	So can we
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:40,928	| IOT066 |	Create a marriage
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:43,744	| IOT066 |	Connected home or we can actually help prevent these
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,536	| IOT066 |	Carol's are happening inside
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,304	| IOT066 |	The water is
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,072	| IOT066 |	It was a really
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:48,608	| IOT066 |	Space that we're looking at
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:52,192	| IOT066 |	Surprisingly there isn't a ton of really gray water detection
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:54,240	| IOT066 |	Solutions out there there's a lot of sort of low cost
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,264	| IOT066 |	Contact sensors
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,800	| IOT066 |	You can put around this connect to a hub
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,360	| IOT066 |	But I think that's an area that we're seeing some
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:01,152	| IOT066 |	Innovation and receipt companies
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:02,176	| IOT066 |	Start to do more
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:03,712	| IOT066 |	It also kind of brings up to
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,504	| IOT066 |	Point of retrofit which is
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:07,296	| IOT066 |	This isn't like cars
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,576	| IOT066 |	Where everybody's going to have
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,600	| IOT066 |	A new car in 10 years
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:12,928	| IOT066 |	How do you retrofit a home how do you put
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:15,488	| IOT066 |	How do you encourage customers to let you in their homes
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:17,792	| IOT066 |	Stick a water shutoff valve requires a plumber
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,584	| IOT066 |	That's a pretty big ass
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,352	| IOT066 |	Sprite
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:24,192	| IOT066 |	So I think something I've heard you talk about is Smart Homes going to take awhile to get there
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,008	| IOT066 |	Because we're all living in homes that are going to be ready
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:31,104	| IOT066 |	It's true this is this is something that makes me so sad
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:35,712	| IOT066 |	As I rip and replace all kinds of stuff in my home is actually it was built in 2013 and
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:36,992	| IOT066 |	Justin
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,784	| IOT066 |	Justin 3 years
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:43,136	| IOT066 |	This I would have put this in
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,160	| IOT066 |	Course I probably wouldn't work
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:44,672	| IOT066 |	Working 5c
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,720	| IOT066 |	I won't worry about that
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,256	| IOT066 |	So what about trust
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,024	| IOT066 |	Because
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:52,608	| IOT066 |	This sounds really nice I would actually love to have
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:53,376	| IOT066 |	Hero
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,656	| IOT066 |	A notification
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,960	| IOT066 |	Stacy by the way you got to leak
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:37:00,800	| IOT066 |	Or we're sensing a lot of water coming into your house somewhere
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:03,872	| IOT066 |	Here's five plumbers that we cover in your area
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,944	| IOT066 |	Do you want us to start asking for estimates
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:08,736	| IOT066 |	I would love you
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,016	| IOT066 |	Forever
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:10,528	| IOT066 |	But
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:13,600	| IOT066 |	A lot of people look at this and think about things like
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:20,000	| IOT066 |	They're going to start costing me money maybe if I don't fix something or they're going to see data and they're going to be like oh we do
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:23,072	| IOT066 |	Not one insurer that house it's got like crazy drafts or I have
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:26,400	| IOT066 |	So how do you kind of address the idea that
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,936	| IOT066 |	You guys are going to get this data
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:29,216	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:30,496	| IOT066 |	Use it for baby
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,776	| IOT066 |	Differential pricing
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,080	| IOT066 |	I don't know something punitive
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:36,896	| IOT066 |	I think that's a very natural
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,432	| IOT066 |	Expected response
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,968	| IOT066 |	Summarize the time because I think
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:46,368	| IOT066 |	You look at the insurance industry the whole it needs to change I think
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,904	| IOT066 |	Find a different areas where
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,184	| IOT066 |	Call Jessica
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:50,208	| IOT066 |	I think
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:54,816	| IOT066 |	If you understand the business we're in and we're rats today I think it makes more sense so
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:57,120	| IOT066 |	What's walk down at example of
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:38:00,192	| IOT066 |	Aviva insurance company I mean I already today
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:02,240	| IOT066 |	The insurance is in what we call low engaged
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:06,592	| IOT066 |	Consumers do not interact with a very often other than paying for a bill
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:08,384	| IOT066 |	Maybe once every 10 years you have a claim
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,968	| IOT066 |	What's the fact that we live in an age
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:16,064	| IOT066 |	Exponential technology growth we live in an age of One Click Amazon
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT066 |	Shopping
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:21,184	| IOT066 |	And Uber description of experiences the den entrepreneur Ozark rating
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,232	| IOT066 |	That's a recipe for Destruction
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:26,560	| IOT066 |	So I think any insurance company that thinks they're going to use this data to
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:31,680	| IOT066 |	Sophisticate there their pricing model which is already pretty sophisticated and not
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,984	| IOT066 |	Ensure people raise prices
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,520	| IOT066 |	How is that going to impact
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:37,568	| IOT066 |	Customer experience in any sort of positive way
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:38,592	| IOT066 |	They want
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,384	| IOT066 |	And I think that's the recipe
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,152	| IOT066 |	For failure
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:41,920	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:44,224	| IOT066 |	I mean we're looking at this really at the long-term and saying
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,528	| IOT066 |	How do we take an industry that
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,088	| IOT066 |	Yo is it love today and how do we make it lost
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,392	| IOT066 |	Because that's really where
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,416	| IOT066 |	Long-term
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:53,952	| IOT066 |	Excessive going to rest
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,512	| IOT066 |	And as we add this kind of data
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,048	| IOT066 |	How does this change
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:02,656	| IOT066 |	Underwriting practices and kind of what risks because if you can say
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:04,960	| IOT066 |	You got the sensor in your house that
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:07,520	| IOT066 |	Can detect a leak before it gets bad
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:10,336	| IOT066 |	Your reducing a large
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,152	| IOT066 |	Chunk of Rights provided someone takes action
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,176	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:21,344	| IOT066 |	Does this mean like eventually overtime my insurance rates could go lower insurance as we know it
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,904	| IOT066 |	Because we know it is going to change so take the car for example
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,464	| IOT066 |	People predicting anywhere between
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:30,304	| IOT066 |	20 and fifty years that there will really won't be personal Auto Insurance
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:36,448	| IOT066 |	Anderson companies either companies are going to make the artificial intelligence that runs the car they're going to pick up the liability insurance
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,984	| IOT066 |	Another example is
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,264	| IOT066 |	Is cyber cyber threat
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,288	| IOT066 |	Cyber insurance
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:44,128	| IOT066 |	So much of the world is going from physical to digital that a lot of threats or now
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:47,968	| IOT066 |	Cyberspace so if you're not into cyberspace 20 years from now
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:50,272	| IOT066 |	Yeah will you be around will you be relevant
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,040	| IOT066 |	So I think
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:52,320	| IOT066 |	Risk is changing
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:55,136	| IOT066 |	Customer perception of a current industry is not great
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,952	| IOT066 |	And I think the connected home presents this
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:59,232	| IOT066 |	Wonderful opportunity
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| IOT066 |	B2
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,792	| IOT066 |	Be a hero brand you better
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:07,424	| IOT066 |	Farris Motor Company you guys have a team driving program and I think it's actually exemplifies that type of thinking
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:11,776	| IOT066 |	Do you want to talk a little bit about that I'm very passionate about that that was my job for
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:14,848	| IOT066 |	Well over a year was to travel around Middle America in
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:15,616	| IOT066 |	Meet with parents
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,664	| IOT066 |	Continue to try to convince them to put this
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:19,712	| IOT066 |	Basically a video camera in there
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,480	| IOT066 |	Cars
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:26,624	| IOT066 |	And that's sort of the seeds were planted there I think of American families Innovation or rats today so what happened is
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,416	| IOT066 |	There was a video event
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:32,512	| IOT066 |	Recorder that would get placed in the car and it would be triggered off of motion
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:38,144	| IOT066 |	So it's the teen driver did an erratic turn or slammed on the brakes all the things that actually lead to accidents
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:42,752	| IOT066 |	Hayward be a video clip that was sent to the parents so it only recorded you if you did something
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:47,872	| IOT066 |	And so quickly overtime in a very short period of time
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:48,640	| IOT066 |	Beetlejuice
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,944	| IOT066 |	Went from like 40% to 100%
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,504	| IOT066 |	So all the sudden have kids with driving with a seatbelt
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:56,576	| IOT066 |	The next thing was parents started talk about tailgating
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,624	| IOT066 |	Stop texting while driving those types
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,416	| IOT066 |	What is program
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:01,696	| IOT066 |	Doubt it was
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:06,048	| IOT066 |	Economically was it sound no cost for way too high back then but costs are coming down
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,328	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,888	| IOT066 |	You cannot do the same thing with your phone basic
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,936	| IOT066 |	Zapp's today that you can mount on your dash
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,984	| IOT066 |	Duke primary the same thing
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:17,312	| IOT066 |	And out of that program I saw parents in tears
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:21,408	| IOT066 |	Saying I will never switch to another insurance company you guys helped save
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,200	| IOT066 |	My son or daughter's life
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:25,504	| IOT066 |	And that's a really powerful thing when you're in the industry this
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:30,880	| IOT066 |	Has historically I changed a lot
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:33,440	| IOT066 |	Can drive a whole new different type of business
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:36,256	| IOT066 |	OKC and I would
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:36,768	| IOT066 |	Question
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,352	| IOT066 |	Power to you guys protect my child
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:47,520	| IOT066 |	To show every time you break rapidly
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,312	| IOT066 |	My husband would go for it.
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:55,199	| IOT066 |	Yeah and if you look at where the usage-based insurance industry is gone
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,479	| IOT066 |	There's very few companies
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:58,783	| IOT066 |	Second cousin
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,551	| IOT066 |	Sleep analyzer
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:01,855	| IOT066 |	Driving bad most of them
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:07,743	| IOT066 |	I think most insurance companies are hesitant to go in that other direction and to penalize people for
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:10,815	| IOT066 |	What to eat Pacific risky Behavior
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,839	| IOT066 |	I certainly know
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,375	| IOT066 |	Are we taking
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:14,399	| IOT066 |	Incredible amounts of
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,935	| IOT066 |	Carson and
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,471	| IOT066 |	Effort
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,263	| IOT066 |	Detroit number one transparent with customers
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:21,055	| IOT066 |	If they know what's going on
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:21,823	| IOT066 |	Why are using a
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:24,383	| IOT066 |	Opt-in for the voluntary
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:26,175	| IOT066 |	Answer some benefits of them
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:33,087	| IOT066 |	I think what we found in are certainly connected home and working the connected cars that's the recipe for
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:34,367	| IOT066 |	Mutual Trust
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:34,879	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:36,927	| IOT066 |	Awesome
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:39,999	| IOT066 |	Alright well let's go into the connected home a little bit because
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:46,655	| IOT066 |	You guys have experimented with I think you told me for every program y'all Implement y'all have tried out 22:30 differ
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,959	| IOT066 |	Other devices on the back
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:49,471	| IOT066 |	Gantz o
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,263	| IOT066 |	You seen a lot of stuff
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,031	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,055	| IOT066 |	Where do you think
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,335	| IOT066 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:58,175	| IOT066 |	Yeah I think if we were to sign intelligence
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:59,455	| IOT066 |	Score
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:01,247	| IOT066 |	People that this is the intelligent home
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,063	| IOT066 |	I think it's somewhere you know around an IQ of us
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:07,135	| IOT066 |	Sixty or seventy I think it's you know it's sort of a mentally deficient
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,671	| IOT066 |	Home it's not a smart
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:10,463	| IOT066 |	But that's good because
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:13,279	| IOT066 |	Fights in years ago it was a totally unintelligent
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,815	| IOT066 |	What I'm seeing as
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:15,839	| IOT066 |	Success
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:16,863	| IOT066 |	Companies
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,167	| IOT066 |	Salisbury specific problems
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:22,239	| IOT066 |	Wonderful Whites of the nest

EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,799	| IOT066 |	Was way better than the old
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:25,567	| IOT066 |	Programmable thermostat
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:29,663	| IOT066 |	Sold a very specific problem right then try to create
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,431	| IOT066 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,711	| IOT066 |	The ring video doorbell
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:33,503	| IOT066 |	Is about
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,527	| IOT066 |	Preventing
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,807	| IOT066 |	Justin burglaries in neighborhood
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:38,111	| IOT066 |	And everybody has a dork
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:39,135	| IOT066 |	Nobody knows
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:42,463	| IOT066 |	That the old doorbell did one thing and the ring doorbell does like
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,231	| IOT066 |	20 awesome things
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:45,535	| IOT066 |	I should interrupt you for a second
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:47,071	| IOT066 |	To know that you guys are an investor
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:50,399	| IOT066 |	Thank you yes we are an investor with a venture capital
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,703	| IOT066 |	We have a investment in
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:56,799	| IOT066 |	But ring is interesting because people get it because they sink
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,335	| IOT066 |	Did they want they wanted to protect their home
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:01,151	| IOT066 |	Outside in a public
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:01,919	| IOT066 |	Space
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:03,199	| IOT066 |	Scrapy in any way
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:05,503	| IOT066 |	That's something somebody can hack him
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:09,343	| IOT066 |	See inside your home but when they get it they have all these other benefit
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,879	| IOT066 |	It's like they see when packages arrive
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,159	| IOT066 |	Macy win
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:15,487	| IOT066 |	Your friends come to the home and now you can unlock your door
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:17,791	| IOT066 |	From ring administrations that they're building so I think
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,839	| IOT066 |	Rings for broke through
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| IOT066 |	By being really really good at
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,167	| IOT066 |	Solving cost
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:23,935	| IOT066 |	4 problems
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,959	| IOT066 |	Pacific area
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:28,543	| IOT066 |	I think what's going to happen is now with sort of programs like works with nest
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,615	| IOT066 |	People get these things it solves problems for them
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:34,943	| IOT066 |	And I can maybe get another thing in the Abby's building blocks
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:38,783	| IOT066 |	And then pretty soon things like Amazon Echo come along make
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:39,807	| IOT066 |	Easier to work with them
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,855	| IOT066 |	And I think it's going to take time off
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,367	| IOT066 |	Will get there
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:48,511	| IOT066 |	So let's talk about Amazon Echo because in the last probably I'm going to say 6
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,535	| IOT066 |	12 months
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:57,727	| IOT066 |	Everyone's like oh my God I have a smart home I have voice control it's amazing it was it's kind of like
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:58,751	| IOT066 |	Possibly
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:02,591	| IOT066 |	What is your oven do you have one what are you guys
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,103	| IOT066 |	Speak about that
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:05,407	| IOT066 |	Yeah I have one eye
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:07,455	| IOT066 |	Can I retested Schoology
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,223	| IOT066 |	Devices
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:10,527	| IOT066 |	Test of in my home personally
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:11,295	| IOT066 |	Oh my pasta
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:14,623	| IOT066 |	Big family issues with cameras in the house and
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,415	| IOT066 |	At the echo is
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| IOT066 |	Really interesting
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:19,487	| IOT066 |	She follows where the customer adoption
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,023	| IOT066 |	All these devices
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:24,095	| IOT066 |	It's a lot of the stuff is early adopters will buy anything
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:24,863	| IOT066 |	If it's cool
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,399	| IOT066 |	Engadget e Wright
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:31,775	| IOT066 |	What happened with the echo is you know it took the interface from the phone and
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:33,311	| IOT066 |	At a fatigue
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,847	| IOT066 |	To the physical world
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,639	| IOT066 |	And I don't think anybody would have predicted
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:37,919	| IOT066 |	The echo
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,991	| IOT066 |	And for me you know it's something that my kids use
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:44,575	| IOT066 |	In fact we got a rule if you if you play Shut Up and Dance One More Time
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:48,671	| IOT066 |	Vehicle goes away and it's something my parents are not giving away to their friends
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:52,255	| IOT066 |	The problem is connected home is really bridging into that mass market and I think
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:53,535	| IOT066 |	Carla Thomas gee
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,327	| IOT066 |	Are the problem I think is
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:57,375	| IOT066 |	Making the devices song
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:01,215	| IOT066 |	Customer problems real problems in the second part of it is making it really easy and natural
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:04,543	| IOT066 |	I have to ask this because you are an investor
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:12,991	| IOT066 |	And it was a step back for the industry the shutdown of the revolve Hub in the absolute
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:15,807	| IOT066 |	The way it was handled felt really
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:16,831	| IOT066 |	Preemptive
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:18,111	| IOT066 |	And now they're giving
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:19,903	| IOT066 |	A refund to people who bought it
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:23,231	| IOT066 |	Aren't the nest guys are getting a refund of people about it
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:26,303	| IOT066 |	Beforehand they just for like hey Rita shut this device down
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:27,839	| IOT066 |	And
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:28,863	| IOT066 |	Thank you
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:29,887	| IOT066 |	So
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,423	| IOT066 |	How did you feel like
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:34,239	| IOT066 |	That was handled or that could have been
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,799	| IOT066 |	I can't comment on
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:38,335	| IOT066 |	Specifics of nest
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:41,151	| IOT066 |	Handling of the Revolt shot. Bride you think it shows you
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:45,759	| IOT066 |	And if you talk to the people at Bolton other places and no Hardware really well
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:50,623	| IOT066 |	It just shows you how difficult it is to be in the space you know how do you sound setup
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:51,903	| IOT066 |	How do you turn something off
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,695	| IOT066 |	Because it was so publicized
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,231	| IOT066 |	I think it did
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:47:02,143	| IOT066 |	Do some damage to adoption is a whole cuz people were forced to suddenly realize it there is spending a lot of
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:02,911	| IOT066 |	Nice things in
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:06,751	| IOT066 |	Is something that's owned by such a legit company could suddenly go away like
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,567	| IOT066 |	It was kind of like
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:12,639	| IOT066 |	What am I really willing to invest on all this stuff
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:17,759	| IOT066 |	Yeah so if you spend $203 on device how long do you expect it to last
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:19,295	| IOT066 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:21,343	| IOT066 |	I think we're learning I think
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:22,879	| IOT066 |	Industry still trying to figure that out
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:24,927	| IOT066 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:26,719	| IOT066 |	Final question for you
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:28,767	| IOT066 |	Because you tested so many things
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:30,559	| IOT066 |	What are your
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:34,399	| IOT066 |	Favorite devices or what are you looking for excited about then
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:35,679	| IOT066 |	Years to come
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,471	| IOT066 |	Well I'm really
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,007	| IOT066 |	Interested in
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:40,287	| IOT066 |	Now is
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,567	| IOT066 |	How these devices
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,871	| IOT066 |	And how the data from these devices
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,151	| IOT066 |	Can lead to service
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,967	| IOT066 |	So I think that opportunity for
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:50,015	| IOT066 |	Connected home is not
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:52,575	| IOT066 |	Notifications in apps I think it's healthy
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:56,415	| IOT066 |	The data the real data from The Real World which is busy
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:58,719	| IOT066 |	Instrumentation
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,511	| IOT066 |	How do we use that information
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:03,839	| IOT066 |	To create new products and services that
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:05,119	| IOT066 |	Never existed before
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:08,959	| IOT066 |	We still screen and test a ton of
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,239	| IOT066 |	Devices ID
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:13,055	| IOT066 |	Amazon
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:14,591	| IOT066 |	That goes for the Breakthrough
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,615	| IOT066 |	In the last year
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:18,943	| IOT066 |	There's a lot of cool stuff for looking at now and that's where the water shut off side
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,479	| IOT066 |	But I think
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:21,503	| IOT066 |	Really it's about
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:23,551	| IOT066 |	Services I think that's what we're seeing from
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,575	| IOT066 |	Consumers wants
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:27,391	| IOT066 |	Yo bro get a real big aha this last
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:29,951	| IOT066 |	Which was it's not really the connected home it's the home
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:31,999	| IOT066 |	It might be that may be connected
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:35,583	| IOT066 |	It's the home and it's homeowners that are living in the home that have real problems
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:37,119	| IOT066 |	That they need salt
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:40,959	| IOT066 |	Owning a home is one of the most complicated challenging things
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:42,495	| IOT066 |	32 speight painting to home
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:46,335	| IOT066 |	Childish things that you're not doing right now and I'm not doing that we don't even need me
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:47,615	| IOT066 |	No need to do
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:49,663	| IOT066 |	I change the furnace filter
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:51,199	| IOT066 |	Every six months or
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:51,967	| IOT066 |	What we started
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,735	| IOT066 |	Dive into
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:54,015	| IOT066 |	Is less of the gas
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,551	| IOT066 |	Three more of the problems in the home
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:49:01,183	| IOT066 |	And how can connected home be apart about holistic solution that includes devices-and-services and insurance
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:02,463	| IOT066 |	I can't wait
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:04,511	| IOT066 |	I should ask you I lied to you
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:05,535	| IOT066 |	One more question
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:11,679	| IOT066 |	Am I ever going to have to have like an app for my insurance company for monitoring this or do you guys want to do most of this through
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:12,191	| IOT066 |	Partnerships
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:15,519	| IOT066 |	I think you're going to find delightful
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:17,567	| IOT066 |	But you have insurance companies do it right with
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:20,895	| IOT066 |	You know American Family certainly thinks we're heading that direction you're going to want to
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:22,943	| IOT066 |	Use your insurance app
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:26,015	| IOT066 |	Mobile app or mobile experience because it's more than just
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:26,783	| IOT066 |	What happened
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:28,063	| IOT066 |	It might be
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:29,599	| IOT066 |	Contextual information about
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:30,879	| IOT066 |	The weather it might be
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:32,159	| IOT066 |	Information about
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:33,695	| IOT066 |	Non iot device
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:35,999	| IOT066 |	That you care about the robin
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:38,303	| IOT066 |	Oh you could do a partnership with next door
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:41,119	| IOT066 |	You could be like hey there's been a rash of burglaries in your area
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:43,423	| IOT066 |	There was a company we looked at that was
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:49,823	| IOT066 |	Layering from connected home to external Transportation so do I want to go get on the
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:51,615	| IOT066 |	Bicycle or do I want to take the bus
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:55,455	| IOT066 |	You're so not just me and my home but as I leave my home and go by lights
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:58,015	| IOT066 |	Flight yeah I think actually
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,551	| IOT066 |	Connected home app
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:02,879	| IOT066 |	Is going to be part of something bigger
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,391	| IOT066 |	Sing
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:05,695	| IOT066 |	In the future now is that insurance
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:06,719	| IOT066 |	We certainly hope we're
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:11,583	| IOT066 |	Have that sort of role in people's lives
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:18,495	| IOT066 |	Thank you for having me that's it for this week's show please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
