EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:13,568	| IOT053 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:14,080	00:00:14,592	| IOT053 |	Cohoes
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:15,872	| IOT053 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:19,200	| IOT053 |	And today we have amazingly huge news
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:21,504	| IOT053 |	We've got reviews of the Amazon.
EDL	00:00:21,504	00:00:25,088	| IOT053 |	And some Integrations that
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:28,928	| IOT053 |	We start a review of the osram lightify switch
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:32,256	| IOT053 |	The big news of the week which is
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:35,328	| IOT053 |	Nest shutting down the revolv smart
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:36,352	| IOT053 |	Hub
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:38,144	| IOT053 |	Later
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:38,912	| IOT053 |	Actually it's Nick
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:40,192	| IOT053 |	What's my next turn
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:40,960	| IOT053 |	Next month
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:42,240	| IOT053 |	Because Kevin
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:43,520	| IOT053 |	Works for Google
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:49,408	| IOT053 |	Annies nest
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:54,016	| IOT053 |	We're just going to call
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:57,088	| IOT053 |	Google back in 2014 when they bought
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,112	| IOT053 |	Revolve
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,136	| IOT053 |	And so
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:01,184	| IOT053 |	What's happening there is
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:03,744	| IOT053 |	Let me just clarify actually
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:08,096	| IOT053 |	Alphabet bought Nest but Nest itself but revolve correct
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:11,424	| IOT053 |	And I only said it because it's kind of like a separate
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:13,728	| IOT053 |	I think there was told her to be
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:15,776	| IOT053 |	Beaver Run autonomously
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:21,152	| IOT053 |	Yes although what we found a couple weeks ago in the story from the information is that
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,456	| IOT053 |	When next fight dropped
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:29,856	| IOT053 |	That was actually a bill that was brought to them by the Google
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,624	| IOT053 |	Corporate development team
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,416	| IOT053 |	Which
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:32,928	| IOT053 |	You're like
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,256	| IOT053 |	Beaver Falls steel happened
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,536	| IOT053 |	In October
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:39,328	| IOT053 |	Which is several months late
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:41,120	| IOT053 |	9 months after the deal closed
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:41,888	| IOT053 |	And that's almost
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,448	| IOT053 |	2014 A7
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:46,240	| IOT053 |	Yes. Ness pot revolve
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,032	| IOT053 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| IOT053 |	So
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,872	| IOT053 |	And actually at that time I thought they said
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,920	| IOT053 |	That they were no longer going to sell the hardware
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:58,784	| IOT053 |	So what they said at the time I went back and looked at my stories cuz
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| IOT053 |	Remember you cover it
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,600	| IOT053 |	Yeah well okay
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,112	| IOT053 |	We said what
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,672	| IOT053 |	No I guess not
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:12,096	| IOT053 |	People have evolved devices the service will no longer be available as of May 5th
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:15,680	| IOT053 |	Revolve app won't open in the hub won't work that's
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,728	| IOT053 |	I'm reading that verbatim from the revolve block right now
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,800	| IOT053 |	So that's what happened there is a tizzy
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,848	| IOT053 |	And a very
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,152	| IOT053 |	Legitimate sense
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,456	| IOT053 |	Totally understandable sense of frustration from users
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,992	| IOT053 |	To purchase the revolve
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:33,088	| IOT053 |	Which I thought had lifetime service guarantee number one
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:38,720	| IOT053 |	And it did have a one year warranty but since has been sold in a year I guess that's all at the window
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,488	| IOT053 |	Well
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,280	| IOT053 |	Yes so what happened was
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:48,192	| IOT053 |	It was $299 for this Hub and at the time it was going up against things like SmartThings which cost about
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,240	| IOT053 |	Important notice
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,032	| IOT053 |	When it was sold
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| IOT053 |	They said
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,104	| IOT053 |	Rapala / nest
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,408	| IOT053 |	They said they wouldn't update the product
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:02,016	| IOT053 |	They also said they wouldn't Provide support after a year and they also said
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,832	| IOT053 |	Because of a 1-year warranty at the time
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,368	| IOT053 |	You and I on our podcast
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:11,488	| IOT053 |	Prior to this one said that you know that probably meant you shouldn't buy a revolve anytime soon because
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,304	| IOT053 |	It was not going to be updated or kept up
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,608	| IOT053 |	No time
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,400	| IOT053 |	Did they say
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,448	| IOT053 |	Hey
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,544	| IOT053 |	Yeah that's essentially what's happening is the back-end services
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,848	| IOT053 |	Are shutting down leaving these
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,616	| IOT053 |	Hardware
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,664	| IOT053 |	Deaths that people paid to 99 Ford
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,432	| IOT053 |	Arundel
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| IOT053 |	Useless because
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,016	| IOT053 |	It's tied to that service
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| IOT053 |	And
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,576	| IOT053 |	Again I'm going to read from
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,112	| IOT053 |	The site
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:43,232	| IOT053 |	We're pouring all her energy into works with nest and Incredibly excited by what we're making
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:48,864	| IOT053 |	Unfortunately that means we can't allocate resources to revolve anymore and we have to shut down the service
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:52,704	| IOT053 |	People basically a hardware that's just no longer going to work there's no
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,776	| IOT053 |	There's no alternative service don't get into
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| IOT053 |	Nothing has been said about
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:59,360	| IOT053 |	Do you think Services being open source or anything like that
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,640	| IOT053 |	So
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:03,968	| IOT053 |	If you have one of these it literally will not work after May 15th
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:06,528	| IOT053 |	So consumers
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,600	| IOT053 |	Correct that means
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,416	| IOT053 |	When you bought the platform back in 2014
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,488	| IOT053 |	Or late 2013
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,768	| IOT053 |	Because it did exist then
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,303	| IOT053 |	You were probably like
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,583	| IOT053 |	Crap I just spent
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:23,167	| IOT053 |	You know $300 on something and it lasted me for you know
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,679	| IOT053 |	Not even
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:30,847	| IOT053 |	And I can understand me so I can understand people's frustration with the news in the development here but I can also understand why people
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:33,663	| IOT053 |	Chose revolve back that even though it was more expensive
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,199	| IOT053 |	Is if I remember correctly
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:38,527	| IOT053 |	Wasn't that the how the heck pretty much every single radio
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:43,647	| IOT053 |	It had every single radio and when I did I did a comprehensive review of smart home hubs
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,183	| IOT053 |	Christmas of 2013
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:47,487	| IOT053 |	Was actually one of my favorites
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,815	| IOT053 |	It had good software it had great pairing
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,351	| IOT053 |	It it was a really
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT053 |	Good product
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,423	| IOT053 |	Don't know how well it sold
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,215	| IOT053 |	It was only on the market for a limited time
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,751	| IOT053 |	Was expensive
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,311	| IOT053 |	And so when Nest bought them
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| IOT053 |	It was kind of like
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,663	| IOT053 |	That's a bunch of good Engineers from Boulder Colorado
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,199	| IOT053 |	Bricks for the base ship
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,783	| IOT053 |	So I don't know how many people are upset
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,575	| IOT053 |	My hunch is that it's
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,367	| IOT053 |	Probably not as many but
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,903	| IOT053 |	It does bring up
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,927	| IOT053 |	Really important issues for the in
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:23,071	| IOT053 |	We talked about a lot so it's so funny I mean I hate to have bad news
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:27,423	| IOT053 |	Reflect back on the themes that we've been harping on for the past month or two but
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:30,239	| IOT053 |	We haven't talked about this we talked many times about
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:33,823	| IOT053 |	Cloud vs local when it comes to Smart Homes and IRT
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,127	| IOT053 |	We talked about holding devices hostage
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:36,895	| IOT053 |	Instalok
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,687	| IOT053 |	It's a shame that something
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:43,551	| IOT053 |	Tangible had to happen to resurface these discussions but they have to be resurfaced because
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,599	| IOT053 |	There are still challenges that have to be
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,367	| IOT053 |	Resolved
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:50,463	| IOT053 |	It was a big economic challenge actually we don't talk about
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,487	| IOT053 |	And I
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| IOT053 |	We probably should
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,327	| IOT053 |	On the side of the nest folks
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,119	| IOT053 |	Supporting
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:59,167	| IOT053 |	Project with limited users
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:03,519	| IOT053 |	That is not making additional Revenue when you still have to
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:09,407	| IOT053 |	Buy server infrastructure in dilute and engineer or possibly to I don't know how messy it is on the back end
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,687	| IOT053 |	To it
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,991	| IOT053 |	Is expensive and
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,295	| IOT053 |	It doesn't really justify the cost over
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:18,879	| IOT053 |	The potential life cycle of the device in that gets into that disconnect between
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:24,767	| IOT053 |	Installing something in your house and expecting it to last for 10 years and being a business whose like
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,815	| IOT053 |	Oh crap I'm not going to want to search
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,631	| IOT053 |	Forever oh my God what did I do
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,703	| IOT053 |	Yeah because it becomes a numbers game what's the bottom line
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,031	| IOT053 |	That's that's frustrating for
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:38,591	| IOT053 |	Consumers for you know any of these products because
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:44,479	| IOT053 |	It now reaches the questions of you know what other services may go away to render things
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,063	| IOT053 |	Useless you know I mean this could apply to cars this
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| IOT053 |	Reply to
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| IOT053 |	Tea party Lee everything is connected
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:56,511	| IOT053 |	So there was a wonderful recode story talk about Nest only pulling in 340 million of Revenue
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,583	| IOT053 |	And not meeting its like 500 million dollar a year
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,095	| IOT053 |	Targets
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,655	| IOT053 |	I really don't think the
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,423	| IOT053 |	You don't nest
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,239	| IOT053 |	Google would let Nest become little
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,543	| IOT053 |	Warts on your wall right
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| IOT053 |	You know it's true
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,919	| IOT053 |	If you Woulda thought that's what happened to revolve either right now
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,967	| IOT053 |	This is exactly why
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:22,111	| IOT053 |	And I do I have a lot of doubts about companies
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:26,719	| IOT053 |	And they're their thought process around this very few companies I talked to have things like
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:29,791	| IOT053 |	Oh we got an escrow account for our software
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:31,839	| IOT053 |	In case we got a business or
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,863	| IOT053 |	AR
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:33,887	| IOT053 |	Some sort of money to
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| IOT053 |	To keep operating our cloud
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,703	| IOT053 |	If something happens
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,007	| IOT053 |	I love that I wish I wish
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,287	| IOT053 |	Everybody in this industry
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| IOT053 |	Took that approach but
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,359	| IOT053 |	Obviously not everybody does
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:48,223	| IOT053 |	I'll be quite honest I've said many times how much I love the wink hub
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,759	| IOT053 |	When you were reporting that Flex
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,319	| IOT053 |	Butt wink and wink with Sinnoh
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,879	| IOT053 |	Digesting of working everything else I was concerned
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,951	| IOT053 |	Don't my whole platform for my house is that going away will it
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,231	| IOT053 |	Will it shut down
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,791	| IOT053 |	Is it gets frustrating peppermint industry perspective
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:05,375	| IOT053 |	Right in this is one of the reasons why consumers are like
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:07,167	| IOT053 |	They're going to look at this and they're going to like
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,471	| IOT053 |	Oh shoot dance that bullet
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:09,983	| IOT053 |	Screw this Marco
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,823	| IOT053 |	That hurts consumer sentiment as a whole
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,103	| IOT053 |	Which will hold up the industry
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,407	| IOT053 |	So my hope is we get
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,687	| IOT053 |	Some form of
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,247	| IOT053 |	Industry-standard and maybe it's
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,551	| IOT053 |	Maybe it's like security like as a member of the media
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:30,719	| IOT053 |	And we should be talking to our guests like Hey how do you plan to support your stuff if you got a business just like we started we started asking about
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,231	| IOT053 |	About security for the
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,511	| IOT053 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,047	| IOT053 |	It maybe should be a you know what
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:37,119	| IOT053 |	Another must ask question on the list now
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,631	| IOT053 |	And then
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,703	| IOT053 |	The flip side is too mean I'm actually like
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:45,567	| IOT053 |	To the point where I'm well gee maybe I need to go back to a completely local Bass Run on server kind of thing
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| IOT053 |	You know I mean it
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,407	| IOT053 |	Assassin
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,479	| IOT053 |	What to talk about building your own smart home hub
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:52,991	| IOT053 |	Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,783	| IOT053 |	When you can be done
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,319	| IOT053 |	Raspberry Pi openhab
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,623	| IOT053 |	Openhab
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| IOT053 |	So that's the nest
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| IOT053 |	Revolve
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,695	| IOT053 |	Drama
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,719	| IOT053 |	In a nutshell
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:03,743	| IOT053 |	I really like that
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:11,423	| IOT053 |	And our take on it is things like escrow accounts open source software or rather just put in your software in there if you
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,447	| IOT053 |	I want to make it open source
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| IOT053 |	In case something bad happens
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:18,079	| IOT053 |	Negotiations you know when you're negotiating a deal like an m&a deal
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,383	| IOT053 |	Baby you make some sort of
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,663	| IOT053 |	Users
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,967	| IOT053 |	So
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| IOT053 |	I would love to see that
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,807	| IOT053 |	Cuz I mean the value of these companies
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,111	| IOT053 |	It's not actually clear yet what it is
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,927	| IOT053 |	Is it the data is at the user base and
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:33,951	| IOT053 |	That
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:38,303	| IOT053 |	It all starts with a user's because you don't get dead without users number one and
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,839	| IOT053 |	If you don't have a product
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,351	| IOT053 |	2
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,167	| IOT053 |	Offer to people that they want him in
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,983	| IOT053 |	You're not going to have users to me it's all about users
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:49,311	| IOT053 |	Well in that spot revolves though they said it was more about the engineering
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,847	| IOT053 |	Date fruit
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,127	| IOT053 |	So that was kind of an apple higher
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:55,711	| IOT053 |	So I guess truth the writing was on the wall
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| IOT053 |	Possibly.
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,063	| IOT053 |	Actually kind of us cuz they did say they were going to
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,391	| IOT053 |	Add new features and supported after a year so
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,463	| IOT053 |	Yes they didn't say they were going to turn it off
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:15,679	| IOT053 |	Let's move onto a week ago will actually last Thursday so a week from when you guys are hearing this
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| IOT053 |	Kevin and I both
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,543	| IOT053 |	Received
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| IOT053 |	It's actually
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,615	| IOT053 |	Did you got it on Wednesday
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,407	| IOT053 |	I did
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,455	| IOT053 |	I'm not that that matters to anybody who's listening
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,503	| IOT053 |	Yes I got mine before you did
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,623	| IOT053 |	I'm going to talk about
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,647	| IOT053 |	Amazon
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,415	| IOT053 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,951	| IOT053 |	Smaller version
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,999	| IOT053 |	Of the two new products that
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| IOT053 |	Amazon
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,559	| IOT053 |	Put it out and it's
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:47,935	| IOT053 |	The echo lineup what's actually figure out what the heck we're going to call the Amazon Echo.
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:51,519	| IOT053 |	In tap what are those see that's the thing that there's the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,543	| IOT053 |	Then there's the
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,079	| IOT053 |	Amazon.
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,383	| IOT053 |	And then there's the
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,663	| IOT053 |	Echo tap I believe
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| IOT053 |	I thought so
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,039	| IOT053 |	I'm checking as we speak
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:07,903	| IOT053 |	Summit I remember the standing out like all of these there's no consistency in
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| IOT053 |	What is were
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:13,535	| IOT053 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,071	| IOT053 |	The Amazon Echo obviously
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,631	| IOT053 |	The Amazon tap and the Amazon.
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,447	| IOT053 |	So only the echo is the echo
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT053 |	Right
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:24,799	| IOT053 |	Question in our challenge here is
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,615	| IOT053 |	What the heck are we going to call these products because
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:32,991	| IOT053 |	There's a word for the more than the Amazon Echo we have to save the Amazon
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,271	| IOT053 |	Something's
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,831	| IOT053 |	The connected speaker line that's not really it
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| IOT053 |	Bear
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:41,695	| IOT053 |	Voice assistant voice assistant
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:42,975	| IOT053 |	Listeners
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,815	| IOT053 |	Let us know if you have a great idea or if you've heard the actual term
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,583	| IOT053 |	Cuz
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,607	| IOT053 |	Kevin and I cannot read it
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,655	| IOT053 |	Alright so
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| IOT053 |	Back-to-the.
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,215	| IOT053 |	We both elected for.
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,775	| IOT053 |	What we talked about why we had a reader talk to us about their privacy
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,335	| IOT053 |	That's why they got the tap
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,871	| IOT053 |	That's because you are
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,175	| IOT053 |	Tap it on to listen and then tap it back off
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,503	| IOT053 |	Where isthe. Is always listening and has a
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| IOT053 |	Smaller speaker
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| IOT053 |	So Kevin
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,831	| IOT053 |	19 hours
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,367	| IOT053 |	What did you think
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT053 |	I think
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,975	| IOT053 |	I love it I mean I'll I'll be blunt I love it
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:18,559	| IOT053 |	It's it's everything the echo is minus the big
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,095	| IOT053 |	Speaker so it literally few
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:24,447	| IOT053 |	Cut the speaker out of an echo and put the two remaining puts together in middle of a hockey puck that's the.
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,007	| IOT053 |	The speaker that's inside it
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:30,079	| IOT053 |	I really thought would be like maybe just like a phone speaker
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:36,479	| IOT053 |	It is better than that but marginally better than that and you're still not going to fill a room with
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,271	| IOT053 |	Bass and Rich sound but
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:41,343	| IOT053 |	Her background music which I often listen to while I'm working all day long
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,135	| IOT053 |	It's actually fine for that
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,671	| IOT053 |	A little louder than I expected
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,951	| IOT053 |	And
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:50,815	| IOT053 |	Payment setup was a breeze if you already have and I could come through the setup process pretty simple using the same
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:54,911	| IOT053 |	Amazon Alexa app hate to say her name but I had to
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:13:01,567	| IOT053 |	I don't know if you noticed this but your skills and my smart home Integrations all came over
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,895	| IOT053 |	I did not to do anything
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,967	| IOT053 |	McLoud Cafe
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:10,015	| IOT053 |	Are there well that's the benefit
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,807	| IOT053 |	I never said that
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:14,111	| IOT053 |	Cloud cloud is bad I'm just saying
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:18,463	| IOT053 |	You know you got a hold of cloud is available and and up and running for you
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,279	| IOT053 |	Seamless if you already have
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:24,863	| IOT053 |	Amazon Echo your right everything is transfers over the beautiful thing
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,399	| IOT053 |	She was literally plug-and-play at that
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| IOT053 |	Let's figure out
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:32,543	| IOT053 |	Let's figure out where did you put your
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| IOT053 |	Dot it where is your Echo
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,871	| IOT053 |	Spell to
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,663	| IOT053 |	The echo used to be in
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:42,527	| IOT053 |	My home office where I am now on the second floor and that meant only I would be able to use it because
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,575	| IOT053 |	I don't have the door shut when I'm working and someone
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:50,719	| IOT053 |	I have moved the echo down to the family room so it sits between the family room in the kitchen so that everybody can use it
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,279	| IOT053 |	There was also no way to control Smart Home Stuff
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,583	| IOT053 |	I'm downstairs now there is for everybody
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:14:00,191	| IOT053 |	So now that God is taking the place in my home office sitting behind me and I had to connected
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,983	| IOT053 |	Temporarily to a
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,007	| IOT053 |	Jawbone
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:07,615	| IOT053 |	Big Jambox because my Marshall stanmore speaker is broken which I didn't know until I
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,639	| IOT053 |	Connected
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,967	| IOT053 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:15,039	| IOT053 |	Did you name them both I have to say it you guys
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,575	| IOT053 |	Did you name them both
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:21,183	| IOT053 |	Yes I did you don't get any new choices to get the same 3 choices
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,999	| IOT053 |	I kind of thought maybe you could call it. But I thought so too
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,303	| IOT053 |	Yeah no no.
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:30,399	| IOT053 |	No. And if I'm in the middle of the two of them like I'm on the stairs
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,703	| IOT053 |	Between the first and second floor and I shout out her name
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,495	| IOT053 |	She responds on both of them and
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,311	| IOT053 |	Hopefully one or both ears me and they both respond
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,615	| IOT053 |	They work independently I want to be clear
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,663	| IOT053 |	You can't multitask
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,687	| IOT053 |	Music through the
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,967	| IOT053 |	Yet
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:49,855	| IOT053 |	It's a cheap way to add the echo this is what I love about it's an inexpensive way to add it
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,367	| IOT053 |	To all
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,927	| IOT053 |	That's what that mean if you've got it so
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,719	| IOT053 |	We didn't actually specify this but
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,511	| IOT053 |	It comes with a line in
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,023	| IOT053 |	Jack in
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:00,607	| IOT053 |	7.5 mm cord in jackass
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,375	| IOT053 |	Puppet in
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,703	| IOT053 |	I called line in cuz that's the
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,495	| IOT053 |	Commander my sodas
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,079	| IOT053 |	Stand alone till you don't need to connect to a speaker
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,591	| IOT053 |	You do not
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,407	| IOT053 |	I can buy what it is
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:13,919	| IOT053 |	What is great
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:19,807	| IOT053 |	I also connected it to my receiver which is in my AV system which is where I thought I was going to end up putting it
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,855	| IOT053 |	Oh my God it sounded
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| IOT053 |	Like
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,927	| IOT053 |	Just fabulous
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,951	| IOT053 |	I was like what
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,255	| IOT053 |	But we realize that
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,023	| IOT053 |	Because that's
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:29,791	| IOT053 |	Sarhul
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,071	| IOT053 |	Home entertainment system
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:36,703	| IOT053 |	That it's hard when it cuz then it's right by the TV and then if we're watching TV we can't shout it
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:41,311	| IOT053 |	You don't go to church or the. To turn off the television so we ended up
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,079	| IOT053 |	Keeping
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:45,919	| IOT053 |	Original Echo downstairs to the kitchen where it was
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:50,783	| IOT053 |	After a couple days and then we move the. Upstairs
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,063	| IOT053 |	Bedroom and it's actually
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,343	| IOT053 |	My husband
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,135	| IOT053 |	Throughout his alarm clock and made it his alarm
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:58,207	| IOT053 |	Sports crate for that absolutely
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,791	| IOT053 |	Now it's funny you mention the TV because as soon as I got this
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:05,631	| IOT053 |	All we can figure and put the echo downstairs by the TV
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,447	| IOT053 |	I have an Amazon Fire TV connect is that TV
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:14,591	| IOT053 |	And I'm like okay I can use the voice remote for that and I can control the TV you know the playback of Amazon stuff
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,639	| IOT053 |	Wouldn't it be nice if I could just
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,431	| IOT053 |	Use the echo to do that
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:21,247	| IOT053 |	Unfortunate you can't spend mix there's no way that I know of yet
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,319	| IOT053 |	So that is unfortunate now I will say
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,855	| IOT053 |	Here's where we get to some
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| IOT053 |	Integration
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,415	| IOT053 |	You guys are gonna
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,743	| IOT053 |	Or not
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,791	| IOT053 |	So
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,071	| IOT053 |	3 things to know
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,583	| IOT053 |	It integration
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,863	| IOT053 |	1
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,911	| IOT053 |	Amazon is integrating with
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,423	| IOT053 |	Lutron
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,471	| IOT053 |	My favorite light switches
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,239	| IOT053 |	Time interest
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,287	| IOT053 |	Because I forgot to tell you the show
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:48,895	| IOT053 |	Michael pecina the CEO of Lutron is actually Our Guest so stay tuned for him
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,943	| IOT053 |	And
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,455	| IOT053 |	2
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:56,319	| IOT053 |	Comedy clubs you know me that we talked about before also did it integration with nest
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,391	| IOT053 |	Like you said and then three
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,439	| IOT053 |	Amazon on Tuesday this week
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,207	| IOT053 |	Announced
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,255	| IOT053 |	That they're smart home skill API
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,535	| IOT053 |	Is now available
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:09,119	| IOT053 |	Everyone they launched it originally as the Alexa lighting API
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,143	| IOT053 |	Sorry I said
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,959	| IOT053 |	In August 2015
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,519	| IOT053 |	So all the companies that offer
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:19,103	| IOT053 |	Like lighting support like SmartThings Philips Hue Etc
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,383	| IOT053 |	They were all working
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,151	| IOT053 |	Through
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| IOT053 |	That API but now it's
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,711	| IOT053 |	Available to everyone
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:29,855	| IOT053 |	Yay yay so now if you got to connect to thermostat connected lights of any sort you can actually make it
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| IOT053 |	Tourettes with
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:34,463	| IOT053 |	The echo so then you can say I'm going to say it again you guys I'm sorry
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,767	| IOT053 |	Alexa turn on lights as opposed to
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,791	| IOT053 |	Ask lifx
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT053 |	To turn on light
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,375	| IOT053 |	Yeah it's much better with it
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:45,215	| IOT053 |	Native Integrations because it's a more natural language as opposed to the skill
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,751	| IOT053 |	Which is a pattern of words
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,103	| IOT053 |	Hope it all make sense
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,663	| IOT053 |	I have some lights that are
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,943	| IOT053 |	Controlled
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,735	| IOT053 |	If this then that trigger
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,503	| IOT053 |	Russo
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:02,111	| IOT053 |	And then the rest of my lights are normal so I'm constantly struggling with like
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,695	| IOT053 |	Turn on bedroom
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| IOT053 |	Lights
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,767	| IOT053 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:15,935	| IOT053 |	Set it for the integration is the various choices we have with if they're saying that different apis sdks and all that
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:20,543	| IOT053 |	So nice but ultimately made it as ideal because you don't ever think about how to ask it anymore
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,311	| IOT053 |	You still have to pay
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,847	| IOT053 |	Think I'm actually running out of
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,615	| IOT053 |	Words to control
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,199	| IOT053 |	It's more consistent.
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:31,039	| IOT053 |	You don't have to think about cuz I control history if this and that's why I need to ask it this way
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,063	| IOT053 |	In-N-Out
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,111	| IOT053 |	Yes they're slightly less
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,903	| IOT053 |	But sometimes I'm just like
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,303	| IOT053 |	Right
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,071	| IOT053 |	Whatever works
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,351	| IOT053 |	We're not there yet
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,375	| IOT053 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,167	| IOT053 |	But
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,959	| IOT053 |	Okay getting back to the TV
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,495	| IOT053 |	Because science
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,031	| IOT053 |	The integration with yonomi
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:55,359	| IOT053 |	Which is free software that anyone can download on iOS or Android
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:57,151	| IOT053 |	And it's much better than
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,711	| IOT053 |	We reviewed it like a year maybe longer ago
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,759	| IOT053 |	And it was a little buggy but cool
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| IOT053 |	It recognizes
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,343	| IOT053 |	Products like Sonos the Amazon
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,647	| IOT053 |	Nest
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,671	| IOT053 |	Hue Lights
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| IOT053 |	WeMo
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,975	| IOT053 |	The Logitech
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,487	| IOT053 |	Harmony
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| IOT053 |	System hub
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:18,143	| IOT053 |	A couple other things so there's a lot of connected products on it it's free
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:21,471	| IOT053 |	They come with like these setups already programmed
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| IOT053 |	So like
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,775	| IOT053 |	Every time my phone rings
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,567	| IOT053 |	My Sonos is if they're on there
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,335	| IOT053 |	Pause
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,871	| IOT053 |	Which is
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| IOT053 |	I think it's awesome
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,943	| IOT053 |	With the Amazon
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:34,783	| IOT053 |	Devices with the Amazon integration
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,807	| IOT053 |	Now
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:39,903	| IOT053 |	You can actually turn on your TV if you have a Logitech Harmony Hub
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,719	| IOT053 |	Because an all you have to do is say
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,255	| IOT053 |	Hey lady a
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,791	| IOT053 |	Turn on
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,327	| IOT053 |	Movie night
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT053 |	Or whatever your
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,911	| IOT053 |	Your routine is
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,423	| IOT053 |	And you know me
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:56,799	| IOT053 |	So basically now I can control to a limited extent my Sonos has
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,591	| IOT053 |	The echo
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,455	| IOT053 |	I can now set up my TV to turn on
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:03,967	| IOT053 |	With
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,527	| IOT053 |	If I have a Logitech Harmony
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,343	| IOT053 |	Do you like so much worse.
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:09,855	| IOT053 |	It's okay
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,135	| IOT053 |	That is cool
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,975	| IOT053 |	That is cool to do this
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:19,071	| IOT053 |	You need to do a couple things or else it will not work and you will be as frustrated as I was
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:22,143	| IOT053 |	You have to add a device
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| IOT053 |	To you know me you need to
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:27,775	| IOT053 |	Manually for the next like until they update the app you have to manually like
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,055	| IOT053 |	Find devices
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,383	| IOT053 |	And once you've done that you have to go back into
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,407	| IOT053 |	Echo
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:37,759	| IOT053 |	Discover new devices
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,527	| IOT053 |	Keep your order of operations
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,111	| IOT053 |	Write the checking for new devices
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:44,671	| IOT053 |	In the Amazon App should always be the last
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:45,951	| IOT053 |	I believe the last step
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:49,535	| IOT053 |	And if you have the Philips Hue Lights you're going to have to go punch a button
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,839	| IOT053 |	Finally
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,375	| IOT053 |	After that
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:53,887	| IOT053 |	Immigration
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,935	| IOT053 |	There's also the Lutron integration
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,983	| IOT053 |	Which I was really excited about
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,519	| IOT053 |	I realize
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:06,175	| IOT053 |	Cuz I have Lutron lights are connected to the echo through the wing
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,711	| IOT053 |	Link up and I was like
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,247	| IOT053 |	Now I can talk directly to
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,464	| IOT053 |	You can actually talk to right now.
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| IOT053 |	So
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:21,024	| IOT053 |	Can I get rid of that hug just yet
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:21,792	| IOT053 |	Not that we
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:27,424	| IOT053 |	Link up but but you can still use your Echo to control your Lutron switches now
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,704	| IOT053 |	Because of the
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,008	| IOT053 |	True
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:36,384	| IOT053 |	If you don't have the wing but you have like the Lutron Bridge which people may have bought for homekit compatibility
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,408	| IOT053 |	Cuz it was one of the first ones
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,712	| IOT053 |	We'll talk directly
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,016	| IOT053 |	So
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,808	| IOT053 |	That's a plus that is a plus
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,576	| IOT053 |	More lights
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,600	| IOT053 |	More control
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,880	| IOT053 |	Speaking of light
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,160	| IOT053 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:50,464	| IOT053 |	Please tell me if you can talk about this new Switch
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,000	| IOT053 |	I am Because You Loved Me
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:58,656	| IOT053 |	I love the osram tunable white bulbs that I have in the house I have a couple of them they're all connected and
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,680	| IOT053 |	Change from
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:02,240	| IOT053 |	Soft white to warm white tube
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| IOT053 |	Daylight I love my love my love
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,056	| IOT053 |	Banana have a switch
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,616	| IOT053 |	They do so this is the osram
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:10,432	| IOT053 |	Lightify Wireless dimming Smart Switch
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:14,016	| IOT053 |	That's a mouthful
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:18,880	| IOT053 |	Osram lightify switch I guarantee you're going to see this is like a
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,160	| IOT053 |	Fancier light switch
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| IOT053 |	It's about $30
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,744	| IOT053 |	I bought it because
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| IOT053 |	Someone actually told me about it
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,584	| IOT053 |	I was very frustrated by the fact that
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,864	| IOT053 |	My
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,888	| IOT053 |	Light switch
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,912	| IOT053 |	Was always
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| IOT053 |	If it wasn't on a Lutron
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| IOT053 |	Or like a wifi-connected dimmer
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,800	| IOT053 |	People would turn it off
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,336	| IOT053 |	Whatever people turn it off
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,872	| IOT053 |	Get out then my
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,408	| IOT053 |	Connect to light bulbs didn't work
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,432	| IOT053 |	And that was always kind of
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:42,944	| IOT053 |	Frustrating
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,248	| IOT053 |	So
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:48,832	| IOT053 |	I got this thinking I could put it anywhere and it would
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,368	| IOT053 |	The way it looks
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,928	| IOT053 |	It looks like it actually toggles
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:59,072	| IOT053 |	Your switch cuz it comes with different backing plates that you put on top of the existing switch so you don't have to mess around with electricity
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,120	| IOT053 |	Okay that's the other reason I got
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,912	| IOT053 |	That's cuz I know people are kind of worried about that
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:06,752	| IOT053 |	I was like Hey would it be awesome if I could tell them about this connect a light switch that
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,288	| IOT053 |	Still toggles there
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:08,800	| IOT053 |	Switch physically
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,872	| IOT053 |	And keeps track of state which is what I thought it did but it does not do
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:17,248	| IOT053 |	I know it almost looks like so it fits over existing switch
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,016	| IOT053 |	It does
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,856	| IOT053 |	Basically just talks to your existing osram lightify lights
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,904	| IOT053 |	So you press it up and down
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:28,000	| IOT053 |	It doesn't control your physical switch so your physical switch will always stay on
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,816	| IOT053 |	He put it over the switch and then that switch
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,120	| IOT053 |	Now talk to your eyes room lights
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,912	| IOT053 |	And you don't turns off and on
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:36,960	| IOT053 |	It is
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,240	| IOT053 |	Zigbee compatible
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,544	| IOT053 |	I hooked it up to the wink
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:46,944	| IOT053 |	And it didn't quite work the way I thought but I think I need to hook it up as a remote instead of as an actual switch
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,016	| IOT053 |	So I'm still getting this
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,832	| IOT053 |	I'm still trying to find the use case for it cuz I was
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:53,856	| IOT053 |	Again
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,136	| IOT053 |	I thought it would like
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,928	| IOT053 |	Well do something different
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,000	| IOT053 |	So I mean it dims your bulbs
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:03,840	| IOT053 |	Yeah that you can you can already do that through an echo or hug or whatever
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,912	| IOT053 |	But this also gives you the physical option now of giving
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:09,728	| IOT053 |	Write so someone goes and hits that switch
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:13,056	| IOT053 |	They're used to just hit the switch on the wall they're still going to be able to hit the switch on the wall
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:14,592	| IOT053 |	End
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:17,408	| IOT053 |	The nice thing about it is if it pairs to your lights
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,272	| IOT053 |	Your underlying physical switch will always be on
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,320	| IOT053 |	When someone actually touches
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,136	| IOT053 |	The switch which is on top of the physical switch
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:35,072	| IOT053 |	And I would imagine that it didn't give the state of the light bulb
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,888	| IOT053 |	To any apps or any like that as well
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,424	| IOT053 |	Exactly
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:44,544	| IOT053 |	And you don't even have to put this over an existing switch like I see a picture of it on Amazon music. On a nightstand just
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,360	| IOT053 |	So it comes with three different bag
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,432	| IOT053 |	And one is for the
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:52,480	| IOT053 |	Traditional toggle switches with a little
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,760	| IOT053 |	Toggle sticking out of the switch
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:55,808	| IOT053 |	One is for the
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| IOT053 |	Flatter switches
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,904	| IOT053 |	Rockers
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,440	| IOT053 |	Chips or rocker switch
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT053 |	And then the other
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:07,328	| IOT053 |	So many reason were here is a plain back
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,632	| IOT053 |	And I'ma put this on the wrong light
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,656	| IOT053 |	1st and
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,448	| IOT053 |	If it took me like 5 Seconds
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,264	| IOT053 |	Ghetto unscrew the
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:18,592	| IOT053 |	Screws holding my existing light switch plate in place and
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,640	| IOT053 |	Can I screw this guy in and
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,664	| IOT053 |	That was it
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:24,736	| IOT053 |	It's really easy it was easy to pair
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:27,552	| IOT053 |	So if you need something like this
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,832	| IOT053 |	It's 30 bucks
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:31,648	| IOT053 |	It does stick out from the wall my husband told me that I could not leave it up
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,768	| IOT053 |	Yeah it looks like it sticks out a good 1/2 inch or 3/4 of an inch from a
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,280	| IOT053 |	Wall
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:43,680	| IOT053 |	Yeah it's pretty ish it does have it right on the switch
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,960	| IOT053 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,752	| IOT053 |	Sure
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,776	| IOT053 |	Sure but it does
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| IOT053 |	It tells you this
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,592	| IOT053 |	The top is at the bottom
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:54,432	| IOT053 |	Well in the any other thing I like about this I mean
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,992	| IOT053 |	I don't think it's for me because I connect
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:00,832	| IOT053 |	You know your eyebrows are involves going through the way again the echo.and
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,112	| IOT053 |	Stuck at the apps I got the voice
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:07,232	| IOT053 |	Interactional s but my family still isn't into the whole shouting at something to turn lights on
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,280	| IOT053 |	So I could see
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:13,888	| IOT053 |	Them using this is proper some reason why use a phone app or
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:17,472	| IOT053 |	Or doesn't have a voice activation system for these things
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,032	| IOT053 |	Yeah cuz it needs a physical product
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,056	| IOT053 |	Or yes
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:25,152	| IOT053 |	Or it's good for if you have a light switch in An Inconvenient spot
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,968	| IOT053 |	And you can put an osram bulb in
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,552	| IOT053 |	Do you hook up a parrot to this guy
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,832	| IOT053 |	And then boom
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,880	| IOT053 |	You now have a light switch wherever you want it
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:35,904	| IOT053 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:39,488	| IOT053 |	Wireless light switch kit
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:41,024	| IOT053 |	Okay so that's what this is
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,816	| IOT053 |	It does work is easy pair
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| IOT053 |	And
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,864	| IOT053 |	30 bucks is 30 bucks
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,168	| IOT053 |	It's available on
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,192	| IOT053 |	Amazon in
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:53,568	| IOT053 |	Okay so we talked about quite a bit I think that's probably good for us
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,104	| IOT053 |	Before I leave
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,128	| IOT053 |	Please

EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,960	| IOT053 |	And president of Lutron
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,496	| IOT053 |	Hi Michael how are you doing
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,336	| IOT053 |	Hi Stacy I'm doing great how are you
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:34,176	| IOT053 |	I am really excited to have you on the show because I have
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:38,272	| IOT053 |	Probably five or six Lutron switches throughout my house and
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:38,784	| IOT053 |	I love them
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:41,856	| IOT053 |	And I'm kind of very curious to find out
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,904	| IOT053 |	The future of these things that I have
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,696	| IOT053 |	Put in my home so
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,744	| IOT053 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,304	| IOT053 |	What she looks first tell the audience
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,328	| IOT053 |	What Lutron is
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:57,728	| IOT053 |	Thank you Stacey and again thank you for giving us the opportunity to tell her to tell her story on your show
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,544	| IOT053 |	Somatron we have been
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,592	| IOT053 |	55 years in the lighting
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,360	| IOT053 |	Pro-business
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,664	| IOT053 |	Back to Genesis of our company is our founder
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,992	| IOT053 |	Under The Lights dimmer in 1961
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:09,760	| IOT053 |	Products
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:16,416	| IOT053 |	Serve the both commercial and residential markets and Factor about 50% residential and 50% commercial
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:20,000	| IOT053 |	So since you got a pretty long perspective here is a company
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:27,680	| IOT053 |	What has changed in the last let's call it for 5 years with relation to kind of the Smart Home
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:31,008	| IOT053 |	The launch of all these hubs and kind of the snoo
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:32,544	| IOT053 |	Exciting
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:33,568	| IOT053 |	Is it just
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,592	| IOT053 |	Going down Market
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:37,408	| IOT053 |	For the smart home or is there something different happening
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:42,784	| IOT053 |	I think there's significant things and I thought maybe maybe Stacy would be
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:47,136	| IOT053 |	Alfred schedule is just a very very and I'll just take a few minutes if I could
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,672	| IOT053 |	Timeline about Lutron
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,000	| IOT053 |	But I mention 1961 or founder patented
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:57,120	| IOT053 |	And that was an obviously the input that was the start of the company
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,888	| IOT053 |	Important
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:02,240	| IOT053 |	You asked about 5 years ago what's different and really what happened in two
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:04,288	| IOT053 |	7 2008 with a smartphone
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,360	| IOT053 |	Smartphone and everybody's hands today
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,664	| IOT053 |	Now all the sudden gave you the ability
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,224	| IOT053 |	Two notches control items
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,992	| IOT053 |	In your home
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:17,088	| IOT053 |	Your home from outside of your home
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,136	| IOT053 |	And the development of apps
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:23,232	| IOT053 |	With our reliable lighting control technology was just a natural
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:25,024	| IOT053 |	Putting these things together
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,304	| IOT053 |	Such that
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:28,352	| IOT053 |	Again you have the control in your home
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:33,216	| IOT053 |	Or if you want to set scenes or have geofencing or any kind of capabilities of
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:39,360	| IOT053 |	When you're approaching your home have your lights turn on automatically to welcome same so you never enter a dark home
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:43,456	| IOT053 |	That was a natural I think that's been the big change I don't think it's as much
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:49,856	| IOT053 |	Downmarket although we've developed technology for the mass-market the wireless technology
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:54,720	| IOT053 |	It's really been that the smart all-sec smartphones and tablets have made I really made the
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,256	| IOT053 |	Connected home
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:56,768	| IOT053 |	Potential
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:59,328	| IOT053 |	Much more of the mass Market product
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,656	| IOT053 |	Okay and that dope because
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:06,240	| IOT053 |	Agree with you the smartphone is really opened up a lot of things
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,800	| IOT053 |	What I have seen
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,080	| IOT053 |	In the next
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:12,896	| IOT053 |	Will say in the next few years what seems to be coming
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:19,552	| IOT053 |	Technology that works directly with the smartphone
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:21,856	| IOT053 |	There's a Wi-Fi light bulbs out there
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,416	| IOT053 |	Lutron has this amazing
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,976	| IOT053 |	Proprietary radio technology
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,024	| IOT053 |	But I'm very curious
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,328	| IOT053 |	How you see the future
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,400	| IOT053 |	Of kinds of wireless tech and
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:40,288	| IOT053 |	It's supporting that across many platforms and making it kind of interoperable with some of the other Gadgets in the smart
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:45,920	| IOT053 |	I think space you're exactly right we we employ our Wireless Clear connect technology
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,712	| IOT053 |	And it's all about reliability
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:51,040	| IOT053 |	It's all about when the button presses occurred
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,344	| IOT053 |	That you want to turn a light on
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:55,392	| IOT053 |	Not only does it always turn on
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:58,208	| IOT053 |	But it turns on fast we called Liam
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,000	| IOT053 |	But I think
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,280	| IOT053 |	When you look at Bluetooth
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:05,376	| IOT053 |	Where you look at Wi-Fi are you look at other protocols out there and zigbee and Z-Wave
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,936	| IOT053 |	They have a part in this connected home
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,520	| IOT053 |	We'll look at Bluetooth technology and Wi-Fi technology
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,288	| IOT053 |	For the setup
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:15,616	| IOT053 |	And that you're very very simple setup of our Tech
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,920	| IOT053 |	Of our lighting control technology
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:20,480	| IOT053 |	What we have to do is Ensure
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,504	| IOT053 |	To the homeowner
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,272	| IOT053 |	It's not about
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:25,344	| IOT053 |	The technology what is Bluetooth Wi-Fi
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,368	| IOT053 |	Clerk connect
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,416	| IOT053 |	It's about we believe
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:28,928	| IOT053 |	Precinct
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:29,952	| IOT053 |	1
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,768	| IOT053 |	Does it give the homeowner
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,304	| IOT053 |	The effect
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,072	| IOT053 |	That they wanted
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| IOT053 |	Number two
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:43,264	| IOT053 |	How can we even with different Technologies in Bluetooth and BLS much different than Wi-Fi technology
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:47,360	| IOT053 |	Can you put that behind the curtain so the homeowners G
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,128	| IOT053 |	Just plug it in
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,408	| IOT053 |	And it just works
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,712	| IOT053 |	And the third part of that
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,736	| IOT053 |	Is the reliability
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:56,064	| IOT053 |	Will it be reliable over time
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,112	| IOT053 |	We always like to say you don't want to reboot your lighting
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,672	| IOT053 |	But it's true you don't want to
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:05,792	| IOT053 |	Expected
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,608	| IOT053 |	You don't say see one of the things we do is we look at
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,912	| IOT053 |	Okay how how
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:13,728	| IOT053 |	Close can we get to the reliability of a light switch
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:18,592	| IOT053 |	Let's take this a little bit further cuz you guys today are launching
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:21,408	| IOT053 |	An integration with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:25,248	| IOT053 |	Let's talk about kind of the future
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:27,040	| IOT053 |	Lutron in this kind of
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:30,112	| IOT053 |	Interoperable Multi-Device connected home
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:32,160	| IOT053 |	Where do you see
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,208	| IOT053 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,256	| IOT053 |	I think one of the things
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:40,608	| IOT053 |	Currently that what we are talking about with Amazon Echo and what we're launching
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,912	| IOT053 |	As we looked at this and we thought
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,960	| IOT053 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:48,800	| IOT053 |	Really is a very good software platform we've been very pleased with that week
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,616	| IOT053 |	Testing at 4. Of time I know it's getting good response
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:53,152	| IOT053 |	In the marketplace
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,712	| IOT053 |	And we make great software and Hardware
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,784	| IOT053 |	So we thought it was a natural of bringing Amazon Echo
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,856	| IOT053 |	And the Lutron caseta platform together
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:05,184	| IOT053 |	So I think one of the things we bring to this
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,720	| IOT053 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT053 |	Is
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:10,560	| IOT053 |	Making sure things always work
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,376	| IOT053 |	I'm at bringing this back up
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,144	| IOT053 |	Capability
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:15,424	| IOT053 |	Because again
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:21,056	| IOT053 |	If the internet goes down we want you to always be able to control your lights reliably
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,080	| IOT053 |	Okay
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:25,152	| IOT053 |	And let's go platforms because
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,712	| IOT053 |	I think Lutron is now on
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,016	| IOT053 |	Almost all of the big ones so you guys have
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:32,832	| IOT053 |	Your Bridges homekit certified
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,624	| IOT053 |	You've got the web platform
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT053 |	Look at the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,208	| IOT053 |	Do you have anything with the works with Nest program
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:41,024	| IOT053 |	Yes we are part of the works with Nest program
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,584	| IOT053 |	All right so that's a big for it seems like
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| IOT053 |	I don't know if there's another big one for you guys
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:47,680	| IOT053 |	Well we we have worked as
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:52,288	| IOT053 |	We have work this part of there's been announcements with both AT&T Digital Life
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,824	| IOT053 |	And there's also been announced
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,592	| IOT053 |	Since with Comcast
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,408	| IOT053 |	Work work as a part of cell
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,456	| IOT053 |	You know we take
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:05,856	| IOT053 |	You know there are approaches is very simple we believe that we are working and are committed to the
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:07,392	| IOT053 |	Best lighting control in the world
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:13,536	| IOT053 |	And we want to make sure it's seamlessly integrate with all the popular platform Stacy
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:14,816	| IOT053 |	Salt works
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:16,864	| IOT053 |	And have these protocols
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,680	| IOT053 |	That are outside behind the scenes
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:20,960	| IOT053 |	Just work
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:24,032	| IOT053 |	In a fashion that the homeowner doesn't need to worry about
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:27,360	| IOT053 |	When we say Lutron is going to work with a
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,920	| IOT053 |	In that part of the desk
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,968	| IOT053 |	Platformer work was part of homekit
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,760	| IOT053 |	You just connect it
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,272	| IOT053 |	And it works
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,552	| IOT053 |	Head
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:40,160	| IOT053 |	Will do all the hardware and software verification so that that occurs and happens
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,696	| IOT053 |	And
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,744	| IOT053 |	I think that has been our strategy
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:48,352	| IOT053 |	As well as having our own Bridge capability case somebody just wanted to do lights
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,144	| IOT053 |	Shades and temperature
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,960	| IOT053 |	They have that capability also
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,008	| IOT053 |	And among these platforms
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,056	| IOT053 |	Can you talk to me about
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,128	| IOT053 |	The ease of working with them because they're
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,176	| IOT053 |	There different levels there is
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:05,760	| IOT053 |	Works with Nest is very much developer Focus kind of application thing
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:11,648	| IOT053 |	The echo seems to be more in line with that and then there's home kit which requires Hardware
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:13,440	| IOT053 |	I'm just kind of curious
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:17,280	| IOT053 |	As a company that is deciding where to invest their time
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:24,960	| IOT053 |	How are you evaluating this and what would your advice be to other companies who are looking and trying to decide which platform
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,472	| IOT053 |	Sport
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,800	| IOT053 |	So that's an excellent question
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:32,640	| IOT053 |	First of all I think our relationship with all these companies have been very good
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,664	| IOT053 |	And
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:39,552	| IOT053 |	But there's different levels of integration what we did with link is we embedded are clear connect technology
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:43,648	| IOT053 |	And that takes a little more time to do that cuz we work out on
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:44,928	| IOT053 |	Not just
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,952	| IOT053 |	Software
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:50,816	| IOT053 |	For also embedding the radio on the antenna design so that has take that took a little more time
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:53,120	| IOT053 |	What we do with Amazon
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:56,704	| IOT053 |	And we're doing as part of the nest program doing part of homekit
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:59,264	| IOT053 |	It's really cloud to Cloud integration
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:03,104	| IOT053 |	So we were very reliable Cloud platform they have a good Cloud platform
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,664	| IOT053 |	And what we do is work on the software
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,944	| IOT053 |	So these
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:09,248	| IOT053 |	Basically cloud-to-cloud Stampley
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,272	| IOT053 |	We can integrate very
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:10,784	| IOT053 |	Seamlessly
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:13,600	| IOT053 |	That would be a little bit of an easier approach
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:16,928	| IOT053 |	Overall all of these companies have been good to work with
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:20,000	| IOT053 |	Which platform has the most users right now
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,536	| IOT053 |	Or most of your users
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,328	| IOT053 |	I don't know the answer to
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,608	| IOT053 |	To that question.
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,680	| IOT053 |	Who has the most users
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,472	| IOT053 |	I can tell you that are

EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:35,872	| IOT053 |	How to grow
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:40,736	| IOT053 |	Only the caceda version so these are more the

EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,928	| IOT053 |	The mass Market
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:49,696	| IOT053 |	Pico remote
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:55,072	| IOT053 |	Those are the only ones that integrate with all these other connected home platform
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,656	| IOT053 |	No the radio raw and homeworks
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,936	| IOT053 |	We announced it
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,960	| IOT053 |	Acedia last year
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,240	| IOT053 |	Are part of nest
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:08,128	| IOT053 |	They're part of the Honeywell platforms security platforms as well as

EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,712	| IOT053 |	Are those
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:14,016	| IOT053 |	Part of the Maestro line or is there a different line

EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,680	| IOT053 |	You can have thousand
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,448	| IOT053 |	Thousands
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,264	| IOT053 |	Control on that and I'll say very customized

EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,408	| IOT053 |	How about it 50
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,456	| IOT053 |	Okay good to know
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,736	| IOT053 |	Because I am
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,784	| IOT053 |	Huge nerd when it comes to lighting
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,320	| IOT053 |	I I tried pretty much everything
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:53,696	| IOT053 |	What are the big trends you guys see in lighting that your kind of follow along with Ben Hur really
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:54,720	| IOT053 |	Excited
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:39:01,888	| IOT053 |	Well I think one of the things that it's occurred and and and lighting ceremony in the past 3 to 4 years is
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:05,472	| IOT053 |	LED technology-infused if you think of what's going on
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:10,592	| IOT053 |	An LED technology is used the benefit of having a microprocessor and every light bulb
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:14,944	| IOT053 |	It's also added a lot of new people in the marketplace you know in the
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:17,248	| IOT053 |	And add that what I mean by that
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,808	| IOT053 |	Is your company's today light Cree
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:22,624	| IOT053 |	And like
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:25,696	| IOT053 |	Song in and others in the LED Marketplace
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:26,976	| IOT053 |	Which weren't there
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,024	| IOT053 |	R56 years ago
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:35,424	| IOT053 |	But the other thing that that's occurring is obviously with a Micro Control in there you can put radios in light bulbs
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:38,752	| IOT053 |	Special put what radios in lightbulbs you'll have the ability to
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,520	| IOT053 |	Call them directly
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,568	| IOT053 |	Commensurately
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:44,128	| IOT053 |	Did the addition of voice technology
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:46,432	| IOT053 |	What's the Amazon Echo has
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,456	| IOT053 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:49,760	| IOT053 |	And Siri also
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:53,344	| IOT053 |	Send out we work with those for those platforms so that's something that's
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:57,440	| IOT053 |	Changes that are occurring we work very hard to stay on top of that
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:59,744	| IOT053 |	Let's talk about this for a little bit
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:04,352	| IOT053 |	Because I I kind of walked through my house every now and then play a little game with myself about
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,656	| IOT053 |	What's going to be in at 10 years from now
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:09,472	| IOT053 |	And I'm assuming I'm making a lot of assumptions
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:11,520	| IOT053 |	Bear with me
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:12,800	| IOT053 |	But
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:19,456	| IOT053 |	I'm trying out some lights right now that I have motion control the cat temperature controls built into kind of ambient light sensor
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,784	| IOT053 |	In some of my rooms
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:26,624	| IOT053 |	In the hallways and small rooms especially like closets and bath
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,392	| IOT053 |	X
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,696	| IOT053 |	It's perfect I never touch a light switch
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,464	| IOT053 |	Like
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,488	| IOT053 |	It's it's awesome
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:35,072	| IOT053 |	What happened to
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:37,376	| IOT053 |	I'll use Sonos again cuz it's a good anime
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,144	| IOT053 |	Creed eyes perhaps
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:39,936	| IOT053 |	Crate Tech
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:40,960	| IOT053 |	Work super well
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:41,984	| IOT053 |	But
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,800	| IOT053 |	Ask the internet of things kind of happens
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:48,640	| IOT053 |	It's a very real question about how that will disrupt like
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,920	| IOT053 |	Your business model so
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,968	| IOT053 |	I might not need my light switches
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:57,088	| IOT053 |	Well I think it's something you know I've been asked many times Stacy
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:57,856	| IOT053 |	Talk about disrupt
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:01,184	| IOT053 |	Disruption actually can be a good thing
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:05,792	| IOT053 |	Spinning around a little bit and don't think about the disruption but look at the opportunity
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:08,096	| IOT053 |	So what's the opportunity
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,376	| IOT053 |	And and
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:12,192	| IOT053 |	Connected light bulbs that have sensing capability
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:15,008	| IOT053 |	We believe there still a need
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,800	| IOT053 |	2 in the event
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,592	| IOT053 |	From sensing standpoint
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:23,200	| IOT053 |	You're still going to need the ability if you're standing still and things like that should be able to
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:31,392	| IOT053 |	And and we think they're still opportunities for us to be able to connect to these light bulbs and ways and
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,672	| IOT053 |	Offers Superior
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,440	| IOT053 |	User
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:33,952	| IOT053 |	Experience
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:38,304	| IOT053 |	In a closet application again we could see
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:39,840	| IOT053 |	Interfacing with those
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:40,864	| IOT053 |	Type of applications
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:46,240	| IOT053 |	So maybe you would want to be able to control the lights even before you enter the space
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,032	| IOT053 |	And
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,080	| IOT053 |	You could be able to control them
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:51,616	| IOT053 |	Maybe by sensors
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,895	| IOT053 |	You ever you approaching
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:53,919	| IOT053 |	Particular
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:57,247	| IOT053 |	I can tell you that happens in my hallway today
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:59,807	| IOT053 |	With our wireless sensor technology
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,599	| IOT053 |	When I get into the hallway
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,391	| IOT053 |	Before I get into the closet
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,671	| IOT053 |	My lights in my closet
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,463	| IOT053 |	Come on to
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:10,303	| IOT053 |	40 to 50% and then when I get into the closet my lights come on
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,839	| IOT053 |	To 90%
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,911	| IOT053 |	And again there's anticipation
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:21,311	| IOT053 |	And I think one of the things we remain to be is a very very good very reliable hardware and software
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:22,847	| IOT053 |	Technology company
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:27,711	| IOT053 |	Are you guys going to be adding it sounded like you were going to be adding some sort of
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:34,623	| IOT053 |	When you talked about anticipation which I think would be
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:37,183	| IOT053 |	Kind of cool because the less I have to program
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,207	| IOT053 |	The better
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:42,559	| IOT053 |	I'm really not at Liberty Stacy to talk about future developments but
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:43,327	| IOT053 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:46,399	| IOT053 |	I have to ask because I'm kind of curious if you get this.
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:49,727	| IOT053 |	Everytime I actually was a crazy chain
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:53,823	| IOT053 |	I use the Amazon Echo to turn off my dining room light switch
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:56,895	| IOT053 |	Stuck on a Lutron switch
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| IOT053 |	It's the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:42:59,455	| IOT053 |	To wink
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:00,735	| IOT053 |	To Lutron
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:03,295	| IOT053 |	Do you guys get to see that data
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:08,159	| IOT053 |	It's going to it's going through so many places so I'm curious
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:11,999	| IOT053 |	The day that we would see as we know the
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:16,351	| IOT053 |	Product is being hooked up we don't know the specifics of that
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,143	| IOT053 |	On how it is
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:21,983	| IOT053 |	Working in and we don't know the specifics in terms of users
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:25,567	| IOT053 |	And how the users are using the product that's
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:27,103	| IOT053 |	Obviously information and
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:29,407	| IOT053 |	That we would not interfere
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:31,199	| IOT053 |	4 or 1/2
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:36,575	| IOT053 |	The intruding in people's lives but I think one of the things we do is we'll hook up
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:40,159	| IOT053 |	The Amazon Echo in our technology and we'll look how people are used
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:42,719	| IOT053 |	Dance day in and day out
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:45,279	| IOT053 |	And then final advice
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,327	| IOT053 |	I would love to pick your brain since you are
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,119	| IOT053 |	Become CEO of a lighting
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,191	| IOT053 |	Give us some advice on
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,215	| IOT053 |	Lighting settings
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:54,495	| IOT053 |	Because as people are
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:58,335	| IOT053 |	Transitioning to LEDs that have this level of customization
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:00,639	| IOT053 |	Let's just run through some basic
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,199	| IOT053 |	Scenarios
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,991	| IOT053 |	Give them to you and then you tell me you kind of
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:07,807	| IOT053 |	Where should my lighting be maybe it's a temperature may be a
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,087	| IOT053 |	Adapt
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,879	| IOT053 |	Are you ready for this do you think
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:11,647	| IOT053 |	Do this
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:14,207	| IOT053 |	I can try for my experience
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:16,767	| IOT053 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,303	| IOT053 |	Movie night
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:20,863	| IOT053 |	Individual setting could be anywhere between
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:23,167	| IOT053 |	Anywhere between camdude
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:26,239	| IOT053 |	30% depending on how much light to give available in your room
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,007	| IOT053 |	Dinner party lighting
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:29,311	| IOT053 |	I think it's dinner party lighting
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,591	| IOT053 |	Is candle lighting
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:31,615	| IOT053 |	Cuz the best
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:38,527	| IOT053 |	Adelaide in the best lighting is somewhere in the neighborhood again as I'll say any to 10 to 24
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:39,551	| IOT053 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,087	| IOT053 |	Good morning
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:45,951	| IOT053 |	I think probably one of the greatest things about good morning is having a nice warm light
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:50,815	| IOT053 |	Probably would let somewhere it's between 30 to 50% and the shades
