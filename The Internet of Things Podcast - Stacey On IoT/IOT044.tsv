EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:13,312	| IOT044 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,824	00:00:14,592	| IOT044 |	And this is my
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,360	| IOT044 |	My co-host
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,384	| IOT044 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:19,200	| IOT044 |	And we are here to talk about
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:20,224	| IOT044 |	That's awesome things
EDL	00:00:20,736	00:00:22,016	| IOT044 |	And moonshine
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:25,856	| IOT044 |	Let's get started with the news that Oral Roberts
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:30,464	| IOT044 |	I don't know how to stay religious University the
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:33,536	| IOT044 |	That's kind of what it is
EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:35,584	| IOT044 |	That's what it world
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:39,168	| IOT044 |	So this university has is putting
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:40,960	| IOT044 |	Mandatory fitbit's on its students
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:47,872	| IOT044 |	Which a lot of people like crazy but it's important to note that students actually before they were
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:49,664	| IOT044 |	Stuck with mandatory fitbit's
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:51,712	| IOT044 |	To track people's Motion in health
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:52,224	| IOT044 |	Fitness
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:54,272	| IOT044 |	They actually had it
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:56,064	| IOT044 |	Fitness and activities
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,088	| IOT044 |	Beforehand
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,112	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,136	| IOT044 |	This is
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,416	| IOT044 |	Yes
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,976	| IOT044 |	A technological upgrade but it is not
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,256	| IOT044 |	Like
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:07,072	| IOT044 |	Like totally crazy so
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:08,864	| IOT044 |	I think it's a little crazy what do you think Kevin
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:15,776	| IOT044 |	Oh I don't know I'm in there fighting the Freshman 15 that's often so happens in my son will be a freshman this fall at his university
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:17,312	| IOT044 |	It'll be curious to see what happens there
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:20,640	| IOT044 |	Again late like you said they've been requiring students to
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:21,664	| IOT044 |	Kind of monitor
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:24,480	| IOT044 |	Aerobic activity and such manually
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:29,344	| IOT044 |	This kind of adds more data to the to the process and makes it simpler I'm in
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,624	| IOT044 |	If you're wearing Fitbit
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,904	| IOT044 |	Got your Fitbit account
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:35,232	| IOT044 |	You know you don't have to to manually do really anything which is kind of nice
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:38,048	| IOT044 |	I don't have the students feel about having the
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:40,608	| IOT044 |	School have access to that data
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:42,400	| IOT044 |	You know overall I think it's a good thing
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,704	| IOT044 |	It's a lot of data
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:45,472	| IOT044 |	You shouldn't have to log
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:48,032	| IOT044 |	Well I don't know if you had to log your sleep data
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,616	| IOT044 |	I'm just thinking about all the data that my Fitbit
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,200	| IOT044 |	Not sure which fitbit's there
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:56,480	| IOT044 |	Getting exactly
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:57,760	| IOT044 |	You know some of them
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,808	| IOT044 |	Log more data than others
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:05,696	| IOT044 |	And there's the one they're using doesn't have GPS so it's not like the school can actually see where everybody is or isn't
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,000	| IOT044 |	Which is a plus I think
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,768	| IOT044 |	That is a plus
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:12,608	| IOT044 |	Now you can see what people are psychoactive
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,680	| IOT044 |	One of the quotes in the article in the guardian was
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:18,752	| IOT044 |	When they're on spring break in Africa or South Africa
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,520	| IOT044 |	Weekend
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,568	| IOT044 |	You don't see how active they are in like
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,664	| IOT044 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:28,992	| IOT044 |	I like the intent here and there trying to do something
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,784	| IOT044 |	Positive
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,832	| IOT044 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,880	| IOT044 |	And it says it is an issue
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,696	| IOT044 |	The real issue that they're trying to resolve them it's pretty
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:41,792	| IOT044 |	I would say you know everybody goes to college and games away but it's it's a common
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,584	| IOT044 |	The common challenge so
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,144	| IOT044 |	You know I kind of think it should be
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,168	| IOT044 |	An opt-in
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| IOT044 |	Saying
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT044 |	But
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:51,008	| IOT044 |	There are technically I think requiring this
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:51,520	| IOT044 |	They are
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,616	| IOT044 |	Let's let's twist it a little bit
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,896	| IOT044 |	What if you're in
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,408	| IOT044 |	Lawyer
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,688	| IOT044 |	Had you often
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,736	| IOT044 |	You know
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,272	| IOT044 |	Nothing Forest
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,088	| IOT044 |	I'm pretty much okay with
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,392	| IOT044 |	Any opt-in solution
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:11,744	| IOT044 |	Quite honestly you know as long as I've got control and I make that choice so
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,304	| IOT044 |	I'm going to say person I don't have a problem with that
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,584	| IOT044 |	No
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,632	| IOT044 |	What if your health insurance starts doing this
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,192	| IOT044 |	If
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:23,776	| IOT044 |	Himmler
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:29,664	| IOT044 |	Yeah and I think you know whether you agree with it or not I think that's kind of where we're heading
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,968	| IOT044 |	I don't think it's very far-fetched to think that in
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,016	| IOT044 |	Five years or less
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,040	| IOT044 |	You know that's the
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,832	| IOT044 |	More common than it is today
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:42,464	| IOT044 |	You know I'm in it it's helping the business the insurance company better managed healthcare and
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,768	| IOT044 |	And subscribers so I know
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:49,888	| IOT044 |	I don't know if it's to the point where it's almost like the whole privacy thing when they kicked up ears
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,168	| IOT044 |	I got one still going on
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| IOT044 |	At some point
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:55,264	| IOT044 |	You know what if we have to give if we want to get something in return
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,056	| IOT044 |	Now I will
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,592	| IOT044 |	I would be in
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,128	| IOT044 |	You know there's a
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:04,992	| IOT044 |	All the lawsuits there's I think a class action lawsuit right now against Fitbit for accuracy
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:05,760	| IOT044 |	Are there
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,040	| IOT044 |	Heart rate monitor
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,576	| IOT044 |	I believe it is the heart rate monitor
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,344	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,136	| IOT044 |	I am kind of intrigued by the idea of
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,696	| IOT044 |	Man once someone sues over this then
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,232	| IOT044 |	Do we get the lawsuits
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,024	| IOT044 |	You know well
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,327	| IOT044 |	How accurate is this anyway do we have
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:19,839	| IOT044 |	Federal settings
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,679	| IOT044 |	Which I actually think is an interesting kind of question because
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:29,823	| IOT044 |	There's even some doubt about the 10000 steps is that a really great gator health
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:35,711	| IOT044 |	I will be the first to argue you know that maybe it's not the best gauge maybe because I only
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:37,759	| IOT044 |	Achieve like 6000 steps a day
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,295	| IOT044 |	WeChat
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,087	| IOT044 |	I just admit that
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,879	| IOT044 |	Everyone who listens to the show
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,927	| IOT044 |	6000 steps a day
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,743	| IOT044 |	You don't my resting heart rate still at like
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,791	| IOT044 |	Channel 52
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,303	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,095	| IOT044 |	Okay
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:59,263	| IOT044 |	Yeah I mean you and I are mostly work-from-home people so it's not like we're walking to catch a bus or walking around
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,031	| IOT044 |	City that much
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,799	| IOT044 |	Turn the work today
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,639	| IOT044 |	I still like the idea of having that goal in the end
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:08,479	| IOT044 |	The apps and devices I'm using these days you let me set that goal I don't have to
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:12,575	| IOT044 |	Make it a default 10,000 or live with that I've actually got mindset to 8000
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:17,951	| IOT044 |	It's a guideline and I think it's good to have because it it gamify something so that way you can
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,231	| IOT044 |	You know
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,767	| IOT044 |	They have something to shoot for during the day.
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,399	| IOT044 |	That's true maybe we should be partners Kevin we just had our steps together
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,519	| IOT044 |	I would be embarrassed cuz some days I barely even
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:40,479	| IOT044 |	I'm pretty good now I've been running everyday since the beginning of the year so rough about its
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,271	| IOT044 |	It's almost 2000 steps for every mile
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,855	| IOT044 |	And most days I don't even have to go walk around which is good
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:50,463	| IOT044 |	OKC and I even take like yoga or Barre classes and I'm
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:50,975	| IOT044 |	I'm still not itchy
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:57,119	| IOT044 |	That's not true it's a different type of thing you're not achieving steps
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,703	| IOT044 |	But the steps is not the end-all be-all again it's a guideline away
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| IOT044 |	A simple wave
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,263	| IOT044 |	Everybody can
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,567	| IOT044 |	Get a little healthier at least be more Health aware that's all
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,871	| IOT044 |	So Oral Roberts may or may not
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| IOT044 |	Be pleased with us
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,687	| IOT044 |	Our insurance
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,551	| IOT044 |	So we hang on
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:19,135	| IOT044 |	Aren't there some insurance firms already doing this like made with an automatic or
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,183	| IOT044 |	Or someone will give you a reduced rate
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| IOT044 |	Automatically
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:27,839	| IOT044 |	Exactly
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,631	| IOT044 |	I wasn't thinking about it
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| IOT044 |	It just rolls right off of the time
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,751	| IOT044 |	I would have to double-check
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:37,311	| IOT044 |	What if someone is so USAA
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:40,127	| IOT044 |	Infested and automatic and is researching using
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:44,991	| IOT044 |	I do not know if they actually have a program in place yet for ottoman
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:50,111	| IOT044 |	I was thinking actually of progressive I'm pretty sure they have something that you can plug in and
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,135	| IOT044 |	What's my next one
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,671	| IOT044 |	The progressive
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,463	| IOT044 |	It's on black box
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:54,975	| IOT044 |	State it is
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,535	| IOT044 |	A 6-month program though
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,327	| IOT044 |	It is not a program that
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| IOT044 |	Continuously running
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,935	| IOT044 |	And it's not then it is an option
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,703	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:06,495	| IOT044 |	You share your data with them for 6
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,287	| IOT044 |	The driving dead
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,591	| IOT044 |	So yes
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:14,175	| IOT044 |	I probably would do it
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,199	| IOT044 |	I believe
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,271	| IOT044 |	Are going to be some kind of
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,807	| IOT044 |	New stuff this year so
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,391	| IOT044 |	State Farm is looking at this USAA
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:26,975	| IOT044 |	Is also looking at this and so is American family
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,999	| IOT044 |	Which has
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,071	| IOT044 |	Have some interesting kind of investments in the space
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:37,727	| IOT044 |	This year should be the year that insurance starts getting kind of crazy Innovative with some of the stuff
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT044 |	Look for it
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,543	| IOT044 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,103	| IOT044 |	Let's move on to
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,383	| IOT044 |	This week's news
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,431	| IOT044 |	Which was actually kind of big
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,455	| IOT044 |	On Monday
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| IOT044 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:48,991	| IOT044 |	Reported earnings
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,063	| IOT044 |	For the first time that broke out all of the little bit
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,855	| IOT044 |	The alphabets in a little bit
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,391	| IOT044 |	Cleverly called it
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,159	| IOT044 |	Show the other bats
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,183	| IOT044 |	The other guys
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| IOT044 |	And Google reported
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,255	| IOT044 |	75
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT044 |	With a B
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,143	| IOT044 |	Revenue that's Olive
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,655	| IOT044 |	Google
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,679	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| IOT044 |	That's 23-point
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT044 |	4
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| IOT044 |	23 points
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,823	| IOT044 |	Ford
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,359	| IOT044 |	I was deciding how far I wanted to round
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,175	| IOT044 |	23.4 billion
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,479	| IOT044 |	Again with the b in operating in
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,319	| IOT044 |	For the year so that's for all the 2015
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,855	| IOT044 |	That's a lot of money
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| IOT044 |	Mostly an ad Revenue
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,439	| IOT044 |	Little better that's probably from the cloud
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| IOT044 |	Segment
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| IOT044 |	And then the other bets
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| IOT044 |	Include things like
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,303	| IOT044 |	Nest
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,583	| IOT044 |	Project access
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:36,863	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,911	| IOT044 |	Those are probably the ones that are made
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,447	| IOT044 |	Money
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,983	| IOT044 |	Made for deer
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,799	| IOT044 |	448 million
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,359	| IOT044 |	And they had an operating loss of
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| IOT044 |	3 point
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| IOT044 |	6 billion
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| IOT044 |	With me
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| IOT044 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,735	| IOT044 |	It's a big loss
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| IOT044 |	But
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,551	| IOT044 |	The money that it made
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,367	| IOT044 |	That's coming from things like nest
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,647	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| IOT044 |	Viber
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,999	| IOT044 |	It's kind of disappointing because I was hoping to see Nest make
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,023	| IOT044 |	A lot more
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,047	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:12,447	| IOT044 |	Recode actually had a story back in November where they expected Nest annual sales to be 450 million
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:17,823	| IOT044 |	Yeah this is just under that if it 448 million for all of the other Revenue
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,615	| IOT044 |	Yeah and we were I mean
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,407	| IOT044 |	Google actually making money
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| IOT044 |	Fiber in
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,735	| IOT044 |	A couple of like three or four cities now
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,551	| IOT044 |	Provo Kansas City Austin
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,599	| IOT044 |	Where they have actual customers
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,439	| IOT044 |	So granted they probably don't have a lot of customers
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,487	| IOT044 |	But they're making money on those guys to
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:36,511	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| IOT044 |	The nuts and bolts of it
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:42,143	| IOT044 |	When I saw this number was maybe the nest business isn't as big as we thought it was
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| IOT044 |	I don't know that that means
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,591	| IOT044 |	Shouldn't have spent the was at 3 billion dollars
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| IOT044 |	Sunrise
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,127	| IOT044 |	Amnesty
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,663	| IOT044 |	3.2
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| IOT044 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,783	| IOT044 |	I meant okay I mean that's that's a big figure I'm in the end
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| IOT044 |	Eli getting back 10%
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT044 |	This particular year
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:08,511	| IOT044 |	At best because they're ugly said there are other things that Google can make money on in the other bets category or segment again
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:11,071	| IOT044 |	But I think it's a long-term investment
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,119	| IOT044 |	Wasn't just the hardware it was
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,935	| IOT044 |	Just the technology and so on so I
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:19,007	| IOT044 |	What the remains to be seen that how Nest expenses business
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,543	| IOT044 |	Cuz right now they're really what
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| IOT044 |	Just a couple products
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,591	| IOT044 |	There's Nest cam
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,639	| IOT044 |	Protect and then there
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| IOT044 |	Sprite
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,199	| IOT044 |	Alright so
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:32,319	| IOT044 |	Nest eventually be the smart home brand for all of Google products
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,623	| IOT044 |	Ways to say I don't know yet
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| IOT044 |	Swelling
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:38,463	| IOT044 |	The other thing to think about is Nest as a proxy for the home
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:38,975	| IOT044 |	The smartphone
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,511	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,863	| IOT044 |	Coming away from all this I I was kind of struck by that number because
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,399	| IOT044 |	WeMo
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,679	| IOT044 |	Has admitted that
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| IOT044 |	Has admittedly
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,215	| IOT044 |	This is something to be ashamed
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,751	| IOT044 |	But they have
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,519	| IOT044 |	One point
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT044 |	5 million
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| IOT044 |	Yeah we met
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,103	| IOT044 |	Chamillionaire
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:00,991	| IOT044 |	That's looking at this number
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,015	| IOT044 |	Furness
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,575	| IOT044 |	But maybe a million user
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,391	| IOT044 |	Assuming all of that revenue is for nest
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,183	| IOT044 |	Max of 2
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:15,327	| IOT044 |	United States around 1.25 Ash maybe 1.5 the same as we do it best
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,631	| IOT044 |	Yeah assuming all
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,143	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,471	| IOT044 |	That's most people who have one Nest product
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,751	| IOT044 |	Usually
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:26,847	| IOT044 |	I'm going to guess have another one I mean I'm just thinking if you have a nest protect
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,615	| IOT044 |	She probably have
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,943	| IOT044 |	Most likely
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,223	| IOT044 |	The people I know with an s
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,247	| IOT044 |	Respirtech usually have
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,271	| IOT044 |	Multiple Nest protects
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| IOT044 |	Sprint
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,879	| IOT044 |	So that's an interesting time now
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,415	| IOT044 |	I will say
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,719	| IOT044 |	Last year in
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:49,119	| IOT044 |	Early late in the fall kind of timeframe last year is when Nest started announcing Partnerships with ATT with American
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,679	| IOT044 |	Family with a lot of like the insurance and security forms
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,215	| IOT044 |	Was like hey
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,239	| IOT044 |	You sign up for
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:58,079	| IOT044 |	If you sign up for like ATT service or
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,359	| IOT044 |	Do you want to get like
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,407	| IOT044 |	An insurance discount
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| IOT044 |	What give you
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,967	| IOT044 |	Nest protect
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,807	| IOT044 |	Discount so
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,319	| IOT044 |	That's
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:14,719	| IOT044 |	It's going to take time for that to kick in
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,487	| IOT044 |	1 state right now
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,559	| IOT044 |	That'll be really interest
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,655	| IOT044 |	Yeah we might get a better idea on that in the next
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,215	| IOT044 |	1 or to Coeur d'Alene
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,775	| IOT044 |	Reports now that we're getting is Breakout by segment
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:31,359	| IOT044 |	So and it'll be worthwhile to see
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,663	| IOT044 |	I mean it'll be nice to see some more
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:36,735	| IOT044 |	Segmentation possibly on fiber
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,039	| IOT044 |	As the FCC starts releasing more
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,135	| IOT044 |	We might be able to get more interested more information there too
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:45,439	| IOT044 |	On how how fiber penetration is going
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:52,351	| IOT044 |	Yeah I don't know because I mean when I had heard that they were in a reorganizing to alphabet never going to report by side
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,375	| IOT044 |	Simonson's salon
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:57,215	| IOT044 |	I figured we'd see bits from each company here but really
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,775	| IOT044 |	All the non cortical Google companies
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,591	| IOT044 |	Under alphabet where Lumpkin child are bats in
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,871	| IOT044 |	And I listen to the car
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:08,479	| IOT044 |	Call Annette some in other bets include their efforts on
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,295	| IOT044 |	The smart contact lenses with verily
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,343	| IOT044 |	But we're not seeing all that broken out
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:15,391	| IOT044 |	We are a step closer to the big picture but
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,183	| IOT044 |	Not that much closer
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:18,207	| IOT044 |	I wouldn't expect
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,279	| IOT044 |	I mean all of these
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| IOT044 |	So young
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:27,167	| IOT044 |	If you're a startup trying to do anything you don't want to be all transparent with
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,959	| IOT044 |	What are bats and efforts
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,007	| IOT044 |	Cuz then other people will like
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,287	| IOT044 |	Do with that data
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,079	| IOT044 |	Yeah that's good point that's good point
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,103	| IOT044 |	This way there
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,087	| IOT044 |	Now if you're like a smart home company if you're like
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,623	| IOT044 |	Ecobee or Honeywell you're like
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,695	| IOT044 |	Wechat data
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,487	| IOT044 |	It's not great day. But
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,767	| IOT044 |	It's a little bit more clear
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:55,327	| IOT044 |	And now maybe you feel better or make me feel worse I don't know
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,631	| IOT044 |	By The Way We Were
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| IOT044 |	Looking for the
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:03,263	| IOT044 |	Quarterly revenue for Google in the other bets just before the show here and
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,031	| IOT044 |	I just found it
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| IOT044 |	They're a bunch of tables on the bottom of the press release so
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:11,455	| IOT044 |	If you're curious the other bets for the holiday. Which I would think would be good for
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,479	| IOT044 |	Sacred nest
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,783	| IOT044 |	Was 151 million in revenues
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,855	| IOT044 |	Prior quarter was 142
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:21,439	| IOT044 |	Then summertime 75 last March 80
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,719	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:26,815	| IOT044 |	10 holiday 2014 was 106 million * 151
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| IOT044 |	Million for 706
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,887	| IOT044 |	Year-over-year
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,423	| IOT044 |	Brother bets
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT044 |	Oh so it went down
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,007	| IOT044 |	You know I went out from 106
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,519	| IOT044 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:39,615	| IOT044 |	06 December 31st 2014
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:42,943	| IOT044 |	To 100 to 1 million December 31st 2015
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,711	| IOT044 |	Misspell that advertise
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,295	| IOT044 |	All the fancy psychedelic Nest as I saw everywhere
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| IOT044 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,647	| IOT044 |	Well let's move on from moonshots to something for the
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:55,231	| IOT044 |	Tinkers at we got two things for the Tinkers actually
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,743	| IOT044 |	Bring it
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,279	| IOT044 |	1 is
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,815	| IOT044 |	How to build your own
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,095	| IOT044 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,375	| IOT044 |	Kevin
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,447	| IOT044 |	This is interesting it's an echo clone
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:07,775	| IOT044 |	But it doesn't use and it surprised me when I saw that the details of it
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,055	| IOT044 |	It doesn't use
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:11,871	| IOT044 |	Amazon support services that Google services
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,919	| IOT044 |	What I thought it would but it doesn't it
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,479	| IOT044 |	It's actually using IBM Watson
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,783	| IOT044 |	And the Intel Edison board
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,855	| IOT044 |	Getting Watson for the speech-to-text that's kind of interesting
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,391	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| IOT044 |	So if you if you don't trust
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,207	| IOT044 |	Amazon
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,719	| IOT044 |	For some reason
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:34,655	| IOT044 |	That's your choice but you'll need an Arduino
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,447	| IOT044 |	Expansion board for the Intel Edison
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:40,031	| IOT044 |	USB micro Bluetooth speaker Keno odds and ends
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,311	| IOT044 |	I have plenty of the my closet
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,127	| IOT044 |	And then a working knowledge of node. Js
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| IOT044 |	Nodejs
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:55,903	| IOT044 |	Codes actually in this and then I'm assuming we're going to Lincoln the show nuts all the code is is here on GitHub and in the
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,927	| IOT044 |	Blog post
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:03,071	| IOT044 |	Showing you how to make it work I mean like here's how it how it tried ties into DuckDuckGo is instant answer API
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,351	| IOT044 |	4 searches for example women
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,399	| IOT044 |	It if you're into coding at all
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,703	| IOT044 |	It's kind of interesting just to look at I think
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,007	| IOT044 |	Yeah and it's not $180
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,543	| IOT044 |	If you bought all these parts
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:13,567	| IOT044 |	You're probably looking at
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,103	| IOT044 |	I don't know what the
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,431	| IOT044 |	Expansion board in the
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,479	| IOT044 |	An Intel Edison Hardware goes for
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,783	| IOT044 |	I would think most people have a USB mic
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:26,111	| IOT044 |	Probably a bazooka Bluetooth speaker that they could use
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,415	| IOT044 |	I was following the links and I thought it would be like
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,951	| IOT044 |	Oh here's where you can buy it
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,487	| IOT044 |	But it it's just that
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,791	| IOT044 |	System architecture
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,327	| IOT044 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| IOT044 |	Corazon
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT044 |	All right
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,959	| IOT044 |	So I'm going to put the links in the show notes cuz
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,775	| IOT044 |	You know I know there enough of you guys out there who are like
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,335	| IOT044 |	Crazy enough to want to do this so you do build this
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,615	| IOT044 |	Let us know how it went
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:54,015	| IOT044 |	Because I would love it so info at iot podcast. Cam is where you would tell me or send me an email to tell me
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,039	| IOT044 |	Funny how this goes
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:57,599	| IOT044 |	Before we talk about our next kind of developer Orient
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,927	| IOT044 |	Two thing actually don't let's talk about that first and then we'll get to our last
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,695	| IOT044 |	Segment
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,207	| IOT044 |	Sure
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,303	| IOT044 |	I don't know if any of our listeners or you Stacy
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,631	| IOT044 |	Back this Kickstarter project but I did it
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,679	| IOT044 |	It's for the pine a64
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| IOT044 |	Oh I remember reading about
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,495	| IOT044 |	I did not back
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,031	| IOT044 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:21,151	| IOT044 |	I couldn't not back it was $15 that I think I upgraded to the $19
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,175	| IOT044 |	A 64
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,199	| IOT044 |	Plus board
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:27,807	| IOT044 |	It's similar to a Raspberry Pi it's got a cortex a53 chip
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:33,439	| IOT044 |	Valley 400 GPU and I got the one with extra memory so I think I got a gig of RAM on it
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:39,071	| IOT044 |	And it's got 4K HDMI output so it's like a nice little TV computer let's see. Let's do that
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,887	| IOT044 |	I don't have it yet they haven't started sending them but it's
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,655	| IOT044 |	You know
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,215	| IOT044 |	Hey I could always use another 3 by 5 in
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| IOT044 |	Computer mouse so why not
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:49,055	| IOT044 |	But I just found out last week
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,871	| IOT044 |	And I did not know this when I ordered it but now I'm really glad I ordered it
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,919	| IOT044 |	That they are going to have
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,711	| IOT044 |	Modules that will
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:18:02,111	| IOT044 |	Fit in with this and I'm looking to the models right now aside from the USB serial programmer module
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,391	| IOT044 |	Also
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,695	| IOT044 |	An ambient light sensor you can get
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,743	| IOT044 |	A humidity sensor
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,535	| IOT044 |	Actually see me the end temperature
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,071	| IOT044 |	A Z-Wave module
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,375	| IOT044 |	A Wi-Fi remote module so there's
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:19,775	| IOT044 |	There's some iot stuff here we can do with this fruit with this little 15 $20 Gizmo excited now
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,823	| IOT044 |	No I'm noticing that the
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,359	| IOT044 |	The net working on this though is
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| IOT044 |	Or
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,919	| IOT044 |	100
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| IOT044 |	This is on ethernet
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:27,967	| IOT044 |	As opposed to what
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:34,623	| IOT044 |	Correctly there is a Wi-Fi module that you can get and they're also experimenting with power over ethernet not working
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,903	| IOT044 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,719	| IOT044 |	A lot of different options
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,279	| IOT044 |	Originally was just going to be this little computer and
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,559	| IOT044 |	Run Android on it
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:46,399	| IOT044 |	Zumpano's Linux and all that but it seems like they've expanded it
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,935	| IOT044 |	Far beyond that now
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,983	| IOT044 |	But the gpus you could use it
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,775	| IOT044 |	Media player gaming platform
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,311	| IOT044 |	Farm to absolutely
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:56,639	| IOT044 |	Absolutely anything for you know 20 bucks or less
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:00,223	| IOT044 |	When you confront so for people who like
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:03,039	| IOT044 |	Are into this sort of thing you could run open wrt
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| IOT044 |	Hey hey
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:08,671	| IOT044 |	If you want to be a writer for you or you could run openhab which is
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,463	| IOT044 |	Open Smart Home
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,231	| IOT044 |	Kind of platform
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| IOT044 |	People come on the show
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,327	| IOT044 |	For a while
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,607	| IOT044 |	So one day
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:17,887	| IOT044 |	One day it's going to happen
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| IOT044 |	So that's
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT044 |	Worth noting
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:23,263	| IOT044 |	As I'm scrolling down and learning all about this
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:26,079	| IOT044 |	I'm so okay well cool as you get the
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,639	| IOT044 |	Let us know what do you plan on doing with it
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:35,551	| IOT044 |	Are you I was just going to make a little Linux machine and do some media and whatnot but now that these modules are going to be
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:37,599	| IOT044 |	I don't have the pricing at they've announced it
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:40,415	| IOT044 |	Now I'm thinking you know what else can I do from smartphone perspective
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:46,815	| IOT044 |	Not that smell every good to get them on the show and talk about
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,327	| IOT044 |	So yeah
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,351	| IOT044 |	Maybe I'll make you
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,143	| IOT044 |	Hahaha
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,727	| IOT044 |	Look at that snout
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,799	| IOT044 |	Didn't have this before the $59 I owe TPAC
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,103	| IOT044 |	Includes the
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,943	| IOT044 |	Little computer 8 gig micro SD card with openhab on it
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:07,551	| IOT044 |	Power supply enclosure Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi module
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,599	| IOT044 |	And Z-Wave plus aniyo car
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,135	| IOT044 |	39 bucks
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,671	| IOT044 |	Wow
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,463	| IOT044 |	Womp womp
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| IOT044 |	That's so sad Trump
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,279	| IOT044 |	Yeah that's a sad trombone
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| IOT044 |	There we go
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:24,191	| IOT044 |	Alright Movin right along we got a comment from listener
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:27,519	| IOT044 |	Last week that's worth sharing this is from Nick
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,567	| IOT044 |	Last week we talked about
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,615	| IOT044 |	What do we talk about we had Scott Jensen on the show
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:35,199	| IOT044 |	Google and he talked about
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:39,551	| IOT044 |	Moving our smart devices with us and he gave his home an email account
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:40,831	| IOT044 |	Because
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,111	| IOT044 |	He was like
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:46,207	| IOT044 |	How about making his light switches smart he was using NC on light switches
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT044 |	And he was like I don't want it
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:51,583	| IOT044 |	Associated with me I wanted associated with the house so he gave us house a Gmail account
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:54,143	| IOT044 |	Except he's kind of hurt by it
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,703	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:21:00,543	| IOT044 |	He didn't like his idea he he wants a better identity kind of issues this is
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,591	| IOT044 |	Flash
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,383	| IOT044 |	Things that he will make better possibly
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,407	| IOT044 |	In his life
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,223	| IOT044 |	Nick Roden and was like
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:12,831	| IOT044 |	Scott mentioned that you wouldn't take her smart devices with you when you move much like he wouldn't take your dishwasher
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:18,976	| IOT044 |	I don't take my dishwasher because I expect my new house to have a dishwasher left behind by the other owners
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| IOT044 |	The same goes with a stove
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:24,608	| IOT044 |	The refrigerator's on the other hand people usually do take those with them when they move
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:27,680	| IOT044 |	So it's not expected that you would buy a house with a refrigerator
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,216	| IOT044 |	So I bring my own
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:34,336	| IOT044 |	But for a smart device I don't expect to buy a house with smart devices because most houses don't have them
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:38,944	| IOT044 |	So if I sell my house with all my setup and move to a new house I'm going to have to start
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:43,040	| IOT044 |	From scratch if I put several thousand dollars of smart devices in my home
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:45,088	| IOT044 |	What's money lost when selling my house
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:51,232	| IOT044 |	And I can't really say my house is worth more because of those devices because most people right now wouldn't pay the extra cost of having
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| IOT044 |	That's a really good point
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,584	| IOT044 |	And I know I would not pay the X
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,352	| IOT044 |	Patrick Hospital
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,120	| IOT044 |	And I love her
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,168	| IOT044 |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,680	| IOT044 |	Highwood
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,960	| IOT044 |	I
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,496	| IOT044 |	Probably would not know
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,544	| IOT044 |	You know we put the solar panels on her house and
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,104	| IOT044 |	That added about $30,000
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,640	| IOT044 |	To the appraised value because
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,968	| IOT044 |	Clearly they're not coming with us for not taking down 41 solar panels
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:14,272	| IOT044 |	When we move there permanently attached to the house
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,088	| IOT044 |	Turn on my smart home stuff I would definitely take with me
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,624	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:22,208	| IOT044 |	Would I pay more for a house that already had it
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,024	| IOT044 |	I kind of want
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:29,888	| IOT044 |	The choice of what I want to use so I don't know a kind of trying to go straight and say well hey
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:34,496	| IOT044 |	Either take it out or leave it I don't care not paying more for it I don't think I pay more for a house because it was
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,776	| IOT044 |	Fit in with that kind of stuff
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:38,592	| IOT044 |	Yeah kind of depends on how
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,360	| IOT044 |	Well spit it out
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,176	| IOT044 |	Many people today already pay for
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,224	| IOT044 |	Certain types of media system
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:45,760	| IOT044 |	Sounds like you pay more for it
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,040	| IOT044 |	In-ceiling speakers
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,064	| IOT044 |	You might
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:56,000	| IOT044 |	I would maybe like a projector an HDMI HDTV projector its mountains at the ceiling with a screen
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:56,512	| IOT044 |	But I don't think
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,536	| IOT044 |	Alarm system
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,120	| IOT044 |	Irrigation system that's connected
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,680	| IOT044 |	I'm just that I'm starting to that mean Lake
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,704	| IOT044 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:08,032	| IOT044 |	I mean there's something to that happen if you got a whole package of these things
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:12,640	| IOT044 |	But you're not going to break them out and see what a house is worth $4,000 more because I have all these things so you know
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:13,664	| IOT044 |	Will you just
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,760	| IOT044 |	Someone is having a pitch one day
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,528	| IOT044 |	You know that's like
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,320	| IOT044 |	Smart Home Tech is the new granite countertop
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,600	| IOT044 |	In a sense
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,904	| IOT044 |	A granite countertop is not going to make it
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,672	| IOT044 |	Break
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,696	| IOT044 |	Your house would have
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,256	| IOT044 |	A certain price level
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:34,912	| IOT044 |	If we can we can sell our house last year cuz we didn't have Granite for go ahead
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,728	| IOT044 |	I have Corian
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,568	| IOT044 |	But
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,616	| IOT044 |	At a certain level people
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| IOT044 |	Expect certain amenities
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,944	| IOT044 |	Countertops
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,968	| IOT044 |	And I think
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,248	| IOT044 |	We're going to get to a point
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,064	| IOT044 |	We're at a certain level people are going to look at your
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:55,392	| IOT044 |	A better irrigation system or Nest Thermostat or
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,928	| IOT044 |	You know that kind of
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:59,232	| IOT044 |	Things like it really high-end homes
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,280	| IOT044 |	You expect smarter lighting
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,048	| IOT044 |	You really do
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,584	| IOT044 |	Liquor store store
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,096	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| IOT044 |	I will let you know what
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:11,520	| IOT044 |	I agree with you I guess I question the timing I think it's I think we're a long way off
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:14,336	| IOT044 |	From those types of things impacting homes
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,616	| IOT044 |	For all but high-end homes
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:18,176	| IOT044 |	And I would be curious if any of our listeners
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,224	| IOT044 |	Have sold their home
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:22,528	| IOT044 |	With and without Smart Home Stuff
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:28,416	| IOT044 |	And if that effective negotiation or price I would love to hear from somebody who's actually gone through that and
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,952	| IOT044 |	Desmos princess Asher
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:31,488	| IOT044 |	Okay so listeners

EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,864	| IOT044 |	Or if you were Soldier home
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:40,192	| IOT044 |	Add a smart device or a smart
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,240	| IOT044 |	Kind of home automation system that is helped

EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:19,616	| IOT044 |	You don't have to worry about that the reason he's on the show is because there is also an Internet of Things component
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,408	| IOT044 |	To his Broadband offering

EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,416	| IOT044 |	You guys lunch story last
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,696	| IOT044 |	Last week and it was up
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,720	| IOT044 |	Big
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,280	| IOT044 |	Freaking so why don't you go
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,072	| IOT044 |	I telling everybody
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,608	| IOT044 |	Seriously what story is
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,960	| IOT044 |	Sure so sorry was known as project decibel while we were developing
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:21,312	| IOT044 |	But basically it's it's kind of think of it as a entire communication
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,848	| IOT044 |	If you will
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,896	| IOT044 |	It starts with
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:28,224	| IOT044 |	Depending on which way you look at it either from home or or some
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:32,064	| IOT044 |	The goals of companies to provide a
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,832	| IOT044 |	Broadband access
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,624	| IOT044 |	A way for using
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,904	| IOT044 |	Wireless technology
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:37,952	| IOT044 |	Olympics
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:42,048	| IOT044 |	Second is in home appliances that combine and simplify
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:46,400	| IOT044 |	Interfaces the consumer has to the internet
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,704	| IOT044 |	Goal ambition
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:51,264	| IOT044 |	And goodies for the passion is to make
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:54,080	| IOT044 |	Things that are simple easy convenient
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:59,712	| IOT044 |	Consumers will adopt them more and then get a greater benefit out of them
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,248	| IOT044 |	Okay so
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,272	| IOT044 |	You were doing
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,552	| IOT044 |	Broadband service to
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,368	| IOT044 |	People and just just to get people really excited
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,392	| IOT044 |	How fast
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,672	| IOT044 |	Is this internet service
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,184	| IOT044 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:12,512	| IOT044 |	Sonar technical test we've tested up to a gigabit
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:17,888	| IOT044 |	But we think ultimately will be able to do more but that's the max that we've demonstrated to ourselves and I
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,192	| IOT044 |	Oh wow okay
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:20,960	| IOT044 |	I don't usually hear
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:23,776	| IOT044 |	Technical test we can do a gigabit
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:27,872	| IOT044 |	And then we think we can do more I usually it's the other way around to do it take a bit but really
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,896	| IOT044 |	You're going to get less
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,664	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:31,968	| IOT044 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,736	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,040	| IOT044 |	The idea is I can ditch my
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,064	| IOT044 |	Traditional IRA
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:39,904	| IOT044 |	I put one of your devices if I have a house it's going to be
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| IOT044 |	On a window
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,744	| IOT044 |	I stick this in there
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,280	| IOT044 |	It's going to take
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,560	| IOT044 |	Your
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,840	| IOT044 |	Crazy
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:50,656	| IOT044 |	It's crazy technology guys don't worry about it
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,448	| IOT044 |	But on the inside of the house
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,216	| IOT044 |	It turns into Wi-Fi
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,776	| IOT044 |	So outside of the house it's
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:57,056	| IOT044 |	7 millimeter waves
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,848	| IOT044 |	Y'all can worry about that later
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,384	| IOT044 |	Inside of the house it's Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,944	| IOT044 |	There is another device
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,480	| IOT044 |	It's called
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,528	| IOT044 |	Let's see what is it it's the starry
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,576	| IOT044 |	It's called The Starry station
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,368	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,136	| IOT044 |	Is
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,184	| IOT044 |	Wireless router
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,208	| IOT044 |	Plus AI
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:14,976	| IOT044 |	Hub
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:19,328	| IOT044 |	An Android application platform all combined in the
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,608	| IOT044 |	Awesomely beautiful looking
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:25,728	| IOT044 |	It is very pretty I am kind of excited that we have this this
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,568	| IOT044 |	Huge number of pretty routers like devices in her home
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:33,664	| IOT044 |	So the story station is kind of what we will focus on here
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,432	| IOT044 |	Because
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,712	| IOT044 |	This is the Hub
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,736	| IOT044 |	For you guys
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:40,576	| IOT044 |	It has Bluetooth it has 11 AC Wi-Fi
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,648	| IOT044 |	We spent a lot of time optimizing
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:46,208	| IOT044 |	Power amplifiers in antenna design in.
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:47,232	| IOT044 |	Maximize coverage
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,536	| IOT044 |	It has zigbee
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,584	| IOT044 |	As well and
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:56,960	| IOT044 |	It will also we would also launch a Extender with it soon which basically
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:59,008	| IOT044 |	Creates a tunnel between
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:03,360	| IOT044 |	Abuse isolation and extender to extend the reach in
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:08,224	| IOT044 |	More concrete type of construction on brick and masonry Caprica
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:08,736	| IOT044 |	Instructions
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,272	| IOT044 |	My situations
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,064	| IOT044 |	Okay so I do have to ask
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:13,600	| IOT044 |	Because this is going to have
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,112	| IOT044 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,392	| IOT044 |	Busy Bee
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:15,904	| IOT044 |	The Wi-Fi
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,464	| IOT044 |	Sounds good it's got the Android Bass
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,512	| IOT044 |	You told me before the show that
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,560	| IOT044 |	You know one day it might upgrade to thread
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,632	| IOT044 |	Why no Z-Wave
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,936	| IOT044 |	So we went back and forth
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:34,080	| IOT044 |	Turn on the decisions and betrayed use to put in there and put a long time to at least two months there was a lot of
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:37,664	| IOT044 |	Passionate debate inside the company I think we broke down the
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,200	| IOT044 |	Coyote Channel alarm
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,480	| IOT044 |	Debating the same
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:44,832	| IOT044 |	I think the conclusion we at least of it seemed reached was
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:47,904	| IOT044 |	Unipower started thinking about some a power perspective
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:52,000	| IOT044 |	Which method zigbee made a lot of sense for low-power applications
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:56,096	| IOT044 |	Ble obviously program applications include
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,400	| IOT044 |	Bridging two speakers from Wi-Fi etcetera
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,424	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:02,240	| IOT044 |	Your Instinct was that a lot of
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,288	| IOT044 |	People were beginning to build
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:07,872	| IOT044 |	You know Wi-Fi into these devices as opposed to Z-Wave and we saw
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,664	| IOT044 |	As a roadmap
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,992	| IOT044 |	Nothing that deter deciding if we had zigbee and
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,576	| IOT044 |	Wi-Fi and Bluetooth we wouldn't be able to cover a lot of Apple
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:19,136	| IOT044 |	And you know this is not you know
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:21,696	| IOT044 |	You know I mean this version of the product has.
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:23,744	| IOT044 |	Things change in the future
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:26,048	| IOT044 |	I'm sure we'll upgrade or change our approach
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,328	| IOT044 |	But that was for the Box
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:27,840	| IOT044 |	Can going into
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,656	| IOT044 |	Okay is there a port on the back where I can plug
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:34,752	| IOT044 |	No the radios built into the device itself
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,824	| IOT044 |	I'm okay
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,592	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,616	| IOT044 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:45,760	| IOT044 |	Why you decided to combine because this is probably more Salient to the normal people out there who listen to the podcast
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,296	| IOT044 |	Why you decided to say hey
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,320	| IOT044 |	I'm going to be
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,856	| IOT044 |	Be an ISP
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,672	| IOT044 |	And I'm going to provide an iot hub
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,464	| IOT044 |	I think that some
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:56,000	| IOT044 |	Approach we take is
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,768	| IOT044 |	Experience
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,560	| IOT044 |	And I think of my experience and education
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,072	| IOT044 |	Expect a lot of pee
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,096	| IOT044 |	Feel the same way
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| IOT044 |	Is when you don't have
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:06,752	| IOT044 |	Environment in which you providing the entire stock it is very difficult
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:08,544	| IOT044 |	To provide a great experience to Consumers
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:14,176	| IOT044 |	So we wanted to do the entire and do anything to make sure the experience that we could put our name behind
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:17,248	| IOT044 |	And you know I Grand and get passionate about
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,064	| IOT044 |	Was controlled by us in terms of equality
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:22,624	| IOT044 |	Right now in attempts to be
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:27,232	| IOT044 |	You know you have an ISP that has a cable modem or or DSL modem or whatever
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,536	| IOT044 |	Particular transport to use
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,560	| IOT044 |	And then they
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:32,352	| IOT044 |	Either package in
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,144	| IOT044 |	The cheapest possible access
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,960	| IOT044 |	When did they can find or encourage you to go by
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:41,568	| IOT044 |	You know I'm more sophisticated wireless router AP
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:44,896	| IOT044 |	The problem is at the service provider they don't have any
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:47,200	| IOT044 |	Control over the software intern
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,224	| IOT044 |	Quality Inn
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:48,992	| IOT044 |	Upgrades in
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:50,272	| IOT044 |	Women's
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,552	| IOT044 |	And it just frustrates
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,320	| IOT044 |	Consumers
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:56,160	| IOT044 |	Same thing applies to iot devices yuan ultimately to think about it
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,440	| IOT044 |	Entire ecosystem
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:02,048	| IOT044 |	That can be managed by the consumer anywhere anyhow easy to deploy and simple
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:05,632	| IOT044 |	Do you want to have access to the entire software stock so you can
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| IOT044 |	Really provided gradle
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,680	| IOT044 |	Experience
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:10,240	| IOT044 |	I'm even Bluetooth pairing as such you know half the
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,264	| IOT044 |	People stumble on it
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| IOT044 |	Writing and then
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:16,384	| IOT044 |	Pairing any of these other things devices are daring and a Wi-Fi
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,688	| IOT044 |	Extender is yuno a science project for an average
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,224	| IOT044 |	I shouldn't be that hard
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,528	| IOT044 |	Nothing what ends up happening is people
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,296	| IOT044 |	Call
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:25,344	| IOT044 |	The service provider ended up set of the cellar
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,112	| IOT044 |	Service provider
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:27,648	| IOT044 |	Somebody else's phone
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:28,928	| IOT044 |	Compared to what
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,744	| IOT044 |	I don't know why I try to avoid
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:35,840	| IOT044 |	That is our goal is that you don't have to call us
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:36,608	| IOT044 |	Which is why
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:39,168	| IOT044 |	We put it at Android screen in there
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:39,936	| IOT044 |	Because we think
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,472	| IOT044 |	We can then develop
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,264	| IOT044 |	Great network-level application
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:49,152	| IOT044 |	That you will be able to control know and hope Nina perhaps in the future will open that up as a open outside
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:53,760	| IOT044 |	Okay so let's talk about that cuz you just kind of opened up this whole
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,296	| IOT044 |	Addition
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:56,320	| IOT044 |	In
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,368	| IOT044 |	About to dig into it so
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:00,160	| IOT044 |	Are you guys thinking about
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:05,792	| IOT044 |	Adding sensors and other devices or are you thinking more like you're going to bring in third-party device
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:09,632	| IOT044 |	I think we will try to develop a few of Our Own
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:13,472	| IOT044 |	But I think we we think that's opening up that platform and
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:14,240	| IOT044 |	Stables
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,800	| IOT044 |	The software and Hardware integrated software Hardware environment
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:23,200	| IOT044 |	Poor People's example that makes sensors and take the burden away from them to have to add cell yet another hub
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:28,320	| IOT044 |	Anna's Pizza software that goes with it as opposed to just writing an app in Android app
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,624	| IOT044 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:35,232	| IOT044 |	Sew-in in you're not going to do any weird for version of Android like the Amazon did with
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,256	| IOT044 |	You know it's fire stuff
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:41,888	| IOT044 |	No it's it's pretty stock-standard I apologize I don't remember if it's lollipop or not but I do
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:46,752	| IOT044 |	Okay that you don't have to you don't have to worry
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,568	| IOT044 |	I won't ask you if you're on marshmallow or
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,848	| IOT044 |	KitKat or lollipop
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,128	| IOT044 |	Actually
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,920	| IOT044 |	Lollipop would be relevant
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:54,688	| IOT044 |	Because of the BL
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,016	| IOT044 |	Oh so nerdy so nerdy chat we won't go there
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,040	| IOT044 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,320	| IOT044 |	So
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,112	| IOT044 |	Check you have
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,648	| IOT044 |	A Thornton is peace
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,184	| IOT044 |	And your previous
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:05,952	| IOT044 |	Start up
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,464	| IOT044 |	Ariel
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,536	| IOT044 |	In that case you were
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:11,328	| IOT044 |	Upsetting the cable company
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,376	| IOT044 |	With the ability to
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:16,448	| IOT044 |	Basically stream and record over the air TV
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,520	| IOT044 |	The shutdown
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:21,568	| IOT044 |	Buy a court case unfortunately
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:24,384	| IOT044 |	I was really eager for it to come to Austin so I was
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:27,200	| IOT044 |	Sad because I can actually get over the air TV in my
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:27,968	| IOT044 |	My house
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,296	| IOT044 |	But
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,856	| IOT044 |	I'm sure you probably learned a lot
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:34,368	| IOT044 |	And
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:38,720	| IOT044 |	I'm curious what did you learn that you think might apply and in this particular
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:40,256	| IOT044 |	Business that you're starting at now
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:45,888	| IOT044 |	Sure it's interesting. You know people's first reaction is as you raised
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:48,192	| IOT044 |	Is that we are going to get a raise
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:51,008	| IOT044 |	That's a nice piece in and I just don't understand
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:54,592	| IOT044 |	Why we live in a system where a
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,128	| IOT044 |	Competition Amina obviously
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:35:00,224	| IOT044 |	An Amazon sells you a bunch of stuff and sodas in a Walmart
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:03,040	| IOT044 |	Nice competition it's Greg everybody created
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,600	| IOT044 |	You better products and their services and attract customers
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,416	| IOT044 |	That's for the model in the
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:09,696	| IOT044 |	Access
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:14,048	| IOT044 |	And I don't understand why that is the case I mean I know why it is the case but I don't understand why
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:14,560	| IOT044 |	People think
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,120	| IOT044 |	Somehow it's not a good idea then and now
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,936	| IOT044 |	Oh I think it's a great idea I'm really excited
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:25,568	| IOT044 |	Little I know you are and I think a lot of pockets are but just ascend
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,616	| IOT044 |	Companies that the reaction tends to be
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,408	| IOT044 |	Well we don't like this
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:33,760	| IOT044 |	Okay great let's see what you can do and then we'll push the boundary to and and
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:35,040	| IOT044 |	See what happens when we the best
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,856	| IOT044 |	Approach is the best company win
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,648	| IOT044 |	And in the study room for everybody
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:43,232	| IOT044 |	And in particular I think people don't like upstart
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,768	| IOT044 |	It's doing that I don't understand that
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,304	| IOT044 |	Ew that's a lot of
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,584	| IOT044 |	Great Innovation and
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:51,424	| IOT044 |	Interesting ideas come out of people that are not encumbered by the conventional
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,448	| IOT044 |	We're thinking about
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,264	| IOT044 |	But be that as it may
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:56,800	| IOT044 |	Either we learned of
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:57,312	| IOT044 |	Fitbit in
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:58,592	| IOT044 |	I dare you
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,640	| IOT044 |	You know a lot of that was
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:03,968	| IOT044 |	How to build a technology company while
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,736	| IOT044 |	Your buildings
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,784	| IOT044 |	Facilities based infrastructure
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:10,624	| IOT044 |	Stop because area was also a city-by-city build-out kind of a model which is
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,392	| IOT044 |	Ghana
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,160	| IOT044 |	Different than what clean
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,696	| IOT044 |	Here
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,976	| IOT044 |	We learned how to
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:18,560	| IOT044 |	Market online which was great we learned
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,328	| IOT044 |	That we
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:22,400	| IOT044 |	We started started we made sure that we
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:24,192	| IOT044 |	Entire marketing
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:26,752	| IOT044 |	What is the foundational marketing team of Ariel
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,800	| IOT044 |	I wish it was with us they won
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:31,616	| IOT044 |	Because we learned the hard way that it's so hard
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:38,016	| IOT044 |	To build a Marketing Group after the fact and when you don't date on the right foundation to the bottom over the same Fields team
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,320	| IOT044 |	The hand of all the areas
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| IOT044 |	Expansion came over
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:44,416	| IOT044 |	The same RF tmall revolve you say augmented the team
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:45,440	| IOT044 |	On the other side
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:46,720	| IOT044 |	Outside quite a bit
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:51,584	| IOT044 |	But yeah it was ultimately the team had a lot got a lot of
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:53,888	| IOT044 |	Confidence out of execution material because
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:58,240	| IOT044 |	When we started area we have it was sort of this like oh my God how we go
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,008	| IOT044 |	Going to do this
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,544	| IOT044 |	Like what do you mean you have to like
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:02,336	| IOT044 |	Rent buildings and rooftops
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:06,176	| IOT044 |	Cities in United stall stuff in you know rent cranes do you know
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,456	| IOT044 |	Raise boxes and
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,736	| IOT044 |	Air conditioning
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,016	| IOT044 |	Those nuts
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:13,088	| IOT044 |	And we learned a lot and how to get it done then
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:13,856	| IOT044 |	Got a lot of confidence
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,136	| IOT044 |	Starting distance
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:20,000	| IOT044 |	That look like this mysterious set of things that need to happen to light activated service
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:24,352	| IOT044 |	What we kind of did it we know what the mechanics are and we've learned a lot
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:26,400	| IOT044 |	In terms of how to do it faster better as well
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,448	| IOT044 |	Those what kind of dog
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:31,264	| IOT044 |	Execution things that we took away from
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,544	| IOT044 |	.
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:37,664	| IOT044 |	Starting dinner in a lot of other ways a lot of innovative companies that have come in you know people mailman.
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:40,480	| IOT044 |	Products and services
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,784	| IOT044 |	Tend to be very useful that I'm thinking
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,320	| IOT044 |	Uber another country
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:46,624	| IOT044 |	Things like that that have had challenges
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,648	| IOT044 |	In the Clarence of the week
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,160	| IOT044 |	Incumbent
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:53,024	| IOT044 |	Climate and I think that the biggest distinction between Ariel and some of those company
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:56,352	| IOT044 |	Please was the we had a single point of failure which was
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,144	| IOT044 |	Federal court versus
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:58,912	| IOT044 |	How you did
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,704	| IOT044 |	Beauty legal framework
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,472	| IOT044 |	State and city in
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,264	| IOT044 |	Mini Plus
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:05,312	| IOT044 |	So I think avoiding a single point of failure is
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:06,848	| IOT044 |	Another key lesson
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:10,688	| IOT044 |	It was unavoidable in areas case because copyright
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:12,480	| IOT044 |	It is what it is
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,040	| IOT044 |	That was a that was a good lesson to learn that
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:18,880	| IOT044 |	And if you're going to push the boundary in any way shape or form not that that's
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,928	| IOT044 |	The case here but that was just a good academic last
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:23,232	| IOT044 |	That tried to distribute arrest
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,792	| IOT044 |	I like it
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,304	| IOT044 |	All right
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,864	| IOT044 |	And for people who are
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:33,728	| IOT044 |	Oh my gosh how can I get this can you tell us a little bit about what start
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,752	| IOT044 |	Is going to cost
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:42,176	| IOT044 |	Starry station which is the iot Wi-Fi blue ble all combined have which is going
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:47,808	| IOT044 |	You can reserve it now on our website it goes to sale and get clothes on sale next week I think February 4th
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:51,136	| IOT044 |	On Amazon as well as our website
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:53,184	| IOT044 |	Is $249
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| IOT044 |	So you can order that
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:57,280	| IOT044 |	The stories Internet Service Wichita Starry internet
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,560	| IOT044 |	Will start beta
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,352	| IOT044 |	In Boston at the First Market
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,888	| IOT044 |	In the summertime thing with Target
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,936	| IOT044 |	And then
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:08,288	| IOT044 |	Much like we did with the area we let it soak for a few months learned a great deal
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,056	| IOT044 |	Entrance
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:09,568	| IOT044 |	How to do it
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,616	| IOT044 |	Better faster
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:14,176	| IOT044 |	Build our support infrastructure with that as well
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:16,224	| IOT044 |	And then we'll start rolling that out in
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:18,016	| IOT044 |	Testing multiple more cities
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,088	| IOT044 |	Okay any word on
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,368	| IOT044 |	The cities that you plan
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:29,536	| IOT044 |	Not at the moment I mean you know obviously some of our test licenses are public information but I wouldn't message
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:33,888	| IOT044 |	Primarily focused on making sure that we have testing done in
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,424	| IOT044 |	Various different types of
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:38,240	| IOT044 |	Biological geographical and
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:41,824	| IOT044 |	In the weather conditions with them but we have not finalized this
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,128	| IOT044 |	But again it's a start-up I think it's fair to assume
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:46,432	| IOT044 |	That you fish where the fish are
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:52,832	| IOT044 |	And so we will probably go after underserved markets and or where that is only itching the coax provider with
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,344	| IOT044 |	ESL
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:56,928	| IOT044 |	In order to you no bring a better dynamic
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| IOT044 |	Excellent
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,792	| IOT044 |	One more thing because
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,840	| IOT044 |	This will actually run on the day
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,888	| IOT044 |	Your Starry station goes on sale
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:08,704	| IOT044 |	Is there a reason for me to buy the starry station
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,496	| IOT044 |	If I'm not in line to
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:12,288	| IOT044 |	To get Starry internet
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,312	| IOT044 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,592	| IOT044 |	Because if you
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,640	| IOT044 |	Are frustrated with your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,408	| IOT044 |	In terms of its
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,944	| IOT044 |	Performance throughout your house
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:25,344	| IOT044 |	If you're frustrated with not having simple and easy apps like I like I don't know if you have children but if you want to have school
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:28,672	| IOT044 |	We have a great app on the station called screen time which allows you
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:34,816	| IOT044 |	To set up policies on and filters for your children so they can email be online and certain hours
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:40,704	| IOT044 |	Block other things Etc. So all those apps that new parents would find easy and simple to use
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,984	| IOT044 |	Essentially just
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,008	| IOT044 |	Clicking top
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:47,872	| IOT044 |	It has really cool interesting features that will make your life much easier for example
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,152	| IOT044 |	It monitors
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:51,200	| IOT044 |	To put on a poor client level
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:56,832	| IOT044 |	And actually then also on the wide area network and creates an entire Health score for you to tell you
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,368	| IOT044 |	Which devices may be struggling
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:02,976	| IOT044 |	What day are SSI levels are and adults example if you got
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,000	| IOT044 |	An Apple TV
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:06,816	| IOT044 |	That is attached to a 2.4 gigahertz
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:09,376	| IOT044 |	N Signal because the power in a power 10
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:13,728	| IOT044 |	It'll automatically detect a days greeter couplet at 8
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,008	| IOT044 |	Inferior
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:19,104	| IOT044 |	Pizza Spectrum it'll create a five gig version of that Network
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,384	| IOT044 |	Pop up something to say to you
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:23,712	| IOT044 |	We are going to now connect you with Apple TV to the V Gate Park
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,528	| IOT044 |	Standing enforce that connection and
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:29,344	| IOT044 |	It's not really smart learning
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,624	| IOT044 |	Features built into it
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:32,672	| IOT044 |	That'll allow you to
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:34,208	| IOT044 |	Make life easier
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:38,816	| IOT044 |	If you go to YouTube you're not like you know the one Tech person in the household becoming an admin for the entire day
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,328	| IOT044 |	Extended family
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,376	| IOT044 |	So it's a better router
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:41,888	| IOT044 |	For your family
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,168	| IOT044 |	Better
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:43,936	| IOT044 |	Performance
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,704	| IOT044 |	Easy
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:51,104	| IOT044 |	Simple and you know we designed it in a really interesting way which was the screen is for the hero
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:52,895	| IOT044 |	The product really two reasons
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,431	| IOT044 |	1
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:56,991	| IOT044 |	With a better user interface but the second thing is
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:57,759	| IOT044 |	Yeah I'm sure you know
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:04,159	| IOT044 |	You know most people will stick their AP somewhere or router somewhere in a Dusty shelf behind a bunch of book
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,183	| IOT044 |	Bookshelves etc etc
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:07,231	| IOT044 |	Which potentially hurts
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:07,999	| IOT044 |	Performance matters
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:11,583	| IOT044 |	Putting a screen in building an Ambien
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,887	| IOT044 |	Play that is continuously telling you the help
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:14,655	| IOT044 |	At a glance
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,959	| IOT044 |	Wokano ask people
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,263	| IOT044 |	Basically the move it in
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,287	| IOT044 |	It's somewhere that they can see it
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,311	| IOT044 |	As a result
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:25,919	| IOT044 |	Routers are becoming like
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,711	| IOT044 |	The superheroes of the home network
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:28,991	| IOT044 |	It's so fun
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:31,551	| IOT044 |	I'm loving it
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:33,599	| IOT044 |	I
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,111	| IOT044 |	Half life
