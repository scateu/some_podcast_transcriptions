EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:44,192	| IOT203 |	All right
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| IOT203 |	Let us talk
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,288	| IOT203 |	All the news that
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:50,848	| IOT203 |	Talk about
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,408	| IOT203 |	Correction last week when we were answering
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,944	| IOT203 |	Something on the iot
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,712	| IOT203 |	The podcast hotline
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| IOT203 |	We said
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:59,552	| IOT203 |	That idevices switches do not work
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,904	| IOT203 |	They have had an Android app for quite some time
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,720	| IOT203 |	So know that
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,048	| IOT203 |	You're the Android User I have an iPhone
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:10,560	| IOT203 |	So I'm in the clear
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,096	| IOT203 |	Yes this was all my
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,400	| IOT203 |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,704	| IOT203 |	Let's get started with our big news
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,984	| IOT203 |	The day which is Amazon
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:19,008	| IOT203 |	Asbat
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,544	| IOT203 |	Eero
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,312	| IOT203 |	Actually
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,336	| IOT203 |	They've announced that they plan to buy
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,384	| IOT203 |	Deal is not yet closed
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,152	| IOT203 |	There is no
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,944	| IOT203 |	Price tag associated with
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:29,248	| IOT203 |	Bastille so it is a big mystery
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,016	| IOT203 |	I did ask
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:30,528	| IOT203 |	No one told me
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:35,648	| IOT203 |	Show me a surprise if we get that number and it was quite a surprise that this even happen
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| IOT203 |	Yasso Iero if you guys are on
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,744	| IOT203 |	Familiar is a mesh Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,792	| IOT203 |	I use it in my house
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,304	| IOT203 |	Actually ever
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,376	| IOT203 |	It basically makes it super easy to
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,656	| IOT203 |	Create a WiFi network
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,168	| IOT203 |	It covers your whole home
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,472	| IOT203 |	Eero has been one of the
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,520	| IOT203 |	Big pioneers and mesh Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,800	| IOT203 |	Why they're not the first to do it
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,336	| IOT203 |	But they definitely made it a household name
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,384	| IOT203 |	So I wrote a story about the
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,920	| IOT203 |	Best and in it I talked about
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,712	| IOT203 |	Why Amazon is doing
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,760	| IOT203 |	In the first reason is
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:03,808	| IOT203 |	All homes need a good wifi system
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,624	| IOT203 |	Just because you put smart device
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,416	| IOT203 |	System places you might never bring a PC
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| IOT203 |	So wifi
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,232	| IOT203 |	Like nooks and crannies really
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,280	| IOT203 |	They also bought it
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,096	| IOT203 |	Because 0 has access to a lot of data
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,168	| IOT203 |	I don't know and we'll talk about this in a minute if
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:23,520	| IOT203 |	Amazon is ever going to change arrows privacy practices zero says right now that they're not
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,568	| IOT203 |	But right now
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,848	| IOT203 |	Euro nose
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,640	| IOT203 |	All the devices in my home
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,664	| IOT203 |	Wifi base
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,712	| IOT203 |	They also know where I go on the web
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| IOT203 |	Because
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| IOT203 |	It's my router
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,552	| IOT203 |	It's a lot of data there
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,088	| IOT203 |	And then third
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,880	| IOT203 |	Eero has a Cyrus
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:42,720	| IOT203 |	Security service called Eero plus actually subscribe to it just to see if it was worth
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,792	| IOT203 |	And this is both cyber-security soap
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,328	| IOT203 |	Protect against malware is
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,096	| IOT203 |	Set a beta ad blocker
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,144	| IOT203 |	It also allows for parental
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:56,032	| IOT203 |	Controls in this is a kind of service that I can see Amazon wanting to either offer Maybe
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:56,544	| IOT203 |	2 prime number
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,384	| IOT203 |	Or just in general to have a good
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,664	| IOT203 |	Cyber security
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,432	| IOT203 |	Or connected
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,224	| IOT203 |	Devices service because
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,248	| IOT203 |	It's seeming to become
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,552	| IOT203 |	Comcast offers one
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,576	| IOT203 |	CES
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,392	| IOT203 |	Comedies like bitdefender
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,440	| IOT203 |	Cujo Norton has a
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| IOT203 |	Save a little
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,976	| IOT203 |	Hexagonal
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,256	| IOT203 |	Looking device
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,024	| IOT203 |	The core
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,327	| IOT203 |	So there's a bunch of these devices out there
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,119	| IOT203 |	So it makes sense that Amazon wants to
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| IOT203 |	This game
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,191	| IOT203 |	It also makes sense to offer it as a service
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,215	| IOT203 |	Then
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,079	| IOT203 |	Does it include a VPN option
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,615	| IOT203 |	It does I get a VP
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,151	| IOT203 |	PM Plus I also get a password
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,223	| IOT203 |	There's a lot there
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,759	| IOT203 |	So those are like the
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT203 |	3 reasons I think
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| IOT203 |	In
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,879	| IOT203 |	There's also I would say Kevin is probably going
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,927	| IOT203 |	About this
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,463	| IOT203 |	There is the potential
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,999	| IOT203 |	To put
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| IOT203 |	Eero
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,279	| IOT203 |	In Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| IOT203 |	And combined it into a spa
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,839	| IOT203 |	My home hub
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,863	| IOT203 |	What you think
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:59,263	| IOT203 |	I think I wrote the story that thing that somebody should do just that about nine months ago and we don't know if they're going to do
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:03,615	| IOT203 |	Obviously in a lot of people in fact a lot of the readers of that said they don't want
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:09,759	| IOT203 |	They want to keep their smart home stuff and their Network your separate and that's totally understandable
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,575	| IOT203 |	But I wonder if that will come as an option
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:18,719	| IOT203 |	As an all-in-one package they wouldn't be the first to do that they being Amazon combined with Eero until I got high
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:23,327	| IOT203 |	Because Samsung's done this with their SmartThings wi-fi system which
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:27,167	| IOT203 |	Includes Mesh networking and a SmartThings Hub all-in-one base
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,959	| IOT203 |	This is
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,239	| IOT203 |	Appliance on the market
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:36,383	| IOT203 |	Today not from Amazon not from Google I really expected them to do it so they have Google Wi-Fi and Google home
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,687	| IOT203 |	I would expect that we Elysium
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| IOT203 |	I'm from Amazon the future on this
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,783	| IOT203 |	Yes and it's worth noting the
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,295	| IOT203 |	The competitive Batman
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,111	| IOT203 |	So Google has their mesh wi-fi system
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,135	| IOT203 |	Samsung
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,159	| IOT203 |	Has decided to
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,183	| IOT203 |	Partner with
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,207	| IOT203 |	Plume
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,255	| IOT203 |	Chipotle basically wifi
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,583	| IOT203 |	SmartThings Hub and eventually into other products
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:59,423	| IOT203 |	And I do think that's someplace we might go which is
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,703	| IOT203 |	Instead of having
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| IOT203 |	These like
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:07,871	| IOT203 |	Little access points around our house plugged in places we might just see it built into like light switches or smart speakers
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,663	| IOT203 |	Or a variety of other things that are already in
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,223	| IOT203 |	And that would be nice
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| IOT203 |	Cuz I I'll be honest
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:13,759	| IOT203 |	I'm kind of overwhelmed
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:18,879	| IOT203 |	I was just going to say less boxes less wires it starts to become
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,159	| IOT203 |	More The Hidden
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:25,279	| IOT203 |	Teacher in the home cuz Franklin give me something to look nice
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:29,119	| IOT203 |	I really want to see them all over the house I do now
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,399	| IOT203 |	Oh wait no
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:33,215	| IOT203 |	I don't want this in my lighting though because I don't
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| IOT203 |	What I mean Wi-Fi changes so fast
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,311	| IOT203 |	3 years from now I don't want to switch out
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:41,407	| IOT203 |	So I take my comment back I do want it in like a hub that I can
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| IOT203 |	But I don't want it better than
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,015	| IOT203 |	I'm a guy so it doesn't bother me
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,295	| IOT203 |	You're so straight
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,599	| IOT203 |	Change
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,647	| IOT203 |	Oh wait no no you're not strange you just have a different
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,695	| IOT203 |	Perspective it that's why you're awesome on the show
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,487	| IOT203 |	That's what you meant to say yeah
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,791	| IOT203 |	All right
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,607	| IOT203 |	So tied to this and what we saw it in the wake of
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,631	| IOT203 |	Hit the snooze witch
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,911	| IOT203 |	Shows how little we trust
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,215	| IOT203 |	Please is this idea that
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,495	| IOT203 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,543	| IOT203 |	I don't want Amazon doing all of that about me
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,591	| IOT203 |	Oh and a lot of people said you know
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,919	| IOT203 |	Where they were going to dump your oh and by the way if you want to jump your Eros
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:14,431	| IOT203 |	You're small
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,223	| IOT203 |	Ubiquiti
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,551	| IOT203 |	Netgear has orbi although they do have Madam a
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,575	| IOT203 |	Integrations so
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,855	| IOT203 |	You wouldn't want to act
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,647	| IOT203 |	Say that there's also
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,183	| IOT203 |	Linksys has their velop
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:25,951	| IOT203 |	System
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,231	| IOT203 |	And a company called so
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,999	| IOT203 |	Securifi
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,023	| IOT203 |	They actually
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:31,071	| IOT203 |	I don't know they pioneered the match but they were one of the
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| IOT203 |	First companies out there with a
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,119	| IOT203 |	Mesh system
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,655	| IOT203 |	And they're actually a startup
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| IOT203 |	Company so they have
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,727	| IOT203 |	A mesh Wi-Fi
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| IOT203 |	Dumb as well
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,287	| IOT203 |	So those are some options if your
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,079	| IOT203 |	I can't have this
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,359	| IOT203 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:43,871	| IOT203 |	The other ass
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,943	| IOT203 |	That we should talk about is the idea that Amazon is sucking
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,015	| IOT203 |	What the state of right after they did the Eero aqua
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,319	| IOT203 |	Position story came out in Bloomberg
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,623	| IOT203 |	That interviewed some of the people who are working with the
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,415	| IOT203 |	Madam a
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,207	| IOT203 |	Program and it talks about
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,743	| IOT203 |	Amazon trying to get
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| IOT203 |	Accessed
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,279	| IOT203 |	Data
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,047	| IOT203 |	About
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:02,815	| IOT203 |	When your turn
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,095	| IOT203 |	Lights on and off
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| IOT203 |	When you're using things
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:08,191	| IOT203 |	Not just when you ask Madame a to do it
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:08,703	| IOT203 |	But all the time
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| IOT203 |	Wonderful
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| IOT203 |	In
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,287	| IOT203 |	You don't
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,823	| IOT203 |	Amazon says and I actually believe them
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,383	| IOT203 |	They're getting this because they wanted antissa
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,687	| IOT203 |	If they want to understand
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,455	| IOT203 |	How someone
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,735	| IOT203 |	Daily life at
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:21,759	| IOT203 |	So you can
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,295	| IOT203 |	See patterns.
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,063	| IOT203 |	Anticipated
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,343	| IOT203 |	We talk about this
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:25,855	| IOT203 |	The time on the show
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| IOT203 |	But
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,671	| IOT203 |	Most people are like
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,695	| IOT203 |	I don't trust you
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,743	| IOT203 |	Are you going to use it for advertising
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,279	| IOT203 |	Today Amazon says they do not
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,303	| IOT203 |	Might be in the feet
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| IOT203 |	Sure
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| IOT203 |	And that's where
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,655	| IOT203 |	There's a huge breakdown and Trust
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,423	| IOT203 |	With the iot
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,215	| IOT203 |	I really don't know how we're going to solve
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:46,591	| IOT203 |	Yeah there's two thoughts that come to mind here from an advertising perspective I don't
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,919	| IOT203 |	Think that's going to be an issue in the reason I say that is
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:54,271	| IOT203 |	What's a your surfing on the web know you're giving Google maybe all this data
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,575	| IOT203 |	Right where you go what you're looking for
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| IOT203 |	And it will recommend products
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,903	| IOT203 |	Why when you talk about off home
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,439	| IOT203 |	And devices in the home
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,207	| IOT203 |	You're not
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:08,607	| IOT203 |	Doing that much with them yours turn things on or off the closing door the only thing I can think of
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:15,007	| IOT203 |	Much wider range of information is from the TV and we're going to talk about that later in the show because that's
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:18,079	| IOT203 |	Voicemail question has to do with privacy and security on smart TVs
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:22,431	| IOT203 |	So I'm not concerned from an advertising perspective and I don't think most people should be
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,967	| IOT203 |	However
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| IOT203 |	There is a
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,039	| IOT203 |	Very valid perception that win
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,831	| IOT203 |	An individual buy something
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,879	| IOT203 |	What is the phone tablet
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,927	| IOT203 |	It's up to them how they use it
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,463	| IOT203 |	And
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:38,047	| IOT203 |	I think people will have a problem with Amazon and Google and other company
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| IOT203 |	Knowing
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,095	| IOT203 |	Am I home right now
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,631	| IOT203 |	Did I go out through this door
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,423	| IOT203 |	How many people are in the house and so on
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:46,239	| IOT203 |	That's where I think people are and should rightly be concerned about
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:50,847	| IOT203 |	And honestly I mean it's very clear from my patterns at home that I work
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,639	| IOT203 |	Or maybe I don't work
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:53,919	| IOT203 |	Maybe I look
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,687	| IOT203 |	Like a stay-at-home mom
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:57,247	| IOT203 |	I don't know but those are not things I necessarily want
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:02,367	| IOT203 |	No and then the other flip side of this is and I don't worry about the so much with Amazon and Google
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,647	| IOT203 |	But what if that data gets hacked
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:07,487	| IOT203 |	What if I can see into my house and you know exactly
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,047	| IOT203 |	Person is clearly on vacation
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:18,239	| IOT203 |	Yeah I mean innocent the smart home is both the solution and the problem
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,775	| IOT203 |	The solution is having
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,311	| IOT203 |	Smart devices that indicate
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,591	| IOT203 |	Your house being broken into
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:26,431	| IOT203 |	How did they even in your house
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,967	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,991	| IOT203 |	Honest friend
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| IOT203 |	This is not something
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,551	| IOT203 |	For now
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,575	| IOT203 |	I'm going to trust Amazon with
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,391	| IOT203 |	But I don't feel as blase is
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,183	| IOT203 |	And I am seriously
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,975	| IOT203 |	Rethinking a lot of my
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,999	| IOT203 |	Relationships with these cup
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,303	| IOT203 |	Unfortunately I'm not sure what I'm going to
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,071	| IOT203 |	That you about it
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,863	| IOT203 |	Gizmodo has a great article actually from
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| IOT203 |	Kashmir Hill
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,679	| IOT203 |	This week and it is called
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,239	| IOT203 |	I cut the Big 5 Tech Giants for my life
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| IOT203 |	It was hell
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,079	| IOT203 |	And holy cow it was I really recommend to put a link to this
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:56,127	| IOT203 |	A story that you read this because
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,663	| IOT203 |	Was very hard for her to do her
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,687	| IOT203 |	Her job and
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,735	| IOT203 |	I think it was like a series were
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:03,551	| IOT203 |	Birchwood live without one of the major tech companies
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,087	| IOT203 |	Products and services for a week
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,159	| IOT203 |	So I don't know if the store you have is a wrap up
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,999	| IOT203 |	Yeah she live without one of them for a week and then
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| IOT203 |	The final
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,095	| IOT203 |	Yeah it is an omen
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,375	| IOT203 |	Situation
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,447	| IOT203 |	Mary Harper
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:24,287	| IOT203 |	Sirius. Here I do fundamentally believe
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:27,359	| IOT203 |	That we can use this kind of data to make our lives easier and more
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| IOT203 |	More convenient but I also do believe that things
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,431	| IOT203 |	Gotten way out of
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,735	| IOT203 |	Also we should
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| IOT203 |	Be rethinking
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,527	| IOT203 |	This
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,319	| IOT203 |	And I'm not even sure how to do
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,087	| IOT203 |	Define this so
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,111	| IOT203 |	This is what I'm worth
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| IOT203 |	On for like the next month or so
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,951	| IOT203 |	That's because this is changing
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,815	| IOT203 |	Let's move on to something a little bit more fun
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| IOT203 |	And useful
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| IOT203 |	Possibly used
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,375	| IOT203 |	That's true
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,167	| IOT203 |	So I don't know about you but
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,447	| IOT203 |	Baidu
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,983	| IOT203 |	Fight with my husband in bed
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| IOT203 |	Over his Mosaic cover Steeler I'll be honest
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,055	| IOT203 |	And I'm actually
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,103	| IOT203 |	Can crutches on his territory
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:11:59,871	| IOT203 |	I like sprawled out in the
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,687	| IOT203 |	Ford may have a solution
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:08,063	| IOT203 |	Yeah I don't fight with your husband in bed but I still think this is an interesting situation and it came from
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,343	| IOT203 |	Fords
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,951	| IOT203 |	Lotus Group in Dallas
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,719	| IOT203 |	Got a one-off
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,999	| IOT203 |	Products
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:20,607	| IOT203 |	That is Courtney Ford Lane keeping bed now you understand the auto rep
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:25,215	| IOT203 |	This is a bed that is built with a conveyor belt inside it
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:31,359	| IOT203 |	And issue is when somebody rolls over to hog up the bed
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:38,527	| IOT203 |	Conveyor belt will move entire both of you in the bed to even out
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,063	| IOT203 |	The bet so you're not
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,855	| IOT203 |	Infringing on somebody's Lane
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:45,439	| IOT203 |	Second sister
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT203 |	Cars
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:52,607	| IOT203 |	It's pretty interesting I would have liked it more if it actually lift it up and roll the person over who is trying to hog the bed
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:58,495	| IOT203 |	But it doesn't do that it just shifts both people back to the middle of the bed because the bed is gone
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| IOT203 |	And uses
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:03,359	| IOT203 |	Pressure points to determine when maybe somebody is not on their side so
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:05,663	| IOT203 |	Rather interesting funny video to say quite honestly
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,223	| IOT203 |	And you can't buy this is a concept
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,735	| IOT203 |	What I would like
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:12,575	| IOT203 |	His Biz basically reminds me of I don't know if you have siblings
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,111	| IOT203 |	We be at the back
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| IOT203 |	The car
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,903	| IOT203 |	And like you draw the line.
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,719	| IOT203 |	He's such a he's touching me
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,255	| IOT203 |	I put my finger over the imaginary
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:24,351	| IOT203 |	Maybe like hahaha
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:27,167	| IOT203 |	This might be good actually in the backseat of a car
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,471	| IOT203 |	It's you could just like conveyor them
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:34,079	| IOT203 |	Little electric shock to win
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,223	| IOT203 |	In other news there's been two deals in the homestead
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:40,735	| IOT203 |	Security world
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,527	| IOT203 |	And as you guys
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:48,159	| IOT203 |	Remember security is basically the Trojan Horse to get a lot of consumers into the smartphone
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,695	| IOT203 |	So you see a lot of
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:53,023	| IOT203 |	Annie's buying security-focused products
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:53,791	| IOT203 |	Because
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,303	| IOT203 |	Consumers will
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,583	| IOT203 |	We spend money on
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,119	| IOT203 |	Where is they may not spend it on can
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,143	| IOT203 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,423	| IOT203 |	First
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,703	| IOT203 |	Then it's a foot in the door
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,263	| IOT203 |	So yes they get their foot in the door and then poof
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,287	| IOT203 |	People start buying all kinds
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| IOT203 |	A company called
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,615	| IOT203 |	Bode
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,919	| IOT203 |	They make a really good actually
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,431	| IOT203 |	Security
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,479	| IOT203 |	They partnered with a company called
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:12,991	| IOT203 |	Hellotalk
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,783	| IOT203 |	Hellotech will actually
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,807	| IOT203 |	Do it for peace
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,343	| IOT203 |	They will install the security
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,367	| IOT203 |	Customs for them
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:22,463	| IOT203 |	Which is nice because there's a whole crowd of people out there who are like
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,767	| IOT203 |	Yeah the smart home stuff is too intimidating I want to mess
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| IOT203 |	And then ATT
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| IOT203 |	Which is
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:29,375	| IOT203 |	B name
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,447	| IOT203 |	Is actually acquired
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,727	| IOT203 |	Company called lifeshield
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,007	| IOT203 |	And like Shield
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,775	| IOT203 |	Actually make
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| IOT203 |	XA DIY
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| IOT203 |	Security system
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,663	| IOT203 |	So this way ATT is moving deeper into the DIY mark
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,455	| IOT203 |	Pick up some of that Mark
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,759	| IOT203 |	Because basically
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,039	| IOT203 |	The security Market
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,343	| IOT203 |	Professional and has been stuck around 20%
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:49,855	| IOT203 |	Are monitored
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| IOT203 |	And
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,671	| IOT203 |	ATT camp
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,439	| IOT203 |	This growth
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:53,951	| IOT203 |	At the bottom
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,767	| IOT203 |	So two deals in that space
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,279	| IOT203 |	Worth
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,327	| IOT203 |	And now let's talk about iot
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,351	| IOT203 |	At 4
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,399	| IOT203 |	There've been some retrenchment
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| IOT203 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,703	| IOT203 |	Unexpected ones
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,519	| IOT203 |	Yes well one of them's unexpected
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,031	| IOT203 |	Because we missed it
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:13,663	| IOT203 |	So I'll confess that back in December Samsung said that they were closing their iot module business
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,711	| IOT203 |	Does the arctic module business and this
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,271	| IOT203 |	Surprised us mostly because
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT203 |	We saw a notice on the Arctic
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,831	| IOT203 |	Cloud website saying
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,855	| IOT203 |	Hey for shutting this down
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,391	| IOT203 |	What what happened
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:28,767	| IOT203 |	Luckily business Korea was on top of the situation because they're about the only ones who reported
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| IOT203 |	Yes
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,119	| IOT203 |	So basically in December Samsung said there
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,143	| IOT203 |	After 4 years
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,167	| IOT203 |	They're pulling the plug on Arctic
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:38,495	| IOT203 |	It employed slightly fewer than a hundred employees
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:39,775	| IOT203 |	Arctic wolf
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:42,079	| IOT203 |	This module and it was also a cloud platform
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,639	| IOT203 |	It makes sense
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| IOT203 |	That this happened
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:49,247	| IOT203 |	I had talked to people who said Arctic was kind of not
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,807	| IOT203 |	All that when it came to doing scaled out
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,343	| IOT203 |	Deployment it was good for
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,111	| IOT203 |	Prototyping butt
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:58,719	| IOT203 |	In Samsung also wanted to get all in on their SmartThings cloud
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,487	| IOT203 |	Or iot
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,023	| IOT203 |	So I think those two things
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,791	| IOT203 |	Probably
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:02,559	| IOT203 |	Tight end to end
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| IOT203 |	And surprisingly
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT203 |	Samsung's decision to
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,935	| IOT203 |	And this back in December at now
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,215	| IOT203 |	It's going to close as of
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,983	| IOT203 |	So it already closed
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,007	| IOT203 |	February 1st
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,799	| IOT203 |	You can no longer
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| IOT203 |	But it's not the only one
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,639	| IOT203 |	No it's not the only one
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,687	| IOT203 |	This comes as a bit of a shock as well
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:23,039	| IOT203 |	Google has an update on Android things that other platform that we don't talk about it too much
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:28,415	| IOT203 |	And that's probably cuz nobody really uses it and I think what they're saying is
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:32,255	| IOT203 |	Partners to create products
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:37,375	| IOT203 |	Android things the successes if only come in smart speakers and smart displays
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,911	| IOT203 |	So as of this week
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:42,239	| IOT203 |	They say they are refocusing enjoy things as a platform
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,031	| IOT203 |	Just those two devices
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:49,151	| IOT203 |	So you no longer want to be a widespread build all your IRT stuff on Android things and
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,455	| IOT203 |	Sissy putting this out in previous podcast
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:54,271	| IOT203 |	Android things was a little chunky
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:54,783	| IOT203 |	In terms of
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:17:00,159	| IOT203 |	Creating devices with a very thin footprint when it comes to software it just was to
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,695	| IOT203 |	Monkey could really make anything
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,743	| IOT203 |	Yes and you had to have
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,023	| IOT203 |	Way more memory
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,303	| IOT203 |	And way more process
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,071	| IOT203 |	Power that most like
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,375	| IOT203 |	Edge true sensors and true
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| IOT203 |	Anything running on MCU
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,727	| IOT203 |	Without a team is 1 gig of memory
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,775	| IOT203 |	It was up there I don't recall the exact words
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:21,919	| IOT203 |	Reset devices with small amounts
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,479	| IOT203 |	It was the bottom line is it
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| IOT203 |	Or is he
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,807	| IOT203 |	Which is not good
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,319	| IOT203 |	For you know
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:34,719	| IOT203 |	Right so of course Google still has an astounding in this announcement cloud
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:39,071	| IOT203 |	What do they really have for the small device
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,839	| IOT203 |	Market
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,887	| IOT203 |	Nothing yeah I think it's really
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:44,191	| IOT203 |	We're just going to give you the ability to build
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,751	| IOT203 |	Google home actions and routines and such
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,287	| IOT203 |	And maybe we'll see an acquisition
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| IOT203 |	I'll ponder that
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,383	| IOT203 |	All right let's go to some
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:52,895	| IOT203 |	Small
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,431	| IOT203 |	Arlo
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,735	| IOT203 |	Which is the publicly traded company
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:00,831	| IOT203 |	Netgear spun out for its Arlo security camera business they had really good
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,135	| IOT203 |	Q4 revenues probably everybody getting our local
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,719	| IOT203 |	They are expecting Revenue
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,231	| IOT203 |	Instafollow
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,535	| IOT203 |	19 +
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,815	| IOT203 |	That is unsub
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,583	| IOT203 |	Uprising
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,095	| IOT203 |	They
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,655	| IOT203 |	Reported Revenue in the fourth quarter of
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,191	| IOT203 |	Almost 130 million
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,471	| IOT203 |	So yay
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,287	| IOT203 |	And total 2018 Revenue was 472
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:21,823	| IOT203 |	But
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,639	| IOT203 |	They actually predict in 2019 they're going to make less than
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,431	| IOT203 |	Significantly less than
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,223	| IOT203 |	That almost a hundred million less than that
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,247	| IOT203 |	Or maybe just
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,295	| IOT203 |	Which is
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:38,207	| IOT203 |	And I think it speaks to the same thing that happened with GoPro and Fitbit and
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| IOT203 |	Everyone
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,279	| IOT203 |	The tries to get into the connected consumer Hardware Mar
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,559	| IOT203 |	It is hard
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,839	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| IOT203 |	I don't know what to say about that
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:45,887	| IOT203 |	Other than
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,215	| IOT203 |	Having a single device strategy
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,031	| IOT203 |	Is tough and Arlo's going to bring out new products but
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,055	| IOT203 |	It's still tough
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,359	| IOT203 |	I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| IOT203 |	All right
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,663	| IOT203 |	Apple Smartwatch news
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,455	| IOT203 |	Yes I better wearable
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:01,503	| IOT203 |	Which is this is an interesting Twist on wearables
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,295	| IOT203 |	Sony has something a baby
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:09,695	| IOT203 |	Actually a product I've had in Japan for quite some time but they just brought to the UK I have not heard of it until this week is
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,975	| IOT203 |	It's called the winner
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,487	| IOT203 |	Wrist wrap
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,279	| IOT203 |	Basically
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:17,887	| IOT203 |	You can get it with a watch face from Sony or you can just get the strap and attach it to
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,935	| IOT203 |	Your Rolex if you have on it's up to you
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:26,335	| IOT203 |	What is Stone is it's taken all the smarts from a smartwatch and put it into a module that goes on the band
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,431	| IOT203 |	Any watch as notifications Fitness tracking contact list
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,199	| IOT203 |	Payments
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:37,599	| IOT203 |	Very small OLED screen to show the incoming messages notifications they have an act
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:43,487	| IOT203 |	Actor model with a much larger screen regardless it's not something I look at all the time in the fact
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,767	| IOT203 |	Watch
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:47,071	| IOT203 |	Lastrap you're literally going to be looking at
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:50,911	| IOT203 |	Back of your wrist not the watch face for all these notifications
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,191	| IOT203 |	It's also not cheap
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,215	| IOT203 |	It's about
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,751	| IOT203 |	$50 US
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:55,775	| IOT203 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:59,615	| IOT203 |	GPS in the act in one heart rate sensor and someone
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,431	| IOT203 |	I don't know a price I don't see it really being
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:04,223	| IOT203 |	Widespread success
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,295	| IOT203 |	Watch out there if you've got that much money.
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,575	| IOT203 |	You're probably going to be using that right
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,135	| IOT203 |	Well yes but keep in mind
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:15,999	| IOT203 |	Android has about 80% of the worldwide smartphone market and therefore
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:22,143	| IOT203 |	20% or less have Apple devices which are required for the Apple watch so you're still a big pool of potential customers
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,215	| IOT203 |	But it doesn't matter I mean this is just way too much
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,519	| IOT203 |	Apple Smartwatch for Android
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,055	| IOT203 |	200 $300
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:35,199	| IOT203 |	It's interesting that they did not go with an Android Wear Google Wear OS watch the guy said let's try this
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| IOT203 |	Do they have one of the past
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,295	| IOT203 |	But it's been a couple years since it was updated I think four years now so
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,391	| IOT203 |	But maybe we'll learn something
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,695	| IOT203 |	I say that every year
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT203 |	By the way
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,023	| IOT203 |	Resume
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,303	| IOT203 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,351	| IOT203 |	So other news
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,631	| IOT203 |	Define a little bit for you
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,143	| IOT203 |	Lucy Foxx
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,423	| IOT203 |	They are
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,959	| IOT203 |	Low-power wide area
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:58,495	| IOT203 |	They're based
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,031	| IOT203 |	And
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,591	| IOT203 |	Basically this is not a lot of bandwidth
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,103	| IOT203 |	But
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,175	| IOT203 |	So tell me about the data
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:09,247	| IOT203 |	Really cheap you can bet these sensors and things and then
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,783	| IOT203 |	Kafka communication
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:14,879	| IOT203 |	And it's for like smoke detectors or parking
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,159	| IOT203 |	Sensors are all kinds
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,976	| IOT203 |	Well I've always been a little skeptical of it
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,000	| IOT203 |	Because they're
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,792	| IOT203 |	More like Laura is
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:22,816	| IOT203 |	What is more open
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,840	| IOT203 |	But sick foxes
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,608	| IOT203 |	Is all-purpose
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,376	| IOT203 |	But
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,144	| IOT203 |	This week
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:30,752	| IOT203 |	They basically said that on the client side they're making public their radios
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,800	| IOT203 |	This means anybody can
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,104	| IOT203 |	Develop and build sigfox radios
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,872	| IOT203 |	With the spec
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:38,432	| IOT203 |	If you want to make those radios talk back to
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,968	| IOT203 |	To the cloud you're going to have to pay
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,272	| IOT203 |	Server-side
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:42,784	| IOT203 |	Services
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| IOT203 |	That's worth
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT203 |	But
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,600	| IOT203 |	It's actually a
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,368	| IOT203 |	Good move
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,136	| IOT203 |	Because now
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,416	| IOT203 |	We can one see how popular
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,464	| IOT203 |	People decide they want
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:53,280	| IOT203 |	Embed this Orville radios for this into
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,584	| IOT203 |	You know this could broaden their market and make it a lot
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:22:00,192	| IOT203 |	Along with the radio spec to have an API
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:03,264	| IOT203 |	Matt will talk back to sigfox in the cloud
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:08,128	| IOT203 |	So that's another way that we can track how many developers actually using an API
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,920	| IOT203 |	So we can keep an eye on that
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,224	| IOT203 |	I think it's smart because they try to go It Alone
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,248	| IOT203 |	For so long
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,016	| IOT203 |	And
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,784	| IOT203 |	Benzo
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,344	| IOT203 |	Dietary they still are least
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:22,976	| IOT203 |	They're trying to Branch out because the only way they're going to probably expand against the competition is to open up a little bit more if not
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,744	| IOT203 |	Additionally in the future
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,840	| IOT203 |	And we are also seeing so with low-power wide-area
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,888	| IOT203 |	We're basically seeing
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:33,216	| IOT203 |	Laura on the unlicensed side we're seeing cellular nb-iot
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,544	| IOT203 |	And a little bit of cat M1 if you're in the
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| IOT203 |	Nikki West
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,360	| IOT203 |	And then a lot of the other companies
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,384	| IOT203 |	It started in the space
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,920	| IOT203 |	Fallen by the wayside
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| IOT203 |	So there was
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| IOT203 |	I can't even remember the name of
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,016	| IOT203 |	There are a couple other come
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,040	| IOT203 |	How do you spell boxes
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,552	| IOT203 |	Still around
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,088	| IOT203 |	And hopefully this
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,368	| IOT203 |	Guess this helps them
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,672	| IOT203 |	Guilin at the potential to
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,720	| IOT203 |	So there's all that
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,232	| IOT203 |	SNL
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:56,768	| IOT203 |	Talk about
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,536	| IOT203 |	Habitat
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| IOT203 |	Kevin yes
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,120	| IOT203 |	Some of our listeners have
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,400	| IOT203 |	Call us about habitat
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,704	| IOT203 |	Muslim love it
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,472	| IOT203 |	Quite frankly
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:11,872	| IOT203 |	And what habitat is the biggest draw for Habitat which is a smart home hub that has all the four major radios Bluetooth wife
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:13,152	| IOT203 |	Sicp in Z-Wave
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:19,552	| IOT203 |	The biggest draw is that it's all local all the data all the rules all the animations all happened on the
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:22,368	| IOT203 |	The device there's no Cloud involved from that aspect
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:28,768	| IOT203 |	And that helps you from a privacy standpoint that helps that your internet connection is down but your home Wi-Fi still up you haven't lost
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:31,584	| IOT203 |	Any functionality to your devices
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,864	| IOT203 |	I totally got that
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:37,984	| IOT203 |	However if there's ever been a product and all the products I've reviewed since 2003
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,288	| IOT203 |	Simultaneously love
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,592	| IOT203 |	And hate at the same time it is the habitat
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,384	| IOT203 |	Oh wow those are big words for
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,664	| IOT203 |	Kevin tissue usually
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,688	| IOT203 |	Kevin is the nicest
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:47,968	| IOT203 |	He's Fair
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,248	| IOT203 |	And he's also like
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,040	| IOT203 |	It may not be for me but it's for someone
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| IOT203 |	And actually
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:55,904	| IOT203 |	It's funny you say that because there is definitely a crowd I would
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,952	| IOT203 |	Heartily recommend the habitat
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,232	| IOT203 |	Elevation Hub 2
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,536	| IOT203 |	And there's a whole crowd that I would say do not
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,048	| IOT203 |	Touch this light
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:06,400	| IOT203 |	It reminds me let me go to the crowd that I don't recommend it for. Explain why
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:10,496	| IOT203 |	It reminded me all the setup process reminded me of
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,544	| IOT203 |	What it takes to get Linux running
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:18,944	| IOT203 |	Honor PC you got to get into the Cody got to get into Eternal you have to download drivers and things like that
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT203 |	Tweakin tweakin tweakin to it
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,784	| IOT203 |	And for a lot of people in the smartphone space
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:27,392	| IOT203 |	They don't want to do that and there are perfectly good products probably good hubs that
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:30,720	| IOT203 |	Make it very easy to add devices to set up
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,256	| IOT203 |	Automations in routine
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:36,352	| IOT203 |	How to connect multiple devices together into rooms in group and so on and so forth
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:40,192	| IOT203 |	And you have a nice pretty little app it just does everything for you
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,496	| IOT203 |	It's nice and easy to look at and use and so on so forth
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,288	| IOT203 |	Habitat is not bad
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:46,592	| IOT203 |	In fact I talked to the folks at habitat
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:49,152	| IOT203 |	Couple weeks back when discussing this
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:50,688	| IOT203 |	Product and I said
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:56,320	| IOT203 |	It seems to me like the your Hub is really like an if this then that on steroids and relaxing is very powerful
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,600	| IOT203 |	So that's a good thing
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,624	| IOT203 |	But it's not
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:01,952	| IOT203 |	It's not as user-friendly as some of the other options that are out there
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:08,096	| IOT203 |	And it doesn't seem to be for controlling devices and what I mean by that is there is no app for habit
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:11,424	| IOT203 |	Literally there is a small web server
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:14,752	| IOT203 |	Running locally on the device that you access

EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:22,176	| IOT203 |	That's what shows all your devices at 3 set everything up and so on
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:28,576	| IOT203 |	To get to controls we actually turn something on or off you have to create your own little dashboard switch is it took me awhile
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,112	| IOT203 |	I'll figure it out I'll just leave it at that
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:32,928	| IOT203 |	It's just not meant for the same purpose it is
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,976	| IOT203 |	Who hardly meant for automation
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:37,024	| IOT203 |	You just set it up and forget about it
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,328	| IOT203 |	An unexpected Works fantastic
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,888	| IOT203 |	It's great setting things up though is a challenge
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,936	| IOT203 |	I struggle sometimes I even had to
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,520	| IOT203 |	Try and install some device Handler tour drivers
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:53,920	| IOT203 |	Similar to if your SmartThings Hub user you may have seen drivers wear it with your building groovy that turn Java like it
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,688	| IOT203 |	Change the language
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,712	| IOT203 |	And that will
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,992	| IOT203 |	Get your device working
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:03,392	| IOT203 |	You know I struggle with that I even downloaded and and try to install when I got a ton of hers and I don't know why the good news is there's a hole
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,184	| IOT203 |	Big passion community
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,232	| IOT203 |	With habitat they have a lot of
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,280	| IOT203 |	Community Forum activity
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:15,424	| IOT203 |	The documentation is a little weak in my opinion than your little to give in a box and then told to go to the website to figure it out
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,984	| IOT203 |	You have to want to
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,008	| IOT203 |	Spend the time
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,544	| IOT203 |	To get rid of Isis
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,568	| IOT203 |	Discovered
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,336	| IOT203 |	Groot
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:27,712	| IOT203 |	Get your dashboard tiles if you want to do actual on off by touch screen and so on and you can add
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,992	| IOT203 |	Voice control with
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,552	| IOT203 |	Matinee and with Google that works fine
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:37,696	| IOT203 |	Again except for the crowd who probably either already has grown or outgrown the traditional easy hub
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:41,792	| IOT203 |	Or somebody plays with openhab or home automation and raspberry pies
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:47,424	| IOT203 |	If you want those people this is great it's a great products $99 no fee or anything like that
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:49,216	| IOT203 |	The bee breath of devices are
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:51,776	| IOT203 |	Square very good what you going to spend a lot of time
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,800	| IOT203 |	And if you want to take her
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:55,360	| IOT203 |	Do it to your heart's content this isn't device radio
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,176	| IOT203 |	That whole intersection of the DIY I just want to
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:00,224	| IOT203 |	Plug it in and have it work in
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,504	| IOT203 |	Set up automation
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,296	| IOT203 |	Macro icons in an app
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:08,416	| IOT203 |	I just can't recommend it for those folks as they're going to get frustrated even I was frustrated at times and I've
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:11,744	| IOT203 |	Set up a bunch of hot so that's where I stand on it it's
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:14,048	| IOT203 |	A great product for the right group of people
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,328	| IOT203 |	That's fair
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:15,840	| IOT203 |	I mean in nuts
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| IOT203 |	I try to be fair
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,680	| IOT203 |	I feel that you were totally fair
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,728	| IOT203 |	Cuz yes I was looking at some of this and I miss
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,776	| IOT203 |	I was excited about it but I also
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,824	| IOT203 |	I won't lie I was looking at that and I was like
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,360	| IOT203 |	I think I would have kept in it
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,640	| IOT203 |	How is Kevin review.
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:32,736	| IOT203 |	That's how I got this review you and I see yeah I think
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:36,064	| IOT203 |	Listen to you and I I mean having done this kind of stuff for years now
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:39,904	| IOT203 |	We could make this work for sure I've no doubt and I did make it work
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| IOT203 |	But it was
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:43,232	| IOT203 |	Not easy at Ransom challenges some errors
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:46,816	| IOT203 |	At one point you would send me a Samsung button for example of zigbee button
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:53,728	| IOT203 |	I use that to try and turn on my Cree bulb once I hooked up the button and had I had to tell the button what to do
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:56,544	| IOT203 |	Turn the light on
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,312	| IOT203 |	I did it I hit it
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,968	| IOT203 |	And I took a while to troubleshoot all that and it's just
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:07,040	| IOT203 |	We can figure this stuff out and a lot of our listeners here
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,064	| IOT203 |	Could figure it out
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,600	| IOT203 |	Petit mass-market
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,392	| IOT203 |	Didn't want to figure it out they just want us to work
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,672	| IOT203 |	I'm pretty sure some of our listeners
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,720	| IOT203 |	Great listeners
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,744	| IOT203 |	Yeah
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,792	| IOT203 |	And I also know that some of them
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,328	| IOT203 |	This Hub and they love it
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,864	| IOT203 |	Obvious reasons privacy
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,912	| IOT203 |	There's no redundancy you don't need anything
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:27,520	| IOT203 |	Always be running and they have total control over everything so I get it I really do
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:31,104	| IOT203 |	Well if you want more on this Kevin has postage
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:33,152	| IOT203 |	Review and we will link to it in the show.
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,688	| IOT203 |	So look
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,760	| IOT203 |	For that and speaking of privacy
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:39,552	| IOT203 |	This brings us to

EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,376	| IOT203 |	Let's go to this week's question
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,400	| IOT203 |	It is from
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:26,912	| IOT203 |	Chris
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,448	| IOT203 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:31,008	| IOT203 |	My name is Chris and I'm calling from Winnipeg Manitoba
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,800	| IOT203 |	Canada and my question relates
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:33,824	| IOT203 |	2 Smart TV
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,872	| IOT203 |	Home theater package
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,200	| IOT203 |	I know there's a lot of smart TVs these days
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:41,248	| IOT203 |	Some will have digital assistants
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,016	| IOT203 |	Various
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,296	| IOT203 |	Streaming services
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,088	| IOT203 |	We currently have no Smart Hub
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,368	| IOT203 |	Or smart devices
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,184	| IOT203 |	Except for our Chromecast device in our current
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:49,696	| IOT203 |	TV
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,488	| IOT203 |	We're planning a run over base
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,024	| IOT203 |	And I want the technology
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,560	| IOT203 |	But I also want
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,328	| IOT203 |	Security
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,864	| IOT203 |	I don't want a television with a
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,888	| IOT203 |	Camera built-in
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,448	| IOT203 |	I want to limit the amount of information sharing
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:02,496	| IOT203 |	And if I get a digital assistants
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,032	| IOT203 |	Is Google or madam
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,080	| IOT203 |	I want the ability to turn off
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:06,592	| IOT203 |	Microphone
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:07,616	| IOT203 |	Play Don Juan
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:08,640	| IOT203 |	Cordings occur
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:11,200	| IOT203 |	Do either of you have any recommendations
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:13,504	| IOT203 |	I love listening to The Show by the way
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,344	| IOT203 |	Okay
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:17,856	| IOT203 |	Chris
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,136	| IOT203 |	1
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| IOT203 |	I too would want to
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:21,440	| IOT203 |	Nice basement renovation
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,976	| IOT203 |	If I were living in Winnipeg
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| IOT203 |	Good Lord
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,024	| IOT203 |	That is
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,560	| IOT203 |	That is cold
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:29,120	| IOT203 |	This is a hard question
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,888	| IOT203 |	And I'm glad you asked
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,704	| IOT203 |	Because we learned a lot about Smart Television
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:35,520	| IOT203 |	I was aware that is hard to buy a brand new awesome
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,592	| IOT203 |	Big screen TV that is amazing
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,360	| IOT203 |	And not have it
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,408	| IOT203 |	Smart that's
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:41,920	| IOT203 |	Pretty much impossible
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,712	| IOT203 |	But we also learned
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:46,272	| IOT203 |	That there to privacy things you should worry about with you
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,552	| IOT203 |	Televisions
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,576	| IOT203 |	One is called
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,344	| IOT203 |	Automatic content
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,392	| IOT203 |	Ignition and basically
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,928	| IOT203 |	This is something that TV makers of
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,696	| IOT203 |	Putting in their TV
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:56,768	| IOT203 |	2015 and they basically try to identify
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:58,816	| IOT203 |	Every television show that you are watch
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,608	| IOT203 |	And send that data to the
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,632	| IOT203 |	TV maker so they
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:02,912	| IOT203 |	Target advertising
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,704	| IOT203 |	Sounds like
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:07,264	| IOT203 |	But two and this is what I think you're mostly talking
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| IOT203 |	Is
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,312	| IOT203 |	Microphone
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,872	| IOT203 |	What's a lot of these televisions have microphones on them
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,896	| IOT203 |	Where the remotes have mic
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,432	| IOT203 |	It's girly
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,456	| IOT203 |	It's hard to tell
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,736	| IOT203 |	If they do or not
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,528	| IOT203 |	So Kevin's going to talk about microphones
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:21,088	| IOT203 |	And then I'll talk about how to disable automatic
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:23,904	| IOT203 |	Microphones
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:28,000	| IOT203 |	Yeah we did some research I literally went to Samsung
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:31,840	| IOT203 |	TV site because Samsung is probably the premier brand right now it's
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:36,960	| IOT203 |	It's not the top one it's got to be in the top three for anybody's looking for a TV
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:39,264	| IOT203 |	Renovation like you're talking about Chris
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,032	| IOT203 |	And
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:45,920	| IOT203 |	They talked about Bixby and how it works a little bit but I had to go into the device manual
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:48,224	| IOT203 |	Before even learning how
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:48,992	| IOT203 |	Basalt
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,760	| IOT203 |	Shakes down
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:51,296	| IOT203 |	So some TVs
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:54,112	| IOT203 |	Have the remote with microphone built-in
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,392	| IOT203 |	Well actually all of them do
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,928	| IOT203 |	As far as I can tell from Samsung
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,952	| IOT203 |	What others
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,256	| IOT203 |	Also have I can always listening mode
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,816	| IOT203 |	Pink Samsung calls it to me like
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| IOT203 |	Voice
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,376	| IOT203 |	Wake up or something to that effect
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,680	| IOT203 |	You can disable that which is good
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:11,264	| IOT203 |	It's not clear though from the spec sheet if those TVs
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:17,408	| IOT203 |	As a microphone built into the TV or not even doesn't say that the remote has a macro
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:23,040	| IOT203 |	In aspects even though we know it does from looking at pictures of microphone in the end the mail how to use Bixby
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:23,808	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:27,136	| IOT203 |	What I would recommend is no matter what TV you think you're going to buy
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,416	| IOT203 |	Before you buy it
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT203 |	Look
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,976	| IOT203 |	Online for user manual
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,000	| IOT203 |	And see
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,792	| IOT203 |	If you can shut the microphone off
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,816	| IOT203 |	If you can
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,632	| IOT203 |	If there is a microphone exactly
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:41,728	| IOT203 |	The reason I say this because there is in the manual I think says hey if you want to use Bixby
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:48,128	| IOT203 |	Just press the button on the remote but on a newer TV it says that an additional and says you can change the setting to
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,408	| IOT203 |	Wake up
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,432	| IOT203 |	To be on or off
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,968	| IOT203 |	To me that's always listening
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:55,552	| IOT203 |	So you could use the button or not use the button for that particular set
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:33:00,160	| IOT203 |	So you got to make sure that there's a way to disable the always listening functionality
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:06,560	| IOT203 |	Quite honestly and it is so hard to tell I would not buy the TV and then try and figure this out I would try and figure this out and then by the T
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,352	| IOT203 |	TV that suits my needs and requirements
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,936	| IOT203 |	So basically we're telling you you have to read the manual
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,472	| IOT203 |	And you should probably
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:14,240	| IOT203 |	We also read
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,288	| IOT203 |	The Privacy policies to understand
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,824	| IOT203 |	What date of the TV is even
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:20,896	| IOT203 |	And again you should do this before you actually perch
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:22,688	| IOT203 |	And yes
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,456	| IOT203 |	This does suck
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:24,736	| IOT203 |	It's unfair
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:25,248	| IOT203 |	And I hate it
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:26,528	| IOT203 |	And
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,808	| IOT203 |	The other aspect of
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,856	| IOT203 |	This which is the automatic content recognition
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,648	| IOT203 |	Ignition which may or may not upset you
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,672	| IOT203 |	A link to an article
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:33,952	| IOT203 |	Talks about this
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,512	| IOT203 |	Consumer Reports but basically
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,816	| IOT203 |	A lot of the televisions that now have
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:40,352	| IOT203 |	Smart's built into it
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,888	| IOT203 |	You can turn that off
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:42,912	| IOT203 |	But it's different
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,704	| IOT203 |	And the settings were very good
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:45,984	| IOT203 |	Vitality
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:51,104	| IOT203 |	In some cases though there are certain TVs such as those that are built on the
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:51,872	| IOT203 |	Android platform
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:55,200	| IOT203 |	So like Sony televisions you actually can't opt out of
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:57,504	| IOT203 |	Google's privacy policies
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,016	| IOT203 |	When you
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,296	| IOT203 |	Turn that TV on
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,344	| IOT203 |	So you're going to be sharing data with
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,136	| IOT203 |	Situation and
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:09,280	| IOT203 |	Yeah that's concerning to mean it's not just Android TVs because I've had a Vizio TV for example
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:12,352	| IOT203 |	That if you can set the terms of service and those included
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,376	| IOT203 |	That means you
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,144	| IOT203 |	Sharing
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:17,472	| IOT203 |	Your viewing habits with potential advertisers
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:19,776	| IOT203 |	If you did not accept that the TV would not work
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:23,104	| IOT203 |	And the same thing with the Amazon Fire
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:26,688	| IOT203 |	TV's those won't work unless you
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,968	| IOT203 |	Looks like on okay
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:29,504	| IOT203 |	And you may be like well of course
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,528	| IOT203 |	Amazon television
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,296	| IOT203 |	But
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:34,624	| IOT203 |	Again the fact that you have to buy the device
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:36,160	| IOT203 |	To see this is really concern
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,952	| IOT203 |	To me and I will also say that video
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:44,096	| IOT203 |	A couple years ago actually got in trouble with the FTC because they did not make that data collection and then sharing very
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,120	| IOT203 |	Very clear
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:45,632	| IOT203 |	DC find them
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:49,216	| IOT203 |	What I will say here
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,240	| IOT203 |	And I don't like it
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,520	| IOT203 |	Is Whit television
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,312	| IOT203 |	You got to do a lot of research
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,080	| IOT203 |	Before you buy
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:57,152	| IOT203 |	And once you buy you may actually get caught off guard
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:57,920	| IOT203 |	Bye
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,200	| IOT203 |	The terms of service
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,224	| IOT203 |	They may not be in the mail
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,760	| IOT203 |	He may not be able to see it there
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:04,832	| IOT203 |	Kevin and I think that in your spec sheet
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,112	| IOT203 |	You should probably say if you have a mic
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:09,696	| IOT203 |	I think that's probably good for all connected devices going for
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:16,608	| IOT203 |	And the same goes for cameras and Chris brought that up and I haven't seen too many TVs that have cameras are out there I think that
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,376	| IOT203 |	Easy to avoid
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,424	| IOT203 |	So I would call on manufacturers to
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,960	| IOT203 |	City that I would call and Regulators to start me
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:22,752	| IOT203 |	That those words
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:23,264	| IOT203 |	Things Are
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:24,544	| IOT203 |	Very explicit
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:25,824	| IOT203 |	You buy something
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:27,360	| IOT203 |	And cut it around out here
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:27,872	| IOT203 |	Your question
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,664	| IOT203 |	If you buy a TV and
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:31,456	| IOT203 |	Can you read all this in this research and
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:31,968	| IOT203 |	You feel like you're sick
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,528	| IOT203 |	Then I would say if you have a Google home
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,296	| IOT203 |	Or
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,320	| IOT203 |	Amazon device
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,600	| IOT203 |	Those all have
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,112	| IOT203 |	Have the ability to
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,648	| IOT203 |	Manually shut off
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,720	| IOT203 |	Again I think
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:45,536	| IOT203 |	If you want to voice control your television
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,816	| IOT203 |	You're kind of stuck
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,096	| IOT203 |	Sharing a lot of data that
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,120	| IOT203 |	That you may not want to share
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:49,888	| IOT203 |	And that's unfortunate
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,168	| IOT203 |	Cuz it is kind of
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,472	| IOT203 |	Matinee turn on Netflix
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:54,752	| IOT203 |	Haji
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:55,776	| IOT203 |	Turn on
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,336	| IOT203 |	YouTube TV
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,360	| IOT203 |	Turn on YouTube TV
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:02,176	| IOT203 |	So with convenience comes apparently a loss of privacy
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:07,552	| IOT203 |	And what's even worse is that loss of privacy may not be explicit
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,112	| IOT203 |	So sorry for the bad news there
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,416	| IOT203 |	And the long research project
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:13,184	| IOT203 |	Ahead of you
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,232	| IOT203 |	Good luck with your basement

EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,480	| IOT203 |	This week
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:37,760	| IOT203 |	Louis LaTour
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,272	| IOT203 |	Who is the
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,576	| IOT203 |	CEO of greenwave
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,368	| IOT203 |	And we are going to be talking about
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,648	| IOT203 |	The risc V
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,416	| IOT203 |	Architecture
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:48,256	| IOT203 |	Superchips which sounds super nerdy but we're talking about how it can really improve
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,024	| IOT203 |	Battery life
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,560	| IOT203 |	For The Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:57,728	| IOT203 |	Everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:58,240	| IOT203 |	Urban X
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:05,152	| IOT203 |	It is an accelerator for startups reimagining the city life and I have one of the participants in the urban Expo
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,944	| IOT203 |	Program here to talk to us today
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:09,504	| IOT203 |	Meet seraphim who is the CEO
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,016	| IOT203 |	Of Newman
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:14,112	| IOT203 |	So why don't we get started by having you tell me a little bit about what numina
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:21,536	| IOT203 |	What is a data utility for City what that really means is we make a sensor that sounds delightful
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:24,608	| IOT203 |	And measures all different modes of traffic and streets
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,936	| IOT203 |	The where traditionally bunnies have only looked at car traffic
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:29,728	| IOT203 |	We actually attack
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:36,128	| IOT203 |	Graphtreon bicycle scooters wheelchairs by the trash can you name it even among the hickey alert
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,408	| IOT203 |	Traffic we differentiate
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:39,456	| IOT203 |	Cars and buses from track
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,224	| IOT203 |	And other types
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:40,992	| IOT203 |	Vehicle
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:47,392	| IOT203 |	In a completely privacy persuade cuz I are main differentiator from other State traffic cameras
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:51,488	| IOT203 |	We're really focused on providing intelligence without surveillance
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,768	| IOT203 |	And this intelligence
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:53,536	| IOT203 |	Empowered
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,072	| IOT203 |	Interactive design places
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,608	| IOT203 |	Not just for cars but for
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:59,680	| IOT203 |	Do you have a big vision for the future of cities
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:01,216	| IOT203 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:02,240	| IOT203 |	We Are Young
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,520	| IOT203 |	Especially in the United
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:09,920	| IOT203 |	State cities being kind of grades of drinks for cars and what's really exciting to me is
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:14,016	| IOT203 |	Thinking about all the ways that we can use our public and shared
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:20,160	| IOT203 |	When we don't have to allocate so much space to cars when either cars are shared or
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:22,464	| IOT203 |	Or cities are just
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:28,864	| IOT203 |	Do things prioritize other modes of travel and that's what you meant it. We provide data around all the things
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:31,168	| IOT203 |	Newton Street so that we can design our street
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:37,568	| IOT203 |	To equitably accommodate not just cars but everything else then maybe that in the future is real
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:39,616	| IOT203 |	Watch that automatically pick up your trash
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:42,688	| IOT203 |	Shore dancing green face instead of mint
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,992	| IOT203 |	You guys were the first cohort
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,784	| IOT203 |	Of the urban X Program
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,808	| IOT203 |	What did you get out of it
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:51,136	| IOT203 |	Applying to or joining Urban
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:51,904	| IOT203 |	We had
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:56,000	| IOT203 |	A prototype that was really Frankenstein together
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,024	| IOT203 |	It was.
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:39:00,096	| IOT203 |	Playpen D cell batteries and a lot of special part
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:05,984	| IOT203 |	We were excited about urbanaxes because it gave us access to BMW engineer
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:11,872	| IOT203 |	You actually help us design our first design for manufacture and that first version of our sensor
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:18,272	| IOT203 |	We did manufacturer and deploy in for City we also broke that version a hundred different ways
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:24,416	| IOT203 |	And now we have our Gen 2 Center will be live in about a dozen community
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,208	| IOT203 |	Quitter and Wild
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:28,512	| IOT203 |	It's a bit more refined now
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,048	| IOT203 |	We actually still
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:35,680	| IOT203 |	Use a lot of the same design principles and the same form factor that are organized
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,448	| IOT203 |	Designer

EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,264	| IOT203 |	Excellent so weird
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:41,824	| IOT203 |	People go to find out more about urbanex
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:43,104	| IOT203 |	Or
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:49,504	| IOT203 |	If you're interested in urban axes amazing accelerator you can apply now at Urban
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,784	| IOT203 |	I've been asked.

EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,128	| IOT203 |	And today's guest
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:17,152	| IOT203 |	What is Louis
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:17,664	| IOT203 |	Leo Tire
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:20,736	| IOT203 |	Who is the CEO of Green Wave technology
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,784	| IOT203 |	Hello how are you
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,576	| IOT203 |	Good morning I will thank you
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:29,184	| IOT203 |	Awesome alright so I promised our listeners that we would be talking about
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:30,976	| IOT203 |	Chip's my favorite
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:32,512	| IOT203 |	And you guys are building
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,072	| IOT203 |	Processor for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:35,840	| IOT203 |	That uses
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,888	| IOT203 |	Risc V Technologies
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,424	| IOT203 |	So let's start
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:42,496	| IOT203 |	By telling them a little bit about your startup
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,776	| IOT203 |	And what you're trying to do
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:48,640	| IOT203 |	This is what we call a coyote application processor
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:51,968	| IOT203 |	Application processor a processor
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,504	| IOT203 |	Not specialized bikes
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:57,088	| IOT203 |	Shooting to do very well certain application
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,880	| IOT203 |	It's about to come to an understanding
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:04,000	| IOT203 |	Typically it's about analyzing image down vibration but also biological
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,536	| IOT203 |	And we do that
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:07,328	| IOT203 |	Is an extreme energy efficient
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:14,240	| IOT203 |	What we are looking after our use cases that works on the battery for yours
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:17,056	| IOT203 |	Got it so something they can take it in
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:18,592	| IOT203 |	It sounds like both analog
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,360	| IOT203 |	And digital
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,640	| IOT203 |	And process them
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,432	| IOT203 |	With low battery
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,224	| IOT203 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,552	| IOT203 |	We have no power sensors or small processors
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,600	| IOT203 |	You stick it on the wall and you forget it for you
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:31,648	| IOT203 |	I like it I love forgetting about
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:32,672	| IOT203 |	I hate when they
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,720	| IOT203 |	Me for battery changes
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,488	| IOT203 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:36,256	| IOT203 |	So
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,536	| IOT203 |	Let's talk about why
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:38,816	| IOT203 |	You guys turned
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,608	| IOT203 |	But before you do that
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:41,632	| IOT203 |	I got ahead of myself
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:45,216	| IOT203 |	We should talk about what the heck risk V is for anybody out there
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:47,008	| IOT203 |	What
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:49,312	| IOT203 |	Time taken to know about arm
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,592	| IOT203 |	Talk to us about what
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:51,104	| IOT203 |	Spiders
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,271	| IOT203 |	Where in Santo died
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:02,367	| IOT203 |	Dolese sporty forty years ago in Brooklyn and the same guy
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:04,671	| IOT203 |	Who invented that's what years ago
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:09,535	| IOT203 |	Revisit to the risk architecture
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:19,263	| IOT203 |	Picture of cross
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:23,359	| IOT203 |	Yours and came out with what we put on instruction set
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,895	| IOT203 |	Hockey pictures
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:26,431	| IOT203 |	The construction that
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,967	| IOT203 |	You used to program
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:36,415	| IOT203 |	Instead of making
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:38,719	| IOT203 |	The decider together with Becca University
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:40,767	| IOT203 |	To make it available for free
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,815	| IOT203 |	How to take over world
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:48,959	| IOT203 |	So they made it available launch Foundation
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:49,983	| IOT203 |	Which missions
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,263	| IOT203 |	How do you make the chicken
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:54,591	| IOT203 |	And I must say that
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,871	| IOT203 |	These four years ago
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:58,431	| IOT203 |	This has to momentum engine.
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:02,271	| IOT203 |	I'm to be Frank's for years ago when I was teaching
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:04,575	| IOT203 |	Mira's five bass processor
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,623	| IOT203 |	60% of the time I was
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,647	| IOT203 |	Pronoun
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:09,695	| IOT203 |	Not anymore everybody's list
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:13,279	| IOT203 |	Let's go to the idea of
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:15,327	| IOT203 |	Why an end consumer should
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:17,119	| IOT203 |	So I obviously
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:19,423	| IOT203 |	Like oh my gosh nerdout on Newmarket
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,727	| IOT203 |	Most people are going to think
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:24,543	| IOT203 |	Man you know I don't need to know this
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:25,311	| IOT203 |	How does this benefit
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:29,919	| IOT203 |	Want to get some pool.
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:32,223	| IOT203 |	Country music
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:33,503	| IOT203 |	Logos of the
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:38,367	| IOT203 |	Bands that you wear can be a watch or not to watch that Will analyze your movements
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:40,671	| IOT203 |	Analyze your biological signal
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:45,535	| IOT203 |	Application that is well-known
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:48,095	| IOT203 |	You can use iron processor today
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,399	| IOT203 |	She wants to really analyze those
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:52,191	| IOT203 |	And if you have a cheap solution
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:56,031	| IOT203 |	Today is the only thing that that band will be able to do is analyze your
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,055	| IOT203 |	But nothing else
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:59,359	| IOT203 |	So if you have the stuff
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,895	| IOT203 |	DU Battery Life
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:01,663	| IOT203 |	Ouija one day
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:04,991	| IOT203 |	You sure use a processor that use hydro energy
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:08,831	| IOT203 |	Battery life we move from one day
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:12,415	| IOT203 |	On this has value for the consumer
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,951	| IOT203 |	That's one example
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:17,023	| IOT203 |	Docker example
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,047	| IOT203 |	More of
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:21,631	| IOT203 |	Industrial / infrastructure business
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:22,911	| IOT203 |	Smoke consumer
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:27,775	| IOT203 |	So I can give you an example that receive
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:29,055	| IOT203 |	Richest people accounting
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:32,383	| IOT203 |	Sensors in a meeting room
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:34,175	| IOT203 |	I'm counting people
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:34,687	| IOT203 |	Every minutes
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:38,015	| IOT203 |	For five years or for the duration of the leaves of the building
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,807	| IOT203 |	It has a lot of value
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:44,671	| IOT203 |	A company in order to understand how they're building out use interrupt United so you can see
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,999	| IOT203 |	Alright so now we have an instruction set
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:50,047	| IOT203 |	I think what's important here is
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:52,351	| IOT203 |	Risc V isn't just
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:52,863	| IOT203 |	For the iot
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:55,679	| IOT203 |	As an instruction set why would you use something
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,775	| IOT203 |	So why would someone choose the least five
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,079	| IOT203 |	Designer process
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:07,199	| IOT203 |	You can trust me because there are as many answers company or research T-Mobile
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:09,503	| IOT203 |	You should talk to people all over the world
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:11,551	| IOT203 |	Primer in China but not only
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:14,623	| IOT203 |	People who say well if I receive a respite I don't have to
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,647	| IOT203 |	To pay anything to anyone
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,463	| IOT203 |	Yes or no
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,023	| IOT203 |	True that it's free so you can use it
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,815	| IOT203 |	You have one you have
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:25,375	| IOT203 |	Correspondence manual
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,911	| IOT203 |	And you still have to develop
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,191	| IOT203 |	The processor.
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:28,959	| IOT203 |	He's able
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:29,983	| IOT203 |	Interpret
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,007	| IOT203 |	Gold instruction
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:37,407	| IOT203 |	Socio there companies that are a licensee designing but processor cores on license

EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:42,015	| IOT203 |	I am not buying one of those so I don't know how much
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,319	| IOT203 |	But I would think that you have to
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:46,367	| IOT203 |	Play what we put on the wall
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:49,183	| IOT203 |	I don't know you so it's a one-time payment
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:51,999	| IOT203 |	I done you can use the processor with nothing royalty
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:56,351	| IOT203 |	The cost of your product
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:58,399	| IOT203 |	On the other hand you have also a lot of
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:02,239	| IOT203 |	This is where it gets interesting
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:04,287	| IOT203 |	That's Takis instructions
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:06,335	| IOT203 |	And innovate around
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:09,663	| IOT203 |	In the rocking themselves
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,943	| IOT203 |	Process of course
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:12,991	| IOT203 |	The one that we are using
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,783	| IOT203 |	He's coming from a project called pulp
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,319	| IOT203 |	Ulp
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:22,463	| IOT203 |	From xinjiang University
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:23,999	| IOT203 |	But you look more interesting
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,303	| IOT203 |	You can read it you know that I can discern that
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:30,911	| IOT203 |	Enrich
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:33,471	| IOT203 |	The sense that we have a.
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,239	| IOT203 |	Instructions
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:38,335	| IOT203 |	That's all very well chune for the type of algorism
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:40,639	| IOT203 |	That we want to run well on my machine
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:42,431	| IOT203 |	Remarkable
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,479	| IOT203 |	TV Kodi on benchmarks that
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,247	| IOT203 |	We have
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:48,319	| IOT203 |	The number of cycles of the number of instruction that you need
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:52,927	| IOT203 |	Full-time lights
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:54,463	| IOT203 |	Then watch it would be
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:56,767	| IOT203 |	Veggie curry spice processor
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:47:00,095	| IOT203 |	I need to be the same Suite to full-time better
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:02,143	| IOT203 |	Done what you could be on an arm processor
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,447	| IOT203 |	Translate directly
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:06,751	| IOT203 |	Almost directly into energy saving
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:07,519	| IOT203 |	Because you have
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:10,847	| IOT203 |	List Cycles on 2-cycle is Reggie Watts consume energy
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:12,127	| IOT203 |	So do in summer
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:14,431	| IOT203 |	People are getting off service 5
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:17,503	| IOT203 |	I don't think this is the most interesting
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,623	| IOT203 |	That's even better if you chant you know that was all the freedom that you
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,671	| IOT203 |	Annual notes obliging.
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:26,719	| IOT203 |	Licensee mobile to East batch
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:27,487	| IOT203 |	To the community
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:31,839	| IOT203 |	You're cool. You can decide to do it or you can keep it to yourself
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:35,167	| IOT203 |	Got it so if I wanted to do something like that with arm I would have
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:36,959	| IOT203 |	Very expensive art
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:37,471	| IOT203 |	Protect your license
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,519	| IOT203 |	And to differentiate
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:41,311	| IOT203 |	I couldn't do it at all with X8
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,639	| IOT203 |	Yes. What's respite
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:45,919	| IOT203 |	Rock
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:48,223	| IOT203 |	Use the Lost Community everybody
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:50,527	| IOT203 |	Because you could have started
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:57,951	| IOT203 |	Teriyaki pictures that you would go and license from the usual intellectual property
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:47:58,975	| IOT203 |	Cheap flights from seoul
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:01,279	| IOT203 |	The synopsis for the Cadence of the world
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,047	| IOT203 |	But she
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:05,119	| IOT203 |	You don't benefit from the huge community
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:10,495	| IOT203 |	To use an architecture that that's a lost community
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:11,775	| IOT203 |	What is that is that
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:16,383	| IOT203 |	The tools that are used by your last Community are always much better and much
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:17,919	| IOT203 |	And they all future-proof
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:19,967	| IOT203 |	So that's generally so
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:20,735	| IOT203 |	So people are
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:21,759	| IOT203 |	Cheap
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:23,295	| IOT203 |	No one ever says no to
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:23,807	| IOT203 |	Jeffrey
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:26,623	| IOT203 |	And then there's the possibility for innovation
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:27,647	| IOT203 |	The huge community
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:28,927	| IOT203 |	No
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:31,487	| IOT203 |	Why are people turning to risc V
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:31,999	| IOT203 |	For iot
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:33,535	| IOT203 |	By the way I think
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:38,911	| IOT203 |	Most of the application.
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:40,191	| IOT203 |	Louis V
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:41,215	| IOT203 |	I'll let you know you
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:43,519	| IOT203 |	I'm not saying that we are alone
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:47,359	| IOT203 |	But the reason is that in most cases today
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:51,455	| IOT203 |	R u t means microcontroller processor.
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:53,759	| IOT203 |	And microcontroller
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:57,343	| IOT203 |	So you don't want to
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:49:00,415	| IOT203 |	Frankly you find watch NGO
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:04,511	| IOT203 |	It's also for people that are selling Arm based processor
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:06,559	| IOT203 |	In a very large number
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,839	| IOT203 |	It's a very competitive
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:11,423	| IOT203 |	Business on you get extremely good pricing from cheap vendors
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:20,895	| IOT203 |	Only if you want to innovate so if you want to have architecture
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:22,687	| IOT203 |	To do very well symptoms
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:27,807	| IOT203 |	Okay if you want just to do a me to processor
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:32,415	| IOT203 |	Keke coutee a microcontroller in iot would cost you anything between
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:33,695	| IOT203 |	Gucci 50 Cent
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:38,303	| IOT203 |	Saving you a couple of Sons of licensees node
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:40,863	| IOT203 |	The same time East Rogers
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:42,655	| IOT203 |	You are doing your processor that use
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:47,263	| IOT203 |	50 timeline
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:48,799	| IOT203 |	Ganja benefits
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:52,383	| IOT203 |	I want to be able to innovate and therefore you have to
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:54,687	| IOT203 |	So it's only
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:55,967	| IOT203 |	4 power consumption
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:57,759	| IOT203 |	He's not for crusty iot
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:59,295	| IOT203 |	Sensors based on your processor
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:03,391	| IOT203 |	Will be more expensive but they will also have a longer battery
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:04,159	| IOT203 |	Flight status the trade-offs
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:05,951	| IOT203 |	Companies who choose that will make
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:06,719	| IOT203 |	Yes
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:08,767	| IOT203 |	That's to put season in Prospect
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:11,583	| IOT203 |	Let's assume that I sell twice as much as
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:14,399	| IOT203 |	Michael conforto
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:18,239	| IOT203 |	I have one customer that has a radio sensor
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:19,007	| IOT203 |	But it has
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:21,311	| IOT203 |	Uses 10 battery
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:24,127	| IOT203 |	Honey we moved from 10 batteries
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:24,895	| IOT203 |	1 battery
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:28,223	| IOT203 |	So in that case there is ample room for the
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:29,759	| IOT203 |	The customer to reduce his cost
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:33,855	| IOT203 |	Sure not just reduce your costs but
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:37,695	| IOT203 |	You can probably actually reduce the entire size of your board that's your product get smaller
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:38,463	| IOT203 |	Yay
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:38,975	| IOT203 |	As well
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:43,583	| IOT203 |	So let's talk about complexities here because
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:46,143	| IOT203 |	I feel like when we start talking about newsha Park
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:49,215	| IOT203 |	People are like they get very excited
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:51,519	| IOT203 |	We're like oh my gosh this could change the world
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:52,287	| IOT203 |	But then a lot of time
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:54,079	| IOT203 |	We don't see adoption
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:56,383	| IOT203 |	In this happened you know I remember this
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:58,943	| IOT203 |	Saint Cloud Computing I feel like we're kind of at that moment
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:51:01,503	| IOT203 |	Where everyone's like oh my God new architectures for AI
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:04,575	| IOT203 |	So what is it take to have a new architecture
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:06,367	| IOT203 |	Adopted by the world
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:07,391	| IOT203 |	At Large
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:08,159	| IOT203 |	Do you even need that
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:15,071	| IOT203 |	Broadly in the cop shooting scene there is a new architectural that she's adopted every time you're so
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:16,095	| IOT203 |	You're right it's very difficult
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:18,655	| IOT203 |	Very difficult and people hate
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:19,679	| IOT203 |	Uc's
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:24,031	| IOT203 |	Primarily because of what I said before primarily because of the tools
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:24,799	| IOT203 |	The tools have
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:25,823	| IOT203 |	Expedia
EDL	00:51:27,103	00:51:28,127	| IOT203 |	Because a lot of
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:32,223	| IOT203 |	People use that and you need something you need a really really strong case
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:35,039	| IOT203 |	Greek architecture
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:36,319	| IOT203 |	For those days
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:37,599	| IOT203 |	New architecture
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:39,391	| IOT203 |	Significant
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:41,695	| IOT203 |	Today Ambush movie
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:43,743	| IOT203 |	20 defunct proposal in the world
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:46,303	| IOT203 |	Maybe one maybe
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:49,887	| IOT203 |	What would make it the last one I think that made it was gpus
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:51,679	| IOT203 |	But you can use all your
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:54,239	| IOT203 |	So why would people want
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:56,799	| IOT203 |	2 greens Market
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:58,079	| IOT203 |	Is when they are
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:51:59,103	| IOT203 |	Fundamentally
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:00,383	| IOT203 |	Algorism because
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:00,895	| IOT203 |	This is what you
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:05,503	| IOT203 |	Weather in Beijing now
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:12,159	| IOT203 |	Performance and increasing income of power consumption
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:14,463	| IOT203 |	At some points are given architecture how to sleep
EDL	00:52:14,975	00:52:17,279	| IOT203 |	Dress you can get off as a stopped up we have
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:19,583	| IOT203 |	Take you under the council's decision.
EDL	00:52:20,607	00:52:21,375	| IOT203 |	Something you
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:23,935	| IOT203 |	No the same
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:27,519	| IOT203 |	AI
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:29,055	| IOT203 |	Forgetting about iot
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:32,639	| IOT203 |	We are very much classy guy so we are not
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:34,175	| IOT203 |	Trying to reinvent the wheel
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:36,223	| IOT203 |	We are statue in the number of
EDL	00:52:36,223	00:52:37,247	| IOT203 |	Architectural
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:39,295	| IOT203 |	Very well-known
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:40,319	| IOT203 |	The programmer
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:42,367	| IOT203 |	We stores
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:44,415	| IOT203 |	Building blocks we are making a cheat that
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:48,255	| IOT203 |	To avoid that you architecture syndrome adults
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:51,839	| IOT203 |	So the underlying RK
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:52,607	| IOT203 |	Conjecture
EDL	00:52:52,607	00:52:53,887	| IOT203 |	The programmers don't actually have
EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:54,399	| IOT203 |	Have to care about it
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:56,191	| IOT203 |	No
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:57,727	| IOT203 |	To be French and we just

EDL	00:52:59,007	00:53:02,079	| IOT203 |	She's almost as if they were using a well-known research process
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:06,943	| IOT203 |	Would be respite that don't matter that teaches by using your programming
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:10,271	| IOT203 |	We provide them all the tools to hide
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:11,807	| IOT203 |	There is some subtlety behind you
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:16,415	| IOT203 |	Picture but we are hiding for the programmer of the fact that
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:17,951	| IOT203 |	Architecture
EDL	00:53:17,951	00:53:19,231	| IOT203 |	It's just like
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:19,999	| IOT203 |	Irregular process
EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:21,791	| IOT203 |	With risk 5
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:26,655	| IOT203 |	If we have seen some big companies in videos using it actually to design internally
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:27,935	| IOT203 |	A Management Corp
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:29,215	| IOT203 |	Western Digital
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:31,263	| IOT203 |	Which by the way is the sponsor of the
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:32,031	| IOT203 |	This week show
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:34,335	| IOT203 |	Is also using theirs and introduced a
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:38,943	| IOT203 |	Core for internal use basically these are big
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:41,503	| IOT203 |	But they're not really by the way
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:43,807	| IOT203 |	And Google's doing it okay
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:48,415	| IOT203 |	As a startup is this
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:50,463	| IOT203 |	An advantage for you does it matter does it
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:52,255	| IOT203 |	Promote respect
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:53,535	| IOT203 |	It helps a lot
EDL	00:53:53,535	00:53:56,351	| IOT203 |	And I have an outside one of those guys
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:58,143	| IOT203 |	Are using the same chords
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:54:02,751	| IOT203 |	Ulta beauty supplies that have verification needs
EDL	00:54:02,751	00:54:04,543	| IOT203 |	EPL 2 hours
EDL	00:54:04,543	00:54:07,103	| IOT203 |	Unda verified the same Growers hours
EDL	00:54:07,103	00:54:07,871	| IOT203 |	The song bugs
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:09,919	| IOT203 |	Updates
EDL	00:54:17,599	00:54:20,159	| IOT203 |	Just really the value in software you only add
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:22,463	| IOT203 |	What differentiate yourself
EDL	00:54:22,463	00:54:23,487	| IOT203 |	But you benefit
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:24,255	| IOT203 |	From the community
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:29,119	| IOT203 |	That comes from the fact that thousands of people are using the same
EDL	00:54:32,191	00:54:35,775	| IOT203 |	Glass companies adopting RS5 for the
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:38,335	| IOT203 |	Gdb embedded
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:41,151	| IOT203 |	The Santa Clause I'm not processing
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:42,943	| IOT203 |	That they offer football team
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:45,503	| IOT203 |	Straight
EDL	00:54:52,159	00:54:52,671	| IOT203 |	Adult
EDL	00:54:53,183	00:54:53,695	| IOT203 |	Respite
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:57,535	| IOT203 |	Just because B companies just because
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:55:00,607	| IOT203 |	They don't need to go to the purchasing department
EDL	00:55:00,607	00:55:01,375	| IOT203 |	Legal department
EDL	00:55:08,031	00:55:08,543	| IOT203 |	Music
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:13,919	| IOT203 |	I don't same way software engineer download the library open source and use it
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:15,455	| IOT203 |	Not asking anybody
EDL	00:55:16,223	00:55:18,015	| IOT203 |	I like that
EDL	00:55:19,039	00:55:21,855	| IOT203 |	Has no impact on industry from
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:24,927	| IOT203 |	Can just make the engineering you're welcome all products
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:27,231	| IOT203 |	Hey productive engineers
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:28,255	| IOT203 |	Lower costs
EDL	00:55:28,255	00:55:29,791	| IOT203 |	Yes
EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:30,303	| IOT203 |	All right
EDL	00:55:30,815	00:55:33,119	| IOT203 |	Will the week thank you so much for
