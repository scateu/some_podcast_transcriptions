EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,872	| IOT140 |	Any cool stuff

EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| IOT140 |	Home stuff
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:01,856	| IOT140 |	I did I really held back I should bought something that we had on our
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,648	| IOT140 |	Iot gift guide list
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:09,792	| IOT140 |	I really like that Sonos one review and it's so much that I bought my own which I got like $50 off
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:12,864	| IOT140 |	IDE
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,632	| IOT140 |	I did not get
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,400	| IOT140 |	Anyting
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:16,448	| IOT140 |	I just couldn't pull the trigger
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:18,496	| IOT140 |	I looked at all this stuff and I
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:22,080	| IOT140 |	I'm feeling a little bit of Gadget overload in my
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,896	| IOT140 |	I think it's a function of headache
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:28,480	| IOT140 |	Too many cables too many apps connecting I just kind of got tired
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,552	| IOT140 |	So I have more than most that I understand
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,600	| IOT140 |	Yeah I think I've hit a threshold
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,672	| IOT140 |	I didn't but you know
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:39,488	| IOT140 |	There was some great deals to be had so hopefully
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,768	| IOT140 |	You guys part 2
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,560	| IOT140 |	Or have you checked out our
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,072	| IOT140 |	Gift guide
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,632	| IOT140 |	All right
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| IOT140 |	So back to
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,680	| IOT140 |	About talking
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,472	| IOT140 |	Google home is actually getting
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,520	| IOT140 |	Really valuable skill
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:55,616	| IOT140 |	So like the Amazon Echo Google home has
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,408	| IOT140 |	They don't call them skills they
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,688	| IOT140 |	Call them
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,712	| IOT140 |	What do they call them
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,736	| IOT140 |	Oh that's
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,528	| IOT140 |	Kakashi's not schedules
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,416	| IOT140 |	Cannot remember
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,768	| IOT140 |	Soon with the Google home
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:15,072	| IOT140 |	Instead of saying Okay g
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| IOT140 |	Talk to
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,912	| IOT140 |	My LG Smart to turn on robot cleaner
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,448	| IOT140 |	To make your LG Vaca
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,984	| IOT140 |	Dinner start cleaning
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,264	| IOT140 |	Susan able to say
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| IOT140 |	Okay g
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,824	| IOT140 |	Start the robot vacuum
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,848	| IOT140 |	And she's going to know what
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:31,200	| IOT140 |	Which is awesome because the biggest challenge I currently have with my Amazon
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:31,968	| IOT140 |	Echo
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| IOT140 |	Is
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,016	| IOT140 |	Madam a
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,040	| IOT140 |	You know ask
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:39,136	| IOT140 |	June to preheat oven to 450 degrees
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,416	| IOT140 |	Theoretically should not be hard
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,184	| IOT140 |	But is
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,720	| IOT140 |	Kind of
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,512	| IOT140 |	Bright red
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:50,912	| IOT140 |	This is actually this is a key reason why my family doesn't buy into all the voice command stuff that like what did you name that late again
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:53,216	| IOT140 |	What's that called over there and I
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,800	| IOT140 |	I recognize their frustration so when Amazon actually added the
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,384	| IOT140 |	You know turn on lights to the localized groups
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,152	| IOT140 |	Not too long ago
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:04,736	| IOT140 |	Define on using an economic interests a matinee lights off
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,016	| IOT140 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| IOT140 |	They're using it now
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:11,392	| IOT140 |	So this is great because I don't want to remember names of companies and products are ninjas
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,184	| IOT140 |	The thing I just want the thing to work
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,464	| IOT140 |	Exactly
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,024	| IOT140 |	Google has released this
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,047	| IOT140 |	Which means that
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,583	| IOT140 |	Comedies just now we need to
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| IOT140 |	Create their New Boyz
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,167	| IOT140 |	This
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,935	| IOT140 |	If done well
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,215	| IOT140 |	Could
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| IOT140 |	Could
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,751	| IOT140 |	Make
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,519	| IOT140 |	Brands
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:31,103	| IOT140 |	Like give up the fact that we're going to buy all LG appliances in our home
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,639	| IOT140 |	And instead we could just have a crack
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,663	| IOT140 |	Optical interface with them
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| IOT140 |	This Is My Hope
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:39,551	| IOT140 |	Samsung's actually the first to implement this too by the way so if you got Samsung appliances
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,575	| IOT140 |	You might want to test us
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,879	| IOT140 |	Yeah apparently you can say things like pasta dishwasher
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,927	| IOT140 |	I don't know why anyone would do that
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:49,279	| IOT140 |	My favorite
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,583	| IOT140 |	How much time is left on my dryer
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:56,447	| IOT140 |	That's really useful cuz my dryer is upstairs and if I'm downstairs I have to walk
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:57,983	| IOT140 |	Are you guys
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,567	| IOT140 |	This is life is tough life is tough
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| IOT140 |	My life is hard
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,615	| IOT140 |	So
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,383	| IOT140 |	That is that
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,151	| IOT140 |	End
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,431	| IOT140 |	We also have
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,479	| IOT140 |	News on Amazon
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,527	| IOT140 |	Madame a skills notification
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,087	| IOT140 |	I'm a little leery this but Kevin you want to tell us what it is
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:15,903	| IOT140 |	I woke this is actually already in place but it's been
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,671	| IOT140 |	Expanded
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:19,487	| IOT140 |	I believe how should I don't know exactly when this year it was
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:25,375	| IOT140 |	Amazon said hey we got a developer preview of notifications for Alexa skills and as of
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,447	| IOT140 |	Today in fact they are expanding that to a wider audience
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,495	| IOT140 |	So this is going to be
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,567	| IOT140 |	A way for you to get personalized notifications in
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| IOT140 |	Save
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:40,735	| IOT140 |	Peekskill I don't know maybe we have an iot podcast skill and maybe we have a notification that your echo says
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,783	| IOT140 |	Does hate there's a new episode would you like to play it
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,831	| IOT140 |	Whenever we have a new episode so
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:51,231	| IOT140 |	This is what's coming or going to get hopefully not bombarded with notifications from are echoes but hopefully some valuable ones
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| IOT140 |	I would like the defaults
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,535	| IOT140 |	To be for me to set
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,815	| IOT140 |	Those up as opposed to having the
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:02,495	| IOT140 |	Will and that's fine I don't know exactly how it's going to be by default it's going to be opt-in for user
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,311	| IOT140 |	There's before Easter vacations
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,359	| IOT140 |	So if you don't help in you'll never even get
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,383	| IOT140 |	Notifications
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:12,479	| IOT140 |	And then even if you opt-in you can disable or suppress notifications
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:16,831	| IOT140 |	Hearing your app where you can put devices in Do Not Disturb mode so
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| IOT140 |	Alright then I feel a little bit.
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:21,439	| IOT140 |	My
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:26,047	| IOT140 |	Amazon Echo waking me up at 5 in the morning to tell me a new iot podcast is dropped
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,631	| IOT140 |	I actually have
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,399	| IOT140 |	How to make sure my things
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,423	| IOT140 |	Polish I have a Nifty
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,215	| IOT140 |	That
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,263	| IOT140 |	Turns one of my hue light bulbs red
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,055	| IOT140 |	So I can always walk downstairs and I'm like
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,103	| IOT140 |	The pietasters
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:44,223	| IOT140 |	Quick why is it red red is usually bad make it green
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,015	| IOT140 |	You know what the old school lights
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:46,527	| IOT140 |	And they don't do
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:50,623	| IOT140 |	I almost was one of my Black Friday almost
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:54,207	| IOT140 |	Your lights are on sale should I get the newer version and then I'm like
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,791	| IOT140 |	Stacy you spent sixty bucks on these bulbs you are not spending fifty bucks on Brady bulbs
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:04,703	| IOT140 |	Yeah if there's a notification I want I know this is unique to me and other people maybe live in a townhome Community like I do
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:08,543	| IOT140 |	The mailboxes are down the street obviously not at the houses
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:14,943	| IOT140 |	And I would like to know when the mail gets here and I would love a notification for that in fact I was actually thinking of creating a little dirty
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,223	| IOT140 |	Board system
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:19,295	| IOT140 |	That pings me when they open the mailbox
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,367	| IOT140 |	So the challenge actually that's actually very easily doable
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,159	| IOT140 |	Just a basic sensor
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,183	| IOT140 |	But exactly
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,975	| IOT140 |	The challenge is getting WiFi
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,487	| IOT140 |	Or connective
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,583	| IOT140 |	Yeah I was going to buy an NB iot Dev board
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,119	| IOT140 |	Okay yeah like I think particle has
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:42,847	| IOT140 |	Sorry I don't nobody else cares
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,407	| IOT140 |	Actually wanted to set this up like when I first got my smart thing
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,943	| IOT140 |	Original
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,503	| IOT140 |	13 and then I was like
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| IOT140 |	Is like wait a second
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:57,951	| IOT140 |	Maybe we should even talk about this maybe we should build it pat didn't sell it to the US Postal Service
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| IOT140 |	They got money
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,815	| IOT140 |	Maybe we should build a patent and sell it to Amazon
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,095	| IOT140 |	All right speaking
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,375	| IOT140 |	No not speaking of Amazon
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,143	| IOT140 |	We just spoke of her
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,655	| IOT140 |	Waze
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,983	| IOT140 |	Get a wake word and voice commands
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,775	| IOT140 |	You are surprised that
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,055	| IOT140 |	Waze is that still a thing
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,663	| IOT140 |	Will innocent is the implementation Waze is great
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,711	| IOT140 |	Don't get me wrong I know a lot of people use it
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:26,111	| IOT140 |	But after being purchased by Google and having some of the ways functionality integrate into Google Maps I kind of thought way
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,159	| IOT140 |	Please as a stand-alone was going away
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:35,071	| IOT140 |	Clearly that's not the case because so many people use the app Waze app and as of today you can on
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:38,399	| IOT140 |	On iOS or Android use the Waze app to say
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,959	| IOT140 |	I think I can say this because I don't think he'll say anything law
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,239	| IOT140 |	Okay Waze
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:45,311	| IOT140 |	And basically it's kind of like turn into a voices
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,591	| IOT140 |	Distance so now you can
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:50,431	| IOT140 |	Initiate your drive get a preview of the route you can send reports at a pitstop
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,991	| IOT140 |	All by voice which is
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:58,111	| IOT140 |	Awesome love it love it it's in the Waze app you going to look in settings
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,391	| IOT140 |	Sound and voice
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,927	| IOT140 |	Talk to Waze
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,487	| IOT140 |	And then tell the okay Waze function on
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,511	| IOT140 |	Wow
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:08,607	| IOT140 |	That's actually pretty cool cuz I don't use it now but now I'm like oh but I could
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:11,935	| IOT140 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,239	| IOT140 |	Voice
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,287	| IOT140 |	Let's move on to China
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| IOT140 |	Because
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,847	| IOT140 |	China has some news
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,359	| IOT140 |	Rather
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,407	| IOT140 |	Actually China itself has news
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,455	| IOT140 |	Is China itself
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,991	| IOT140 |	So
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| IOT140 |	Two things here
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,831	| IOT140 |	It has two interesting bits China is
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,367	| IOT140 |	Beginning to set standards for the smart
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| IOT140 |	This is the
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:36,767	| IOT140 |	Okay here we go the China Light Industry Council
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:40,351	| IOT140 |	And the China household Electric Appliance Research Institute
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,911	| IOT140 |	They have released a white paper
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,215	| IOT140 |	Tell you about nb-iot in the smart
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,543	| IOT140 |	And the cool thing to note there
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,591	| IOT140 |	Kevin Bob is that there
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:55,455	| IOT140 |	Choosing nb-iot over Wi-Fi which is interesting to me
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,015	| IOT140 |	They're saying we're going nb-iot because
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:03,903	| IOT140 |	Lower power consumption wide area coverage and low cause I all of which I agree with but I wonder
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,671	| IOT140 |	Why
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,439	| IOT140 |	Because
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,719	| IOT140 |	And I don't know is
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:10,047	| IOT140 |	Broadband penetration in China very low and therefore people don't have
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,095	| IOT140 |	Home netwerks and therefore WiFi
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:17,471	| IOT140 |	I don't want my appliances connected to a wide area network but maybe there's a good reason in China for this I do not know
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,263	| IOT140 |	It's a really good question
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,311	| IOT140 |	When I think about you
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,359	| IOT140 |	What's so I'm like having your stuff all connected
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:23,871	| IOT140 |	Dwyer is at work
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| IOT140 |	Easier to
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,199	| IOT140 |	Control4 in circle
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:31,807	| IOT140 |	And it's probably better for the manufacturer's because one of the big challenges with
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:34,111	| IOT140 |	Connected appliances today is most people don't actually connect
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:37,695	| IOT140 |	Connecting a device like a washing machine to Wi-Fi is actually for
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:40,511	| IOT140 |	Pretty hard for most consumers one because they're like
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| IOT140 |	What do I need to say
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,071	| IOT140 |	Which is totally legit
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| IOT140 |	Question
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:48,191	| IOT140 |	Even though you just answered it how much time is left on the dryer
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| IOT140 |	Or
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| IOT140 |	They've got it download the app on their phone and that's irritating
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,823	| IOT140 |	Coyote
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,335	| IOT140 |	Some of those
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,407	| IOT140 |	Especially if your vendor
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,527	| IOT140 |	Paid for the connection because they get a benefit of saying I owe this about the breaker hey you need a new filter
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| IOT140 |	Do you want to buy one now
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,087	| IOT140 |	So there are reasons
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:05,855	| IOT140 |	To do it but
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,879	| IOT140 |	It does feel like
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,647	| IOT140 |	That's ask
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:14,559	| IOT140 |	The surveillance thing which I don't disagree with your comment but I'd like to they really want to know when I'm frying Foods when I should be baking them I don't know
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,399	| IOT140 |	Think about things like controlling power
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| IOT140 |	Lake
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:23,519	| IOT140 |	What if I think about this is water such an issue in my neighborhood
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,567	| IOT140 |	Neighborwho like
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,359	| IOT140 |	Runs the sprinkler on off
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:31,199	| IOT140 |	Off days what if your ration power like we ration water and
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:34,015	| IOT140 |	Sprinkler system or sprinkler with telling you
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,063	| IOT140 |	Be like hahaha you can't run now
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:41,951	| IOT140 |	Ratted out by the water company
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:45,023	| IOT140 |	We live in a freaking desert and we're in a drought what are you doing
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,095	| IOT140 |	It's not just you
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:54,495	| IOT140 |	These guys are doing is they're trying to
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,031	| IOT140 |	Set standards
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| IOT140 |	In connectivity
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:57,823	| IOT140 |	Aren't we all
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,359	| IOT140 |	Did we do need it
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,663	| IOT140 |	But also in human machine interfaces
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,943	| IOT140 |	And the cloud computing
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,015	| IOT140 |	So from 2017 to 2019
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,063	| IOT140 |	They're going to
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,087	| IOT140 |	Create
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,415	| IOT140 |	Standards in organizations for smart Manufacturing
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:14,719	| IOT140 |	From 2019 to 2022
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:17,023	| IOT140 |	They're going to create the smart home use
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,535	| IOT140 |	Standards
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,351	| IOT140 |	And then from 2022 to 2025
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:23,679	| IOT140 |	They are going to plan for those things to eat
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,959	| IOT140 |	Actually used
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,471	| IOT140 |	In the smartphone
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,263	| IOT140 |	So I think this is a good
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| IOT140 |	Perspective like
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:31,103	| IOT140 |	Hey let's start with manufacturing let's get that
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,151	| IOT140 |	And then when children place then we'll set the stage
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,687	| IOT140 |	Smart home and they will actually like
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,479	| IOT140 |	All
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,271	| IOT140 |	That's not a crazy
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,623	| IOT140 |	That is
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,903	| IOT140 |	Hope that's only part of the
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,695	| IOT140 |	Here yes
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,463	| IOT140 |	Is there other companies
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| IOT140 |	In China
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:47,999	| IOT140 |	Where am I
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:52,863	| IOT140 |	They are working together on iot and Ai and by they I mean
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,143	| IOT140 |	Baidu and
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| IOT140 |	Xiaomi
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:13:01,311	| IOT140 |	Which if you're not familiar with Baidu is like I can search the Google of China quite honestly I think it has over 75%
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,359	| IOT140 |	Sent market share and search there in China
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:09,759	| IOT140 |	And Jeremy is one of the largest handset Sellers and manufacturers in China you can get some of those phones
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,783	| IOT140 |	Outside of China
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:17,183	| IOT140 |	We don't seem too much here in the u.s. not much detail here it's just an announcement that was made at
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,743	| IOT140 |	Xiaomi's first developer conference in Beijing
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:22,047	| IOT140 |	Just saying that these two are going to start working together
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| IOT140 |	Don't know what
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:23,839	| IOT140 |	Are we going to
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,607	| IOT140 |	Do yet
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:27,167	| IOT140 |	I know by do does have like a
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,703	| IOT140 |	Voice control
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:35,103	| IOT140 |	OS called do OS so that's available in some of those yummy Harbor you can buy today so maybe they're going to interview
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:38,687	| IOT140 |	Great that with whatever they can with Baidu I do not know what
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,967	| IOT140 |	It'll be interesting to watch
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,783	| IOT140 |	Because this is going to be the big coyote
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,343	| IOT140 |	AI movement that we've seen here
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,647	| IOT140 |	Over in China these two large companies
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:50,719	| IOT140 |	Yes and Shelby has a big Smart Home
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,535	| IOT140 |	Effort they make outlets and
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:54,559	| IOT140 |	Bose outlet
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,351	| IOT140 |	But I bet there
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:58,911	| IOT140 |	So
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,703	| IOT140 |	We're keeping an eye on
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:06,079	| IOT140 |	Yeah they work with Smart TVs smart watches and all that as well home appliances
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| IOT140 |	Baidu
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:14,783	| IOT140 |	Hopefully they will be better at it than Google by the way you guys the Google pixel buds that I got
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,551	| IOT140 |	My back
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| IOT140 |	Not a fan
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| IOT140 |	Too much
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:20,671	| IOT140 |	I didn't see anybody who was a fan unfortunately
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,719	| IOT140 |	I read a lot of battery is messed disappointing
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:23,999	| IOT140 |	Google
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| IOT140 |	Come on
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,279	| IOT140 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,655	| IOT140 |	To a really cool story about Sensor Fusion
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:33,727	| IOT140 |	PID of Sensor Fusion is you take data from
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:38,335	| IOT140 |	Multiple different sensors use algorithms and you get different data that's even better
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,871	| IOT140 |	Pretty cool concept
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,895	| IOT140 |	This is
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:43,199	| IOT140 |	Kind of like that I guess it's not technically sensor
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:49,343	| IOT140 |	Fusion it is using cell signal so the performance of your cellular network to detect
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,623	| IOT140 |	Weather so
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,671	| IOT140 |	This is a way to detect
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,743	| IOT140 |	Weather more accurately without buying
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,767	| IOT140 |	Moore weather station
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:04,191	| IOT140 |	I already have tons of sensors and radar and so on and so forth I thought this was an interesting Twist on
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,727	| IOT140 |	No leveraging
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:10,335	| IOT140 |	Traditional technology that we already have the cellular networks themselves to actually
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:16,735	| IOT140 |	Improve weather at a local level and it's climacell which is a boston-based weather company they raised 15 million Siri
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:21,087	| IOT140 |	Is a funding and again no sensors or anything else
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:27,487	| IOT140 |	Measure how weather is impacted by wireless communication networks therefore you can use that information to
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,767	| IOT140 |	Get more accurate
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,047	| IOT140 |	Detailed weather app
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,559	| IOT140 |	Look alive
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:34,399	| IOT140 |	Which is awesome and that reminds me if there's a company from Israel called
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,167	| IOT140 |	Breezometer
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| IOT140 |	I've heard about them a cup
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,959	| IOT140 |	X
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,263	| IOT140 |	They actually use a measure
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:45,663	| IOT140 |	Weather patterns and then they use existing weather sensors but they're using like crazy events climatological
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,431	| IOT140 |	Models
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:49,247	| IOT140 |	To predict whether locally without using more sensors
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,039	| IOT140 |	So this is actually
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| IOT140 |	Tide of a trend
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,623	| IOT140 |	I'm probably the smart one because
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,391	| IOT140 |	Maybe we
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:58,463	| IOT140 |	Have the data we need we just need different algorithms
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:04,863	| IOT140 |	To get to it as opposed to like spending more on sensors which are awesome but you don't require maintenance
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| IOT140 |	Car batteries
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| IOT140 |	Require all kinds of other things
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,679	| IOT140 |	So
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:10,751	| IOT140 |	It is there's a third piece to the weather aspect
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| IOT140 |	It's not covered by this company but
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:18,943	| IOT140 |	Crowdsourcing and that's how I get my weather actually through an app called dark sky and it's uncannily accurate because they will tell me
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,223	| IOT140 |	Rain is starting in 7 minutes
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:25,087	| IOT140 |	And I show people that when I'm out of an event or something like that or bundle up or get your umbrella out
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,367	| IOT140 |	Turn off
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,903	| IOT140 |	Almost to the minute
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,695	| IOT140 |	The rain starts falling it's really impressive
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:34,559	| IOT140 |	Yes I feel like there's a thermostat company that's actually working with
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,375	| IOT140 |	Either dark sky or another crowdsource weather app
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:40,703	| IOT140 |	Weather underground or somebody
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,495	| IOT140 |	Now only I could remember the thermos
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| IOT140 |	But it's actually a really cool story
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,103	| IOT140 |	So the pointier crowdsource
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,127	| IOT140 |	Sensor Fusion
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,407	| IOT140 |	And
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| IOT140 |	Algorithms
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| IOT140 |	West Ada
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,479	| IOT140 |	Making lives better
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,015	| IOT140 |	But maybe not as a
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| IOT140 |	Who's a good tagline
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:03,487	| IOT140 |	What is the inevitable decline of the hype phase of
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:03,999	| IOT140 |	Iot
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,303	| IOT140 |	I should have mentioned this
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,095	| IOT140 |	While back but a company called emberlight
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,655	| IOT140 |	They need smart sockets
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,191	| IOT140 |	So smart light sockets
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,215	| IOT140 |	And possibly
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,567	| IOT140 |	Stopped selling
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,591	| IOT140 |	They decided to shut
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,383	| IOT140 |	Don't they couldn't make it in the market
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,663	| IOT140 |	Which
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,943	| IOT140 |	Cool product but they were like
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,735	| IOT140 |	It's too competitive
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,247	| IOT140 |	Too much
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:31,135	| IOT140 |	We're shutting down so they have a cloud service so there light bulbs will continue to work for
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,159	| IOT140 |	Three to four months
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,671	| IOT140 |	And then
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,463	| IOT140 |	They won't
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:41,375	| IOT140 |	Yeah that's this gets back to what happened to every buying Harbor service and in this case
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:46,751	| IOT140 |	The service is going to stop working unless somebody wants to pick it up open source somehow or whatever
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,799	| IOT140 |	This was actually a Kickstarter
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,311	| IOT140 |	Project
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,359	| IOT140 |	It was and I would say
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:54,943	| IOT140 |	It's not if you're buying a hardware or a service product I think
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,479	| IOT140 |	You are buying a service product
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:01,087	| IOT140 |	You have to recognize that there is an inevitable service product
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,367	| IOT140 |	Associated with these things
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,159	| IOT140 |	Maybe we hadn't really
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,183	| IOT140 |	Recognize before
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,975	| IOT140 |	What I asked a question knowing the answer
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| IOT140 |	You're right
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,303	| IOT140 |	Absolutely but I asked it's the people think about it
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,375	| IOT140 |	If you guys I think
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,703	| IOT140 |	Yeah so also and other lighting
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,239	| IOT140 |	Stack lighting
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,007	| IOT140 |	Which
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:22,847	| IOT140 |	This is really disappointing and my friend Richard our friend Richard Gunther
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,663	| IOT140 |	Who's over at the home on podcast
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,967	| IOT140 |	And the digital media Zone actually reported
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,991	| IOT140 |	Is first so kudos to him
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,527	| IOT140 |	But Staffing
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:34,879	| IOT140 |	They've gotten out of the consumer lighting business they sold their bulbs
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,391	| IOT140 |	Looks like
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:39,231	| IOT140 |	They are now moving into the managed
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,023	| IOT140 |	Aging-in-place managed Beijing
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,791	| IOT140 |	Care
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,071	| IOT140 |	World where
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,607	| IOT140 |	It makes total sense
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:48,447	| IOT140 |	They have built algorithms that understand where people are in a room
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:52,543	| IOT140 |	Yeah based on sensors in the light bulbs and
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:57,151	| IOT140 |	Vacancy basically oh grandma got out of bed this morning awesome so it's less intrusive
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:00,223	| IOT140 |	Our people feel that is less intrusive because it's not a camera
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:03,807	| IOT140 |	So it makes a lot of sense but it's also an indication that
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| IOT140 |	My God don't feel typo
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:09,183	| IOT140 |	Well there's just so many players in that space right now
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:12,767	| IOT140 |	Honestly I mean not you could probably name 10 light bulb companies off top of your head
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:17,375	| IOT140 |	I'm sure really need that many I mean up competitions great I get that
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,167	| IOT140 |	But really do we need that many
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:25,055	| IOT140 |	Well in the challenge also with lightbulbs is these are when to replace your light bulbs
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:29,663	| IOT140 |	They're supposed to 11 if you got LEDs. Going to last for a long time and it's really hard like with me
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,735	| IOT140 |	Paying another fifty bucks for
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,807	| IOT140 |	Better Greens in my Philips Hue color lights I was like
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| IOT140 |	Not worth it
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:44,767	| IOT140 |	I would say there is a sengled is a lighting company that seems to have this that has they make bulbs that
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:50,399	| IOT140 |	Meatballs with different functionalities built-in domes that someone has speakers some of them have IR for security some of them have
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,191	| IOT140 |	Cameras it's very interesting
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,471	| IOT140 |	But they keep them pretty cheap
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:20:00,383	| IOT140 |	And what's interesting there is there model is that you will spend you know 12 to 15 bucks and a light bulb that's connected and
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,455	| IOT140 |	Then in a couple years you'll be like yeah you know what I need a different personality
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:03,967	| IOT140 |	Let's try this
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,015	| IOT140 |	I don't know I don't know
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:08,831	| IOT140 |	No I I don't think it will personally but
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| IOT140 |	Good luck
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:16,511	| IOT140 |	If it does seem happy for them I just don't see it I mean I'm a one-and-done shopping when it comes to light bulbs
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:18,559	| IOT140 |	I think getting people dragging their mind here is going to be
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,631	| IOT140 |	Tough So Good by Amber light
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:22,655	| IOT140 |	I stack you had
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,471	| IOT140 |	What stat to be clear is pivoting
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| IOT140 |	Who's Ember lights they were
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:33,919	| IOT140 |	In retail stores
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,991	| IOT140 |	These are legit companies that made real products that actually work
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,807	| IOT140 |	It's hard out there man
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,599	| IOT140 |	All right
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:44,159	| IOT140 |	Lettuce
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:46,463	| IOT140 |	My holiday Peru tip from Stacy
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,047	| IOT140 |	Okay that's a terribly nice
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,839	| IOT140 |	Reading music for that
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,863	| IOT140 |	We do need music
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,375	| IOT140 |	For my holiday
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:57,983	| IOT140 |	I for the fourth year in running have
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,543	| IOT140 |	Pulled out all of my Christmas lights and
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,567	| IOT140 |	Connected them with
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,591	| IOT140 |	Various
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:05,151	| IOT140 |	Some of the Mercedes some of them are Z-Wave and some of them are Wi-Fi out
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:09,503	| IOT140 |	But my pro-tip to you is for your outdoor lights
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,271	| IOT140 |	Label
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,295	| IOT140 |	Your Outlets
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,599	| IOT140 |	So I take a giant
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,111	| IOT140 |	I'm using a
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,159	| IOT140 |	Silver glitter pen
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,952	| IOT140 |	Because that's what I had on hand
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:21,280	| IOT140 |	But you can also just stick a piece of tape on it and label it on the tape if you don't want to
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:22,560	| IOT140 |	Put silver
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,632	| IOT140 |	Glitter ink on your house
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,960	| IOT140 |	So I have upper balcony I have
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,240	| IOT140 |	Snow witch
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,544	| IOT140 |	I have a snow lamp that shoots out like
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,592	| IOT140 |	Pretty snow patterns on the garage
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,360	| IOT140 |	I have a
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:41,760	| IOT140 |	Roof and I think I have a little balcony and then I have my eye twinkle lights so all of those are permanently
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:48,160	| IOT140 |	Is labeled so I can just pull them out and put them in the right spot which is awesome it saved me like an extra 20 minutes cuz usually what I did
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,184	| IOT140 |	It is I have to
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,720	| IOT140 |	Hook them up to my Z-Wave stuff
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,000	| IOT140 |	Jeffrey hook them up
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:55,584	| IOT140 |	You don't spend the time figuring out which Outlet
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,352	| IOT140 |	Work
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,168	| IOT140 |	So that is my Pro tip
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,704	| IOT140 |	Name your
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:01,984	| IOT140 |	Holiday lighting
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,288	| IOT140 |	To something it can't even be kind of generic
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:08,128	| IOT140 |	But just give each one a name and stick with it
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:08,896	| IOT140 |	That name on the outlet
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,176	| IOT140 |	How to make it easy for
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| IOT140 |	Good idea
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,760	| IOT140 |	That's my Pro tip
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:16,576	| IOT140 |	My other pro-tip is guys
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,856	| IOT140 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,952	| IOT140 |	When do you group things into a room like turn lights on at cetera
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,512	| IOT140 |	Does recognize now the Lutron
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:31,424	| IOT140 |	Which is awesome except for two of my Lutron lights are ceiling fans and so now whenever I turn my lights on my ceiling fans
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,192	| IOT140 |	Turn on soap
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,472	| IOT140 |	How to ungroup at
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,776	| IOT140 |	And that is also information you guys might
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:39,872	| IOT140 |	A neutron
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:45,760	| IOT140 |	Kind of a bummer because I really just wanted to be like turn on fan
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:46,784	| IOT140 |	What it's like
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,832	| IOT140 |	That's a light
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:54,976	| IOT140 |	Cuz we have stupid names for advanced we call it our downstairs when is big fan or if there's one is Master fan
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:59,328	| IOT140 |	I always forget you know my turn on the fan is like there are several things share that name
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,144	| IOT140 |	I get the same thing
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:08,032	| IOT140 |	With the certain lights are rooms and whatnot so I want to get away from the whole names thing let's have some contacts in here and you know
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,824	| IOT140 |	Screen on the contacts
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,104	| IOT140 |	But let's make it the right time
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,640	| IOT140 |	Cuz that is going to light switch
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,176	| IOT140 |	Okay
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:17,248	| IOT140 |	Let us move to the iot podcast listener hotline
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,784	| IOT140 |	Which is brought to you by Schlage

EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,912	| IOT140 |	Adhere I'm going to warn you guys this is a
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,448	| IOT140 |	Good question that is
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,472	| IOT140 |	Given to us
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:37,984	| IOT140 |	Bye
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,520	| IOT140 |	A speech to
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:42,080	| IOT140 |	A text to speech robot baby what do you think
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,664	| IOT140 |	How many grams
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,176	| IOT140 |	This is not an act
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,016	| IOT140 |	Maybe a good reason for that
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,832	| IOT140 |	I believe strongly there is a human
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,344	| IOT140 |	Did actually ask this
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,696	| IOT140 |	Stacey and Kevin
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:00,512	| IOT140 |	I'm calling on behalf of Michael from Brisbane
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| IOT140 |	Australia
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,840	| IOT140 |	Announce the bridge to provide High
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:16,896	| IOT140 |	Have you heard anything from Belkin recently regarding me my timesheet
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,664	| IOT140 |	Compatibility
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,576	| IOT140 |	Like it will come out on December 4th
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,600	| IOT140 |	But
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:26,624	| IOT140 |	Kevin
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:35,072	| IOT140 |	Yeah well for folks who are not familiar with the actual details Belkin actually announced back in May that
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:39,168	| IOT140 |	WeMo devices would be homekit compatible through a WeMo Bridge
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:42,496	| IOT140 |	Piece of Hardware that I don't want another bridge but okay I get it
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,800	| IOT140 |	The reason was because Home Care
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,848	| IOT140 |	Required hardware certification
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:50,688	| IOT140 |	An actual implementation of a security chip however that has changed
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:56,832	| IOT140 |	Apple now that does not require they can do it on the software side so I suspect Michael that the WeMo Bridge
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:59,392	| IOT140 |	Will never come to pass which is fine by me
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,928	| IOT140 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:03,232	| IOT140 |	Dokkan hasn't announced anything yet
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,536	| IOT140 |	In terms of this so I don't know
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| IOT140 |	Really
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,608	| IOT140 |	When they're going to I presume
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:15,008	| IOT140 |	That CES in January which they singing I will both be attending and we will certainly be talking to the Dunkin folks and visiting the
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,032	| IOT140 |	WeMo area
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| IOT140 |	Dad
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:20,896	| IOT140 |	Maybe that's the time that they announced it I can't see if they haven't announced it by now
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| IOT140 |	I suspect CES is really good
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,224	| IOT140 |	The big thing the time in place so
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:28,576	| IOT140 |	Hopefully the second week of January we will have a definitive answer for you
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:33,952	| IOT140 |	I hope it is not a bridge I hope it is something they can do on the software side and just make it sew
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,232	| IOT140 |	Yes I'm actually
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,768	| IOT140 |	Because the homepod
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:41,376	| IOT140 |	Was the Apple homepod was delayed until early 2018
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:44,448	| IOT140 |	I'm actually hoping we see a lot of really cool announcement
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,472	| IOT140 |	At CES
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,240	| IOT140 |	Even though Apple.
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,008	| IOT140 |	Historically
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,824	| IOT140 |	They don't go I'm hoping we see a lot
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:56,224	| IOT140 |	Partners or hear from people that this is going to happen like I hope the homekit ecosystem coalesces
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:56,992	| IOT140 |	Sometime after that
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:01,600	| IOT140 |	Because right now it's not as compelling or as rich as some of the other things and
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:04,160	| IOT140 |	Are other options out there and I think that's a real shame
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:04,672	| IOT140 |	Because
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,208	| IOT140 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:11,840	| IOT140 |	Just looking back at prior CES is a lot of the announcements have been we're going to have this it will
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,608	| IOT140 |	Come this year
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:16,960	| IOT140 |	I think we're at the point now where you will see more actual
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:19,520	| IOT140 |	Implementations and products are available
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,800	| IOT140 |	Like immediately or
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:23,360	| IOT140 |	Student not sometime next year we're going to have
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,408	| IOT140 |	That's so that's my hope Michael that
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:28,224	| IOT140 |	Belkin says we got it as of today
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| IOT140 |	Boom
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,040	| IOT140 |	Yeah I would like it is past time
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,808	| IOT140 |	Together
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,320	| IOT140 |	Poop or get off the
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,856	| IOT140 |	That's what I said
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,904	| IOT140 |	You did you went there
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,952	| IOT140 |	I went there because I am so frustrated
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,488	| IOT140 |	Now
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,000	| IOT140 |	After that
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,536	| IOT140 |	I feel like we should take
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:42,816	| IOT140 |	A moment
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:46,400	| IOT140 |	For a word from our sponsor and then after that stay tuned for
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,704	| IOT140 |	The internet of battle
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,264	| IOT140 |	How we are going to connect
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:54,336	| IOT140 |	All of our robots are drones are soldiers are sensors
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:58,432	| IOT140 |	To create the battlefield of the future this is a fun conversation I had with
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:05,344	| IOT140 |	Someone from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign so stay tuned for that oh and before I go I just want to remind
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:11,744	| IOT140 |	Everybody that Thursday that is actually today Thursday November 30th if you're listening to the podcast in the day
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:14,816	| IOT140 |	Andrew in San Francisco
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| IOT140 |	Target
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:20,448	| IOT140 |	Open house and we are going to be talking about business models for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:24,288	| IOT140 |	You kind of want to go if you're in town because you know
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:28,640	| IOT140 |	It'll be a cool conversation and you can meet me or you can watch it live streams on Facebook
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,944	| IOT140 |	And I'll be sharing a link for that
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,736	| IOT140 |	And that's the one across from Moscone Center
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,600	| IOT140 |	Cool gadgets
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:44,512	| IOT140 |	And now a word from our sponsor hey everyone we are interrupting
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:50,912	| IOT140 |	Message from our sponsor sponsor is sparkcognition I have here fellow
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,936	| IOT140 |	Sparkcognition
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,216	| IOT140 |	To talk about
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,752	| IOT140 |	The Pie vs Bill deliver
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| IOT140 |	Implementing a AI in
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:28:03,200	| IOT140 |	Many companies have internal data teams and they're looking to implement a machine-learning solution internally
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,760	| IOT140 |	What are some of the factors they should consider
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,272	| IOT140 |	In doing this
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:09,856	| IOT140 |	Your first question typically comes from the executive
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:12,416	| IOT140 |	What is the company's core competency
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,464	| IOT140 |	And how is a line
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,232	| IOT140 |	With the idea
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,768	| IOT140 |	Building a team
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:19,584	| IOT140 |	How to create cognitive analytic Solutions in house
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,608	| IOT140 |	Another aspect
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| IOT140 |	When you assess what is it
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,448	| IOT140 |	Strategy required
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,728	| IOT140 |	For me long term
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,056	| IOT140 |	And how far can you really go in here
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:31,360	| IOT140 |	Thinking about implementing machine learning
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,128	| IOT140 |	Solutions
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:32,896	| IOT140 |	Seems to be
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,688	| IOT140 |	Speedy attractive at first
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,480	| IOT140 |	Then you realize it is sex
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:38,272	| IOT140 |	She just the tip of the iceberg
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:41,600	| IOT140 |	If you try to build a cognitive solutions that is it
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,112	| IOT140 |	Scalable
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:47,232	| IOT140 |	And finally implemented it starts
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:51,584	| IOT140 |	With executive team sponsorship it propagates throughout the stakeholders
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:55,424	| IOT140 |	So what advantages and services can an external vendor provide
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:59,008	| IOT140 |	One an AI company like spark ignition
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:03,104	| IOT140 |	Has tested and evaluated existing and available tools
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:03,872	| IOT140 |	Algorithms
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:06,944	| IOT140 |	Techniques that are in the market or any research
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,736	| IOT140 |	Knowing the best product
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:14,624	| IOT140 |	And having access to the right tools can make a significant difference in how long
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:19,488	| IOT140 |	It takes to complete unused case application sometime to value is one Bennett
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,280	| IOT140 |	Second computing
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,072	| IOT140 |	Middleware platform
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,864	| IOT140 |	OS algorithm
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,144	| IOT140 |	Continue to evolve
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:26,912	| IOT140 |	In change
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:30,240	| IOT140 |	Rapidly maintaining and upgrading applications
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:33,568	| IOT140 |	Quickly become a bottleneck so we that long-term
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:37,408	| IOT140 |	Court is a great benefit from vendors that are specialized
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:41,760	| IOT140 |	And finally that was argued that vendors are exposed like no one else
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,064	| IOT140 |	2 hundreds of used case
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,344	| IOT140 |	And this know that
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,368	| IOT140 |	Out of the box
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:50,720	| IOT140 |	Is extremely beneficial when leveraging that knowledge to support a particular client
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:53,024	| IOT140 |	So what would a partnership look
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,792	| IOT140 |	Like what does
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:57,376	| IOT140 |	The internal and external team which responsibilities would they have
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,656	| IOT140 |	So I would like to
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,192	| IOT140 |	Start saying that we becoming

EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,216	| IOT140 |	Define the usability of
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,264	| IOT140 |	And that is actually
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,312	| IOT140 |	Critical because Ximena cases
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,848	| IOT140 |	The same application
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:41,408	| IOT140 |	Will be used by different parts

EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:49,344	| IOT140 |	We will do the end-to-end effort to do project management
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:52,416	| IOT140 |	Will do data ingestion where do dashboards
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,952	| IOT140 |	And we do the final deployment
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,488	| IOT140 |	Follow the sounds great
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:57,024	| IOT140 |	Where can I go to find out
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:03,936	| IOT140 |	You can look at our website for cognition. Com
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:10,336	| IOT140 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the inter

EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:23,648	| IOT140 |	And we are talking about the battlefield
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,672	| IOT140 |	Future
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:32,608	| IOT140 |	Can you show me and I am super excited
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,144	| IOT140 |	But let's break this down
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,960	| IOT140 |	Alright so you guys recently won
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,032	| IOT140 |	Grant from the Army research lab for
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,056	| IOT140 |	Helping develop
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,848	| IOT140 |	Battlefield of the future look like
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,152	| IOT140 |	Vision for this
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,920	| IOT140 |	Game from
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:50,272	| IOT140 |	Cheer. Concern in the future
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,040	| IOT140 |	The US
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| IOT140 |	My face
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| IOT140 |	Adverse
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,648	| IOT140 |	And after college
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| IOT140 |	Need to be ready
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,584	| IOT140 |	Technology Warehouse
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:06,400	| IOT140 |	Cr1tikal logically Advanced 1
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,168	| IOT140 |	Will
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,448	| IOT140 |	Net worth all the answers
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,240	| IOT140 |	Add that well
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,008	| IOT140 |	Allow them
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,032	| IOT140 |	To work dynamis
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:14,848	| IOT140 |	Intelligent player
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:15,616	| IOT140 |	Mission
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,128	| IOT140 |	Without
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:22,528	| IOT140 |	Okay so I have so many questions because
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,808	| IOT140 |	The stuff of science-fiction
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,880	| IOT140 |	Is the ID
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,904	| IOT140 |	In the future
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:31,232	| IOT140 |	We're going to just send out drones
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,280	| IOT140 |	Fight for us
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:37,632	| IOT140 |	I think the idea is that we want to really put the people out of Harm's Way
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,936	| IOT140 |	If that is something that we can do with robot
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,216	| IOT140 |	We should definitely do it with it open
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:45,568	| IOT140 |	Not everything we can do it all by example
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,336	| IOT140 |	Issues
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,360	| IOT140 |	In this project
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,896	| IOT140 |	Is BattleBots shalt not kill
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:49,920	| IOT140 |	Without
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,456	| IOT140 |	Somebody has
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:55,296	| IOT140 |	But there are many other function
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:57,600	| IOT140 |	And the question
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,648	| IOT140 |	To what degree we can push the economy
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:03,488	| IOT140 |	How practical that is how safe that is how ethical
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,024	| IOT140 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,352	| IOT140 |	Turn into septic safe
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:12,192	| IOT140 |	Okay so today
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:19,616	| IOT140 |	And then we also use drones extensively
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:20,896	| IOT140 |	And so
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,176	| IOT140 |	What changes
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,200	| IOT140 |	Are we
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:24,736	| IOT140 |	For this project
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,784	| IOT140 |	Because I feel like we already use a lot of
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:31,648	| IOT140 |	Definitely.
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,184	| IOT140 |	And in fact
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,488	| IOT140 |	Idea of the
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,768	| IOT140 |	Filled up
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,304	| IOT140 |	Future P&G net worth
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:41,632	| IOT140 |	Leverages what the US is already liquid
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:43,168	| IOT140 |	We are in fact
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,192	| IOT140 |	Good act automation
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,728	| IOT140 |	We are in fact
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,752	| IOT140 |	Artificial intelligence
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,800	| IOT140 |	And this takes it to the next step
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,848	| IOT140 |	We want to Network all the
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,152	| IOT140 |	Did not individual entity
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,688	| IOT140 |	That are working
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,968	| IOT140 |	Southside controls
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| IOT140 |	Individuals now we want to see
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,528	| IOT140 |	Think of them as
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,296	| IOT140 |	Beast 2000
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,344	| IOT140 |	All Phase
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,368	| IOT140 |	Cinco distributed
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,440	| IOT140 |	And perhaps the analogy that comes to mind
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,976	| IOT140 |	Yes with Transformers from the
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:08,256	| IOT140 |	Transformers
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,280	| IOT140 |	We have that thing
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:11,072	| IOT140 |	Shapes into whatever you tell it to
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| IOT140 |	Except
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,120	| IOT140 |	Hear it filter
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,680	| IOT140 |	CVS at little
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,216	| IOT140 |	Digital component
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:19,008	| IOT140 |	But they work together as a
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,056	| IOT140 |	Joint Commission
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,592	| IOT140 |	Activision
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,664	| IOT140 |	Intelligent
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,688	| IOT140 |	It has to
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:28,736	| IOT140 |	Think on its own how to accomplish it
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:29,504	| IOT140 |	Mission
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,808	| IOT140 |	It should not be micromanaged
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:34,624	| IOT140 |	I don't want to tell all the Thousand Parts what to do
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:38,464	| IOT140 |	I want to be able to tell that in Seattle what to do
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,256	| IOT140 |	And it should be able to
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:42,048	| IOT140 |	Figured out how to do it somehow
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,072	| IOT140 |	Distribute the jobs
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,912	| IOT140 |	Now the individual Parts could be anything
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,192	| IOT140 |	Could be the armor
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:49,472	| IOT140 |	The people wear
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:50,752	| IOT140 |	Is the weapons themselves
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:53,056	| IOT140 |	It could be very dangerous
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:53,824	| IOT140 |	Krispy Kreme
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,592	| IOT140 |	Mobile
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,360	| IOT140 |	Golang
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,152	| IOT140 |	It could be sensors that
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,432	| IOT140 |	Deliver information
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,224	| IOT140 |	It would be even algorithm
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,992	| IOT140 |	AI search
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,784	| IOT140 |	Components all of these
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:05,600	| IOT140 |	Net worth together all of these are part of the mission part of that
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:10,208	| IOT140 |	OKC that sounds more like Voltron as opposed to a Transformer
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,584	| IOT140 |	This is not an 80s
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:16,864	| IOT140 |	Cartoon show this is
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,144	| IOT140 |	Real life
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,168	| IOT140 |	When you say things
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:24,288	| IOT140 |	Might work in conjunction
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,312	| IOT140 |	Which information
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:30,944	| IOT140 |	For my drone can you put me in a bind
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:34,784	| IOT140 |	Commanding the battle
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:38,624	| IOT140 |	This could be one of the types of missions
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,416	| IOT140 |	Is a Tax Commission
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,696	| IOT140 |	Disaster Response
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,720	| IOT140 |	Mission
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,000	| IOT140 |	Lots of recent hurricanes

EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,648	| IOT140 |	Rescue them
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,672	| IOT140 |	The machine
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,720	| IOT140 |	Quit be able to understand what that's
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:50,304	| IOT140 |	Sensory devices in terms of actuation
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:55,168	| IOT140 |	To be considered
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,704	| IOT140 |	And they would go
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,472	| IOT140 |	Do it
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,240	| IOT140 |	They can eat
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,520	| IOT140 |	Give me some status updates
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,288	| IOT140 |	I made
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,824	| IOT140 |	Manage them but at the high level
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,384	| IOT140 |	Okay so in this idea
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:10,784	| IOT140 |	I feel like a couple of possible weak links so one is right now
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:11,552	| IOT140 |	4
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:12,832	| IOT140 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:15,392	| IOT140 |	In all honesty and update
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,440	| IOT140 |	Crack them all the time
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,488	| IOT140 |	Peps Lake
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:23,328	| IOT140 |	I have to do is go to war with someone who's really good at computers and
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:26,912	| IOT140 |	System
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,776	| IOT140 |	Resilient and then also is aware that
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,336	| IOT140 |	This is a wonderful question
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:36,384	| IOT140 |	And in fact this is
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:37,408	| IOT140 |	Exactly why we need
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,712	| IOT140 |	To be informed
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:41,760	| IOT140 |	Research project
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,808	| IOT140 |	Deployment exercise
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:48,672	| IOT140 |	Security integrators questions
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:49,696	| IOT140 |	Alien
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,232	| IOT140 |	Ask question
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:53,792	| IOT140 |	Safety and that's why
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,608	| IOT140 |	That's why we have 10 years
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:57,888	| IOT140 |	Play Century figure
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:37:59,680	| IOT140 |	Indeed
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:02,496	| IOT140 |	Security is one of the main source in the
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,800	| IOT140 |	Everything we do has to be
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:06,336	| IOT140 |	Your everything we do has
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:07,872	| IOT140 |	Safe has to be
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:08,640	| IOT140 |	Brazilian
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:10,432	| IOT140 |	It has to operate in a very hot
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,248	| IOT140 |	One of the ways that this is
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:14,528	| IOT140 |	Is different from
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:17,856	| IOT140 |	Similar Technologies for the internet of things that are
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,624	| IOT140 |	You was in
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:20,928	| IOT140 |	Civilian life is that we are operating
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,464	| IOT140 |	Demanding
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,536	| IOT140 |	Break up
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,048	| IOT140 |	Is it going to rain
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,096	| IOT140 |	Infiltrate
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:29,120	| IOT140 |	Components
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,912	| IOT140 |	Indication
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:32,192	| IOT140 |	How do we face that has one
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:38,592	| IOT140 |	Let's talk about how to break that up because I think there's some
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,616	| IOT140 |	Obviously
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:45,760	| IOT140 |	Right now one of the big thing is you know cracking various protocols
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:49,600	| IOT140 |	Electronic
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:53,696	| IOT140 |	Components that actually perhaps
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:56,768	| IOT140 |	Do as much manufacturing of our electronic
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:57,536	| IOT140 |	Components
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:39:00,096	| IOT140 |	That we can actually control so I'm curious what you
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,632	| IOT140 |	You guys are thinking about the
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:06,240	| IOT140 |	What one of the very interesting aspects of a project is that division
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,544	| IOT140 |	Conan
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,080	| IOT140 |	I'm not entirely Trust
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,360	| IOT140 |	Not all the components
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:13,664	| IOT140 |	Other
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:15,200	| IOT140 |	Not over components
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:21,344	| IOT140 |	Yeah some of the components perhaps a drastic but some of the components are what we called grey components or even drive component
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:24,416	| IOT140 |	Gray is where you don't quite know
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,952	| IOT140 |	You should trust this
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:28,000	| IOT140 |	Rather sweater is actually
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,024	| IOT140 |	Maybe DeLong
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:32,352	| IOT140 |	Does animated mean when I see if you can somehow
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,632	| IOT140 |	Exact value of it anyway
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,704	| IOT140 |	But the point is
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,216	| IOT140 |	We do not
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,336	| IOT140 |	Are all 100%.
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,616	| IOT140 |	Supportive
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:45,664	| IOT140 |	Security
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:49,760	| IOT140 |	The mechanisms that allow you to pretty quickly
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:54,112	| IOT140 |	Power components that are not doing what they're supposed to work.
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:54,624	| IOT140 |	May have been in
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:57,952	| IOT140 |	And eliminate them or isolate them
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,976	| IOT140 |	What is that prevent
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,768	| IOT140 |	These components
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:05,376	| IOT140 |	What do we learn from technologies that are already out there about
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,400	| IOT140 |	Security cameras
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,936	| IOT140 |	Especially when it comes to things
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:08,960	| IOT140 |	Using machine learning
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,240	| IOT140 |	Do detect
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,360	| IOT140 |	Security
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,640	| IOT140 |	Stanton in network
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,920	| IOT140 |	Is a heart problem
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:19,200	| IOT140 |	Clearly the more components
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,224	| IOT140 |	What's internet work
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:23,296	| IOT140 |	Told me she was at all this
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,320	| IOT140 |	Components
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,392	| IOT140 |	Palestine is bad
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:27,904	| IOT140 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,440	| IOT140 |	There is benefits
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:31,488	| IOT140 |	The more components you have
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,512	| IOT140 |	More
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,816	| IOT140 |	How to be resilient
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:38,656	| IOT140 |	Because even if some of the components go bad
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,424	| IOT140 |	Compensate
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:40,704	| IOT140 |	I think one of the
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:44,544	| IOT140 |	Get network
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,312	| IOT140 |	More
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:47,360	| IOT140 |	The enemy will have to go and
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,688	| IOT140 |	Hawaii is one of those to get to the other
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,456	| IOT140 |	However
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,992	| IOT140 |	Resilience mechanism
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:54,016	| IOT140 |	Are in place
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,552	| IOT140 |	Evil twin
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,856	| IOT140 |	Really clear despondent isolate
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,136	| IOT140 |	Then that's it
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:40:59,904	| IOT140 |	Mitigated
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,440	| IOT140 |	The other part is we
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:04,000	| IOT140 |	To make sure that
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:04,512	| IOT140 |	TSM
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| IOT140 |	And I think that
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,584	| IOT140 |	One of the
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:08,608	| IOT140 |	Critical lesson
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:10,656	| IOT140 |	Trump
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,704	| IOT140 |	What I want to call the field of
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,472	| IOT140 |	Cyber-physical
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,824	| IOT140 |	So the physical world
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,104	| IOT140 |	Subway's learn how to
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,128	| IOT140 |	To build for example
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,896	| IOT140 |	Plane
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:21,920	| IOT140 |	Passenger airline
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:23,456	| IOT140 |	Computer operator
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:26,016	| IOT140 |	Be safe of course that I asked
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,808	| IOT140 |	Spent a lot of the time
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,160	| IOT140 |	We can learn from that
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:33,184	| IOT140 |	One of the
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,208	| IOT140 |	Cheaper happy
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,232	| IOT140 |	Lesson
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,792	| IOT140 |	Is this skillet
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,304	| IOT140 |	Allows this
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,608	| IOT140 |	To build systems.
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:44,448	| IOT140 |	Continue to operate correctly even when a part of this
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,984	| IOT140 |	System has been compromised
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,008	| IOT140 |	This is something that
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,288	| IOT140 |	Need for a lot of things
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:50,336	| IOT140 |	Automated systems like economist
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,128	| IOT140 |	Plane
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:52,895	| IOT140 |	Autopilot
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,687	| IOT140 |	And I think we can chat about along for the bathroom
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,991	| IOT140 |	Because components will be compromised
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,783	| IOT140 |	Distance have to operate with those things
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,599	| IOT140 |	Components will be shot.
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:07,231	| IOT140 |	This is Denise to be engineered in such a way that at our age.
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:10,815	| IOT140 |	I agree and hopefully some of this will apply back out to
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,095	| IOT140 |	Commercial projects
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:17,727	| IOT140 |	Connection factories in other autonomous systems that we're trying to build today in real life
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:21,055	| IOT140 |	I do believe that some of the lessons
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:21,823	| IOT140 |	Let's learn from the
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:22,847	| IOT140 |	Project
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:24,639	| IOT140 |	Chucky be applicable to
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:25,919	| IOT140 |	Industrial demand
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,199	| IOT140 |	Disability application
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:33,343	| IOT140 |	Let's get a little deep into this because you did also mention ethics
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,135	| IOT140 |	And I imagine that's associated with
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:35,647	| IOT140 |	With soldiers
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,951	| IOT140 |	With the button which is already happening today
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,231	| IOT140 |	It's some level
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:42,303	| IOT140 |	The idea of sending drones
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:45,375	| IOT140 |	Robots
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:48,191	| IOT140 |	There's an economic cost but part of the horror
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,983	| IOT140 |	Deterrent
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:53,823	| IOT140 |	Against War has always been the high cost
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,407	| IOT140 |	So I'm curious what it means
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:59,199	| IOT140 |	As we automate
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:42:59,711	| IOT140 |	War
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:03,295	| IOT140 |	That's a wonderful question I said
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,831	| IOT140 |	IID Electric bill
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,879	| IOT140 |	Think of it that way
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,159	| IOT140 |	If we don't do it
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,439	| IOT140 |	And others
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,719	| IOT140 |	Do it with Whitby
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:11,487	| IOT140 |	In good shape
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:12,511	| IOT140 |	My guess
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,303	| IOT140 |	She's not we will not be in good shape
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:19,423	| IOT140 |	The question is do what degree do we want to push in an hour and I think
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,983	| IOT140 |	There is an important role of for ethics
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:23,007	| IOT140 |	Here and in fact
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:23,519	| IOT140 |	We do have
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:27,103	| IOT140 |	I'm looking at hotels at 6
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,895	| IOT140 |	Design and that's the practice
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:32,479	| IOT140 |	That is done in many larger project because a lot of them
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:33,247	| IOT140 |	Design decisions
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,039	| IOT140 |	Do
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,087	| IOT140 |	Beautification somehow
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:37,855	| IOT140 |	The product
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:39,647	| IOT140 |	What is enable
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,415	| IOT140 |	What's the weather
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:40,927	| IOT140 |	OpenTable
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:44,255	| IOT140 |	Empowering
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:46,559	| IOT140 |	What we want to happen or not
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:47,071	| IOT140 |	I think
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:50,143	| IOT140 |	We need to think through the implications of what it means
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,167	| IOT140 |	Install Network things
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,263	| IOT140 |	Delegate certain decision
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,311	| IOT140 |	And
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,591	| IOT140 |	What's a machine
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:01,663	| IOT140 |	Should follow as far as ethical code
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:04,223	| IOT140 |	When I make a decision I make it
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:05,759	| IOT140 |	In accordance with Lauren
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,527	| IOT140 |	In accordance
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,295	| IOT140 |	Ethics
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:08,063	| IOT140 |	In accordance with
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:09,087	| IOT140 |	With knowledge that I have
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,367	| IOT140 |	Make me laugh
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,391	| IOT140 |	Well
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:11,903	| IOT140 |	Wicked
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,695	| IOT140 |	Impart that knowledge on the machine
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,487	| IOT140 |	But we also them
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:17,279	| IOT140 |	Make the machine
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,303	| IOT140 |	Stan's the Lost
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:21,887	| IOT140 |	I think it's
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:23,423	| IOT140 |	Wonderful design problem
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,447	| IOT140 |	It's something that's
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,727	| IOT140 |	Bridges
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:26,751	| IOT140 |	Is the technical
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:29,311	| IOT140 |	And the social and ethical and illegal
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,847	| IOT140 |	And we need to make it
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:31,615	| IOT140 |	Safe
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:33,151	| IOT140 |	We need to make sure that the machine
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:34,431	| IOT140 |	The knot
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:36,223	| IOT140 |	Perpetrator fences
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:36,735	| IOT140 |	Got
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:39,295	| IOT140 |	Be liable for in a bad way they're not going to go kids
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,855	| IOT140 |	Another question
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:43,135	| IOT140 |	Tied to the ethics
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:43,647	| IOT140 |	Is
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:46,207	| IOT140 |	Right now if we look at what's happening
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:47,999	| IOT140 |	With fighting in Syria for example
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:51,327	| IOT140 |	What you see a lot of is civilians
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,095	| IOT140 |	Are left
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:56,447	| IOT140 |	And what becomes interesting to me is this idea of we have our robots fight
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:45:00,799	| IOT140 |	Worse for us it feels like a lot of civilians could be
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:01,567	| IOT140 |	Caught in the
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:02,335	| IOT140 |	Crossfire
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,103	| IOT140 |	Quite literally
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:04,895	| IOT140 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:10,783	| IOT140 |	We're really thinking about so I am curious kind of how you guys think about that are also
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:11,807	| IOT140 |	Not actually about
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:13,087	| IOT140 |	Their cities
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:13,855	| IOT140 |	Jen homes
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:14,623	| IOT140 |	Neighborhood
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:17,695	| IOT140 |	I think what you said is one of the important motivation
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:22,047	| IOT140 |	Theaters of operation if you will Insidious
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,095	| IOT140 |	Most people
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,119	| IOT140 |	Today live in City
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:27,423	| IOT140 |	Future Wars will increasingly be in
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:30,239	| IOT140 |	It's pretty hard.
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:31,519	| IOT140 |	To fight a war
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:34,591	| IOT140 |	He damaged
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,943	| IOT140 |	Collateral damage right now is
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,223	| IOT140 |	Huge problem
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,783	| IOT140 |	Say something
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,551	| IOT140 |	We cannot improve
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,599	| IOT140 |	Idea is
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:46,367	| IOT140 |	Is that
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,647	| IOT140 |	If we have Smart than welcome
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:49,183	| IOT140 |	Maybe they can if
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:55,071	| IOT140 |	Tell your story and this happened to a friend of mine so they
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:57,887	| IOT140 |	They were driving across the bridge
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:58,911	| IOT140 |	And there was a fight
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:02,239	| IOT140 |	Any fire and fighter jet
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,775	| IOT140 |	Flew over the bridge
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:05,823	| IOT140 |	And I circled circled again
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,615	| IOT140 |	Until my friend got off the bridge
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:09,919	| IOT140 |	Just driving around
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:10,943	| IOT140 |	And then that just
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,295	| IOT140 |	Saved my friend's life
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,319	| IOT140 |	Gateway to the
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:18,111	| IOT140 |	Away
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:19,391	| IOT140 |	Now today we have
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:29,119	| IOT140 |	Maybe your check go there's nobody there so I can fly fly fly fly
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:31,679	| IOT140 |	Civilian
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:32,447	| IOT140 |	There's no way to stop it
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,495	| IOT140 |	What is the Rockets
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:36,031	| IOT140 |	Maybe the Rockets
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:37,567	| IOT140 |	Until what that fighter
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:38,335	| IOT140 |	Jet Pilot
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,151	| IOT140 |	Little bit
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:43,711	| IOT140 |	Jefferson
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:46,271	| IOT140 |	My point is we tend to sing
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:48,831	| IOT140 |	Bob's Market weapons
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:51,391	| IOT140 |	More dangerous plants
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,159	| IOT140 |	And that isn't it
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:54,207	| IOT140 |	To explore How can I
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,487	| IOT140 |	Make war
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,511	| IOT140 |	Safer
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:57,535	| IOT140 |	For the civilian
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:46:59,071	| IOT140 |	With less collateral damage
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:01,119	| IOT140 |	So I think that is.
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:04,447	| IOT140 |	Can we create an FAQ
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:05,471	| IOT140 |	Environment
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:07,007	| IOT140 |	Can we create system
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:08,287	| IOT140 |	That was you just clap
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:09,055	| IOT140 |	Damage to zero
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,103	| IOT140 |	High School
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:11,871	| IOT140 |	Try to
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,967	| IOT140 |	Future and I think maybe with smarter Technologies
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,551	| IOT140 |	And
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,879	| IOT140 |	What about our military hardware is going
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:23,647	| IOT140 |	Two places like
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:24,415	| IOT140 |	Police
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:26,463	| IOT140 |	Specifically
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,999	| IOT140 |	Because last year
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:30,047	| IOT140 |	In Dallas the Dallas Police
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:31,583	| IOT140 |	We're faced with a shooter
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:33,119	| IOT140 |	And they actually
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:34,399	| IOT140 |	Parking garage
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,935	| IOT140 |	And took a bomb disposal
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:38,239	| IOT140 |	Robot and then
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:42,591	| IOT140 |	Is weekly kind of
EDL	00:47:42,591	00:47:45,151	| IOT140 |	I feel like there's a lot of questions
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,455	| IOT140 |	Around something
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:50,271	| IOT140 |	We have in the USA history of our military
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:51,807	| IOT140 |	You're going to
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,343	| IOT140 |	Police gear
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,623	| IOT140 |	Can you set down the chain
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| IOT140 |	And
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:57,695	| IOT140 |	Are we prepared for that as we
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:47:58,463	| IOT140 |	Connect stuff
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:47:59,743	| IOT140 |	Make it even smarter
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:01,791	| IOT140 |	Maybe just a couple of things
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:03,839	| IOT140 |	Things that I should mention one of them is.
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:04,863	| IOT140 |	And this is a big
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:05,887	| IOT140 |	IPhone 5S
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:06,911	| IOT140 |	Project
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:07,679	| IOT140 |	We are not
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:11,007	| IOT140 |	I think that's an important
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:12,287	| IOT140 |	Distinction to make because
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:15,103	| IOT140 |	Robots fighting
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:17,663	| IOT140 |	Weather
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:20,479	| IOT140 |	Kill anybody unless I push the button
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:20,991	| IOT140 |	What's the weather today
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:23,551	| IOT140 |	How to make
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:24,831	| IOT140 |	Vacuole function
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:27,135	| IOT140 |	Is a completely different level
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:29,183	| IOT140 |	And it's something that we are
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:30,207	| IOT140 |	Not going to do it
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:35,071	| IOT140 |	Now there are lots of other functions
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:37,375	| IOT140 |	Example data
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:38,655	| IOT140 |	You know I need
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:42,495	| IOT140 |	Sensory data
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:44,287	| IOT140 |	I want to deploy my sensors
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,311	| IOT140 |	Somewhere where they can
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:46,847	| IOT140 |	Can see the enemy and I want them
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:48,383	| IOT140 |	Tell me what the enemy is doing
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:49,919	| IOT140 |	I want them to report when
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:50,687	| IOT140 |	Something happen
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:53,503	| IOT140 |	Requires my attention I want them to
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:55,551	| IOT140 |	To do that for the magically I want them to
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,087	| IOT140 |	Automatically understand
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:00,159	| IOT140 |	When the enemy is doing something that might
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:02,719	| IOT140 |	Star. Delivery
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:05,023	| IOT140 |	Function of those alerts
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:05,791	| IOT140 |	Mason

EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:16,287	| IOT140 |	Worry about people
EDL	00:49:19,615	00:49:20,895	| IOT140 |	Okay
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:23,199	| IOT140 |	I have learned a lot
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:29,855	| IOT140 |	I'm intrigued to see what we can learn from this project so thank you
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:30,623	| IOT140 |	Very much for coming
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:33,695	| IOT140 |	Thank you very much that was fun
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:40,095	| IOT140 |	That's all for this week's Internet of Things podcast remember if you want more iot news
