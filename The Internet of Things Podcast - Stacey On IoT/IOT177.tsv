EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:08,352	| IOT177 |	Chain does for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:11,424	| IOT177 |	It is not your typical blockchain discussion
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:12,448	| IOT177 |	Do not fret
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,216	| IOT177 |	You're gonna enjoy

EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:45,728	| IOT177 |	. IO that's a f e r o. IO
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,776	| IOT177 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:51,104	| IOT177 |	Let's get ready for Defcon is your Wi-Fi turned off
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:58,016	| IOT177 |	Scared of we talked about Defcon cuz it's crazy with the hackers of Jews there just
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:00,576	| IOT177 |	Prove that things are not as secure as we might think
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:01,088	| IOT177 |	Just to make us
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,624	| IOT177 |	Little more insert
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:06,720	| IOT177 |	Actually because of Hotel policy
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:09,024	| IOT177 |	The big story at a Defcon is not the hacks
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:13,888	| IOT177 |	It is the management at hotel sending security guards in randomly to check
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:14,912	| IOT177 |	People's rooms which is
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,192	| IOT177 |	Not a great thing forever
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,984	| IOT177 |	So we're not going to talk
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:20,032	| IOT177 |	That we're going to talk with the devices that are half
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:23,104	| IOT177 |	Including our favorite the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:26,688	| IOT177 |	But researchers from tencent they spent months
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,968	| IOT177 |	Trying to
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:33,088	| IOT177 |	Figure out how to convert the Amazon Echo smart speaker into a surveillance device
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,928	| IOT177 |	What they did was they use multiple bugs
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,952	| IOT177 |	In the second generation
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:42,048	| IOT177 |	Show that allows a hacker to remotely stream audio from the devices micro
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,840	| IOT177 |	But those researchers
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| IOT177 |	Did
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,656	| IOT177 |	Notify Amazon
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,680	| IOT177 |	And Amazon has
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,496	| IOT177 |	That's why I like ethical hackers
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,008	| IOT177 |	Ethical hacker
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,336	| IOT177 |	Should you be worried that someone else is going to come
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,360	| IOT177 |	Come do this to you
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,664	| IOT177 |	It also requires access to your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| IOT177 |	And so
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,992	| IOT177 |	Most of us are not
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,040	| IOT177 |	We don't have people coming around trying to attack her
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,880	| IOT177 |	If you are that person
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,904	| IOT177 |	You know that
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,416	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:14,816	| IOT177 |	It it actually though braces are good point I mean not cortical front door to the smart home is
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,096	| IOT177 |	You know your Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,120	| IOT177 |	Innocence
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,936	| IOT177 |	You really want to focus on keeping that secure
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:25,312	| IOT177 |	Routers updated Etc to talk more about routers later today but I think it's worth the mention to your point that out
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,848	| IOT177 |	Yes don't give out your wife
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,152	| IOT177 |	My password I know we used to all casually B
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,432	| IOT177 |	You like
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,968	| IOT177 |	Gesnetwork baby
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,272	| IOT177 |	I know it's not I Ortiz
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:40,416	| IOT177 |	Specific related but I tell you what voting machine hacking by the kids that are really scares me
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,720	| IOT177 |	1 well folding machines are supposed
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| IOT177 |	These aren't button
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:45,536	| IOT177 |	Instead
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,584	| IOT177 |	What did this 11 year old
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:53,472	| IOT177 |	Here there was a bunch of enterprising young children including the 11 year old who was able to
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,776	| IOT177 |	A control mock-up of the Florida sec
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,080	| IOT177 |	Terry of State website and change the voting results
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:01,664	| IOT177 |	And guess what it took him all of 10 minutes to do so that's
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:05,504	| IOT177 |	Concerning an even though voting machines aren't supposed to be
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,296	| IOT177 |	Network can connect Etc
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,344	| IOT177 |	There are processing
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:13,440	| IOT177 |	Bits inside them and they have firmware and some of the kids
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:18,815	| IOT177 |	Scott's is voting machines to change vote tallies they uploaded their own software the machines
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:23,423	| IOT177 |	And even had a looping gif file on the screens of one of the voting machines so that's
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,959	| IOT177 |	They're just old
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,543	| IOT177 |	Not the kids the machines
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,335	| IOT177 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,431	| IOT177 |	Keep a paper record you guys
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,455	| IOT177 |	Another thing
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,223	| IOT177 |	That was hacked
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,991	| IOT177 |	Police body cameras
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:40,319	| IOT177 |	These people device waited live stream footage from the
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:41,855	| IOT177 |	So
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:45,695	| IOT177 |	Basically hack into a police person who's Maybe
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:48,511	| IOT177 |	Monitoring your criminal organization and be like
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,559	| IOT177 |	Look outside everybody's play it cool
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,607	| IOT177 |	He also could put
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,887	| IOT177 |	Malware on the camera
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,423	| IOT177 |	And then you could bring
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,447	| IOT177 |	That into the
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,471	| IOT177 |	The police department in
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:00,031	| IOT177 |	Go to their other databases and allow you access to
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,799	| IOT177 |	To their Network
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,359	| IOT177 |	Which as we all know is the beginning of the end
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| IOT177 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,663	| IOT177 |	Voicemail
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,479	| IOT177 |	This one cracked me up because it was like
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:11,551	| IOT177 |	Hacking into voicemail but I'm like who uses voicemail
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,087	| IOT177 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,927	| IOT177 |	Probably very happy because people don't care about as much although they probably should
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,463	| IOT177 |	I'm like what are they
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,767	| IOT177 |	Be part of my endless parade of
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,535	| IOT177 |	Your prescription
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,815	| IOT177 |	The pharmacy is now ready
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| IOT177 |	We are confirming your
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,119	| IOT177 |	Appointment at the dentist's
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| IOT177 |	There was another
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,191	| IOT177 |	Kind of freaky
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,727	| IOT177 |	Freaky hack
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:35,615	| IOT177 |	I don't know it was a hack McAfee hackers basically showed off the ability to hack into a
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,431	| IOT177 |	Hospitals Network and falsify a patient's vital signs
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:44,831	| IOT177 |	And this gets into some of the medical device hacking we've talked about that a lot on the show
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:48,159	| IOT177 |	There's a networking protocol used by medical devices known
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,439	| IOT177 |	When is
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| IOT177 |	RW hat
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,255	| IOT177 |	I'm not sure how to say
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,815	| IOT177 |	Rwhat I have no idea
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| IOT177 |	Exactly
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:02,495	| IOT177 |	So basically what they did is they hacked into this protocol and let other devices come on to the network that looks like they
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,055	| IOT177 |	They were monitoring patients to mimic their vital signs
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,359	| IOT177 |	This is again an example of
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,383	| IOT177 |	A case where
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:12,991	| IOT177 |	If you were in a position where someone is really after you and wants to hack you
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| IOT177 |	This is that kind of scary
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:16,575	| IOT177 |	Most of us are not in that position
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:21,439	| IOT177 |	I don't know if many people are going to want to freak out hospitals by creating imaginary patients or
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,511	| IOT177 |	Overloading people's actual vital signs with
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,791	| IOT177 |	But
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,303	| IOT177 |	For me
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:29,631	| IOT177 |	Government let's see here and ex-russian spy purse
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,399	| IOT177 |	Rhapsody
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,447	| IOT177 |	These sorts of hacks confortini
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,215	| IOT177 |	From that perspective
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,775	| IOT177 |	This is an interesting way to murder kill someone
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:40,895	| IOT177 |	Poor kidnap them and make it look like they're still there in the heart is beating normally
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,943	| IOT177 |	They just took that another level
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,479	| IOT177 |	Sorry
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,015	| IOT177 |	We're going to see this and you know
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,551	| IOT177 |	The next batch of movies
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,343	| IOT177 |	TV shows I'm sure
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,415	| IOT177 |	But it is something that we should keep an eye on just because
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:56,511	| IOT177 |	We're connecting all this stuff and it's providing a lot of new ways to
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,559	| IOT177 |	Falsify information and also
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,863	| IOT177 |	Allowing people access to
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,911	| IOT177 |	Things like insulin pumps in that sort of
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,215	| IOT177 |	Too many attack vectors
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,751	| IOT177 |	Too many
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,263	| IOT177 |	Access
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:08,799	| IOT177 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| IOT177 |	Speaking of attack vectors
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,127	| IOT177 |	Speaking of attack
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,199	| IOT177 |	Amazon web service introduced
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,991	| IOT177 |	Their iot device Defender
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,295	| IOT177 |	Actually they didn't release it they just made it available
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:19,807	| IOT177 |	Kevin
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,879	| IOT177 |	Right at AWS invent
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:26,463	| IOT177 |	Equus November last year they announced the iot device
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:32,607	| IOT177 |	Defender for AWS but it is now available basically it is another service that they have for their IRT offer
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,911	| IOT177 |	And What it lets you do is
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,959	| IOT177 |	It lets you create audits
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:41,567	| IOT177 |	Of all of your fireteam devices you can schedule them excetera and you can look for like
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:45,407	| IOT177 |	Cat doesn't different things like certain certificates that are expiring perhaps
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,479	| IOT177 |	There's a policy that overly permissive
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:52,575	| IOT177 |	Is a whole bunch of parameters here in the idea is that you can cut a check
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,623	| IOT177 |	I would say real time I would say and I
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:59,999	| IOT177 |	Schedule regular basis if all of the it devices that you were managing are doing what they're supposed to do
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,767	| IOT177 |	And or
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:06,399	| IOT177 |	Maybe they have been hacked maybe they are getting too much information but they don't need so this is a way to help manage that so it's
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:10,495	| IOT177 |	Iot device Defender and again it's all part of the AWS iot services
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| IOT177 |	Okay so
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:17,663	| IOT177 |	Let's get into another big story this week which is
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,479	| IOT177 |	AP working with some
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,783	| IOT177 |	Princeton researchers discovered that Google
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,807	| IOT177 |	Share your location
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,087	| IOT177 |	Even when you
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,599	| IOT177 |	Don't
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,391	| IOT177 |	That's
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,671	| IOT177 |	Yeah that's a fact
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,951	| IOT177 |	I was going to say that
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:36,351	| IOT177 |	Kind of the story but that is a fact it is true the issue here is one of transparency because Google
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,655	| IOT177 |	Says hey just disable location
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,983	| IOT177 |	Settings on your phone or whatever Android device or Google devices
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:47,103	| IOT177 |	To cetera and your location history will no longer have your location that is technically true
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,943	| IOT177 |	However there's another area of
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,479	| IOT177 |	Your account that
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| IOT177 |	Tracks your location
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,551	| IOT177 |	It is the web and
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| IOT177 |	Activity
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:03,487	| IOT177 |	That's where you need to disable also the location information you can manually delete it if you want to go in your account
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:09,887	| IOT177 |	You can do all that now retroactively but I just find it very disingenuous of Google to say the name something location history with an O
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:13,983	| IOT177 |	On off toggle essentially it's not all of your location history that's bothersome
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:19,103	| IOT177 |	Yes and we talked about this all the time but trust is so important
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,127	| IOT177 |	With the internet
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,151	| IOT177 |	Thanks and with
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,687	| IOT177 |	Mobile devices and
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| IOT177 |	With all of the data.
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| IOT177 |	It's been collected about
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:29,087	| IOT177 |	We is users have to trust that the companies are
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,135	| IOT177 |	Doing what they say they do
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:35,231	| IOT177 |	And maybe this was not nefarious on the part of Google maybe it was just you know
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,815	| IOT177 |	Engineers making decisions and not thinking about the UI impact
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,607	| IOT177 |	Privacy impact
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,911	| IOT177 |	We can't do that anymore
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,983	| IOT177 |	The information that is being gathered here is so personal
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,591	| IOT177 |	I really think all companies have to pay attention to this
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| IOT177 |	Start being
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,151	| IOT177 |	Way more transfer
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,431	| IOT177 |	By the way
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:10:01,087	| IOT177 |	If you want to turn this off you have to go to on your phone do you go to Google settings in the Google account
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,623	| IOT177 |	And tap on data and personals
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,671	| IOT177 |	Station that's where you going to get the web and a peck
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT177 |	Then
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:09,535	| IOT177 |	Utah the blue web and app activity slider
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,303	| IOT177 |	Two off
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:16,191	| IOT177 |	Google's going to be like this is going to limit or disable more personalized experiences across Google services
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,959	| IOT177 |	In
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| IOT177 |	Then
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:19,775	| IOT177 |	And it will
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,823	| IOT177 |	Every now and then I turn off
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,127	| IOT177 |	Or change my privacy
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| IOT177 |	And sharing settings
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,223	| IOT177 |	And I can tell you the experience degrades tremendously
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,039	| IOT177 |	I mean that's kind of to be expected
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:34,367	| IOT177 |	If they don't have that information they can't deliver my weather without me asking
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,415	| IOT177 |	My commute
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,719	| IOT177 |	Yeah I mean that's the thing we have
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:41,279	| IOT177 |	I want to say treated privacy but I guess that's
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:47,679	| IOT177 |	Probably the best word for now we traded some of this data for very personalized useful Services Bureau
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| IOT177 |	Don't want their services
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,471	| IOT177 |	That's fine
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,495	| IOT177 |	You can turn all that off
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT177 |	But
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:58,687	| IOT177 |	I'm kind of can't complain that you're not getting your commute times anymore and you're not getting local traffic cuz it doesn't know what local is for you right now
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,991	| IOT177 |	There's so many things that will disappear
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,015	| IOT177 |	That we've already just
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,039	| IOT177 |	Become accustomed to
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,343	| IOT177 |	All right
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,415	| IOT177 |	Let's move from Wiki security and privacy topics to
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,743	| IOT177 |	Do Wi-Fi Eros
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,303	| IOT177 |	Almost all of the cable
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,071	| IOT177 |	Out there
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:18,399	| IOT177 |	They have made the first router that works with the easymesh
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:23,263	| IOT177 |	And if we remember easymesh we talked about this a while back
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,823	| IOT177 |	This is the Wi-Fi lamp standard
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:28,127	| IOT177 |	To allow different wifi routers
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,199	| IOT177 |	What's Wi-Fi routers from different brands
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:35,295	| IOT177 |	Is beforehand if you wanted a mesh wi-fi system you had to basically by
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:38,367	| IOT177 |	These were all heroes or all whatever
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,135	| IOT177 |	Phillips
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| IOT177 |	So
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:45,023	| IOT177 |	That's still the case with those systems but now Harrison this make sense because it's possible that
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,047	| IOT177 |	If I bought
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,607	| IOT177 |	My cable provider comes in they want to be able to
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| IOT177 |	Adopt whatever
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,423	| IOT177 |	Mesh systems they were
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,983	| IOT177 |	Or maybe are already know
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,799	| IOT177 |	True but I kind of laughed when I saw this
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:01,151	| IOT177 |	Because this is like getting the first fax machines and then saying what okay what do I do because
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,175	| IOT177 |	Even though this is the first
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,223	| IOT177 |	Certified easymesh product
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,759	| IOT177 |	No other
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,575	| IOT177 |	Of the brands that you just mention no other ones
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,135	| IOT177 |	Work with EZ match so it's still only
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| IOT177 |	It wasn't working
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,951	| IOT177 |	This one it will if
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| IOT177 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,047	| IOT177 |	So I mean somebody's got to be
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,887	| IOT177 |	First I get it and it does make sense of the terrorist who can sell these two
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:28,031	| IOT177 |	You know home broadband providers by the pallet load but it doesn't matter until somebody else says
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,823	| IOT177 |	Networking it allow using mesh to
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| IOT177 |	All right
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,383	| IOT177 |	Also in
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| IOT177 |	Wifi router news
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,431	| IOT177 |	Samsung
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:37,503	| IOT177 |	They have what they're calling the new SmartThings mesh wi-fi system
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,039	| IOT177 |	What it actually is
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,551	| IOT177 |	This is
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,087	| IOT177 |	Looms
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,111	| IOT177 |	Service
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:42,879	| IOT177 |	Rebranded
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,647	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:46,975	| IOT177 |	I feel like we talked about this in the past because I talked a lot about the
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,999	| IOT177 |	Future of Wi-Fi
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:51,327	| IOT177 |	Basically all of your Samsung SmartThings hubs
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,351	| IOT177 |	Will have this technology
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,887	| IOT177 |	Built-in +
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,727	| IOT177 |	Basically this is a rebranding of the Samsung connect
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,495	| IOT177 |	Home
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:04,895	| IOT177 |	Mesh Wi-Fi systems to become SmartThings Wi-Fi and Samsung had added the SmartThings keypad
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,943	| IOT177 |	Ability to these Wi-Fi Hub so it's not
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,759	| IOT177 |	Unusual they also are taking the time
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,039	| IOT177 |	Because they had
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,087	| IOT177 |	But this operation I'm guessing
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:16,415	| IOT177 |	Add a new and improved SmartThings Hub sensors and out
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,951	| IOT177 |	These
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| IOT177 |	Are cute
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:23,839	| IOT177 |	The new SmartThings Hub is actually cheaper it's only to be 70 bucks 6999
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,119	| IOT177 |	The sensors are bad
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| IOT177 |	20 + 2
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| IOT177 |	$25
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,959	| IOT177 |	And the smart outlet is
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:37,151	| IOT177 |	Ya know it's this good for SmartThings admin for SmartThings users or somebody wants to upgrade or what
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:42,527	| IOT177 |	Start there's hard on why I get ahold mesh Network system with smartphone capabilities and
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,063	| IOT177 |	The only downside to me is
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,855	| IOT177 |	I'm not a fan of the mobile app but that's
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,623	| IOT177 |	Just me
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,391	| IOT177 |	Oh and they added
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:50,975	| IOT177 |	Button button
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,255	| IOT177 |	Basically
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| IOT177 |	This is
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:53,791	| IOT177 |	It's a button
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:58,143	| IOT177 |	So you can have triggers on it and you can control various things around your home so
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,447	| IOT177 |	Yay
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,727	| IOT177 |	That is the one thing
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:07,103	| IOT177 |	With SmartThings I had a lot of automations but I am almost never in the app so if I can't talk to my
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:08,639	| IOT177 |	4
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,199	| IOT177 |	It's not already automated
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:16,319	| IOT177 |	Write it one question I haven't seen Samsung or plume address
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:19,903	| IOT177 |	Because I know the reason the plume middle layer to integrate the
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:23,487	| IOT177 |	Temp service on this Hardware we just talk recently about plumes
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,511	| IOT177 |	Subscription fees
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,559	| IOT177 |	I don't see any
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,679	| IOT177 |	That's the question yeah there's no mention of it
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:37,311	| IOT177 |	So I assumed not since you can buy this I would imagine it would tell you when you buy it and I'm not saying
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,127	| IOT177 |	So basically if you wanted to you could get the
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,407	| IOT177 |	Flume capabilities
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,943	| IOT177 |	Without the subscription
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:47,807	| IOT177 |	That's if you want you then get this exciting
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,623	| IOT177 |	That also
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,903	| IOT177 |	Has additional radio
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:55,487	| IOT177 |	That also work with zigbee and Z-Wave and Bluetooth which
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,767	| IOT177 |	Actually kind of a smoking good deal
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:01,375	| IOT177 |	And does what Kevin wants which is hay puts All the Small Things
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,143	| IOT177 |	StubHub
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| IOT177 |	You just got Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,935	| IOT177 |	Why so it's functional
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:07,007	| IOT177 |	Exactly
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,031	| IOT177 |	Alrighty
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,567	| IOT177 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,591	| IOT177 |	Samsung has
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,871	| IOT177 |	Also announced
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,895	| IOT177 |	Galaxy homes
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| IOT177 |	Speaker
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:18,527	| IOT177 |	Quizlet of the Amazon Echo or the Google
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,063	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| IOT177 |	This is bixby's version
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,391	| IOT177 |	Looks
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,183	| IOT177 |	Like a fondue pot BBQ
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:30,303	| IOT177 |	Yeah it's just almost like a teardrop
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:33,375	| IOT177 |	Shape with the top of third cut off and has the
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,679	| IOT177 |	3 silver legs
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| IOT177 |	Maine
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:42,079	| IOT177 |	Looks like some of the modern lamps that we had in my home when modern in the 70s men lots of chrome and
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| IOT177 |	Pretty shapes
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| IOT177 |	Can finish it but whatever
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,919	| IOT177 |	There's no price yet it's
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:52,319	| IOT177 |	Coming soon cording to Samsung they did use it at their Galaxy unpacked event where they did do the Samsung
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:58,207	| IOT177 |	Galaxy Note 9 and the Galaxy watch they had a hundred sixty days playing some of the presentation and
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:04,095	| IOT177 |	From my perspective I was watching it online I couldn't tell the difference the sound sounded great but I don't think I'm going to buy a hundred six days for
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,911	| IOT177 |	I'm not convinced that Bixby is
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,935	| IOT177 |	For me but
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,215	| IOT177 |	That's what it's going to run
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,263	| IOT177 |	It also also
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,311	| IOT177 |	Also works as a SmartThings
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,847	| IOT177 |	Hub that's actually
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,383	| IOT177 |	It is
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,407	| IOT177 |	So it's got
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,015	| IOT177 |	It should because it says works as a hub
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,527	| IOT177 |	Core SmartThings
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,391	| IOT177 |	We don't know but has a smoking good deal but if you hate extra
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:31,231	| IOT177 |	Alright I can see that Samsung is going to stick SmartThings
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,023	| IOT177 |	Actually
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,559	| IOT177 |	SmartThings is the basis of
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,351	| IOT177 |	Are there apps that actually switching a lot of their lie
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,911	| IOT177 |	Washing machine up in the fridge app
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,679	| IOT177 |	Are becoming the smart
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,495	| IOT177 |	And Bixby of interface for a doll
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,079	| IOT177 |	Speaking of things that
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,103	| IOT177 |	Talk to each other
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:47,615	| IOT177 |	Cortana
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| IOT177 |	And Madame
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:53,503	| IOT177 |	By the way I get this question a lot matinee is just what we call
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,295	| IOT177 |	Amazon's Echo assistant
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,831	| IOT177 |	Because we don't want to trigger it
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,159	| IOT177 |	But we can say Cortana on a bet it's fine
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:08,607	| IOT177 |	Bixby Bixby
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,887	| IOT177 |	Cuz that's what we don't say
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,167	| IOT177 |	The hot words for those
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,679	| IOT177 |	Yes and
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:14,239	| IOT177 |	Why do you call it something
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,287	| IOT177 |	Dancers
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,567	| IOT177 |	Anyway
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,615	| IOT177 |	So back at Microsoft build
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,919	| IOT177 |	Microsoft showed off
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,943	| IOT177 |	Cortana
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,479	| IOT177 |	And me
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,295	| IOT177 |	Together so basically you take Cortana as matinee
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| IOT177 |	How to turn on my lights
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,391	| IOT177 |	That would happen and you should also
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:34,975	| IOT177 |	Do it in reverse and say Madam a ask Cortana to find this
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| IOT177 |	Particular email
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,559	| IOT177 |	It was awkward to ask
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,839	| IOT177 |	To do the others
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:42,655	| IOT177 |	Who's going to do whatever job
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,447	| IOT177 |	And it was really high latency
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:47,007	| IOT177 |	It's rolling out to everyone so everyone can
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:55,711	| IOT177 |	Yeah I just think from a user experience perspective I don't want an assistant asking another assistant
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,783	| IOT177 |	To do something the only possible benefit I see
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,111	| IOT177 |	Is Windows is still very entrenched in the Enterprise
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,951	| IOT177 |	And why you could use an echo there you probably wouldn't use a
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,231	| IOT177 |	Google home because
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,791	| IOT177 |	Business data
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,559	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,351	| IOT177 |	Maybe use the
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,887	| IOT177 |	Integration to ask
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,679	| IOT177 |	Madame a to set up a
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:21,823	| IOT177 |	Calendar event for your work people on you know without looking so on wherever you using Windows and maybe there's something there
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:27,199	| IOT177 |	I'm not a fan of this and I don't understand why it took a year they announced this last August
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,479	| IOT177 |	It took a year
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,503	| IOT177 |	The basically make this
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,039	| IOT177 |	Skip yeah I don't know
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:34,879	| IOT177 |	There's a lot going on I think there was probably also some inviting
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,903	| IOT177 |	Back at the event
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:41,535	| IOT177 |	Satya Nadella the CEO of Microsoft was like Hey Cortana is for business and Madam A is for home
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,559	| IOT177 |	Maybe there was some like
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,095	| IOT177 |	Calling an Uber
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:44,607	| IOT177 |	Is that a business
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:51,519	| IOT177 |	I don't know that could be and there could have been some debate over who gets what data because the way that this works
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,543	| IOT177 |	Today is
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,079	| IOT177 |	As I understand it when you use
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:58,431	| IOT177 |	Madame a Amazon gift the data when use madhumeh to
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:04,319	| IOT177 |	Ask Cortana do something Microsoft gets the day. So there may have been some pushing and pulling there and that will tug of war
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,855	| IOT177 |	Yes so that's out
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| IOT177 |	Etsy
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:10,463	| IOT177 |	Now it's time for the part of the show where Kevin and Stacey try things at
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:10,975	| IOT177 |	And tell you about them
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,535	| IOT177 |	Kevin last week talk to a lot
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,583	| IOT177 |	About the Lenovo smart display
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:19,167	| IOT177 |	He did a pretty comprehensive review now we've got one up on the site which are linked
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,959	| IOT177 |	But Kevin did you have
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,263	| IOT177 |	Having now used it for more than 30
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,335	| IOT177 |	How do you feel about
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:32,479	| IOT177 |	I really like it is not for everybody I guess I'll say that right up front if you are a homekit
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,527	| IOT177 |	Person this doesn't do anything for you
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:37,087	| IOT177 |	If you are all in on echoes
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:41,183	| IOT177 |	This doesn't do anything for you it is basically a Google home with
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:46,303	| IOT177 |	Screen which I find very beneficial for viewing information just like the Echo Show does
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,839	| IOT177 |	Also for fine
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:52,959	| IOT177 |	Tuning your smart home controls because if you say satellite to 40% it'll do that
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:59,359	| IOT177 |	You can say that my voice but it then we'll show you a little slider on the screen and says 45% and maybe you're in that room and
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:00,639	| IOT177 |	That's not enough
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:05,759	| IOT177 |	You just touch it you don't need to speak again then just touch it and drag the slider that is actually coming to the
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,783	| IOT177 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:11,903	| IOT177 |	As well I've seen that rolling out as of last week so you'll see what I'm talking about on your phones and tablets
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| IOT177 |	If your
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:16,767	| IOT177 |	Thinking about switching over to Google devices this is a
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:20,863	| IOT177 |	Great great device and if you watch a lot of online video content
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,375	| IOT177 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:28,287	| IOT177 |	Because it comes in two sizes 8in and 10in I bought the 10-inch one because it is a full HD display where's the other one at 7
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,567	| IOT177 |	20p you can voice search
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,871	| IOT177 |	And give commands to say watch
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:38,271	| IOT177 |	Cat videos on YouTube and there it is is your Google Play music you can save play songs by The Beatles whatever
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,039	| IOT177 |	It does not
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,087	| IOT177 |	Work with as many Music Services
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,391	| IOT177 |	But that's typical of the Google home platform
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,927	| IOT177 |	So that is a limitation
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:51,327	| IOT177 |	But I love it for watching video as well as YouTube TV which I switched over to about three weeks ago not because of this ice
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,607	| IOT177 |	Switch in advance of this
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,375	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,911	| IOT177 |	It's just nice to have a little
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,727	| IOT177 |	Nightstand TV to watch a half an hour of something
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:02,079	| IOT177 |	In full HD the sound I think it's better than the regular Google home
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:07,967	| IOT177 |	Play Smash it's much better than the Google home mini there's two 10-watt speakers in here and I like the fact that it just
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:13,087	| IOT177 |	Looks more modern than say a competing product like the Echo Show as a nice bamboo back if I
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:19,488	| IOT177 |	Curved back so you can stand the device in portrait or landscape I will admit I've only used it in portrait one time that was free
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:22,048	| IOT177 |	Google Duo call with you Stacy
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:25,888	| IOT177 |	I have not made another one and that's the only function that works in portrait mode
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,168	| IOT177 |	This is meant to be in landscape
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:30,496	| IOT177 |	So I got my photos from Google photos on there all the time I've got the
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,008	| IOT177 |	Time on there
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| IOT177 |	25 hours a day get my weather and so on
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:37,664	| IOT177 |	I love it I got to be honest there are things that don't work yet such as Netflix
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:44,064	| IOT177 |	It's on there even though I link my Netflix account but it's all in the work so I'm very very happy I'm using this far more
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:49,184	| IOT177 |	More than any other smart speaker in my house just because that screen add so much more value to me
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,000	| IOT177 |	I can't wait to get my own
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:58,400	| IOT177 |	And we shall say this is all specific to the 10-inch one because I don't think the 8-inch one can you switch it from porch
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,168	| IOT177 |	Landscape
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:05,568	| IOT177 |	You can't and both of them have cameras to use Google Duo but I should also mention the smartest thing they did was putting it
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:08,128	| IOT177 |	Physical shutter cover on this device
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:11,712	| IOT177 |	And you just slide it and the camera is off its block there's nothing
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,224	| IOT177 |	Vatican City
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,784	| IOT177 |	EXO $200 for the 8in
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,576	| IOT177 |	215 to the 10 in
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:18,112	| IOT177 |	Yes and
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,624	| IOT177 |	Kevin Lee
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,160	| IOT177 |	I'm actually
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,720	| IOT177 |	I kinda want to get to it he didn't actually talk about this but like
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,512	| IOT177 |	Facts about Alaska
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:27,072	| IOT177 |	But you can see things from like your nest cameras
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:27,584	| IOT177 |	On the device
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,608	| IOT177 |	Another sibling
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,912	| IOT177 |	So exciting
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,680	| IOT177 |	Already
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,472	| IOT177 |	Let's talk about my experience with
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:33,984	| IOT177 |	Sous vide
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,288	| IOT177 |	You guys know that I am
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:40,384	| IOT177 |	Crazy person in the kitchen and I met the CEO of chefsteps
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,152	| IOT177 |	Mexican Heaven
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:41,664	| IOT177 |	Come on the show soon
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,712	| IOT177 |	They make a sous vide cooker
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,480	| IOT177 |	They're one of many
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,296	| IOT177 |	Cemitas
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:49,088	| IOT177 |	Cooking under water at a set
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:49,856	| IOT177 |	Temperature basic
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:56,256	| IOT177 |	Play so you put one of these circulators in its got a thermometer it circulates water ideas you stick your food in a plastic bag
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,816	| IOT177 |	You cook it at a set temperature at
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT177 |	Takes
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:01,888	| IOT177 |	A little longer or a lot longer depending on the food
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,400	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,704	| IOT177 |	Quote on quote perfectly done
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,472	| IOT177 |	So
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:05,984	| IOT177 |	They're right
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:13,408	| IOT177 |	Perfectly done I will say that I would not cook something in a suvee I would not suit
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,176	| IOT177 |	Need something
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,688	| IOT177 |	A suburb
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:18,016	| IOT177 |	And then serve it to someone I would want to
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,088	| IOT177 |	Put some charna so fry it up afterwards they tell you about this in
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:24,672	| IOT177 |	So this Tuesday GIF cooking I'm not
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,696	| IOT177 |	Super keen on
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,744	| IOT177 |	Like one pot Stacy
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:31,072	| IOT177 |	It really makes deliciously
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:36,448	| IOT177 |	Jimmy eggs but like eggs with the proper yolk that is not like to renovate
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,728	| IOT177 |	Not to
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,776	| IOT177 |	Hard and then it does a great job
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,312	| IOT177 |	Beach
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,360	| IOT177 |	And for anyone who trying to meal prep
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:47,712	| IOT177 |	In advance it's actually really good because what you can do is you can stick in
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:54,624	| IOT177 |	Couples it has to be the same kind of meat in roughly the same size but you can flavor it different ways so you can have like a
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,160	| IOT177 |	Mediterranean flavor in
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,952	| IOT177 |	Southwestern flavor and you
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:02,048	| IOT177 |	You can stick those in individual bags and you can basically prep different types of chick
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,608	| IOT177 |	Different types of flank steak
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,376	| IOT177 |	Which
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:05,888	| IOT177 |	Actually
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:10,752	| IOT177 |	Does the juul have any connectivity or mobile app or any other
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,544	| IOT177 |	It does in fact
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,312	| IOT177 |	It has
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| IOT177 |	Nothing on it
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,872	| IOT177 |	There is no interface
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,384	| IOT177 |	Without the app
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,432	| IOT177 |	Which is a questionable thing
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,224	| IOT177 |	Some people are not going to let this
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:24,064	| IOT177 |	Others like the Anova have that capability on the device
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| IOT177 |	Schedule without your app is
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,392	| IOT177 |	Shell
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,416	| IOT177 |	The app that
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,440	| IOT177 |	Is really good
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,720	| IOT177 |	Chefsteps has
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,512	| IOT177 |	Comprehensive
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,280	| IOT177 |	Recipe site
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,840	| IOT177 |	In some of the things you don't even have to sous vide
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,656	| IOT177 |	So they have lots of cooking guys that show you how to make
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,960	| IOT177 |	But then they also like
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,776	| IOT177 |	Have a visual indicator so when you're trying to
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,544	| IOT177 |	Cook something
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:47,872	| IOT177 |	Like I put meat in its like hey what are you cooking and I'm like I'm going to cook a cow
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,664	| IOT177 |	And I like yours the cut
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,944	| IOT177 |	And then they show you
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,968	| IOT177 |	Video basically
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:52,992	| IOT177 |	Tidy
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:57,856	| IOT177 |	Video or GIF but it just a quick shot of how would you like a cookie they show it to you
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,392	| IOT177 |	So you don't say meme
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,440	| IOT177 |	Pinkness of the meet basic
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:06,304	| IOT177 |	They show someone cutting into it so you can see like the juicing as that all of the stuff
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,840	| IOT177 |	It's kind of terrible twos
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,888	| IOT177 |	Are you in Siri when you're hungry cuz
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,424	| IOT177 |	Can take an hour or two or three
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,032	| IOT177 |	Except that is
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| IOT177 |	You know what would be neat
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,152	| IOT177 |	Well I see something on the site that has a hands
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,920	| IOT177 |	Free mode
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| IOT177 |	Were you can
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,736	| IOT177 |	Kind of talk to it and
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,016	| IOT177 |	You can't you can't talk
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,320	| IOT177 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,112	| IOT177 |	So if you can do that
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:34,720	| IOT177 |	Would it be cool to at least see the temperature or anything else you want to see on that
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:41,120	| IOT177 |	Smart display or something similar that I was just telling you about it mean it's got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi just temperature information it and or timers
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:41,888	| IOT177 |	Simply
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,912	| IOT177 |	Small bits of data
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:46,240	| IOT177 |	I see a lot they could do with this in terms of integration so I guess is what I'm saying
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,008	| IOT177 |	Yeah they could
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,288	| IOT177 |	Integrated to work with the show
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,056	| IOT177 |	It doesn't work
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| IOT177 |	Google assist
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,848	| IOT177 |	So
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,360	| IOT177 |	Sorry Kevin
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,896	| IOT177 |	That's okay
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,176	| IOT177 |	If you're interested in
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,712	| IOT177 |	The
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,760	| IOT177 |	Juul which is what I tried is
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,808	| IOT177 |	179 for the
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:02,368	| IOT177 |	Cheaper version and then they have an industrial one
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,904	| IOT177 |	The bigger clamp that is 119
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,440	| IOT177 |	On Amazon
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:09,280	| IOT177 |	So in there are others like the Innova it goes on sale regularly for
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:09,792	| IOT177 |	Like 17
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,584	| IOT177 |	So
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,424	| IOT177 |	Pick what you will that's just the one I used but I was actually Pleasant
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,240	| IOT177 |	I surprised in this is very much and I.
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:23,872	| IOT177 |	In the sense that it's using the processing power on your phone to make these kind of decisions about
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,920	| IOT177 |	And the sensors in the particular
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,944	| IOT177 |	Suvee cooker
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,992	| IOT177 |	To figure out the most appropriate way to
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,528	| IOT177 |	Your food which
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| IOT177 |	Awesome

EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,136	| IOT177 |	It is time

EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:22,752	| IOT177 |	Jessie
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:29,664	| IOT177 |	Accusation Kevin this is Jesse from Connecticut here I'm currently building a house and had a question about Smart Control of
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,176	| IOT177 |	Overhead fan
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:34,528	| IOT177 |	Can I have a fan in my bedroom and I asked my electrician to wire separate
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:38,368	| IOT177 |	Switch for both the lights on the fan and the fan itself under the assumption that spark
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,416	| IOT177 |	Be easier with sex
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:45,024	| IOT177 |	I am having Lutron caseta switches style throughout the home for lighting control
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:50,144	| IOT177 |	Set SmartThings Hub brother control and have a number of Madame a and Google flights
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,960	| IOT177 |	What would be the best way to
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,472	| IOT177 |	Trolling motor
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,800	| IOT177 |	Specific make and model of the fan on getting
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,360	| IOT177 |	Thanks spot
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,128	| IOT177 |	Jessie
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:00,896	| IOT177 |	This is
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,664	| IOT177 |	A good question
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,712	| IOT177 |	And your luck because I have Facebook
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,248	| IOT177 |	Myself
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,528	| IOT177 |	And I
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,808	| IOT177 |	Have all the devices you have
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,856	| IOT177 |	And the best option is
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,392	| IOT177 |	The GE Z-Wave
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| IOT177 |	Plus smart
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| IOT177 |	10
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,696	| IOT177 |	Speed control
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,512	| IOT177 |	Device so basically this is a
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,536	| IOT177 |	On Amazon it is a
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,352	| IOT177 |	3782 device
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:25,216	| IOT177 |	$37.82 and you want to get the paddle fan control
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:28,032	| IOT177 |	Vice this is going to turn your fan on and off and
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:29,824	| IOT177 |	You do a long press 2
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,104	| IOT177 |	Control the fan speed
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:35,968	| IOT177 |	It works really well at use a Z-Wave plus so it's going to work with SmartThings
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,504	| IOT177 |	It also will work with
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,040	| IOT177 |	Wink and madam
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,320	| IOT177 |	And
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:43,392	| IOT177 |	You were smart in dividing up the things I will tell you
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,512	| IOT177 |	We actually last week talked about a device
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,584	| IOT177 |	Call the bond ir and RF remote
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,376	| IOT177 |	For people who have existing fans
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:57,984	| IOT177 |	Control that's actually a really good option if they have a remote
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:00,288	| IOT177 |	That goes with their fan they can use
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:03,616	| IOT177 |	That remote to program it to the pond and then it would work with
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,408	| IOT177 |	Madame a and
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,176	| IOT177 |	An app
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,712	| IOT177 |	So just throwing that out
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| IOT177 |	Are people who
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:09,760	| IOT177 |	Maybe we're not as smart
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,272	| IOT177 |	2 divided
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,064	| IOT177 |	Lighting and the
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,576	| IOT177 |	Air fan control
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,880	| IOT177 |	And Jessie and anybody else
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:17,952	| IOT177 |	Has to be careful if you do go to buy this on Amazon
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:20,256	| IOT177 |	There are several switches there
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:25,376	| IOT177 |	And this looks exactly like the paddle light switch but that only controls the lights
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,912	| IOT177 |	So make sure you get the
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,448	| IOT177 |	Paddle for fan control
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:31,008	| IOT177 |	And on the bus it says easy smart fan can
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,288	| IOT177 |	And shows a picture of a
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,336	| IOT177 |	Really look forward
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,920	| IOT177 |	And is a really easy answer for you Jesse so hopefully
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,712	| IOT177 |	You can call us back and let us know
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:40,992	| IOT177 |	How it went
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| IOT177 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,552	| IOT177 |	I think that's it
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,344	| IOT177 |	The new 2nd of this week show
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,904	| IOT177 |	Stay tuned to hear from our guest
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:51,744	| IOT177 |	Who is Allison clift-jennings the CEO of filament discussing
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:55,072	| IOT177 |	What blockchain can do especially around microtransaction
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:58,144	| IOT177 |	And it's a really good we actually get a little philosophic
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,424	| IOT177 |	In there so
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| IOT177 |	Is that your bag
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,472	| IOT177 |	You're going to like this
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,008	| IOT177 |	It's not listen anyway because
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:04,800	| IOT177 |	You can never have enough black
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:12,224	| IOT177 |	And now let's go to a message for this week sponsor hey everyone we're taking a break from this week's Internet of Things
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:17,088	| IOT177 |	Podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Netgear
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,112	| IOT177 |	And I have
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:22,720	| IOT177 |	John McHugh who is a senior vice president of commercial networking at Netgear
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:23,744	| IOT177 |	Alright so we talked
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:26,304	| IOT177 |	A couple weeks about Netgear which
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,328	| IOT177 |	Not only has a
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:34,240	| IOT177 |	Homebase router business that a lot of us are familiar with but also a commercial and small to medium-sized big
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,520	| IOT177 |	Business Solution
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,288	| IOT177 |	So let's
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,336	| IOT177 |	Talk about how you guys make that
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,616	| IOT177 |	Easier for
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,640	| IOT177 |	Commercial customers
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,432	| IOT177 |	Setup and operate their Network
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:47,040	| IOT177 |	You know one of the things Stacy the Netgear really takes pride in
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,808	| IOT177 |	Is
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:50,368	| IOT177 |	Making networking technology
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,904	| IOT177 |	Accessible to folks
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:54,976	| IOT177 |	Who have little or no networking knowledge
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,512	| IOT177 |	Kind of taking rxp
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,048	| IOT177 |	Ortiz from home networking
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,840	| IOT177 |	Where millions and millions
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:06,240	| IOT177 |	The people rely on Netgear for their home networking Solutions and most of those folks aren't really technical specialist
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:08,288	| IOT177 |	We do the same for small business owners
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:15,200	| IOT177 |	Okay so as someone who's dealt with this are we talking about oh now I've got a router and then I've got access points everywhere
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:17,248	| IOT177 |	Where and how do you make that process
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,016	| IOT177 |	Easier
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:21,088	| IOT177 |	Let me give you great example orbi Pro
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:26,464	| IOT177 |	Right or be Pro is a solution for a small maybe four or five thousand
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:30,816	| IOT177 |	Square foot retail outlet or bed-and-breakfast even a hosp
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:35,680	| IOT177 |	Fatality Ben you like a restaurant or whatever and what it allows you to do is
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,728	| IOT177 |	Stand up a small business Network
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:42,080	| IOT177 |	Turn on guest user access the able to log who the guests are they
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,360	| IOT177 |	Use your ecosystem
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,640	| IOT177 |	Have a bunch of ports
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,664	| IOT177 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,432	| IOT177 |	4
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:50,016	| IOT177 |	Business-oriented stuff that you don't want the gas to get access
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:54,112	| IOT177 |	And it does it all in a way that somebody who's an opposite networking
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,648	| IOT177 |	Turn it on to make it run
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:59,744	| IOT177 |	Okay so that's orbi problem we've been talking about your Insight line so how is that different
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| IOT177 |	Inside
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:07,168	| IOT177 |	Kind of plays the next roll up orbi Pro is really designed as a turnkey for a do-it-yourself net
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:07,936	| IOT177 |	Working person
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,728	| IOT177 |	I like to say or be broke
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,544	| IOT177 |	Is for people who don't know what a VLAN is
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:16,640	| IOT177 |	And so can you can set up a grade secure business Network
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:22,016	| IOT177 |	And not know anything about networking whatsoever but if you want to go to the next level then inside
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:25,344	| IOT177 |	Bridges that Gap it's both simple to use its
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,112	| IOT177 |	Common English
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,648	| IOT177 |	Straight boards
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:31,744	| IOT177 |	30 let you get in and start dealing with a real complexities of
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,024	| IOT177 |	More scale-out Network
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:35,072	| IOT177 |	What are some of those complexities
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:41,984	| IOT177 |	You're the most common one is that people like to think about structuring their networking isolating various
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:45,056	| IOT177 |	Is domains one common thing I hear for my customers is
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,336	| IOT177 |	I want all my
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,640	| IOT177 |	Internet of things on a separate VLAN
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:52,224	| IOT177 |	So that my home network my base business network is
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:53,504	| IOT177 |	Completely isolated
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:58,368	| IOT177 |	Well that requires vlans that requires Port assignments on
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:04,256	| IOT177 |	Switches and a lot of stuff that kind of goes to the next level inside allows you to be able to go to
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,792	| IOT177 |	Full Security in Attica
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:10,144	| IOT177 |	Where can I go to find out more about insight and
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:10,656	| IOT177 |	Orbi Pro
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:12,448	| IOT177 |	Www
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:16,288	| IOT177 |	Netgear.com inside
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:29,344	| IOT177 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your home Stacy Higginbotham and today's guest is
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,136	| IOT177 |	Jennings
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:33,184	| IOT177 |	Who is CEO of
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,208	| IOT177 |	Hi Alison how are you doing
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,256	| IOT177 |	I'm so well how are you
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,792	| IOT177 |	I am excited
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:41,632	| IOT177 |	Because we have talked for like years almost about
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,656	| IOT177 |	How we're going to use the black
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:46,240	| IOT177 |	So let's Orion people in
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:46,752	| IOT177 |	And tell them
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,032	| IOT177 |	Where
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,848	| IOT177 |	Filament darted in the iot
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:51,872	| IOT177 |	Originally
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:56,736	| IOT177 |	To think quite a while to get into this realm
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,272	| IOT177 |	Having an engineering problem
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,136	| IOT177 |	Salishan
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,952	| IOT177 |	She was problem and then from there it's always hard to realize
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,328	| IOT177 |	And now we're squarely in this marriage
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,120	| IOT177 |	Between the blockchain and the internet
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:13,888	| IOT177 |	Awesome
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,704	| IOT177 |	We should probably talk a little bit about the hardware problem that you encounter
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:20,544	| IOT177 |	I think it's important only because there's a lot of us height in this phase I mean
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:22,592	| IOT177 |	You taking and everything for just barely IP
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,360	| IOT177 |	And you had blocked
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,664	| IOT177 |	You got to get this like
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:26,176	| IOT177 |	Meda hajt
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:29,760	| IOT177 |	Originally address that we were
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:34,624	| IOT177 |	We had a lot of customers to pay for Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:36,672	| IOT177 |	Product they wanted to pay for it
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,208	| IOT177 |	Korea score per month
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,000	| IOT177 |	Princeton
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,888	| IOT177 |	Upfront
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:51,008	| IOT177 |	In the technical in the financial world who called capital
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:53,824	| IOT177 |	Or capex versus
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,384	| IOT177 |	The common terminal Airlines
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,176	| IOT177 |	So what we ended up having this
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:00,992	| IOT177 |	Orangewood company saying what they want to pay for this
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,064	| IOT177 |	Topic
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,088	| IOT177 |	Requirements
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,904	| IOT177 |	Is it that way
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,672	| IOT177 |	Didn't have a good way to
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,488	| IOT177 |	On the device
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,096	| IOT177 |	And so it is a fundamental engineering problem
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:21,216	| IOT177 |	Any physical device that isn't always online
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,264	| IOT177 |	It turns out that this is a very large problem
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,152	| IOT177 |	Century there's some famous
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,200	| IOT177 |	Problems
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,224	| IOT177 |	Sybil attack
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:35,040	| IOT177 |	These are well-known.
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,576	| IOT177 |	Talk and it turns out that the block
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,880	| IOT177 |	Happened to be a recent
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,672	| IOT177 |	Invention that had address
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,184	| IOT177 |	Does
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,512	| IOT177 |	When we start looking
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,536	| IOT177 |	It's called
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,584	| IOT177 |	Sales problem with some aspects of
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:51,680	| IOT177 |	OKC
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,448	| IOT177 |	You guys
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,472	| IOT177 |	Your solution
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,520	| IOT177 |	Build your own car
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:36:00,128	| IOT177 |	It was because we needed to be able to store
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,408	| IOT177 |	The cryptographic keys
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:01,920	| IOT177 |	For the block
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:05,248	| IOT177 |	And the only way we knew how to do that
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,064	| IOT177 |	SPX
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,088	| IOT177 |	The Cure
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:13,952	| IOT177 |	And so that's where we went down the throat if you know originally again only happy
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:14,720	| IOT177 |	Aspire
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:16,768	| IOT177 |	She asked if I censor device
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:19,584	| IOT177 |	We moved now squarely into bring it up
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,632	| IOT177 |	Security of the hardware aspect of making
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,704	| IOT177 |	By having the heart
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:25,472	| IOT177 |	Secure element
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:27,264	| IOT177 |	That we built
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:30,848	| IOT177 |	Okay but that's actually not what you got
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,432	| IOT177 |	It was nice
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,224	| IOT177 |	Talk about is a startup
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:39,296	| IOT177 |	I'm going to solve this problem
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,320	| IOT177 |	Now I have
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,856	| IOT177 |	Exactly
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:47,232	| IOT177 |	What were you trying to do 6 years ago you saw this opportunity
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:50,560	| IOT177 |	Wow we could do x what was so cool about those ideas
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,168	| IOT177 |	Write this a good question to the pathway
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,032	| IOT177 |	Industrial
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:02,080	| IOT177 |	Ceviche like Sportsman 1000
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,200	| IOT177 |	The world in the Ford motor
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:11,296	| IOT177 |	These were the companies that we thought wanted Industrial iot
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,344	| IOT177 |	Coming iot
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,624	| IOT177 |	And it's
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,392	| IOT177 |	Partially true
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,952	| IOT177 |	The truth is that we found out
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,720	| IOT177 |	Hard struggle
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,280	| IOT177 |	There are
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:24,864	| IOT177 |	Several people in the company who do want it but there are also several people who do not
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:28,960	| IOT177 |	Can often be towed Enterprise
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,264	| IOT177 |	And the only one way to learn this lesson
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:35,104	| IOT177 |	And then have the field close shutdown
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,384	| IOT177 |	Sanya Let's Ride
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:37,408	| IOT177 |	Because of the startup
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:39,712	| IOT177 |	Everything is based
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:43,040	| IOT177 |	Clearly
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:43,552	| IOT177 |	Industrial
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:47,136	| IOT177 |	When we solve the problem for having a little device
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:52,000	| IOT177 |	Payable on going contract or peruse
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:52,512	| IOT177 |	Economics
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:54,816	| IOT177 |	We've been had that moment
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:55,840	| IOT177 |	And which one
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:38:00,960	| IOT177 |	We can do this part 5 what happens if we allow our
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:02,240	| IOT177 |	Officetel
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:03,264	| IOT177 |	Their products
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,592	| IOT177 |	Another words what happened
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:07,360	| IOT177 |	Product
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:10,432	| IOT177 |	This could also be economic
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:13,760	| IOT177 |	And if they could be does it allow them to have him
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:17,600	| IOT177 |	And more importantly does it get
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,136	| IOT177 |	Those who use the veto it
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:22,720	| IOT177 |	Now say oh heck yeah
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:24,512	| IOT177 |	It's about sweater
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:29,120	| IOT177 |	Thule rack today but through a lot of hard lessons by trying to sell Industrial iot
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:30,912	| IOT177 |	Stacy very difficult
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:35,776	| IOT177 |	Okay so what turns a little bit more so when you say
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,312	| IOT177 |	Product
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,848	| IOT177 |	Economic machine
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,128	| IOT177 |	Giving it economic
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:40,896	| IOT177 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:43,968	| IOT177 |	Is that simply like vending machine have the trust
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,504	| IOT177 |	And value
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,272	| IOT177 |	Store TUMI
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,832	| IOT177 |	How would we
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,880	| IOT177 |	It's a great question it's an important point so
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,696	| IOT177 |	Stoneham thinks about making machines economic
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:56,256	| IOT177 |	I can make sure what we mean is that machines by default
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,792	| IOT177 |	Can't our infrastructure Maybe
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:00,352	| IOT177 |	Car trucks
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,888	| IOT177 |	Carpal
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,680	| IOT177 |	Those are awesome
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,496	| IOT177 |	Not economic nature meaning they can't
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,080	| IOT177 |	Transaction value
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,896	| IOT177 |	Some people value is data other people
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:13,408	| IOT177 |	Value is
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:18,784	| IOT177 |	Now what that looks like it's when you start Splenda forget it looks like a cryptocurrency
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:23,392	| IOT177 |	But if those infrastructure pieces or less machine
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,160	| IOT177 |	Could
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,440	| IOT177 |	Transact value
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:27,232	| IOT177 |	Or trade or exchange you know even
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:31,072	| IOT177 |	Can musically be built upon a new business models that allow us to do
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:37,984	| IOT177 |	Simple machine to have the core components required
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:38,752	| IOT177 |	In order to
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,032	| IOT177 |	Transact
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,056	| IOT177 |	Extension
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:43,360	| IOT177 |	Hair be paid or a test
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:45,408	| IOT177 |	2
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,944	| IOT177 |	True that the minutes happened
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:49,504	| IOT177 |	Cryptographically Exchange
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:52,832	| IOT177 |	Aggregate
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:54,624	| IOT177 |	Together so let's actually
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:57,184	| IOT177 |	Take a step-by-step because this is a pretty
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:59,232	| IOT177 |	I think it's not a hard concept but it
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,512	| IOT177 |	Examples totally help
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,048	| IOT177 |	Let's go with something
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,680	| IOT177 |	Listen Vision something we know and love
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:08,704	| IOT177 |	Now with
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,496	| IOT177 |	The machines having this inherent
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:12,032	| IOT177 |	Capability unit comes from
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:12,800	| IOT177 |	Implanting
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,592	| IOT177 |	Write in cars in
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:19,712	| IOT177 |	If you take Vehicles today are usually operated by
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:23,552	| IOT177 |	People usually own the vehicle or pay regulation
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,648	| IOT177 |	And usually also pay other
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,696	| IOT177 |	Entity to operate a vehicle
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,232	| IOT177 |	Insurance
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,792	| IOT177 |	Or sometimes a ticket to a highway patrolman
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:36,864	| IOT177 |	For a toll road these are various aspects of
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:40,192	| IOT177 |	Payment.
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,216	| IOT177 |	Need to make
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,264	| IOT177 |	In order to use music
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,848	| IOT177 |	So when I start talking about how this might look differently with her
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:50,944	| IOT177 |	As we see in the future on the horizon of autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:52,736	| IOT177 |	They'll still need to
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,528	| IOT177 |	Transact on behalf of
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,832	| IOT177 |	Either their owner operator the writer
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:57,856	| IOT177 |	The manufacturer
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:41:00,928	| IOT177 |	Somebody will need to pay for the fuel to recharge
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,208	| IOT177 |	The ticket
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:02,976	| IOT177 |	Find
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,024	| IOT177 |	Toll road fee and so these are all
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,840	| IOT177 |	And there's just not
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:08,608	| IOT177 |	8 weight
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,376	| IOT177 |	To do that today
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:12,192	| IOT177 |	This is like a coyote today is literally like
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,472	| IOT177 |	Me too
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:20,128	| IOT177 |	We had gray background website sir Tim berners-lee invented the world wide web and we're all excited about make your own web
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:24,224	| IOT177 |	And then came along.
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,784	| IOT177 |	E-commerce which allowed the internet
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,296	| IOT177 |	2B Transit
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:35,232	| IOT177 |	To be transacted as well because what happened when we brought e-commerce the internet
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:36,768	| IOT177 |	We got companies like Amazon
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:37,792	| IOT177 |	Alibaba
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,560	| IOT177 |	EBay
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,096	| IOT177 |	How old is amazing
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:43,168	| IOT177 |	Exactly could not have existed
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,704	| IOT177 |	Of the internet
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:48,032	| IOT177 |	So when we can bring the future Alibaba
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:49,056	| IOT177 |	Amazon eBay
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:51,616	| IOT177 |	Could be built upon the machine
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:55,199	| IOT177 |	The Stick of payments for a moment longer
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,735	| IOT177 |	A lot of people look at this
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,015	| IOT177 |	This is like a way to enable macros
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:41:59,807	| IOT177 |	So
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,623	| IOT177 |	I feel like in some ways that's a bit limiting but we
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:03,903	| IOT177 |	Do need a way to do my
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,439	| IOT177 |	Transactions so can you
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:05,951	| IOT177 |	Give us your vision
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:09,279	| IOT177 |	Yes microtransactions are funny
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:11,071	| IOT177 |	Because they are buried
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,631	| IOT177 |	So many ways but the technology
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,399	| IOT177 |	In the trees
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| IOT177 |	Directions for
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,751	| IOT177 |	He almost empty Commerce
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:21,311	| IOT177 |	Publishers
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,383	| IOT177 |	You're going to pay podcast
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,431	| IOT177 |	We were going to pay a lot of people a lot of things
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:28,223	| IOT177 |	Never really
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:31,039	| IOT177 |	And a big reason why
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:33,599	| IOT177 |	Did the minimum transaction fee to make
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:36,927	| IOT177 |	In the traditional credit card or electronic
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:39,743	| IOT177 |	World that we had up until 10 years ago was still
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,023	| IOT177 |	Too high for microchip
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,815	| IOT177 |	Do you like going to the ATM
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:44,863	| IOT177 |	And clean out $0.30.
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,655	| IOT177 |	$2
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,423	| IOT177 |	It just doesn't
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:54,079	| IOT177 |	I didn't know in this actually going to do that so there is an aspect to this that we're looking at that cryptocurrency
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,871	| IOT177 |	Allow for the pie
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,639	| IOT177 |	Possibility
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,175	| IOT177 |	Have microtransaction
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:58,943	| IOT177 |	Capability
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,063	| IOT177 |	This isn't always
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,903	| IOT177 |	Spaceballs
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:13,023	| IOT177 |	That public blockchain such as Bitcoin and ethereum are quite expensive right now
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:17,119	| IOT177 |	Taxi transact on internally want coffee maker conduction test
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:21,215	| IOT177 |	Luckily there are some new technologies in that state
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:21,983	| IOT177 |	Network that
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:26,847	| IOT177 |	Requirements
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:29,663	| IOT177 |	All that is to say that this technology
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,175	| IOT177 |	Along with
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,503	| IOT177 |	Development is setting up
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,527	| IOT177 |	The situation
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,295	| IOT177 |	Very nicely
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,831	| IOT177 |	To actually be able to
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:37,855	| IOT177 |	Could you microtransaction
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,879	| IOT177 |	At the hardware level
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:39,647	| IOT177 |	Finally
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:41,695	| IOT177 |	It only took us like 30 years ago
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,743	| IOT177 |	That's how I feel about a lot of
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:47,839	| IOT177 |	Now it's actually here
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:49,631	| IOT177 |	So
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,167	| IOT177 |	Let's talk about value
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,191	| IOT177 |	Because this is
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:54,239	| IOT177 |	Cryptocurrency hype
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:55,519	| IOT177 |	I think a lot of people
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:57,311	| IOT177 |	Don't think about the idea
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,591	| IOT177 |	Attestation
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:00,639	| IOT177 |	Update on saying hey this came from here
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,943	| IOT177 |	It's a really important thing and I'll just
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:03,711	| IOT177 |	Sherwood
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:04,479	| IOT177 |	Our listeners
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:07,551	| IOT177 |	I was talking with someone from Bosch and they were talking about
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:10,367	| IOT177 |	Connecting trucks please of trucks
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:14,463	| IOT177 |	And it would be really beneficial to have some sort of decentralized way
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:16,255	| IOT177 |	For those trucks to identify
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| IOT177 |	Car self driving
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:19,327	| IOT177 |	Identify that they can join
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:21,887	| IOT177 |	Time it take advantage
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,423	| IOT177 |	Cartoon VR so
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:26,239	| IOT177 |	Machines being able to
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:29,823	| IOT177 |	Data or Truss
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:31,359	| IOT177 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,639	| IOT177 |	Because you know a lot of
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,039	| IOT177 |	Networking
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:40,575	| IOT177 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,135	| IOT177 |	That's better
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:45,695	| IOT177 |	Detective chief
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:48,767	| IOT177 |	And I think that economics
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:53,375	| IOT177 |	Not even when people sell things are always after the data
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,191	| IOT177 |	Catchphrase
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,007	| IOT177 |	Expected we think of it
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:01,823	| IOT177 |	If you look at information or what
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:05,151	| IOT177 |	Definition Theory data is the Bottom Rung of this
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:06,943	| IOT177 |	Definition
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:08,479	| IOT177 |	Because data and then on top of that
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:10,783	| IOT177 |	Information which is data that
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:11,551	| IOT177 |	Organized
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:14,623	| IOT177 |	And then on top of that information
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:15,647	| IOT177 |	Categorized
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:21,535	| IOT177 |	And then you have your wisdom which is overlooking based
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,559	| IOT177 |	Previous knowledge
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:27,167	| IOT177 |	Proactive
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:30,239	| IOT177 |	Siri and Alexa kind of think about how we
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,263	| IOT177 |	Deal with data
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:33,055	| IOT177 |	Is it similar thing that we
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,847	| IOT177 |	Headed to dig into the economics
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:37,407	| IOT177 |	Is not data
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:38,943	| IOT177 |	Economics
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:41,503	| IOT177 |	And then on top of that you start to have
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,295	| IOT177 |	Party or participate
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:43,807	| IOT177 |	Cinemark
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:47,903	| IOT177 |	Look up. You start to have things like
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:49,695	| IOT177 |	Transaction demand
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| IOT177 |	Reputation is like Wednesday
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:55,839	| IOT177 |	Like I will trust you again cuz I trusted you in the back
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,607	| IOT177 |	Every time
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:59,423	| IOT177 |	So it's interesting because it's parallel
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:00,959	| IOT177 |	Field
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:04,031	| IOT177 |	And both of them are just as powerful as the other
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,823	| IOT177 |	But we spent a lot of type of data
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,359	| IOT177 |	In the tech world
EDL	00:46:09,151	00:46:10,431	| IOT177 |	Talking about values
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,735	| IOT177 |	Requires
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,783	| IOT177 |	Trust to be absolutely rock-solid
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:18,111	| IOT177 |	If you can't trust the other party
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:20,415	| IOT177 |	Your reputation for the park & Market Apartments
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,719	| IOT177 |	Don't know
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:24,511	| IOT177 |	And I thought they were most attacks happen
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:25,791	| IOT177 |	Today in the cryptocurrency
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:28,095	| IOT177 |	Space is like trying to steal cheese in the Trap
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:31,423	| IOT177 |	So when we think about this we really do want
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,447	| IOT177 |	Established
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:36,287	| IOT177 |	Really strong roots of traffic and then on top of that let others build
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:37,055	| IOT177 |	Their applications
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,615	| IOT177 |	Let's break down this
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,639	| IOT177 |	Concept of trust from
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,175	| IOT177 |	Economic theory
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:43,455	| IOT177 |	Because
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:46,015	| IOT177 |	What you're talking about is just that it's
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:50,623	| IOT177 |	Sure it's trust that it's secure in your stuff won't be stolen or
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,951	| IOT177 |	I can't be value cannot be
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:54,719	| IOT177 |	Temperature
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:55,487	| IOT177 |	Correct
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:57,791	| IOT177 |	Because there's also an element of trust in
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:00,607	| IOT177 |	Reputations like what I think of is a person
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:02,911	| IOT177 |	Trusting another /
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,703	| IOT177 |	That's more reputational
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:05,471	| IOT177 |	Incorrect
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,495	| IOT177 |	I think so
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:08,543	| IOT177 |	Okay because the tech companies
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:13,407	| IOT177 |	I would look at them and I think going into eye
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,967	| IOT177 |	Abstract for a lot of people as machines being
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:16,735	| IOT177 |	Transaction
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:17,759	| IOT177 |	Build it
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,527	| IOT177 |	A lot of companies
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:21,087	| IOT177 |	The reputation Trust
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:24,415	| IOT177 |	It's becoming increasingly clear that
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,695	| IOT177 |	If you're going to say
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:26,719	| IOT177 |	You're going to hand
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:27,999	| IOT177 |	Company the keys to
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:28,511	| IOT177 |	Creative me
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:31,071	| IOT177 |	Some sort of aspect
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:32,351	| IOT177 |	Business weather
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:32,863	| IOT177 |	Partner with
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:35,935	| IOT177 |	That relationship
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:37,727	| IOT177 |	In the reputation entrust their beak
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:42,335	| IOT177 |	So much more important and I don't see a lot of companies thinking that way
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:43,871	| IOT177 |	I think that maybe
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:48,991	| IOT177 |	Completely agree in concurrence I don't even see it in our Clinic
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:50,015	| IOT177 |	No fear in other areas
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:53,087	| IOT177 |	What happens when trust breaks down
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:56,415	| IOT177 |	It can be pretty dense metal can be able to trust
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:59,487	| IOT177 |	Perspective
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:02,559	| IOT177 |	And I completely agree with you.
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,119	| IOT177 |	Used trucks
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:05,631	| IOT177 |	URC
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:09,471	| IOT177 |	Then when losing out on possible future capability and
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,751	| IOT177 |	Quite frankly
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:13,311	| IOT177 |	Payment issue later because we have trust based in
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:17,919	| IOT177 |	We don't have it yet we're not quite there I do believe it starts with people reconsidering what trust means
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:22,271	| IOT177 |	Okay well that got deep real
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:26,879	| IOT177 |	It's something that I'm not sure we can
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:28,927	| IOT177 |	But if you have any tips
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:30,463	| IOT177 |	Stephen Thompson
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:31,487	| IOT177 |	Blase about
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:33,791	| IOT177 |	Really so important
EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:36,607	| IOT177 |	Ways to establish real partnership
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:40,191	| IOT177 |	What are the kind of things that a company should be
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:42,495	| IOT177 |	Communicating and also internalizing
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:47,359	| IOT177 |	Considering this as a first class property
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:49,663	| IOT177 |	Property
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,735	| IOT177 |	Fire today
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:54,271	| IOT177 |	It's not unlike
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:55,295	| IOT177 |	Traditional

EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,231	| IOT177 |	And then we had the Home Depot
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:05,279	| IOT177 |	Target another hacks where
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:09,119	| IOT177 |	This is a requirement this is a necessary thing for
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:09,887	| IOT177 |	To take seriously
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:14,495	| IOT177 |	I do believe that you know
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:19,359	| IOT177 |	Sir I'm not sure he could probably fall under CIA
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,895	| IOT177 |	Regardless
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:25,503	| IOT177 |	Somewhere where somebody champions
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,783	| IOT177 |	I need to be treated
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:28,575	| IOT177 |	Because it will be one of us
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:30,111	| IOT177 |	Lightable area
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:31,647	| IOT177 |	Where are you again
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,671	| IOT177 |	In some ways
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:34,719	| IOT177 |	Traditional human or social

EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:54,943	| IOT177 |	Much more broken up
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:59,039	| IOT177 |	Treated with respect. Whatever type of I don't want cause a liability but
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:49:59,807	| IOT177 |	Responsibility
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:00,831	| IOT177 |	Of companies

EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:07,743	| IOT177 |	Where's that they must also
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:10,559	| IOT177 |	Have some aspect of responsibility around the

EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:24,639	| IOT177 |	It could be something it has

EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:33,087	| IOT177 |	Is kind of crazy hard
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:33,855	| IOT177 |	I think about
