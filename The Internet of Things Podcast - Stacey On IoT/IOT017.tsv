EDL	00:00:03,840	00:00:10,240	| IOT017 |	Hey everyone welcome to the inner
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:11,520	| IOT017 |	Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:14,080	| IOT017 |	I am Stacey Higginbotham and I have my co-host
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,616	| IOT017 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,616	00:00:17,152	| IOT017 |	And we are here to guide you
EDL	00:00:17,152	00:00:19,456	| IOT017 |	This week show we're going to start talking about
EDL	00:00:19,968	00:00:20,736	| IOT017 |	Hacked cars
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:25,088	| IOT017 |	Should you be afraid the answer is probably yes we're going to talk about
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:26,880	| IOT017 |	Quirky the future of wink
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:29,184	| IOT017 |	And we are going to talk about
EDL	00:00:29,184	00:00:32,000	| IOT017 |	Heaven's latest and greatest smart home setup
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:33,280	| IOT017 |	We're going to talk
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,048	| IOT017 |	To Chris Bruce
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:38,912	| IOT017 |	About why crowdfunding is no longer the best way to fund a
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:39,936	| IOT017 |	Hardware
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:43,008	| IOT017 |	Alright let's kick it off
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:45,568	| IOT017 |	Have it wired has an awesome
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:46,080	| IOT017 |	Some story
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,128	| IOT017 |	On
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:51,968	| IOT017 |	This dude driving down the freeway in St Louis and all of a sudden
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:53,504	| IOT017 |	Hackers took over his
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,272	| IOT017 |	Chrysler
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,040	| IOT017 |	Jeep
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:57,088	| IOT017 |	Chrysler Jeep LeBaron
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:00:58,624	| IOT017 |	Which is not Apple
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:01,184	| IOT017 |	It is a Jeep which is
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:04,000	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:06,048	| IOT017 |	It actually sounds pretty darn scary and
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:09,376	| IOT017 |	Yeah this is
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:11,424	| IOT017 |	Well concerning for a few reasons
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:15,520	| IOT017 |	A lot of people are talking about this today that they were recording the show
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,800	| IOT017 |	Essentially
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:21,152	| IOT017 |	Let me just get his name right here it was Adam I'm sorry Andy Greenberg
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:22,688	| IOT017 |	Who writes on
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:25,248	| IOT017 |	Security topics for Wired and what he did is he
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:29,088	| IOT017 |	Did a little experiment with two people Charlie Miller and
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,112	| IOT017 |	Chris Blazek
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:34,976	| IOT017 |	And those two guys are are hackers there known hackers they working
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:39,584	| IOT017 |	That one is work for the NSA I mean they paid their in the industry
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,376	| IOT017 |	I'm security and they have since
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:45,472	| IOT017 |	Going on and looked at different exploits for things in this time
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,264	| IOT017 |	It's connected cars and specifically
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:50,592	| IOT017 |	I think it's a 2014 Jeep Cherokee that
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:53,664	| IOT017 |	They were hacking into as the author
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:54,432	| IOT017 |	Andy was
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,200	| IOT017 |	Driving
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:56,992	| IOT017 |	On Highway 40 in St Louis
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,832	| IOT017 |	He says he was driving 70 miles an hour when the exploit began to
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:06,976	| IOT017 |	Take hold so let's just let's just pause for a second on what happened here and I'm really surprised they actually did the
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:10,304	| IOT017 |	In actual traffic on a highway
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:13,376	| IOT017 |	But essentially the two known hackers
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,936	| IOT017 |	Took control of his vehicle from afar
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:18,240	| IOT017 |	They weren't in the car they weren't near the car
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:22,080	| IOT017 |	They were able to cut the transmission cut the brakes
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,176	| IOT017 |	Change the radio station change the climate control excetera
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,712	| IOT017 |	Turn on windshield wipers
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,736	| IOT017 |	All kinds of things
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,272	| IOT017 |	Let's pause for a moment
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,088	| IOT017 |	Once you said cut the brakes
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:37,184	| IOT017 |	And they actually power down is transmission which meant he couldn't
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:42,560	| IOT017 |	Control the acceleration or anything in his car that's where I would focus like the fact that he couldn't
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,864	| IOT017 |	Move his windshield wipers at that point or
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,888	| IOT017 |	The radio station
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,168	| IOT017 |	Like I don't
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:50,240	| IOT017 |	Okay from a safety perspective I guess
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,008	| IOT017 |	Probably not
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,056	| IOT017 |	It would certainly not as big a deal is
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,848	| IOT017 |	As having control of the
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:57,408	| IOT017 |	Are the cars actually no acceleration and so on
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,456	| IOT017 |	They could even control the steering wheel
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,248	| IOT017 |	But only when the car is in reverse
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:05,856	| IOT017 |	They think they can do on the cars going forward with this to be a full remote control on hack
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,904	| IOT017 |	And they did it from 10 miles away
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:12,512	| IOT017 |	And they did it in this is this is relevant they did it actually over the cars cellular now
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,864	| IOT017 |	I think she took the Jeep Cherokee has the Uconnect system
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:20,192	| IOT017 |	Which I think that this service is provided by
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,752	| IOT017 |	Sprint and what they do is they used a Sprint burner phone
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,312	| IOT017 |	And they were actually able to remotely
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,896	| IOT017 |	Do the space device-to-device connection from miles away
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,664	| IOT017 |	Exactly
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,432	| IOT017 |	So
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| IOT017 |	What should we learn from
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:38,112	| IOT017 |	Well first of all don't do don't test me think on the highway I still can't believe they did this I could have done this anywhere but
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,648	| IOT017 |	Whatever that's beside the point
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,952	| IOT017 |	What do we learn from this that
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:47,584	| IOT017 |	The car industry this is actually something we already know the car industry does not move quickly model years or once a year
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:54,496	| IOT017 |	They changes far slower than the Consumer Electronics industry and yet they're putting consumer electronics capabilities
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,264	| IOT017 |	In the vehicles
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,800	| IOT017 |	So if nothing else
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,616	| IOT017 |	The car industry as a whole I'm not trying to
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,152	| IOT017 |	The point fingers here at
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,200	| IOT017 |	Chrysler at by any means cuz
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,992	| IOT017 |	This could have been done on any
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,040	| IOT017 |	Brand vehicle has got to connect a car
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,832	| IOT017 |	They all have to start taking this
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,368	| IOT017 |	Far more seriously
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,928	| IOT017 |	These two hackers demonstrated
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,488	| IOT017 |	Similar things on Toyota Prius 3 years ago
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:19,583	| IOT017 |	And Toyota said well yeah but you had to be in the car to do and at the time they did
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:22,911	| IOT017 |	But now these guys are proving you don't have to be in a car to do it so
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,959	| IOT017 |	The industry as a whole must
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,751	| IOT017 |	Begin to take this seriously
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,799	| IOT017 |	As a consumer I'm a little concerned
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,591	| IOT017 |	I mean I don't know what else I can say
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,895	| IOT017 |	But I'm a little concerned I do not have a connected vehicle
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:35,455	| IOT017 |	I don't think you do either at this point
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,735	| IOT017 |	Oh God now my car doesn't
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:40,319	| IOT017 |	But you're safe and don't worry you're safe
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,599	| IOT017 |	I like IHOP
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,111	| IOT017 |	Automatic win
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:48,255	| IOT017 |	So we had actually episode 2 of the iot podcast I had Josh Corman on the show
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,047	| IOT017 |	We talked about this very issue
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,327	| IOT017 |	Josh is
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,607	| IOT017 |	Part of I am the cavalry
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:57,215	| IOT017 |	It's an organization that's made up of Security Professionals
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:02,591	| IOT017 |	And it's purely voluntary their nonprofit that is trying to educate the media the government
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,663	| IOT017 |	Anybody who will listen basically
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,199	| IOT017 |	About
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:09,247	| IOT017 |	Security for connected devices
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,063	| IOT017 |	And one of their first efforts was the
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,343	| IOT017 |	Automotive industry
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,671	| IOT017 |	So Senator Markey introduced a bill
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:19,487	| IOT017 |	This week that is designed to protect
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,767	| IOT017 |	Consumers against
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,071	| IOT017 |	Breaches of privacy and security from
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,119	| IOT017 |	Did killer hacking basically
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:32,031	| IOT017 |	I'm in a lot of those are similar to kind of the principles outlined in the automotive framework that I
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,055	| IOT017 |	I am the cavalry
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:33,823	| IOT017 |	Had
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,127	| IOT017 |	Post so they're things like
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,455	| IOT017 |	Basically if a car has been hacked is there a way that
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| IOT017 |	Vehicle
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,039	| IOT017 |	Shows that has been hacked like a trail
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,063	| IOT017 |	That you can
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,343	| IOT017 |	Kind of show and prove
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:48,671	| IOT017 |	Is there a disclosure policy that
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,999	| IOT017 |	It shows what you do if a car has been hacked
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,327	| IOT017 |	And a way to communicate to customers what is happened
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:59,167	| IOT017 |	Can your vehicle be securely updated in a prompt manner
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,447	| IOT017 |	So like 4
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,239	| IOT017 |	Example this this recent
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,263	| IOT017 |	Cheap thing
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,799	| IOT017 |	The way that the update
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,103	| IOT017 |	Happens is an over-the-air it is
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,383	| IOT017 |	USB drive
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,663	| IOT017 |	Wish
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,687	| IOT017 |	You either have to
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,807	| IOT017 |	You can actually download the the update onto a USB drive yourself
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:18,111	| IOT017 |	Or what most people probably do is go to a dealer
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,927	| IOT017 |	Or really what most people do is sell be like
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,975	| IOT017 |	That sucks
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:27,071	| IOT017 |	So these are some real issues I know with
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,351	| IOT017 |	BMW
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:31,167	| IOT017 |	And I think we talked about this on that that episode
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,935	| IOT017 |	At the podcast
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,727	| IOT017 |	They actually had some
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,519	| IOT017 |	Walking
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,055	| IOT017 |	Issues and they actually
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:39,871	| IOT017 |	Change their system to be an over the air update
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,639	| IOT017 |	To deal with it
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,175	| IOT017 |	And that kind of
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:42,943	| IOT017 |	Worked for them
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,479	| IOT017 |	But in the past
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:49,087	| IOT017 |	Auto manufacturers didn't want to do over there updates cuz they perceived that to be a c
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:49,599	| IOT017 |	Security risk
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:55,231	| IOT017 |	So in a lot of ways there's like a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't kind of
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,047	| IOT017 |	Feeling and mentality among these guys so
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| IOT017 |	Got episodes really into
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,631	| IOT017 |	Sing this whole issue is really in
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,143	| IOT017 |	Interesting
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:07,007	| IOT017 |	There's very much a sense here that we cannot ignore this any longer
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,823	| IOT017 |	And hopefully the industry
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,895	| IOT017 |	I I would hope not I mean I would hope that
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:16,735	| IOT017 |	They don't wait too long to wear somebody gets hacked and seriously injured
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,039	| IOT017 |	Before they actually take action
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,063	| IOT017 |	You hate to see that happen
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,343	| IOT017 |	So that's
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:24,415	| IOT017 |	That's the biggest challenges in getting their attention now is good
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,951	| IOT017 |	I don't even think
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:31,583	| IOT017 |	Because I don't think it's really out of the realm of possibility that we're going to have driverless vehicles at some point
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,887	| IOT017 |	It's not really a question of if it's question of when
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:34,911	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,447	| IOT017 |	At that point
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT017 |	You know
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:41,311	| IOT017 |	It's something that you pretty much given all control over to a system in the car
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,847	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,383	| IOT017 |	Did the situation could be even worse
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:49,503	| IOT017 |	That's something we talked about or is that something the bill covers and something that this
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:53,087	| IOT017 |	Standard the security standard that these guys published
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,367	| IOT017 |	Talks about and that's kind of
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:08:01,023	| IOT017 |	It's called air gapping or physical isolation so not every system should be able to connect to the Internet so
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,071	| IOT017 |	What are the critical systems
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:06,655	| IOT017 |	It's like maybe the steering should never be connected to anything
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,167	| IOT017 |	Disconnected
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,727	| IOT017 |	Maybe acceleration should
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| IOT017 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,055	| IOT017 |	I mean there are definite advantages
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,359	| IOT017 |	To having that especially if we're talking about self
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:15,871	| IOT017 |	Self-driving vehicle
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,919	| IOT017 |	So how do we how do we build that in
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT017 |	Again
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,039	| IOT017 |	Real questions that we need to figure out
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,367	| IOT017 |	And I think also this mentality and I don't think
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:32,511	| IOT017 |	Detroit or you know the big Automotive manufacturers really have this yet I think some of them do so Tesla I think
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:36,095	| IOT017 |	I think probably some of the German car manufacturers are getting there
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,631	| IOT017 |	Is this idea that
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,935	| IOT017 |	You can actually build a connected
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,215	| IOT017 |	If ice and have it
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,775	| IOT017 |	Stay static and secure right
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,823	| IOT017 |	Nothing Bill disconnected
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,591	| IOT017 |	Ecstatic
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,871	| IOT017 |	It's always going
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| IOT017 |	To be continually attacked
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,479	| IOT017 |	So we have to start building things that are going to be
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,783	| IOT017 |	Continually updated and reacting
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| IOT017 |	To their environment
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,367	| IOT017 |	And you know the attacks that are going to happen to them
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,951	| IOT017 |	That is a huge mentality shift not just for like
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,999	| IOT017 |	Automotive industry good for every industry
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,767	| IOT017 |	Is building anything
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,143	| IOT017 |	I agree and I would second your
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,655	| IOT017 |	Your point about
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| IOT017 |	Either firewalling off
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,215	| IOT017 |	Or
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,543	| IOT017 |	Sandboxing certain system so that they don't interact with each other
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:21,407	| IOT017 |	To to alleviate in a total control our Total Takeover that's that's an obvious problem

EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| IOT017 |	Came from wired
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,279	| IOT017 |	And we should probably move on
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,327	| IOT017 |	For all the people who are getting upset
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,655	| IOT017 |	Or maybe there's a couple New Yorkers out there like I don't have a car I don't care

EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,175	| IOT017 |	Let's move on to quirky
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,991	| IOT017 |	I was at the fortune brainstorm
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,759	| IOT017 |	Tech events
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| IOT017 |	Last week
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,039	| IOT017 |	In Aspen
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,831	| IOT017 |	If you listen to last week
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,343	| IOT017 |	Flicks podcast
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,623	| IOT017 |	Do you know this
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,975	| IOT017 |	And we got to see Ben Kaufman who is the CEO of quirky
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:43,583	| IOT017 |	Come out on stage and talk about both quirky's future
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,399	| IOT017 |	And where it is now and also Corky
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,703	| IOT017 |	Has a majority ownership stake in wink
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| IOT017 |	The connected home
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| IOT017 |	Gadget company
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,031	| IOT017 |	Software
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,567	| IOT017 |	Hub thing
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:56,895	| IOT017 |	And he talked to that was a terrible description
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,431	| IOT017 |	Why do they let me have a pot
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,455	| IOT017 |	I don't even know
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| IOT017 |	So he talked about kind of Winx future
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,319	| IOT017 |	So, bullet points there
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,367	| IOT017 |	Ben got up on stage
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,927	| IOT017 |	And it was a hilarious interview I really suggest
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,719	| IOT017 |	If you get a chance
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,535	| IOT017 |	Because it was a model of transparency
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,351	| IOT017 |	In the sense that he basically answered every question that was put to him
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,887	| IOT017 |	Really brutally honest
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,727	| IOT017 |	And he said basically that Corky is out of money
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| IOT017 |	It is seeking more money
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,055	| IOT017 |	He gave some advice like
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,847	| IOT017 |	Don't start a startup within a startup
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,943	| IOT017 |	And that's really hard to do and that's kind of why wink
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| IOT017 |	Was
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,223	| IOT017 |	For sale
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,783	| IOT017 |	Wink is no longer for sale
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:40,415	| IOT017 |	It sounds like he pulled wink after the security snafus that affected wink back in April
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,207	| IOT017 |	You guys may have remembered that
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| IOT017 |	They did a security update
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,071	| IOT017 |	April that kind of bricks a whole bunch of wink devices and
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:51,423	| IOT017 |	People who died that didn't come back online they had to physically mail their devices
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| IOT017 |	Back to
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,215	| IOT017 |	Quirky
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,983	| IOT017 |	And then
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,263	| IOT017 |	Corky had to reset them in
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,055	| IOT017 |	Email them back to the home
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:58,847	| IOT017 |	Was kind of a big
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| IOT017 |	Wakanda
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| IOT017 |	Brouhaha
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,199	| IOT017 |	Yeah it was it was not ideal for any
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:07,295	| IOT017 |	But they actually solve the problem that was awesome for them and
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,855	| IOT017 |	Homeowners did not lose their settings which was
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,623	| IOT017 |	Nice
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,903	| IOT017 |	So after that happened
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| IOT017 |	Cricket they took quirky off the mall
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,231	| IOT017 |	I'm sorry it took wink
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,999	| IOT017 |	Off the market
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:19,583	| IOT017 |	So what what we know now is that quirky
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,887	| IOT017 |	The parent company has $12 in cash
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,423	| IOT017 |	That is
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,703	| IOT017 |	Exceeded by its liabilities
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,519	| IOT017 |	None of its creditors want to put it in the bank
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,335	| IOT017 |	So then gave me his option
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:30,847	| IOT017 |	Order
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,663	| IOT017 |	The first is Wink raises no less than 5
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,223	| IOT017 |	And that gets it through a couple of years
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:41,599	| IOT017 |	His second option is quirky raises money and that's enough to help both businesses stay afloat
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,159	| IOT017 |	But it doesn't solve his problem that he
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,951	| IOT017 |	He's got two different businesses he's trying to
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,767	| IOT017 |	And he doesn't really want to run both of them
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,559	| IOT017 |	Is third option is he
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,607	| IOT017 |	Put swing back on the market
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,631	| IOT017 |	Which
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| IOT017 |	He's not really a fan of
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,727	| IOT017 |	In his fourth option is so quirky and wing
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,775	| IOT017 |	And he really doesn't
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:00,799	| IOT017 |	Is that all
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,383	| IOT017 |	He's assured me that
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,919	| IOT017 |	People who have won cups
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| IOT017 |	Do not worry about the
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,479	| IOT017 |	Detroit there wink hubs
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:12,063	| IOT017 |	Wink will find a buyer we got lots of information about
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,855	| IOT017 |	Wink it is by far
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,903	| IOT017 |	Like I usually successful platform
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,719	| IOT017 |	So that's amazing
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,023	| IOT017 |	He did promise me that
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:27,167	| IOT017 |	Future generation of wink Hub that's going to kind of have direct support for Hue and kind of
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:32,287	| IOT017 |	Lower latency and things like that that will start seeing that support come out very soon
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| IOT017 |	Which
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,919	| IOT017 |	I am really looking forward to I'm actually ready to plug in my wink and try it again
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:42,783	| IOT017 |	I'm here with that BS software update to the existing hubs
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,343	| IOT017 |	That is unclear he made it sound like
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,903	| IOT017 |	I could see that as soon as like the end of this month
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,975	| IOT017 |	I'm going to try it in
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| IOT017 |	MC
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,279	| IOT017 |	It could be a software update
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,071	| IOT017 |	Actually
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,143	| IOT017 |	I see that describe to me two different
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,935	| IOT017 |	So I'm going to plug in my existing
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,727	| IOT017 |	See
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:05,567	| IOT017 |	Cuz right now the way that wink supports the Philips Hue Lights for exam
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,663	| IOT017 |	Is problematic of the latency side because basically
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:14,271	| IOT017 |	You're talking to the wink Cloud that then calls out to the Hue cloud
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,575	| IOT017 |	That then says do this
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| IOT017 |	And then
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,623	| IOT017 |	All of this happen
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,927	| IOT017 |	It's a it's a chain of cloud events at that point
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,487	| IOT017 |	But they were saying that
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| IOT017 |	They will have
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,535	| IOT017 |	Philips cloud
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,047	| IOT017 |	Cloud
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,607	| IOT017 |	Integration so it should be faster
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,935	| IOT017 |	I'm unclear exactly
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,239	| IOT017 |	What that means
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,055	| IOT017 |	And no one's giving me real specifics
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,335	| IOT017 |	Because
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,943	| IOT017 |	What I just described sounds kind of like Cloud to Cloud integration right
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,247	| IOT017 |	So
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,527	| IOT017 |	I'm like oh really
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,319	| IOT017 |	How to set how to set differ from
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:51,391	| IOT017 |	And then it'll just be faster
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:54,463	| IOT017 |	So if the net result is it faster
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:54,975	| IOT017 |	That's all.
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| IOT017 |	Really cares about
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:03,167	| IOT017 |	So the other thing to know is the wink he said
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:05,215	| IOT017 |	Is now in 300000
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,727	| IOT017 |	Homes
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| IOT017 |	That
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:07,519	| IOT017 |	Is
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,311	| IOT017 |	Brazy
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,591	| IOT017 |	In one of those new
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:12,895	| IOT017 |	Is yours Kevin
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,431	| IOT017 |	That's correct
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:17,503	| IOT017 |	One of them is my that's why I asked the question about the software cup ticket
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,319	| IOT017 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:25,951	| IOT017 |	Can we talk about that now we should I should also tell you that he says it's not going away so you should not be
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,487	| IOT017 |	Concern
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,511	| IOT017 |	And II would be a little
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:33,119	| IOT017 |	Still I've already I've already started it and eBay
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:35,679	| IOT017 |	Option for my wink Hub that I just bought that no kidding
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,983	| IOT017 |	No I'm going to ride it out and
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,007	| IOT017 |	Brinkley
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:44,639	| IOT017 |	I only spent $50 on the wink Hub to begin with sweet I don't feel like it's a huge massive Financial loss it's
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,663	| IOT017 |	It's an annoyance if
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,223	| IOT017 |	If wink support actually stops and
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,503	| IOT017 |	Is one of the reasons I drive
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:52,575	| IOT017 |	Preached in the past I don't care for cloud-based
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,367	| IOT017 |	Home automation systems however
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,231	| IOT017 |	There's a reason I ended up going with the wing so let me know when I guess I should explain why that is
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,279	| IOT017 |	Two Worlds collided
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,047	| IOT017 |	Late last week
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:05,119	| IOT017 |	I was in Home Depot
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,655	| IOT017 |	And I saw the
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:11,007	| IOT017 |	Sylvania osram bulbs once or twice
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,031	| IOT017 |	With their whole
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,311	| IOT017 |	Lightify system
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,335	| IOT017 |	I don't think we talked about it
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,359	| IOT017 |	But yeah it's a nice
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,919	| IOT017 |	Yeah and and you can
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,455	| IOT017 |	Certainly by a lightify
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:24,063	| IOT017 |	Little plug-in Hub and whatnot I think was $50 for a bub a bold and the
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,343	| IOT017 |	Small plug-in hub
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,391	| IOT017 |	But I saw on the box that
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,439	| IOT017 |	The osram bulb with wink
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:29,951	| IOT017 |	Certified
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,023	| IOT017 |	Let me see what the wink Hub cost
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,791	| IOT017 |	50 bucks
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,071	| IOT017 |	I said I could live with that
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:41,983	| IOT017 |	Let me let me try that in the reason I actually bought the wink Hub also was because even though I have a Philips Hue Hub here
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:44,287	| IOT017 |	And I thought the osram bulb would work with it
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:49,151	| IOT017 |	I'm like if it doesn't work with it then I get a bowl I really can't use to let me get the wink Hub now
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:52,479	| IOT017 |	If I don't need it I'll just return to the Home Depot on open no harm no foul
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,807	| IOT017 |	Well I couldn't get the osram bulb to pair with the
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,575	| IOT017 |	Hugh
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,087	| IOT017 |	Hub
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,135	| IOT017 |	So I'm like well I'm glad I bought this
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,415	| IOT017 |	WinCo
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,719	| IOT017 |	Can I talk to you in 5 minutes later set up my account
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:05,279	| IOT017 |	And was able to connect to the new bulb
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:08,095	| IOT017 |	I should mention the bulb itself
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:11,167	| IOT017 |	The standard LED bulb a19 base
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,447	| IOT017 |	Or shape
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,471	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,751	| IOT017 |	It's $30 which
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:20,127	| IOT017 |	Is less than the Hue bulbs that aren't that you color those are $60 I believe
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| IOT017 |	Yeah so this was 30 half that price
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,479	| IOT017 |	It's the same as
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,247	| IOT017 |	The Hue Lux
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,527	| IOT017 |	White
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| IOT017 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,343	| IOT017 |	Which are $30
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:32,159	| IOT017 |	And you can even buy connected bulbs for
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,743	| IOT017 |	Connected white LED bulbs for as little as $15
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,535	| IOT017 |	So why did I choose a $30 bill
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:42,655	| IOT017 |	Because all of the connected white bulbs that I found including the locks if I'm not mistaken
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:47,519	| IOT017 |	They're all 2700 K color temperature which is the yellow e soft white color
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,055	| IOT017 |	And that's all you got
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,103	| IOT017 |	With the osram bulb
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:54,431	| IOT017 |	You get dimming which is pretty common in most of these bulbs
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,711	| IOT017 |	But you also get
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,759	| IOT017 |	Tunable color temperature for the white
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:00,575	| IOT017 |	So I can go from 2700 kelvins to
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:06,207	| IOT017 |	6500 Calvin's meaning I can go from a yellow light to a soft white to a bright white
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:07,487	| IOT017 |	All the way up to Daylight
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:12,095	| IOT017 |	So if you're familiar with those in the stores where you can see that the differences between
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,375	| IOT017 |	Soft white and daylight
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:15,167	| IOT017 |	This one dog does all of that
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:20,287	| IOT017 |	So I opted to spend the extra money and get the osram bulbs and I sent that at you more and I actually have three of them now
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:24,127	| IOT017 |	Did you work well with the wink Hub latency is really not an issue
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| IOT017 |	Which is nice
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:31,039	| IOT017 |	And I mentioned at the beginning of this I said worlds are colliding once I knew I had a wink hub
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:33,343	| IOT017 |	In mine I quickly ordered
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,647	| IOT017 |	Next day delivery for an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:40,511	| IOT017 |	Is working wonderfully I can tell when we make sure the microphone is off on Alexa yes it is
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,327	| IOT017 |	I can tell Alexa to turn my office light on
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,863	| IOT017 |	Can I do that before you can walk into the room
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:50,751	| IOT017 |	Tell her to turn the family room lights on them to bulbs downstairs go on or go often
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,799	| IOT017 |	In the Wink app I scheduled
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:56,383	| IOT017 |	Times for the lights to go off to make sure nobody leaves them on all night and so on
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:02,015	| IOT017 |	It's working pretty well and and there are more wink devices than I realize so
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| IOT017 |	/ $50
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,831	| IOT017 |	I thought it was a reasonably good investment
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,135	| IOT017 |	Don't know what it's it's really nice and
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,183	| IOT017 |	When I first reviewed the way
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,487	| IOT017 |	The bug oenis the hardware
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,047	| IOT017 |	The problem but I actually I've liked
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,607	| IOT017 |	What's the software a lot so I'm curious like
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,887	| IOT017 |	How did you find
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,191	| IOT017 |	Scheduling and how did you find the software employee
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:23,519	| IOT017 |	The software I think is reasonably good
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:27,103	| IOT017 |	I'm running it on iOS but I know there was an Android version as well
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:31,455	| IOT017 |	I took me a little time to find the scheduling aspect of it but it is
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,735	| IOT017 |	Pretty easy to set up
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,527	| IOT017 |	And it's working perfectly fine you can have
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:41,183	| IOT017 |	Daily things will weekly or every day I'm not at this point I just have the family room lights go off at 10:45 p.m.
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:44,511	| IOT017 |	Based on the schedule I've set that up in the iPhone app
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,023	| IOT017 |	No problem
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,583	| IOT017 |	I also like that you can set up shortcuts
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:49,887	| IOT017 |	In a one touch shortcuts to
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,423	| IOT017 |	Turn on one or multiple lights
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,215	| IOT017 |	You can do that in the app
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,775	| IOT017 |	But in iOS you also can make those
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:59,615	| IOT017 |	IOS widget so literally just pulled out of the top of your
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,687	| IOT017 |	IPhone screen and there I got three shortcuts that I can easily tap
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,735	| IOT017 |	To quickly turn lights on or off
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,551	| IOT017 |	Did the software also supports nest
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:12,159	| IOT017 |	And Isabella does replicate The Nest app in the Wink app so it's
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,951	| IOT017 |	Nothing fancy their butts
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,279	| IOT017 |	I hope they expand that in the future that's we'll have to see what happens there
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,839	| IOT017 |	Profile suffer Wisin
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,143	| IOT017 |	I think it's pretty simple and it certainly working well
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,471	| IOT017 |	So would you be interested cuz this is
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,007	| IOT017 |	Now that
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:27,775	| IOT017 |	WinCo
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,823	| IOT017 |	David actually added some sensors
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,127	| IOT017 |	They did also add
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,663	| IOT017 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,687	| IOT017 |	Chickpea
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:37,247	| IOT017 |	Profiles so you could actually add some
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| IOT017 |	So they have there
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,087	| IOT017 |	Tripper
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,599	| IOT017 |	Ink sensor
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:42,623	| IOT017 |	Which
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,903	| IOT017 |	I looked at
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,927	| IOT017 |	I was like it's like 20 bucks for
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,463	| IOT017 |	Like basically a door sensor
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:50,303	| IOT017 |	That could be fun so when you open your door
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,583	| IOT017 |	A certain life
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,095	| IOT017 |	Keto on
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,887	| IOT017 |	And they also have
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:54,911	| IOT017 |	What is today
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:58,239	| IOT017 |	I bet they do integrate with
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| IOT017 |	The Chamberlain
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,799	| IOT017 |	Garage door opener
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:01,823	| IOT017 |	If you have one of those
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:05,151	| IOT017 |	Blinds too I think they do
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,175	| IOT017 |	They do have some blinds
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,479	| IOT017 |	On the express Caesar
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,271	| IOT017 |	Well yeah if you have them already
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:10,783	| IOT017 |	And I think
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:15,135	| IOT017 |	You've got some Foscam cameras I don't know if they play with
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,159	| IOT017 |	Play nicely with flask
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:23,328	| IOT017 |	That's a good I forgot I forgot that even have those they're packaged up with of course the insteon stuff
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| IOT017 |	Yes I know
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,704	| IOT017 |	Come on iPod hug this week
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,520	| IOT017 |	And it's true I'm not giving you enough credit
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| IOT017 |	Ghetto send you in the show you've purchased it was
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:39,456	| IOT017 |	You've taken ownership of our not ownership you tried out some Hue bulbs you purchased a hug
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,504	| IOT017 |	You know I
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:45,088	| IOT017 |	I'm giving you credit man you're doing a great work there Kevin
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| IOT017 |	Good job
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,928	| IOT017 |	Yeah I know I have cuz I've had I've installed the wing
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:51,744	| IOT017 |	Wingstop date they also work really well with the Lutron stuff
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:55,584	| IOT017 |	There's a bit of a delay that makes solution less satisfying
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,376	| IOT017 |	And that's actually something
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,400	| IOT017 |	Dd2 update
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:58,912	| IOT017 |	The Hub Louisville
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:02,496	| IOT017 |	Because that is a cloud thing in the Lutron stuff really benefit
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,264	| IOT017 |	It's from having
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,288	| IOT017 |	Device to device
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,336	| IOT017 |	To each other
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,152	| IOT017 |	But if you want to add some Z-Wave locks
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:11,200	| IOT017 |	You could have you could do that
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,992	| IOT017 |	And it would actually be a lot of fun
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,272	| IOT017 |	Cuz that when you like
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,552	| IOT017 |	Unlock the door some
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:22,976	| IOT017 |	Now there's like there's a lot of different possibilities around Cyrus again I went to the product page for the wink
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:27,072	| IOT017 |	Site and found more than I expected which was nice to say
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:30,656	| IOT017 |	What other aspect I like about the Hub aside from the low price
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,728	| IOT017 |	It doesn't have to be wired to your router
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:36,032	| IOT017 |	Where is I believe the hue
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,056	| IOT017 |	Hub.
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:40,896	| IOT017 |	It has to be connected via Ethernet that's a $7 extra
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,432	| IOT017 |	That's about
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:48,320	| IOT017 |	I think it's maybe 5 to $7 extra building materials to add Wi-Fi to
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,112	| IOT017 |	To the hub so
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:52,672	| IOT017 |	Which is interesting because the wink Hub is cheaper
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,952	| IOT017 |	Well they sell it at a loss
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:58,304	| IOT017 |	Well there's a couple that explains a whole lot about corgis
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,072	| IOT017 |	It does
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:02,400	| IOT017 |	It is not a product
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:02,912	| IOT017 |	Sold for what
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,960	| IOT017 |	Well that's better
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:10,080	| IOT017 |	That's awesome I'm glad I look forward to hearing more about that and so we're going to call the Oscar and lights
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| IOT017 |	Baby 5 minutes
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:12,896	| IOT017 |	Divisive
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,712	| IOT017 |	For this week
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:17,760	| IOT017 |	And so it was so real quickly
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,808	| IOT017 |	Since we spent more than five minutes kind of talked about that
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,600	| IOT017 |	You like these lights
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,624	| IOT017 |	Are tunable
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,160	| IOT017 |	They're $30
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:27,744	| IOT017 |	Dimmable they are quiet when dimmed which is wonderful
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:28,768	| IOT017 |	Yes cuz
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:31,840	| IOT017 |	Because some of these lights like the Currys are there loud
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:34,656	| IOT017 |	They're not they're their got opaque they're not
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,728	| IOT017 |	Like the cheating link lights they're very they have a glare
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,008	| IOT017 |	A lot of people
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:46,176	| IOT017 |	These do output of around 810 lumens for those interested and they use 9.5 watts of power
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,200	| IOT017 |	Woohoo
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:51,552	| IOT017 |	Shuluxe they put out there they use 9 WhatsApp
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:56,928	| IOT017 |	Which is a random fact that my brain knows for I don't even know what she
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,720	| IOT017 |	So that is awesome
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,000	| IOT017 |	Thank you
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,512	| IOT017 |	So much

EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,800	| IOT017 |	Actually connected baby monitoring device
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,592	| IOT017 |	Which would be a fascinating topic
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,360	| IOT017 |	The conversation
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| IOT017 |	But we're not actually talking about that
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:19,200	| IOT017 |	We're talking about why crowdfunding
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,992	| IOT017 |	Is a dead model for hardware store
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,040	| IOT017 |	Keep listing

EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,160	| IOT017 |	You guys to have a
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,696	| IOT017 |	Protestant
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,232	| IOT017 |	Which is kind of part of the subject
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:03,744	| IOT017 |	Today's interview
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,280	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:05,792	| IOT017 |	Sproutling
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,584	| IOT017 |	Fruit you guys are like
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,376	| IOT017 |	Is this a plant thing what is this
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:09,888	| IOT017 |	It is
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,192	| IOT017 |	Really something I was very excited
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,216	| IOT017 |	And still am
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:14,752	| IOT017 |	It is a baby Mana
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:18,336	| IOT017 |	That your baby wears around his ankle
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,104	| IOT017 |	And it's
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,920	| IOT017 |	It's a 299 device that
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:25,504	| IOT017 |	It measures your baby skin temperature its heart rate motion
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,320	| IOT017 |	A variety of things and it connects with a
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,088	| IOT017 |	Divisive
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:32,160	| IOT017 |	It's in the room that has a microphone a temperature sensor
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:36,000	| IOT017 |	And the really awesome thing in the very forward-looking thing about this is
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:41,888	| IOT017 |	It's Gathering all this information and overtime it builds up a profile about your baby
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:47,008	| IOT017 |	Will hear Chris you explain it a little bit better about what it kind of can-do
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,520	| IOT017 |	The potential here
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:53,152	| IOT017 |	Sure it's very interested in this world
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:55,456	| IOT017 |	And all its information flowing in
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,248	| IOT017 |	You look at your car
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,856	| IOT017 |	Connected
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:05,184	| IOT017 |	There's a lot of data
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,024	| IOT017 |	The United States
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,632	| IOT017 |	Taken 3 years to do
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,496	| IOT017 |	They managed to monitor 1070
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:23,616	| IOT017 |	And since then 1600 babies have been born
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:34,112	| IOT017 |	Really the world's first sensing learning in predicting any monarch
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| IOT017 |	Temperature
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| IOT017 |	Motion
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,280	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:41,792	| IOT017 |	Position
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,120	| IOT017 |	Like you mentioned
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:49,472	| IOT017 |	Noise level light level humidity
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,496	| IOT017 |	Does have a microphone
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:27:00,224	| IOT017 |	A statistical model for every
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:07,904	| IOT017 |	When there is a child's heart rate
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,744	| IOT017 |	Predictions
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,792	| IOT017 |	Give you recommendations
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,328	| IOT017 |	What if your
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:19,680	| IOT017 |	Able to lower the room temperature by 5 degrees
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,960	| IOT017 |	It's really about
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,264	| IOT017 |	Nelly having me smart internet connected
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:23,776	| IOT017 |	Devices
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,456	| IOT017 |	Unprecedented
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,480	| IOT017 |	Anywhere else before
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:37,600	| IOT017 |	And that's what's so exciting it's cuz I have I have a bunch of things that give me a lot of raw data
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:42,464	| IOT017 |	But the idea is especially as a parent when you don't get enough sleep as it is
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,000	| IOT017 |	Having something that's just like
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:44,512	| IOT017 |	Hey
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,536	| IOT017 |	You
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,352	| IOT017 |	Lower the temperature in your baby's room and you can
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:48,864	| IOT017 |	Can sleep longer
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,912	| IOT017 |	Oh that's like gold right
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,448	| IOT017 |	So
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,728	| IOT017 |	It's very exciting
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,008	| IOT017 |	Now
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,056	| IOT017 |	When we last talked
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| IOT017 |	Can I was this was still something you were working on
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:00,896	| IOT017 |	And then
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,688	| IOT017 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,456	| IOT017 |	You guys
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,224	| IOT017 |	Did a
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:09,088	| IOT017 |	You didn't do a Kickstarter you launched pre-sales a couple months back
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,600	| IOT017 |	Casino
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:13,184	| IOT017 |	Last August it was right so about a year ago
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,232	| IOT017 |	On your website
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,024	| IOT017 |	And then you promised that this would be
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:18,816	| IOT017 |	I shouldn't say promise that makes
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,888	| IOT017 |	What you said it would be out in March and that didn't
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,400	| IOT017 |	Happen
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,680	| IOT017 |	And for their
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:28,800	| IOT017 |	You guys learned a really valuable lesson in that could have led to the reason that you're on the show today
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,336	| IOT017 |	Which is you tweeted that
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,664	| IOT017 |	You thought the model of young companies going on
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,456	| IOT017 |	Crowdfunding sites
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,224	| IOT017 |	In Kettering
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:40,832	| IOT017 |	You know sales and then Venture backing was just broken and it wasn't going to work anymore
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,880	| IOT017 |	And I'd love for you to kind of talk about
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,416	| IOT017 |	What you meant by that
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,440	| IOT017 |	In your experience here
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,352	| IOT017 |	Or
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,376	| IOT017 |	Venture-backed
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,472	| IOT017 |	Started
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:59,264	| IOT017 |	Really popular
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:01,824	| IOT017 |	Dormant for a long time not allowed
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,872	| IOT017 |	Ace Hardware
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:05,664	| IOT017 |	Cam
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:10,016	| IOT017 |	Ugly Hardware
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,952	| IOT017 |	Champion you have
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,000	| IOT017 |	Degrade
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:24,608	| IOT017 |	You had bleed motion with big braids
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,656	| IOT017 |	Funding campaigns
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,192	| IOT017 |	Really kicking off hardware company
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:33,824	| IOT017 |	Gunther angel
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,104	| IOT017 |	When on
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,408	| IOT017 |	Indiegogo
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:37,920	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,248	| IOT017 |	Got a lot of
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,296	| IOT017 |	Necropolis
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:46,368	| IOT017 |	I didn't raise the rest of them to actually bring the pasta market
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,648	| IOT017 |	And that was
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:49,696	| IOT017 |	Yeah and you had to do that as well
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:53,536	| IOT017 |	Company because the feces actually wanted to see that before they would
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:57,376	| IOT017 |	That boosted your valuation is a company it really helped you
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,448	| IOT017 |	I mean if you didn't go show the PCS
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,728	| IOT017 |	That you could
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:05,568	| IOT017 |	Get those kind of that interest at the customer level they weren't going to find you
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,336	| IOT017 |	Anyhow
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| IOT017 |	So
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:12,736	| IOT017 |	That's exactly right
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,296	| IOT017 |	Wisconsin
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:18,368	| IOT017 |	Customers there
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,256	| IOT017 |	It was
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,024	| IOT017 |	Willie Morris
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,144	| IOT017 |	Where anytime
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:30,912	| IOT017 |	You can use it
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,704	| IOT017 |	Turn to having a baby
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,472	| IOT017 |	On a set date
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,592	| IOT017 |	Babies coming no matter
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,408	| IOT017 |	Shipping or not
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:44,224	| IOT017 |	You are the time we really tired of that we
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:47,296	| IOT017 |	You know we are pretty confident that we're going to be
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,088	| IOT017 |	We want you to be like any of the other one
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:57,024	| IOT017 |	Some seed money enough to get
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:00,352	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:02,400	| IOT017 |	We're looking good today
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,448	| IOT017 |	I think a lot of companies
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:07,264	| IOT017 |	Azan through crowdfunding campaign
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:14,432	| IOT017 |	One country to another
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:17,248	| IOT017 |	Other manufacturing issues after chemo
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:23,136	| IOT017 |	Before I could tell you how much it's going to cost
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:26,464	| IOT017 |	All of these possibilities with you
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:32,352	| IOT017 |	Which was hey we're going to
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:33,888	| IOT017 |	Docker sales
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:36,192	| IOT017 |	We're going to go raise a big round after that
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:37,984	| IOT017 |	Will be happy
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,288	| IOT017 |	Is that
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,080	| IOT017 |	I think the investors appetite
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:45,920	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,096	| IOT017 |	Pre-sales amount
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:08,704	| IOT017 |	But still have to go
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,496	| IOT017 |	Raise money and shows our numbers
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,032	| IOT017 |	I realize that
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:15,360	| IOT017 |	Most of the time that we looked at
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:20,480	| IOT017 |	Free shipping hardware company
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,296	| IOT017 |	Companies that should have been
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,856	| IOT017 |	You realize that.
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,880	| IOT017 |	Twins in that
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:30,208	| IOT017 |	Really certain
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:33,280	| IOT017 |	Interpretation bicycle becoming unrealistic
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:36,864	| IOT017 |	In some cases they want to see the traction but
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:44,288	| IOT017 |	Not really early adopter Foxy's a product rule
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:47,360	| IOT017 |	Probably conceited cell
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:52,992	| IOT017 |	Party time
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:57,856	| IOT017 |	Now you may have a problem and its really
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:02,720	| IOT017 |	Is broken
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,840	| IOT017 |	I would do it completely different
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,888	| IOT017 |	Well I think you also got
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,912	| IOT017 |	Kind of the double
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:13,984	| IOT017 |	Another way me in the sense I guess this would be your triple Whammy
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:17,824	| IOT017 |	In that not only is it not an early adopter Market
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT017 |	But
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:22,944	| IOT017 |	There was enough publicity around campaigns that didn't ship in time
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:25,760	| IOT017 |	That if I were expecting a baby
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:28,576	| IOT017 |	Not only is a baby coming on a set date
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:30,880	| IOT017 |	But you only really care about monetary
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,416	| IOT017 |	Your baby at that level four
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:34,208	| IOT017 |	A relatively small amount of time
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:35,488	| IOT017 |	Like
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:40,096	| IOT017 |	The window in which your baby like you're freaking out about their sleep schedule is
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:42,144	| IOT017 |	It's like maybe a year year-and-a-half
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:45,216	| IOT017 |	Or even four months I mean depends on how
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:47,520	| IOT017 |	But
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:51,872	| IOT017 |	You know once they start sleeping through the night you get a little less frantic about like
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:55,200	| IOT017 |	Oh my God I pay anything for them to sleep an extra 20 minutes
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,248	| IOT017 |	Or are they going to know
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:00,320	| IOT017 |	Where you check in on them every every 5 Seconds
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:03,648	| IOT017 |	It's like I still breathing I can't believe they let me take this thing home from the hospital
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,464	| IOT017 |	So if it's late you know it
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:10,304	| IOT017 |	Is it important time it really does kind of become useless to you
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:17,216	| IOT017 |	And I can see how people would be very hesitant to invest you know I think you said it was 249 for
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:17,984	| IOT017 |	Pre-sales
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,288	| IOT017 |	As opposed to the 299 on the
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,312	| IOT017 |	How it would be now
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,104	| IOT017 |	So so that's a problem
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,920	| IOT017 |	So what did you guys do
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:31,552	| IOT017 |	How do you write I know you got some money initially from first round Capital but what did you guys do
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,856	| IOT017 |	To raise money or have you gone
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:40,000	| IOT017 |	Actually you don't ween raise
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:42,304	| IOT017 |	Erase another
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,072	| IOT017 |	Since then
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,120	| IOT017 |	Call me realize was
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,448	| IOT017 |	Try to go for a big round
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,240	| IOT017 |	Usually anywhere neighborhood
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,008	| IOT017 |	No
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,312	| IOT017 |	8 to 12 million after
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,136	| IOT017 |	T4
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:07,648	| IOT017 |	Huge
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,696	| IOT017 |	You know she did he drown
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:10,976	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,328	| IOT017 |	Take a little bit light-headed
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:19,424	| IOT017 |	And then really bring the Sparkle Market have enough money to actually
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:21,984	| IOT017 |	Try some sales in
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:25,824	| IOT017 |	Some products and then go around
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,848	| IOT017 |	I think the reverse
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:38,368	| IOT017 |	Finance the production of the people already bought
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,648	| IOT017 |	Until
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,464	| IOT017 |	Exact model
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:45,792	| IOT017 |	Definitely.
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:47,840	| IOT017 |	Like I said we took money out of
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:51,424	| IOT017 |	When this had in the past
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,800	| IOT017 |	Beebe actually got our products
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:36:01,920	| IOT017 |	Shipping in the market and other companies that are still struggling
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,528	| IOT017 |	Today parade presale
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,064	| IOT017 |	Canteen
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,088	| IOT017 |	Shift Impala
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:11,136	| IOT017 |	And there's a
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:14,720	| IOT017 |	And emotion
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:17,536	| IOT017 |	Kickstarter campaign and
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,584	| IOT017 |	Nobody buying
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:28,288	| IOT017 |	That's true and they had a lot of hype a lot of excitement and then
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,872	| IOT017 |	The product didn't quite live up so maybe it is better to
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:35,712	| IOT017 |	So maybe fewer and then iterate on your product
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,784	| IOT017 |	Over a smaller number of users
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,856	| IOT017 |	Congratulate make it better which is traditionally how
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,368	| IOT017 |	Products
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,904	| IOT017 |	Especially
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,184	| IOT017 |	Hardware type
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| IOT017 |	Apple products have
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:46,976	| IOT017 |	Developed over
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:52,096	| IOT017 |	The crowdfunding
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:52,864	| IOT017 |	Krowd
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,632	| IOT017 |	He will
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:55,168	| IOT017 |	Very early.
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,448	| IOT017 |	So if you have
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,984	| IOT017 |	The Great Khali
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,312	| IOT017 |	Today shows is that
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:02,848	| IOT017 |	Elderly doctor
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,624	| IOT017 |	Coffee Cabin
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,464	| IOT017 |	To the morning stream consumer
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:23,072	| IOT017 |	And one of the biggest
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:24,608	| IOT017 |	But really prove that
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:29,984	| IOT017 |	And you also learned a valuable kind of PR lesson
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,008	| IOT017 |	I think
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:34,336	| IOT017 |	And I think it's worth noting for people
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,872	| IOT017 |	Because a lot of people still do
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:38,688	| IOT017 |	If not crowdfunding pre-sales on these things
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:42,784	| IOT017 |	And we should also talk about the value of pre-sales
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:44,320	| IOT017 |	And because you're still very
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:47,904	| IOT017 |	I want to say hi on pre-sales but you still find pre-sales to
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:48,416	| IOT017 |	To be very value
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,280	| IOT017 |	Circumstances
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,096	| IOT017 |	Crowdfunding campaigns
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,680	| IOT017 |	TR
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:03,008	| IOT017 |	And so if you really think about it
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,032	| IOT017 |	Dinosaur
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:06,336	| IOT017 |	Taking advantage of
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,104	| IOT017 |	It's really critical
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,920	| IOT017 |	Now the farther you are away from Shipping
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,456	| IOT017 |	The higher the barrier is
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,480	| IOT017 |	Somebody actually
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,248	| IOT017 |	Punching intercredit
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:18,624	| IOT017 |	That's what I said
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,256	| IOT017 |	The less likely to take a chance until
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,280	| IOT017 |	Icantina
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:27,584	| IOT017 |	Getting a lot of tea are around
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,472	| IOT017 |	I think it's going to be
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,752	| IOT017 |	You're much better than
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,312	| IOT017 |	What you say is he today and
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,592	| IOT017 |	I also would argue with that
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:41,408	| IOT017 |	Ozarks
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:43,456	| IOT017 |	Just early.
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:48,064	| IOT017 |	Give me a sentence for what kind of people not to buy at once
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:50,112	| IOT017 |	Letterkenny
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:52,416	| IOT017 |	So and especially for you
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:52,928	| IOT017 |	Cuz hopefully
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,464	| IOT017 |	30 days
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:55,744	| IOT017 |	You know feeling like
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,768	| IOT017 |	I would probably buy it

EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:17,248	| IOT017 |	Now you're going to be able to order it
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:17,760	| IOT017 |	Going to be there

EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,696	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,400	| IOT017 |	I think traditionally.
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:35,936	| IOT017 |	But I would
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:40,032	| IOT017 |	Really courage China raise enough money being
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:44,640	| IOT017 |	I really feel the product get it ready for me facturing

EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:07,168	| IOT017 |	And I think it's
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,448	| IOT017 |	Yourself
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:12,544	| IOT017 |	How to make some compromises
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,104	| IOT017 |	We realize it
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:25,344	| IOT017 |	Commitment time really quick
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,880	| IOT017 |	Way too much pressure on us and
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:31,232	| IOT017 |	Naughty and I think the cause us to continue with the marketing
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,000	| IOT017 |	Continue
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:34,560	| IOT017 |	With a PRN in spending money on things that
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:37,120	| IOT017 |	You know we really should have just waited on

EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,464	| IOT017 |	Swelling and I would say
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:04,000	| IOT017 |	Real fast for me
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:10,400	| IOT017 |	What are some of the manufacturing lessons you learned because I know you said something earlier about starting in the USA
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,936	| IOT017 |	And then switching over to China
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,240	| IOT017 |	So do you want to talk briefly about that
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:18,080	| IOT017 |	Yeah sure
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,872	| IOT017 |	United States
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:36,000	| IOT017 |	For some of these products
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,072	| IOT017 |	Accessible in United States
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,096	| IOT017 |	And we were working with

EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,239	| IOT017 |	Because
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,007	| IOT017 |	It just would happen

EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:30,431	| IOT017 |	Got it all right
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:34,527	| IOT017 |	Chris thank you so much for coming on the show I think we learned a lot about
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:36,575	| IOT017 |	Building Hardware
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:40,927	| IOT017 |	I'm a little concerned about the future for Innovative Hardware companies now
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:45,791	| IOT017 |	Hopefully we'll see maybe some smaller runs of interesting products
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:46,303	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:53,983	| IOT017 |	We'll see where that gets us and hopefully a venture capitalist will still be finding them hopefully crazy early adopters like mice
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,263	| IOT017 |	South will still be buying them
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,799	| IOT017 |	And
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:44:01,407	| IOT017 |	I look forward to talking to you maybe in a year now that your product has actually coming out and in
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:04,479	| IOT017 |	We'll start seeing some data and we can talk about how
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:07,807	| IOT017 |	How parenting will change with the internet of things because that is
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,367	| IOT017 |	As a parent something I'm really excited about

EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:18,047	| IOT017 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,583	| IOT017 |	I can't wait
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:21,119	| IOT017 |	Thanks for coming on the show
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,655	| IOT017 |	Appreciate it
