EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:57,088	| IOT166 |	Actually wanted
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:00,672	| IOT166 |	The fastest growing industrial iot platforms
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,440	| IOT166 |	Mostly because it can
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:03,744	| IOT166 |	AI at the edge
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:06,560	| IOT166 |	So you learned a lot about that stay tuned for it
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:08,608	| IOT166 |	We're also going to have a message from praetorian

EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,496	| IOT166 |	Echo skill
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:18,592	| IOT166 |	Pretty sweet so let's get it all started with a message
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,360	| IOT166 |	From our sponsor
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:26,528	| IOT166 |	This week sponsor is Bosch interested in all things iot the Bosch connected World log covers
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:29,856	| IOT166 |	A wide range of iot topics from around the world
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:36,256	| IOT166 |	Such as industry for a mobility blockchain and adtech checkout blog
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:41,376	| IOT166 |	Bosch - s i.com for articles case studies
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:47,776	| IOT166 |	Interviews and more actually one of my favorite blogs I do find myself thinking too though
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:50,336	| IOT166 |	Those often so check it out
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,616	| IOT166 |	Now
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,152	| IOT166 |	Let's talk about our favorite topic
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,224	| IOT166 |	Gdpr
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,528	| IOT166 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,320	| IOT166 |	Gdpr stands for
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,624	| IOT166 |	General data protection regulation
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,928	| IOT166 |	This was a lot it was actually
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,952	| IOT166 |	Enacted
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:06,720	| IOT166 |	A while back
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,000	| IOT166 |	By the EU
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:11,584	| IOT166 |	But just came into effect on May 25th so last Friday
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:12,864	| IOT166 |	And it's been a mess
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,168	| IOT166 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:19,264	| IOT166 |	Everyone was kind of only this actually
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,544	| IOT166 |	Is actually going to have an impact
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,336	| IOT166 |	Beyond just all the Privacy regulation
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,688	| IOT166 |	Have you had a lot of privacy regulations
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,200	| IOT166 |	Coming in your email
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,248	| IOT166 |	I've had more
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:32,064	| IOT166 |	Privacy regulation notifications
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,088	| IOT166 |	And
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:39,232	| IOT166 |	Re-up on subscriptions to email addresses that I don't really care about then I normally get at CES
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,560	| IOT166 |	I mean it's been in Spain
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,096	| IOT166 |	And it's so bad
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:48,960	| IOT166 |	And some companies are so unprepared for this which I don't understand why cuz we knew it was coming that
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| IOT166 |	Certain
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,776	| IOT166 |	Content providers news outlets
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| IOT166 |	Are actually providing different
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,872	| IOT166 |	Sites of their news
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,688	| IOT166 |	To the EU areas
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,224	| IOT166 |	I believe USA Today is one
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,528	| IOT166 |	In fact it's much faster because
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,296	| IOT166 |	Pause
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:06,112	| IOT166 |	There's no tracking information JavaScript and all kinds of other
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:11,232	| IOT166 |	Fun stuff just HTML pictures Alonzo for sale
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,280	| IOT166 |	It is Miss I should actually take the
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,584	| IOT166 |	The time to say to all of our EU
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,864	| IOT166 |	Citizens and listeners
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,680	| IOT166 |	And pretty much everyone who listens because I actually care about you
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:22,240	| IOT166 |	Your privacy when you listen to
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,776	| IOT166 |	Cast when you go to the website
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,544	| IOT166 |	We don't
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:28,128	| IOT166 |	Track you for add purposes because our sponsors actually pay for every
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,664	| IOT166 |	They don't get your
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,688	| IOT166 |	Information
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:35,552	| IOT166 |	Information if you sign up for the newsletter I do get your email address and I will use it
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,344	| IOT166 |	To send you the newsletter
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,904	| IOT166 |	And then also I do use it
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,184	| IOT166 |	Marketing on
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,952	| IOT166 |	Facebook to you
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,744	| IOT166 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,048	| IOT166 |	So but not in any weird crazy way
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:46,560	| IOT166 |	I don't think it's any
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,936	| IOT166 |	Just so you know about our ad policies
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,960	| IOT166 |	We try to keep it
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,240	| IOT166 |	Really respectful and
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,336	| IOT166 |	I don't want your information sorry
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,128	| IOT166 |	And Kevin Kevin wants another
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,408	| IOT166 |	I don't want anything
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:02,944	| IOT166 |	Do you want to send that to
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,224	| IOT166 |	No no no
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,320	| IOT166 |	Alright so what's happening with iot devices is
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,624	| IOT166 |	A little bit uncertain so far
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,440	| IOT166 |	What we have seen is a couple devices
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| IOT166 |	Installing offline
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,280	| IOT166 |	Actually one noted case it's a
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,047	| IOT166 |	Light from
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,071	| IOT166 |	Company in China
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,607	| IOT166 |	Great white
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,911	| IOT166 |	They stop supporting their app
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| IOT166 |	The Apple Barn
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,031	| IOT166 |	Yeah I don't think I meant to because
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,823	| IOT166 |	Accents fixed it
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,335	| IOT166 |	No
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:37,247	| IOT166 |	No no that's right Guy season announcement the European server service will be restored within a week and some people there
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,783	| IOT166 |	Devices work going to a
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,319	| IOT166 |	Server in Germany
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| IOT166 |	And that's where they couldn't access the server
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,647	| IOT166 |	So
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:50,047	| IOT166 |	Do you enterprising yeelight on her said I'm just switching the server to your Singapore Airline and that's how they got around us but that's
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,559	| IOT166 |	It's not the answer
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,351	| IOT166 |	Hardcore
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT166 |	Route to take
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| IOT166 |	For your lights to work
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:57,471	| IOT166 |	And this is why we should have cloudless hugs
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,007	| IOT166 |	Exactly
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:04:59,775	| IOT166 |	So
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:06,175	| IOT166 |	A couple other connected devices what you would see is things like there's a picture on Twitter of
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,455	| IOT166 |	Someone's Samsung
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,735	| IOT166 |	Smart
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,783	| IOT166 |	Refrigerator family Hub refrigerator
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,599	| IOT166 |	Displaying a gdpr privacy notice
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,135	| IOT166 |	Now it's worth noting that
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,159	| IOT166 |	This person pointed out
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,975	| IOT166 |	They said this is just a notification to go to Samsung
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,535	| IOT166 |	When you clicked okay
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,815	| IOT166 |	You're actually
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| IOT166 |	Not opting in
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,863	| IOT166 |	You're just saying
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,399	| IOT166 |	Seeing that I need
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,703	| IOT166 |	So that was
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,239	| IOT166 |	A good way to do it next also
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:33,055	| IOT166 |	If people went over to turn their thermostats
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,103	| IOT166 |	On stay actually showed them
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:35,615	| IOT166 |	Similar
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,455	| IOT166 |	Application so most people seem to be working
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,479	| IOT166 |	There's just a lot of thing
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,271	| IOT166 |	I'll tell you
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:45,343	| IOT166 |	I am reading through a lot of these policies especially
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,879	| IOT166 |	Connected devices IP
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,671	| IOT166 |	To have something on that
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| IOT166 |	Soon
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:49,951	| IOT166 |	But I am
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,839	| IOT166 |	I may be reading for quite some time
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,119	| IOT166 |	All right
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:57,887	| IOT166 |	So that's
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| IOT166 |	Gdpr
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:02,239	| IOT166 |	Now we'll move into last week
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,055	| IOT166 |	And a little bit into this week's big story which was
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,079	| IOT166 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,359	| IOT166 |	Z-Wave has been hacked
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,663	| IOT166 |	Only
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| IOT166 |	Like many iot
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:14,783	| IOT166 |	Hacking stories this is maybe less scandalous that it first.
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,343	| IOT166 |	Here's what this is talking about is
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:20,415	| IOT166 |	Back in 2013 and I believe again in 2016
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,231	| IOT166 |	Hackers found a way to get access to Z-Wave
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,743	| IOT166 |	Devices Inc
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| IOT166 |	Was it difficult because you had to be
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,095	| IOT166 |	Within 30 to 40
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| IOT166 |	It was possible
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,191	| IOT166 |	So
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:35,263	| IOT166 |	The Z-Wave Alliance actually changed their sick
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:35,775	| IOT166 |	Security stand
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,335	| IOT166 |	In all devices that were
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,383	| IOT166 |	Where are certified after April 2nd
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:40,895	| IOT166 |	A flask
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,199	| IOT166 |	Had to comply with what
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,479	| IOT166 |	Called S2 secure
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,831	| IOT166 |	A lot of devices out there that are not S2
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,343	| IOT166 |	Compliant
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:52,415	| IOT166 |	Titan II but this latest security hack
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,951	| IOT166 |	Is very similar
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,487	| IOT166 |	To the ones from
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| IOT166 |	A couple years back
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,559	| IOT166 |	Basically what happens is
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,607	| IOT166 |	The researchers have found a way
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:03,167	| IOT166 |	Trollback NES to device
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| IOT166 |	0 which means
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| IOT166 |	They can basically perpetrate
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,519	| IOT166 |	Trait that same hat
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,823	| IOT166 |	Freak out
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,615	| IOT166 |	Kevin and I are not so worried
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,663	| IOT166 |	Because again this requires
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,943	| IOT166 |	Really close physical
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| IOT166 |	Proximity
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,247	| IOT166 |	It feels like the same
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:21,343	| IOT166 |	Height of level of danger of someone trying to get access to your Wi-Fi password
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:25,183	| IOT166 |	Sneaking in and trying to see the Authentication
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,463	| IOT166 |	And getting access to the
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,231	| IOT166 |	Encrypted password
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,767	| IOT166 |	Router tries to kill
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:35,935	| IOT166 |	New devices the threat window for somebody trying to do the Z-Wave hack is like 20 milliseconds
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,983	| IOT166 |	It has to be very precise
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,055	| IOT166 |	Have to be close by I mean is it possible sure
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,639	| IOT166 |	It's possible but if you were s to device
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:48,735	| IOT166 |	Does get rolled back or if you add an S 0 device to Z-Wave Network
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,783	| IOT166 |	You should actually get notified
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| IOT166 |	That such a thing as half
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| IOT166 |	So we got all excited about this
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| IOT166 |	But
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,183	| IOT166 |	There's kind of a little bit of a downside which is
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,999	| IOT166 |	Not many hubs rs2 certified
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| IOT166 |	So we looked at the wink hub
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:02,815	| IOT166 |	Not as to certify
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,095	| IOT166 |	According to
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,607	| IOT166 |	It's
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:07,423	| IOT166 |	That that's the wink Hub to the newest one
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,959	| IOT166 |	Is the wink Hub 2
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,775	| IOT166 |	We look for small things also does not appear to have
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,567	| IOT166 |	Which means if you were happy
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:14,847	| IOT166 |	You wouldn't know
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,407	| IOT166 |	We should probably put the link
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:23,551	| IOT166 |	In the show notes to the catalog on Z-Wave Alliance where you can actually look up on the database what devices
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,855	| IOT166 |	Are certified and if you look
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,879	| IOT166 |	For your device
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:29,183	| IOT166 |	It'll actually say if it has S2
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| IOT166 |	Compliance
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,487	| IOT166 |	We will do it
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,047	| IOT166 |	Okay so that is the
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,815	| IOT166 |	Scoop
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,095	| IOT166 |	On the Z-Wave
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,607	| IOT166 |	Challenges
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT166 |	Now
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:38,655	| IOT166 |	What else do we
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,215	| IOT166 |	Have you rebooted your
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,239	| IOT166 |	Louder yet Kevin
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:47,871	| IOT166 |	I have not even though the FBI is suggesting please reboot your router everybody
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| IOT166 |	And I
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,735	| IOT166 |	This actually all started last week with a
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| IOT166 |	I guess it would be called a botnet
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,807	| IOT166 |	Attack
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:59,391	| IOT166 |	I think it was targeted towards the Ukrainian electrical grid but obviously it's
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:04,511	| IOT166 |	To create the attack it's not just using routers and things in Ukraine season 2 from all over the world
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,559	| IOT166 |	I think it's called vpnfilter
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,863	| IOT166 |	Attitude Target certain routers
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:12,959	| IOT166 |	Turn Linksys mikrotik Netgear and tp-link +
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:19,359	| IOT166 |	What the FBI is saying and they actually took control of the server that was spreading this so that's good
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| IOT166 |	Goodbye still may be out there on routers
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,943	| IOT166 |	They're saying just reboot your router
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:26,271	| IOT166 |	I don't think that's enough and if you're that concerned
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:31,903	| IOT166 |	I think what you really need to do is factory reset your router because rebooting it if the code is
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,671	| IOT166 |	Persistent
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,975	| IOT166 |	It's going to be there when you reboot so
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,023	| IOT166 |	I know that resetting a router is
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,303	| IOT166 |	A challenges of pain
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:41,631	| IOT166 |	But if you're that concerned I think we should do the extra step and do that
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,655	| IOT166 |	Reset it
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,983	| IOT166 |	Note to you guys especially if you have lots of connected devices
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,287	| IOT166 |	Your house when you reset your router
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,687	| IOT166 |	Make sure you do the exact password otherwise
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,711	| IOT166 |	Like a crazy person
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,015	| IOT166 |	Resetting your SSID and password
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,039	| IOT166 |	On
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:06,719	| IOT166 |	Yeah I mean that's the thing you have to determine how far you want to go here because some people may say well I don't even want you the same
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| IOT166 |	SSID Android password
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:14,655	| IOT166 |	What what you're going to do that if you don't use it is exactly what you said Stacy you're not to go back and every single device that connects to your voice
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:18,239	| IOT166 |	Wi-Fi network is going to be reconfigured to work with a new coil coating new network
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,775	| IOT166 |	Have fun you guys
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,543	| IOT166 |	All right
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| IOT166 |	So after
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| IOT166 |	Rebooted router
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,639	| IOT166 |	Continue listening to our show so you
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,199	| IOT166 |	You can find out why Amazon whole biosecurity firm
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,271	| IOT166 |	I thought this was a really good article
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,319	| IOT166 |	Call Julie Jacobson / @cee Pro
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,599	| IOT166 |	She Wrote
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| IOT166 |	A story about
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,183	| IOT166 |	Amazon's need for a security firm
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| IOT166 |	Because
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,487	| IOT166 |	As we talked about
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,255	| IOT166 |	Forever on the show
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,303	| IOT166 |	Security is the gateway drug to this
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,095	| IOT166 |	Amazon needs to have
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,119	| IOT166 |	This Plus
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:51,519	| IOT166 |	They need actual boots on the ground and a security company already has those and we've talked about companies like
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,055	| IOT166 |	Ben has been on the market
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:58,175	| IOT166 |	They have been for sale so it's totally possible
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,735	| IOT166 |	That you would see Amazon pick up a cup
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:04,319	| IOT166 |	Company like Vivint maybe like an ATT they have private Equity arnaud's now that
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:05,855	| IOT166 |	Might want to sell that
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,391	| IOT166 |	My money would be on Vivint
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,183	| IOT166 |	Because they've basically been owned by the same product
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,463	| IOT166 |	For a while
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| IOT166 |	Aunt
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,999	| IOT166 |	It's getting raped
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,023	| IOT166 |	It's getting raped
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| IOT166 |	So
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,351	| IOT166 |	Julie points out a couple really
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,375	| IOT166 |	Stupid things
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,935	| IOT166 |	Amazon can't install their own security
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:22,495	| IOT166 |	Products without having alarm certification
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:24,287	| IOT166 |	So they need to get that
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,311	| IOT166 |	They also want
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,359	| IOT166 |	More technicians for their Amazon expert service
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,407	| IOT166 |	And they want
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,431	| IOT166 |	To basically
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,223	| IOT166 |	Sell more devices so
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,247	| IOT166 |	If you have an alarm code
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,295	| IOT166 |	You got it
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| IOT166 |	That's a ton of stuff
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| IOT166 |	And
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,391	| IOT166 |	That gives them service revenue from
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,671	| IOT166 |	Remote network monitoring system
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,463	| IOT166 |	And they can become
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,743	| IOT166 |	I'm like this amazing managed service
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,815	| IOT166 |	Which is something the Broadband come
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| IOT166 |	Please also would like to
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| IOT166 |	To be in the security
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,911	| IOT166 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:53,471	| IOT166 |	Would be in a better position because they have
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| IOT166 |	Madam a
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| IOT166 |	Assistant
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,543	| IOT166 |	And
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,567	| IOT166 |	That gives her
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,335	| IOT166 |	Car more intelligent
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,383	| IOT166 |	It's kind of a win
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:05,503	| IOT166 |	So I'm not going to say Julie's wrong I still think Amazon ends up buying wink
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:10,367	| IOT166 |	Cuz I don't think they Echo Hub or Echo Plus is all that but that's just me
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:15,231	| IOT166 |	And Amazon is deploying when Cubs through their Smart Home Security
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:18,559	| IOT166 |	Offering the strange thing is Julie points out that they need
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,583	| IOT166 |	To be certified
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:26,495	| IOT166 |	Installers in because of certain laws regulations and such to shed their very quirky laws Amazon is already installing
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,287	| IOT166 |	Chinese with Amazon employees
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,591	| IOT166 |	So she kind of lost me there I got to be honest
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,383	| IOT166 |	There are rules in
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,407	| IOT166 |	Each state
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:33,919	| IOT166 |	About
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,711	| IOT166 |	Can do what associate
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,551	| IOT166 |	So it may be that there installing this but there
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:41,855	| IOT166 |	I could be
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:42,879	| IOT166 |	So
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,951	| IOT166 |	If Julie if you're listening let us know
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,487	| IOT166 |	I still think
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,023	| IOT166 |	I do think it's a good idea
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| IOT166 |	I'm not going to lie
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| IOT166 |	I think it's probably
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,863	| IOT166 |	Pretty smart so we'll see what happens
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,911	| IOT166 |	Maybe we'll have fancy fancy news from
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,423	| IOT166 |	Amazon
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,239	| IOT166 |	Okay and now let's talk about
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,567	| IOT166 |	Low-power wide area Networks
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,335	| IOT166 |	And
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| IOT166 |	Let's go
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,383	| IOT166 |	So basically
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,943	| IOT166 |	Ways to get Enterprise in industrial stuff online
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,991	| IOT166 |	So there's a new
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:14,367	| IOT166 |	Partnership between two companies one we've talked about before which is sick Fox they have a proprietary
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,927	| IOT166 |	Networks that they are trying to roll out around the world
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,231	| IOT166 |	And here Technologies which
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:22,047	| IOT166 |	Does a lot of mapping data location type information
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:25,887	| IOT166 |	Their location sweet the here location Suite references
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:32,287	| IOT166 |	Billions of Wi-Fi hotspots and when you combine the Wi-Fi hotspots with sigfox as Network now you've got
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,847	| IOT166 |	Hit capability to track
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:37,407	| IOT166 |	Tag Assets in the supply chain and Logistics area
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:42,271	| IOT166 |	So that's what they're doing their dancing a partnership to develop and deploy a global location service
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:48,671	| IOT166 |	For supply chain Logistics they don't mention anybody using it so this is brand-new this is just a partnership
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:54,047	| IOT166 |	Chip and they're talking about the baking a 1.9 trillion dollar opportunity for Global supply chain and Logistics
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:14:00,447	| IOT166 |	But I think it's a smart partnership because they're bringing together to readily accessible Technologies here
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:06,847	| IOT166 |	Providing an option to the traditional cellular companies and you know nb-iot and other Technologies for
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,871	| IOT166 |	This type of thing
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| IOT166 |	Speaking of it
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,711	| IOT166 |	Electric amp which makes
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,503	| IOT166 |	A module it was
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,551	| IOT166 |	Originally
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,111	| IOT166 |	Was more secure and
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,903	| IOT166 |	Provided you connect Electric
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,439	| IOT166 |	Saint Cloud so basically it was like
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,463	| IOT166 |	Iot in a box
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:29,375	| IOT166 |	So now I have intercellular which is a cellular version it offers LTE Cat 1 in 3-g
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,935	| IOT166 |	And you can do lots of it's got Computing on it every
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,215	| IOT166 |	And then
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,263	| IOT166 |	Eventually they're going to add
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| IOT166 |	Q4
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,567	| IOT166 |	A cat
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,103	| IOT166 |	Mnb iot
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,711	| IOT166 |	And just for you guys who may not be super familiar with various cellular
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| IOT166 |	Low power wide area Networks
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| IOT166 |	Cat 1M
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| IOT166 |	Allows you to
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,831	| IOT166 |	Use more data
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,599	| IOT166 |	So
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,111	| IOT166 |	How to make
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| IOT166 |	Did I believe it
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,159	| IOT166 |	It is end
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,719	| IOT166 |	The cellular providers can roll that out
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,487	| IOT166 |	Pretty much with a software
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,535	| IOT166 |	Nb-iot
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,327	| IOT166 |	You're looking at smaller data
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,863	| IOT166 |	So are slower data
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:05,983	| IOT166 |	So you can transfer less data and the other providers actually have to update their infrastructure
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,751	| IOT166 |	A little bit more
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,775	| IOT166 |	War at their towers
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,287	| IOT166 |	Worst to support
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,591	| IOT166 |	They are supporting it it's
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,127	| IOT166 |	Becoming very much the standard
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,943	| IOT166 |	But you gotta figure application
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,223	| IOT166 |	And one makes sense
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,527	| IOT166 |	Smaller less data rich
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,039	| IOT166 |	Nb-iot
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,855	| IOT166 |	So is this good news
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:26,463	| IOT166 |	Electric imp has done a really good job for Enterprise customers of making it
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:30,047	| IOT166 |	Very easy to get something online and keep it consistent
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,071	| IOT166 |	Around the world
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,631	| IOT166 |	So this is been popular in regulated Industries
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,679	| IOT166 |	Where you can get approvals for
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| IOT166 |	Your cloud provider
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,751	| IOT166 |	Cellular provider and then
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,519	| IOT166 |	You're done
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,055	| IOT166 |	Which is nice so
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:46,943	| IOT166 |	We'll see more about this pricing for the cellular connectivity is going to be based on the number of devices connected
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| IOT166 |	And it'll just automatically go through
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,527	| IOT166 |	Count
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,295	| IOT166 |	Your devices that
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:56,415	| IOT166 |	Are charged in the US that use T-Mobile AT&T
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,463	| IOT166 |	Wherever you have the best cover
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:02,047	| IOT166 |	So it sounds a lot like what twilio is doing with their
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,071	| IOT166 |	Wireless connectivity
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,095	| IOT166 |	Deprogram as well
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,423	| IOT166 |	It's great because we're seeing a lot of these middlemen come in
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,447	| IOT166 |	And provide
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:12,799	| IOT166 |	Cellular connectivity without companies having to go and try to do deals with a site
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| IOT166 |	Which if you're not a big company
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,895	| IOT166 |	It's tough
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,687	| IOT166 |	And even if you are a big company
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,735	| IOT166 |	You may want something that's a bit more
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,247	| IOT166 |	Mike Lobel
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:28,159	| IOT166 |	You can actually pre-order this module 2 and get it around July 30th through 85 bucks which isn't too terrible X
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,951	| IOT166 |	Expensive if you want to do some prototyping and testing
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| IOT166 |	All right
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,327	| IOT166 |	Let's go on to
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,607	| IOT166 |	You are experienced
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,887	| IOT166 |	Yesterday Kevin and I
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:41,983	| IOT166 |	Hey let's test out that Amazon smart scheduling stuff
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| IOT166 |	About last week end
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,359	| IOT166 |	We spent like an hour
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,455	| IOT166 |	It was surprising
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:57,855	| IOT166 |	That's kind of because you really have to be preconfigured in a sense to use it effectively and the more we
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,879	| IOT166 |	Set it up
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:03,231	| IOT166 |	The more I realize this is not something consumers are going to use this is more of it
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,255	| IOT166 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:08,095	| IOT166 |	Type service and it's going to be Enterprise within your own
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,631	| IOT166 |	Surprise so this is
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,167	| IOT166 |	Probably great for intern
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:13,727	| IOT166 |	Turn on meeting so what this is is basically your
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,007	| IOT166 |	Able to say
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,775	| IOT166 |	Madam
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| IOT166 |	And again
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,335	| IOT166 |	We do that to avoid setting off your
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,103	| IOT166 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| IOT166 |	Madam
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| IOT166 |	Schedule a meeting with
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,223	| IOT166 |	And
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,527	| IOT166 |	Then theoretically she's supposed to say
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| IOT166 |	What time is the meeting
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,831	| IOT166 |	Or she might
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,599	| IOT166 |	Suggest a schedule
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,415	| IOT166 |	Yoshi first check
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:38,815	| IOT166 |	Both calendars to see what options are available explains you are both available from this time this time and this
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,095	| IOT166 |	This time to this time when would you like to meet
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,375	| IOT166 |	SEPTA
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,447	| IOT166 |	To make this all work cuz it sounds awesome cuz you have to pay to schedule meeting
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:46,239	| IOT166 |	It's right to make this work you have to
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,775	| IOT166 |	Have a couple things going
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,567	| IOT166 |	You have to have your
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,847	| IOT166 |	Calendar linked to
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,383	| IOT166 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,151	| IOT166 |	2
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:56,223	| IOT166 |	You actually have to share your calendar access
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,271	| IOT166 |	With the person you're trying to make
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,551	| IOT166 |	Appointment
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,111	| IOT166 |	That's why I say this is more of an Enterprise play
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,879	| IOT166 |	Yes so
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,415	| IOT166 |	I did share my calendar with
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,439	| IOT166 |	Then he shared his with
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,975	| IOT166 |	But this is not something
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:07,999	| IOT166 |	We would normally do
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,791	| IOT166 |	And you also
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,863	| IOT166 |	How to make sure your contacts are
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,655	| IOT166 |	Queen when they go into
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,495	| IOT166 |	So for example I had an old email
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,775	| IOT166 |	Address for Kevin
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,079	| IOT166 |	In one of my contacts in that unfortunately is the
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,663	| IOT166 |	Madame Mao
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,431	| IOT166 |	Looks at
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,735	| IOT166 |	So you can't edit your contacts for
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT166 |	From within
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,271	| IOT166 |	The app
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| IOT166 |	The Amazon app
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,831	| IOT166 |	You have to go to York on
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| IOT166 |	Text app
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,391	| IOT166 |	And then once you've done that
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,207	| IOT166 |	It doesn't actually propagate right away to
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:43,071	| IOT166 |	Amazon and that depends for me it did propagate cuz I did at Stacy's
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:49,471	| IOT166 |	Information as well in my native contacts app I did it on my iPhone and it propagated immediately you did it on your
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,031	| IOT166 |	I don't know which Android phone you have and it didn't
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,055	| IOT166 |	It didn't propagate for like
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,335	| IOT166 |	It now has the
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,967	| IOT166 |	It's a cool
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,247	| IOT166 |	Service without a doubt
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:07,135	| IOT166 |	And to be honest I mean I would schedule meetings with third-parties when I worked in corporate all the time and if there
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,927	| IOT166 |	In my contacts that might have their information
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:13,023	| IOT166 |	I wouldn't necessarily be sharing calendars with them so it would not work for that
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:16,863	| IOT166 |	You can set a calendar hold oh so you can actually do it
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:18,143	| IOT166 |	And what'll happen is
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,679	| IOT166 |	The calendar invite will be
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,703	| IOT166 |	Email to them
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,495	| IOT166 |	And then they can see it
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,007	| IOT166 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:27,103	| IOT166 |	Nice the other nice thing about this I thought maybe it was
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:30,943	| IOT166 |	Specific to Amazon made Echo devices only has some features
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| IOT166 |	Are only for Amazon devices
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:38,367	| IOT166 |	But I tried it this morning on the Sonos one that has met him a built-in
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:42,463	| IOT166 |	And I was able to do the exact same thing with Miss Stacy so it
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:45,023	| IOT166 |	Does work on 3rd party Echo devices
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,839	| IOT166 |	So there you have it in this is compatible with Microsoft
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| IOT166 |	65
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:51,679	| IOT166 |	Google G suite and several other popular
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| IOT166 |	Corporate email applications so
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| IOT166 |	Yeah maybe
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:58,079	| IOT166 |	If you got people you schedule meetings with a lot and this is something you're interested in
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| IOT166 |	Maybe just
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:01,663	| IOT166 |	Connect with them and you're like hey let's do this calendar sharing
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:05,247	| IOT166 |	So a rhetorical question why doesn't the Google home do this
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,551	| IOT166 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:13,951	| IOT166 |	Let Me Ride Along I did actually run into Mark Speights who's in charge of Google speakers efforts
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,487	| IOT166 |	Add a conference I was at last week
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,047	| IOT166 |	And I asked him about that and he actually said
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,839	| IOT166 |	But that is a common complaint
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:20,863	| IOT166 |	And their works
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,935	| IOT166 |	I didn't feel much better but you don't
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,215	| IOT166 |	There we have
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,983	| IOT166 |	All right
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,775	| IOT166 |	Essential phone
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:30,079	| IOT166 |	Kevin I saw this and I was really sad because
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,871	| IOT166 |	Cuz the essential phone is not doing well
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,407	| IOT166 |	The company Maybe
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,735	| IOT166 |	Not develop the essential phone 2
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,759	| IOT166 |	Might be able to sell that
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,783	| IOT166 |	Business what's going
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:44,415	| IOT166 |	Yeah there's been some talk of essential putting itself up for sale definitely cancelling II essential
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:49,023	| IOT166 |	The first one it has not sold well the estimates are like a hundred fifty thousand
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:52,863	| IOT166 |	Diamonds which is nothing in the grand scheme of things
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,935	| IOT166 |	Basically brought the Android operating system to Google
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,215	| IOT166 |	When Google purchased Android
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:03,871	| IOT166 |	He's in charge of essential and he put a tweet out saying you know we're constantly evaluating our products and
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| IOT166 |	We are
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:11,039	| IOT166 |	Still focused on creating great mobile and Home Products and
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,087	| IOT166 |	Products we do care about because
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,879	| IOT166 |	Andy had said when
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,159	| IOT166 |	The company launched that they were going to
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:20,256	| IOT166 |	Bring forth the ambient OS that would tie all of our home devices together
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:27,168	| IOT166 |	We haven't seen that I've spoken to the central at CES and pretty much got a no comment you know things are in the works when we haven't
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:33,568	| IOT166 |	Oracle share what is this mean for ambient OS I don't know I mean if they get sold maybe they still plow ahead with that
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:36,384	| IOT166 |	Maybe they don't I don't know is a lot up in the air right now
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,432	| IOT166 |	Was really excited to see Andy Robinson
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,200	| IOT166 |	Interpretation of
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,480	| IOT166 |	Like a smart home
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:46,112	| IOT166 |	So I am too but I was always concerned about it and I still am because
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:53,024	| IOT166 |	He and said that they're just going to work with public apis from all the different device makers to tie everything together and those epi
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:53,792	| IOT166 |	Does change all the time
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,072	| IOT166 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,376	| IOT166 |	All right
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,168	| IOT166 |	We won't stay depressed over that
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,448	| IOT166 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,056	| IOT166 |	Be smart cameras made by
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:08,896	| IOT166 |	For some users they haven't been able to log into their app for so
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,176	| IOT166 |	Days
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,456	| IOT166 |	And
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,992	| IOT166 |	I got to save
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:15,552	| IOT166 |	The response to this has not been awesome so
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:17,088	| IOT166 |	Took a while to figure this out
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,648	| IOT166 |	And then they're saying it's a DNS issue
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:23,232	| IOT166 |	For users and user should reset their DNS setting
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,000	| IOT166 |	Switch
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| IOT166 |	That's a pretty ticket
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,280	| IOT166 |	Nothing to ask
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,864	| IOT166 |	Sweet easy to do but most people
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:33,216	| IOT166 |	It just happens automatically don't worry about it with a lot of people have never been into the DNS settings
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| IOT166 |	Suck ya
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,520	| IOT166 |	That's not the answer
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:41,920	| IOT166 |	Also this week D-Link has some new Wi-Fi cameras and they have home connectivity
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| IOT166 |	Play with
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,712	| IOT166 |	Google
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,480	| IOT166 |	Assistant
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:50,112	| IOT166 |	Amazon Alexa and if they send that there's a trio of cameras the HD Wi-Fi camera which will cost
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:57,280	| IOT166 |	5999 there's a full HD Wi-Fi camera for 8999 and then a full HD pan-and-tilt
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,328	| IOT166 |	Wi-Fi camera for 9999
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:05,728	| IOT166 |	What I like about these they offer for different service levels if you want to subscribe or not that's up to you
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:09,312	| IOT166 |	Cloud storage of the video they have a free option
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:12,896	| IOT166 |	That works with three cameras and has a 24-hour rolling
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,688	| IOT166 |	History of what's being captured
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,736	| IOT166 |	Do they have a basic option for a week
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,504	| IOT166 |	But you can get
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,784	| IOT166 |	For 25 bucks a year
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,552	| IOT166 |	Premium option
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:23,904	| IOT166 |	For 14 days and also adds two more cameras 05 cameras for $50 a year
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,696	| IOT166 |	In the pro version Story video for
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:31,840	| IOT166 |	30 days in the cloud but you have 10 cameras and is $100 a year I actually like that pricing scheme and I wish
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:37,728	| IOT166 |	Companies would kind of look at that give you those kind of different levels and even up the number of devices as well
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,288	| IOT166 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:46,176	| IOT166 |	So we also have a quick update LG 2018 TVs now work with the
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,200	| IOT166 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,248	| IOT166 |	So you can talk to Madam a
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,528	| IOT166 |	Using your LG
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:53,856	| IOT166 |	Already had Google Assistant social condition of
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,368	| IOT166 |	Amazon
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,672	| IOT166 |	And I don't really care
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,440	| IOT166 |	For homekit
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,720	| IOT166 |	But I'm really excited about the
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,256	| IOT166 |	These devices so Elgato
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,024	| IOT166 |	Which makes
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,560	| IOT166 |	Homekit enabled sensor
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,840	| IOT166 |	And other connected
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,400	| IOT166 |	Devices
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,424	| IOT166 |	Sprinkler
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:10,240	| IOT166 |	Control system actually it's like a hose control system
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,008	| IOT166 |	Andale
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,288	| IOT166 |	Lamp called the eve
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,080	| IOT166 |	Claire so
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,360	| IOT166 |	Kevin thought I'd be excited by the
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,128	| IOT166 |	Slayer lamp
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,432	| IOT166 |	But I do love my lighting and this is homekit enabled
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,456	| IOT166 |	Portable LED lamp
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,016	| IOT166 |	Commercially available
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,576	| IOT166 |	Europe
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,112	| IOT166 |	Gdpr compliant
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:30,208	| IOT166 |	It reminds me the Phillips has one called the Goliath
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,512	| IOT166 |	And that's out like a light it looks like a bowl
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,024	| IOT166 |	Close
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,584	| IOT166 |	So that is available
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,096	| IOT166 |	It's 99 years
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,144	| IOT166 |	And then
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,168	| IOT166 |	Elgato
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| IOT166 |	Aqua
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,472	| IOT166 |	Is basically
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:46,080	| IOT166 |	A little irrigation controller so far
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,872	| IOT166 |	But this is homekit enabled it's
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:51,456	| IOT166 |	Create schedules for the cult your sprinkler system
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,760	| IOT166 |	This really attaches to a spigot
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,320	| IOT166 |	And then you can control your outdoor irrigation
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,648	| IOT166 |	And that's going to be 9995
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:02,464	| IOT166 |	And it can be pre-ordered from the Elgato website in the
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,232	| IOT166 |	Us
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:03,744	| IOT166 |	As of now
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,024	| IOT166 |	So
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,048	| IOT166 |	If your homekit enabled
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:10,400	| IOT166 |	That's actually pretty cool and maybe I would buy it and just use homekit for that
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,168	| IOT166 |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:15,776	| IOT166 |	We'll see how so we got a quick update for the Schlage sense deadbolt
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:20,128	| IOT166 |	Which is now compatible with Google assistant so you can ask Google if your door is locked
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,920	| IOT166 |	You can say lock my door
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:28,320	| IOT166 |	You cannot unlock the door like you can with certain locks and the echo when you do that with an echo it will actually a
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,856	| IOT166 |	Ask for a PIN to unlock
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,392	| IOT166 |	Adore as well as
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,416	| IOT166 |	The command to unlock it
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:38,816	| IOT166 |	For security reasons so maybe they will add that but for the moment you can lock or check the status with a Schlage sense deadbolt
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| IOT166 |	And finally
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,656	| IOT166 |	Philips Hue has a new app
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,680	| IOT166 |	And I'm going to tell you
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,960	| IOT166 |	Guys it's really good
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:47,264	| IOT166 |	I have not been I don't use my Philips
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:47,776	| IOT166 |	Q app.
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,848	| IOT166 |	I got most of it automated
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,128	| IOT166 |	You just control it
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,664	| IOT166 |	Voice
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,688	| IOT166 |	But the new app
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,992	| IOT166 |	Especially for a colors and scenes
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,808	| IOT166 |	I like it so give that a try if you are a Philips Hue
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| IOT166 |	And let us know what you think
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,416	| IOT166 |	Finally we have a quick correction
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:07,488	| IOT166 |	Couple weeks ago we were talking about habitat which is a
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,512	| IOT166 |	Local
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,536	| IOT166 |	It's also connect
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,584	| IOT166 |	The idea is that it is a locally control
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,888	| IOT166 |	We said that it had WiFi
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:14,912	| IOT166 |	It is not
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,448	| IOT166 |	It connects to
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:17,984	| IOT166 |	Your router via is
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,776	| IOT166 |	So there you have it
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,080	| IOT166 |	You don't like hubs like Kevin doesn't like
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,592	| IOT166 |	I Cubs this mean
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,128	| IOT166 |	Or rather
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:25,408	| IOT166 |	You don't like the direct connection
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:33,600	| IOT166 |	And it's just a location thing for me sometimes people's routers are not in a central area in which case smart home device
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| IOT166 |	Isis man range issues
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:37,696	| IOT166 |	So that's my bigger concern that in
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,744	| IOT166 |	Ports on my router but that's a whole nother issue
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,768	| IOT166 |	Do not get him started
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,792	| IOT166 |	Don't get me started
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| IOT166 |	Bad
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,400	| IOT166 |	So we can distract you
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,680	| IOT166 |	Quick quick
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,472	| IOT166 |	Let's go to our
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:51,520	| IOT166 |	Iot podcast listener hotline
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,544	| IOT166 |	And guess what
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:58,944	| IOT166 |	You guys I have an ecobee SI it works with Google Assistant it works with Amazon
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:01,760	| IOT166 |	On Echo it is not the pretty cool awesome
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,784	| IOT166 |	Ecobee that I like
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,808	| IOT166 |	But it is
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,344	| IOT166 |	A really nice connected thermostat

EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,984	| IOT166 |	Teeth so that can chew
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| IOT166 |	Wow two whole weeks
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,544	| IOT166 |	To call in
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,824	| IOT166 |	Leave us a question
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,616	| IOT166 |	Entered
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,384	| IOT166 |	Guinda and
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| IOT166 |	Ecobee SI
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:33,504	| IOT166 |	Worst case scenario you get a free internet connected thermostat
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,016	| IOT166 |	It works
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,296	| IOT166 |	What's not to love
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,344	| IOT166 |	Okay so this week
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,368	| IOT166 |	Voicemail is
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,160	| IOT166 |	Actually a really cool suggestion
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,464	| IOT166 |	The brings us back into this Enterprise area of
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,232	| IOT166 |	Merrimack
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| IOT166 |	Some Kevin in Raleigh
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:47,328	| IOT166 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin Kevin and Raleigh
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,656	| IOT166 |	Remember Stacy
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:55,264	| IOT166 |	Saying something I believe it might have been on
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| IOT166 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,824	| IOT166 |	And iot
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:02,688	| IOT166 |	Devices not sensors but things like the echo Etc
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:08,832	| IOT166 |	There is a company anyways has been integrating the echo device
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:11,136	| IOT166 |	With servicenow
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,672	| IOT166 |	It service management
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:16,512	| IOT166 |	So that people in the Enterprise can do things like
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,048	| IOT166 |	Change request
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,608	| IOT166 |	Thought you might find it interesting and something
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,120	| IOT166 |	How to keep an eye on
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,656	| IOT166 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,424	| IOT166 |	Heaven
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,960	| IOT166 |	That's actually a really good idea
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:26,240	| IOT166 |	And I thought it sounded
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,520	| IOT166 |	Kevin who's actually
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,312	| IOT166 |	Question does a job
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,848	| IOT166 |	He has actually paid
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,360	| IOT166 |	Answer informed
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:40,064	| IOT166 |	Yes many moons ago I was starting on a technical help desk and a Fortune 100 company and I remember opening
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:45,952	| IOT166 |	Closing service tickets like a maniac well it turns out Kevin from Raleigh mention
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,232	| IOT166 |	Servicenow
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:49,792	| IOT166 |	Which has worked with a company called
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:52,352	| IOT166 |	Decibel apps least based on the research I found
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:56,192	| IOT166 |	And they have a skill you can say mad at me
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:29:01,824	| IOT166 |	Ask ticket now to create an incident so basically in the Enterprise if you're on a help desk or
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:04,128	| IOT166 |	Your tracking any kind of incidents you could
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:07,712	| IOT166 |	Just create them by voice if you've got echoes in the Enterprise so
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:14,112	| IOT166 |	It's pretty cool skill I know that at the AWS event in November last year they had a hat
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,136	| IOT166 |	Check your office
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:19,744	| IOT166 |	Little party where people trying to create skills for the Enterprise and I don't know if this came out of it or not
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:23,584	| IOT166 |	I know this is available and there is a white paper written on how to create
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:30,496	| IOT166 |	Skills with the Echo and service now so there's probably like a whole market for these kind of things that we probably don't
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:35,360	| IOT166 |	About you often so I'm glad Kevin brought this up cuz I would not know nothing about this I've been wondering
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,640	| IOT166 |	How do we get
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:40,992	| IOT166 |	These Voice assistance in the Enterprise and this is a perfect example of one way to do it
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:44,576	| IOT166 |	Easier service tickets and
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,344	| IOT166 |	Scheduling meeting

EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,608	| IOT166 |	What the heck is happening
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,376	| IOT166 |	Let me talk about AI
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,680	| IOT166 |	Why Jetson

EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,128	| IOT166 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,664	| IOT166 |	Today's guests
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,688	| IOT166 |	Jessie
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:49,248	| IOT166 |	Clayton who is a senior manager for product
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,016	| IOT166 |	Export IntelliJ
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:50,784	| IOT166 |	Machines at
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,064	| IOT166 |	Nvidia
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,344	| IOT166 |	Hi Jessie how are you doing today
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,136	| IOT166 |	I'm doing well how are you
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,440	| IOT166 |	I'm super excited to talk to you
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,208	| IOT166 |	Because
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:02,560	| IOT166 |	We have been so focused here at the show on edge computing
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,096	| IOT166 |	Machine learning at the edge
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,120	| IOT166 |	Vision
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| IOT166 |	Enable and
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,936	| IOT166 |	Feel like in videos
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,472	| IOT166 |	What's going on there
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,752	| IOT166 |	Which is actually
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:17,152	| IOT166 |	Quite unusual from where I thought Nvidia was going to go so let's get started with your main product that you guys are pushing
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,664	| IOT166 |	4
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:20,736	| IOT166 |	Computer vision at the edge is that a fair assessment
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,248	| IOT166 |	Maybe it's Prada
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:25,856	| IOT166 |	I think artificial intelligence at the edge is probably the right Category 2
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:29,440	| IOT166 |	But this okay so this is a board this is the Jetson
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:31,488	| IOT166 |	Tx2 is the latest version of
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,792	| IOT166 |	So tell me a little bit about what you guys are doing
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:37,888	| IOT166 |	Absolutely so it in video where laser focused on artist
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:40,192	| IOT166 |	Videos of worlds
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:42,240	| IOT166 |	Leading AI platform and we build
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,264	| IOT166 |	Products to help
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,544	| IOT166 |	Floyd
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:45,824	| IOT166 |	Use cases
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,616	| IOT166 |	Now the iot is really
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,640	| IOT166 |	About computation
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,456	| IOT166 |	Communication and specifically where do you put
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,480	| IOT166 |	The computation for
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,760	| IOT166 |	The problem that you're trying to solve
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,040	| IOT166 |	Doesn't make sense
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,832	| IOT166 |	The computation or the AI
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:57,344	| IOT166 |	In the cloud
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:58,624	| IOT166 |	Or at the edge
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:01,440	| IOT166 |	Or somewhere in between in many cases it belongs in the
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:05,280	| IOT166 |	In the cloud or the data center but there's some use cases where that's just not possible
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,304	| IOT166 |	Either because of net
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:07,328	| IOT166 |	Work van with constraints
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,096	| IOT166 |	Soar latency
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:08,864	| IOT166 |	Privacy
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,888	| IOT166 |	Availability and so
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,424	| IOT166 |	For those use cases
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,192	| IOT166 |	They really need
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,216	| IOT166 |	The AI running a
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:18,592	| IOT166 |	There's two important technologies that Nvidia is building for AISD
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,640	| IOT166 |	Jetson is NVIDIA splat
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,176	| IOT166 |	AI
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:26,272	| IOT166 |	The Jetson tx2 is a credit card-sized device that runs
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,296	| IOT166 |	Advanced AI in
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:29,600	| IOT166 |	10 watts at our customers
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:31,136	| IOT166 |	Use it in autonomous machines
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,672	| IOT166 |	Like robots and drones
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,696	| IOT166 |	4 manufacturing
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:34,464	| IOT166 |	And Logistics
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:35,744	| IOT166 |	And further applications
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:37,536	| IOT166 |	In the industrial internet-of-things like
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,560	| IOT166 |	Predictive maintenance
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:41,888	| IOT166 |	Now there's also some of these cases where even Jetson is too big and I
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,192	| IOT166 |	Making of the trillions of sensors
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,216	| IOT166 |	Wearables
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,008	| IOT166 |	Mobile devices in these devices
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:47,776	| IOT166 |	Can still benefit
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:48,544	| IOT166 |	From AI
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,080	| IOT166 |	So for these Nvidia has
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:51,104	| IOT166 |	Deep learning Excel
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:53,920	| IOT166 |	Or nvdla nvdla is
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:54,432	| IOT166 |	Hardware
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:58,528	| IOT166 |	Make sure that Nvidia has open sourced to enable companies to benefit
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:02,880	| IOT166 |	From our own AI research and to incorporate this design into their own products
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:06,208	| IOT166 |	Now we just announced recently that nvdla will be available
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,232	| IOT166 |	As part of arms
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT166 |	Trillium
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:10,048	| IOT166 |	Platform and the partnership makes it simple
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,328	| IOT166 |	Wolf or coyote chip company
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:15,424	| IOT166 |	Integrate AI into their design so nvdla is new so it hasn't been
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,192	| IOT166 |	Corporated antenna
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,216	| IOT166 |	Products yet with
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,496	| IOT166 |	Exception of some of them.
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:19,520	| IOT166 |	Motor Products
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,824	| IOT166 |	So I've been covering in video for
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,336	| IOT166 |	Decade
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,640	| IOT166 |	And I watched it start
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:27,456	| IOT166 |	Gpus then go into mobile phone processing fee
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:28,992	| IOT166 |	The logic was
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,528	| IOT166 |	Does koshka Graphics need to be everywhere
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:36,672	| IOT166 |	So what tipped you off or got you guys
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,696	| IOT166 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:40,256	| IOT166 |	Creating the smaller profile technology
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:43,840	| IOT166 |	You correctly stated that are
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,120	| IOT166 |	Nvidia got its start in
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,448	| IOT166 |	In designing processors cheap used for computer graphic
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,752	| IOT166 |	And as it turned out that highly
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| IOT166 |	Parallel architecture
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,824	| IOT166 |	For computer graphics
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:56,128	| IOT166 |	Is also very good for many other testing
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:59,968	| IOT166 |	Shooting and most recently artificial intelligence now today a lot of
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,504	| IOT166 |	Intelligence happen
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:02,784	| IOT166 |	Data Center
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,064	| IOT166 |	Turn the cloud but
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,088	| IOT166 |	We realized
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,136	| IOT166 |	Terminated
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:09,952	| IOT166 |	Play some of these capabilities out to the network at
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:14,304	| IOT166 |	Automotive self-driving cars was the first example where we really saw it
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,352	| IOT166 |	An important role that vehicle
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:16,864	| IOT166 |	Play and help
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,680	| IOT166 |	Bring that technology but of course
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,448	| IOT166 |	Are there devices
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:21,472	| IOT166 |	Microbots
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:23,520	| IOT166 |	Portable Medical
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:25,312	| IOT166 |	What devices can all potentially benefit
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:27,872	| IOT166 |	Artificial intelligence and so
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,152	| IOT166 |	Sort of combining those two
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:32,736	| IOT166 |	To heritage's the one of Designing highly parallel processor
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,272	| IOT166 |	What can be used for artificial
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,040	| IOT166 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:37,088	| IOT166 |	And then designing low-power chips
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,112	| IOT166 |	For going into
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:40,416	| IOT166 |	Mobile products like phones and tablets
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:40,928	| IOT166 |	We realized that we
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,208	| IOT166 |	Could produce something
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:46,304	| IOT166 |	Sing that was almost uniquely qualified to deliver artificial intelligence 2
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,072	| IOT166 |	Biatch
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:49,120	| IOT166 |	All right and for people who are maybe less
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:53,728	| IOT166 |	Differences between training and the computer needs there
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:54,240	| IOT166 |	Executioner
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:58,080	| IOT166 |	So maybe I can give a little bit of an example
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:02,432	| IOT166 |	The first step in modern artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning is training
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:02,944	| IOT166 |	A neural network
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:07,552	| IOT166 |	This is when you're showing the neural network many many instances of the things
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:09,600	| IOT166 |	But you wanted to learn so if you wanted to learn
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:11,904	| IOT166 |	Aztec people you show it lots of pictures of people
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:12,928	| IOT166 |	These are people
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:15,232	| IOT166 |	Or if you wanted to learn to detect cats you should
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,000	| IOT166 |	Lots of pictures
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,512	| IOT166 |	The cat
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,816	| IOT166 |	Are cats and through that process
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,608	| IOT166 |	Of training it learns to distinguish
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:21,120	| IOT166 |	Patterns
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:24,960	| IOT166 |	People and cats and whatever else it is that you decide
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,984	| IOT166 |	It's a train that neural network
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:28,544	| IOT166 |	Now the result of that training activity is a
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,312	| IOT166 |	The train model
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:32,896	| IOT166 |	Network which can then be deployed for the second part
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,688	| IOT166 |	Deep learning which is called inference
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:38,784	| IOT166 |	An inference you're exposing it to new data that it hasn't seen but
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,808	| IOT166 |	Before and it's drawing
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,856	| IOT166 |	Conclusions from that date or drawing inferences
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:43,136	| IOT166 |	From that day to see you show it
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,416	| IOT166 |	A person that it's never seemed
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,184	| IOT166 |	Warren tells you that
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:48,768	| IOT166 |	The person who showed a cat that has never seen before and it tells you that that's a cat
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:51,584	| IOT166 |	Now the training part of this is very very computation
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,376	| IOT166 |	Ideal you want to be
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,656	| IOT166 |	Running this in a super
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:59,008	| IOT166 |	Computer in the cloud but inference while still computationally intensive
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,288	| IOT166 |	It can be scaled down
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| IOT166 |	To fit into summer
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:02,592	| IOT166 |	Edge device
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:08,736	| IOT166 |	Okay and so we were talking about doing inference at the edge where the architectural decisions what do you need
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:14,624	| IOT166 |	Has it turned out good for doing both the train peace and the in
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:17,184	| IOT166 |	And the reason why that is
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,208	| IOT166 |	When you're training
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:23,072	| IOT166 |	What you're really doing is running the data through the neural network the neural networks spits out and ants
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:26,656	| IOT166 |	So let's say you show a picture of a cat and it says car
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:31,008	| IOT166 |	Can you say no that's not a car that's a cat go back and readjust your weights
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,032	| IOT166 |	To an algorithm
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:34,080	| IOT166 |	Notice backpropagation and then
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,104	| IOT166 |	Run the same data
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:38,944	| IOT166 |	Through the neural network again it through this process eventually at Tunes all the settings
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:41,504	| IOT166 |	Network until it can correctly produce the answer
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,064	| IOT166 |	How many move on to the next image in the next image and so far
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:45,344	| IOT166 |	So that first
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:48,672	| IOT166 |	Pass that forecast is actually the same thing as in
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,952	| IOT166 |	Prince's own training are doing
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,744	| IOT166 |	Fordpass and the backpack
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:55,328	| IOT166 |	For inference you're only doing the fordpass and so that's why
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,352	| IOT166 |	Can you see these architecture
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:59,168	| IOT166 |	Is GPU architecture is being replicated for both
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:03,264	| IOT166 |	Training in a server in the cloud as well as inference out at
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,568	| IOT166 |	And so to answer your
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,848	| IOT166 |	Questions to Simply
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:09,152	| IOT166 |	You need a general-purpose highly
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:14,016	| IOT166 |	Parallelize architecture in order to run inference for these neural networks efficiently
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:14,784	| IOT166 |	Okay
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:15,808	| IOT166 |	You just don't need it
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,576	| IOT166 |	Many
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:19,392	| IOT166 |	That's correct so inference is one pass
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:21,952	| IOT166 |	The neural network
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:24,512	| IOT166 |	Where is with training you're doing many many forward passes
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,280	| IOT166 |	Many many backwards
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,328	| IOT166 |	And so that's why you need much
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:30,144	| IOT166 |	Resources for the training side than you do
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:33,472	| IOT166 |	Inference inference is still computationally
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,240	| IOT166 |	Complexion
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,264	| IOT166 |	Is continuing to
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,568	| IOT166 |	To grow researchers are advancing
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,592	| IOT166 |	In the research today there
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,616	| IOT166 |	Designing new
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:41,664	| IOT166 |	Neural network designs and the
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,200	| IOT166 |	Depth and the size of those
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:46,784	| IOT166 |	Neural networks is increasing and so in order to keep up with
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,552	| IOT166 |	Today's
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:50,112	| IOT166 |	Research you really need a platform that's
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,392	| IOT166 |	Continuing to in
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,672	| IOT166 |	Increase of performance
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,952	| IOT166 |	Abilities year-over-year
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,512	| IOT166 |	Okay we're going to talk about that
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:57,024	| IOT166 |	When we start talking about
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:01,120	| IOT166 |	Let's go back to kind of business decisions that invidious
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:06,752	| IOT166 |	So I originally reached out to you guys because I had heard that the Jetson tx1
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,568	| IOT166 |	One of the fastest rising
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:10,592	| IOT166 |	From a percentage
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,896	| IOT166 |	Iot platforms out there
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:15,200	| IOT166 |	Let's talk about what people are
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:15,712	| IOT166 |	Doing
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,016	| IOT166 |	Sure so
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:19,808	| IOT166 |	Jetson is suitable for application
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:21,600	| IOT166 |	Where you need a lot of coffee
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:22,880	| IOT166 |	Realize that your
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,952	| IOT166 |	So for example
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:26,976	| IOT166 |	In robotics there
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,000	| IOT166 |	A big deed for
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,536	| IOT166 |	4 AI capabilities but
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,072	| IOT166 |	It turns out it's really hard to do
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,352	| IOT166 |	Because you need this massive
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,120	| IOT166 |	Amounts of
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:34,912	| IOT166 |	Compute in the size and Power on blue
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:39,264	| IOT166 |	It's typical of these Edge devices like robots in order to optimize
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,032	| IOT166 |	Crop yields
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:42,080	| IOT166 |	And reduce the use of spray.
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:47,200	| IOT166 |	Chemicals Blue River technology uses cameras mounted on tractors to differentiate crops
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:50,784	| IOT166 |	From weeds and to deploy treatment only where it's needed
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,064	| IOT166 |	This allows them to
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,088	| IOT166 |	Dramatically
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:54,368	| IOT166 |	Reduce the amount of spray can
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,672	| IOT166 |	Chemicals and the speed at which they can drive the tractor
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:58,464	| IOT166 |	Depends on how fast
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:39:59,744	| IOT166 |	The processor
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:03,584	| IOT166 |	Process the image so for them Jackson is really critical to productivity
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,376	| IOT166 |	We also see a lot of
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,424	| IOT166 |	Work in navigation where robots
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,704	| IOT166 |	Using AI to low
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:12,288	| IOT166 |	Localizan navigate like last mile delivery robots made by marble
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:15,104	| IOT166 |	Her by Robbie Jetsons also being used to manufacture
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:17,152	| IOT166 |	View robotics develops technology
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,688	| IOT166 |	For collaborative robots
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:22,016	| IOT166 |	I can work alongside humans and FANUC uses AI for opt
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:25,344	| IOT166 |	Inspection on its robots
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:29,184	| IOT166 |	Consumer drone that can autonomously navigate through complex environments like
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:34,304	| IOT166 |	Mountains and Forest and Pelt film people's Great Moments so those are all based on AI process
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:35,840	| IOT166 |	Video data but
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:38,144	| IOT166 |	There's a lot of other applications outside
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:39,424	| IOT166 |	Robotics using other types
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:44,288	| IOT166 |	Update as well one really cool use case is predictive maintenance using anomaly
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,312	| IOT166 |	Detection on Time series
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:47,104	| IOT166 |	So there's this really clever Tech
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:47,872	| IOT166 |	Technique called an auto in
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:50,688	| IOT166 |	What you basically train a neural network to in
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:52,736	| IOT166 |	Encode and decode a signal coming
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:53,760	| IOT166 |	From this time series data
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:56,320	| IOT166 |	Like let's say the current draw
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,344	| IOT166 |	From a water heater
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,880	| IOT166 |	Turn your home now that data
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:03,744	| IOT166 |	The current draw is going to change normally over the course of the day and the seasons but if something abnormal
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:06,560	| IOT166 |	The encoder won't be able to
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:08,096	| IOT166 |	Go to properly because it's never seen it
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,400	| IOT166 |	And so that's a signal that something
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,680	| IOT166 |	Abnormal is happening
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,704	| IOT166 |	And in many cases
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:14,240	| IOT166 |	Is it points to an impending failure
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,032	| IOT166 |	So the homeowner can schedule
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:19,360	| IOT166 |	The water heater breaks another really cool applications
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:21,408	| IOT166 |	South Dakota virtual sensor so let's say that
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:25,504	| IOT166 |	You really want to build is a redundant fuel flow measurement
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,552	| IOT166 |	For an aircraft now you know that
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,320	| IOT166 |	Fuel consumption
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:30,624	| IOT166 |	Is a function of air temperature and pressure in
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:33,696	| IOT166 |	Temperature at altitude speed but you don't know exactly what
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,512	| IOT166 |	You can train a neural network
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| IOT166 |	On these data and
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,328	| IOT166 |	Increte what is essentially
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,120	| IOT166 |	A virtual fuel flow sensor
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:41,888	| IOT166 |	From these other son
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:43,936	| IOT166 |	We see Jetson
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,984	| IOT166 |	Being used for AI at the edge
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,824	| IOT166 |	A lot of ways that we anticipated but also in a lot of edge application
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,848	| IOT166 |	Is that we never really considered
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,384	| IOT166 |	That's actually really cool
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:53,663	| IOT166 |	Marshall Center
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:56,991	| IOT166 |	This reminds me actually of something
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,527	| IOT166 |	I feel like I hear a lot of
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:04,159	| IOT166 |	Video examples and I feel like a lot of the big Tech firms are pushing this concept of video at the edge
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:09,279	| IOT166 |	Show me before finding a parking space that might be monitoring of manufacturing process to understand
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:10,047	| IOT166 |	What's going wrong
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:11,583	| IOT166 |	I'm curious
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,863	| IOT166 |	How you guys feel
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:16,447	| IOT166 |	Video versus maybe some of the other sensors out
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:21,055	| IOT166 |	Is video always the best option when should you use video over
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:21,567	| IOT166 |	Patterson
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:26,431	| IOT166 |	All videos great because it's such a rich sensor
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT166 |	You're sending 1080p
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:34,367	| IOT166 |	4K of pixels at 30 frames a second there's just a lot of data
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:38,207	| IOT166 |	Which you can infer a lot of things but your point there's a lot of cases
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:38,719	| IOT166 |	Video doesn't
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,023	| IOT166 |	It doesn't work in the dark for instance
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:42,815	| IOT166 |	It wouldn't work deep underwater
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:48,191	| IOT166 |	The same reasons or if you're trying to do things like measure the characteristics of a robot or the water he
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:50,751	| IOT166 |	Example that I use video is not going
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:54,079	| IOT166 |	There are all of these other sensors out there that are
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:56,639	| IOT166 |	Producing data where we think there is a lot of Art
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:57,407	| IOT166 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:59,967	| IOT166 |	To use artificial intelligence to draw insights from
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:00,991	| IOT166 |	That data I think
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:06,367	| IOT166 |	Exactly as you said most of the research and development is happening on video today because it's such a
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:08,671	| IOT166 |	Which sensor but there is also a lot of work
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:10,975	| IOT166 |	Getting less attention
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,255	| IOT166 |	Types of sensors
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:13,279	| IOT166 |	And let's
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,303	| IOT166 |	About the future
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:16,095	| IOT166 |	So as you guys are developing
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:19,935	| IOT166 |	It should be ahead of the Curve
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:21,215	| IOT166 |	Because my gosh
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:24,287	| IOT166 |	It takes a lot longer to build something in silicone then it does and software
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:26,847	| IOT166 |	So what are the workloads that you guys
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,383	| IOT166 |	Being interesting going
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:31,455	| IOT166 |	So what are the things we found in our work
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:33,247	| IOT166 |	With Jetson is that Jetsons
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,527	| IOT166 |	Incapable of solving
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,295	| IOT166 |	Many problems
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,575	| IOT166 |	Robotics
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:40,927	| IOT166 |	4 using artificial intelligence at the edge but there are many other
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,951	| IOT166 |	Challenges out there the
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:44,511	| IOT166 |	Because they demand
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,023	| IOT166 |	So much more
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:52,447	| IOT166 |	We can deliver today and there's two things that I'm really excited about the We Believe with future Generations will be able to
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:54,495	| IOT166 |	To address the first is on the robotic side
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,007	| IOT166 |	Automation
EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,799	| IOT166 |	Is already used to manufacture
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:59,615	| IOT166 |	It takes so much effort
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,639	| IOT166 |	Automated production
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:01,919	| IOT166 |	Slime that you only do it
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:02,687	| IOT166 |	Very large
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:05,247	| IOT166 |	IPhone for example github
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:07,295	| IOT166 |	Tremendous efficiency benefit from automation
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:11,647	| IOT166 |	Which might be really Innovative doesn't get that same benefits of
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,671	| IOT166 |	Cost of stamps
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:14,463	| IOT166 |	Say more per unit to manufacture
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:15,743	| IOT166 |	Can I take this as a negative
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:16,767	| IOT166 |	Impact on innovation
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| IOT166 |	Robots that can
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:19,839	| IOT166 |	Quickly learn to adapt
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,607	| IOT166 |	New jobs in
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:23,423	| IOT166 |	Products could make automation much more flexible
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,959	| IOT166 |	Introduce the barriers of
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,983	| IOT166 |	Bringing that
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:26,495	| IOT166 |	Innovation tomorrow
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,031	| IOT166 |	We believe that with
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:29,311	| IOT166 |	Increase comp
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,335	| IOT166 |	Vegetation coming in the
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,871	| IOT166 |	The future will be able to take on
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,919	| IOT166 |	More and more of these Manufacturing
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:35,455	| IOT166 |	Logistics tasks that can't yet
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:39,295	| IOT166 |	The second thing I'm really excited about is in portable Medical
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:39,807	| IOT166 |	Devices
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:43,903	| IOT166 |	Are there so many places in the world that the Physicians don't have good access to
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:45,695	| IOT166 |	Technology as I'm really excited about the
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,207	| IOT166 |	Potential
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:47,743	| IOT166 |	Judge has
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,047	| IOT166 |	Like I care in ultrasound
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,839	| IOT166 |	With the Next Generation
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:52,863	| IOT166 |	Processors
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,143	| IOT166 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:57,215	| IOT166 |	Companies will be able to address some of those challenges I also like being
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,007	| IOT166 |	Surprised by Innovation that I never
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:44:59,775	| IOT166 |	Would have thought of
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:00,287	| IOT166 |	The Jetsons
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,895	| IOT166 |	And I am super excited about this portable medicine idea
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:06,687	| IOT166 |	Kind of fun
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,455	| IOT166 |	I like it
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:10,015	| IOT166 |	So let's talk about the ecosystem because
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:12,575	| IOT166 |	Boomer type at the internet of things it's not like
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,367	| IOT166 |	You buy a board and
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:16,159	| IOT166 |	You just use it right you've got
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,183	| IOT166 |	All kinds of stuff
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:18,975	| IOT166 |	To have to work with the cloud with
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:20,511	| IOT166 |	Various other Edge providers
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:22,815	| IOT166 |	So how do you guys work
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:26,143	| IOT166 |	Companies maybe it's Microsoft Azure maybe it's Amazon
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:29,983	| IOT166 |	AWS maybe it's smaller platforms for the gala
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:33,311	| IOT166 |	It seems to be very consistent Trend that you have to
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:39,711	| IOT166 |	Link your boards to other people's clouds and services because a lot of these companies are building these
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,991	| IOT166 |	Which devices they're not as Technic
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,319	| IOT166 |	Yeah I think there's no question that
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,599	| IOT166 |	Products made from Jets
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:48,159	| IOT166 |	Going to exist in a large
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:48,927	| IOT166 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:51,999	| IOT166 |	Delivering pay I at
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,279	| IOT166 |	Hearts of
EDL	00:45:53,279	00:45:54,303	| IOT166 |	The network topology
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:58,399	| IOT166 |	I'll give you one example so json is used today in
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,447	| IOT166 |	Amazon Greengrass platform
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:03,263	| IOT166 |	So this is a platform that Amazon has developed to help
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,031	| IOT166 |	It's custom
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,055	| IOT166 |	Manage Apple
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:05,823	| IOT166 |	Locations for
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:08,383	| IOT166 |	The industrial internet-of-things and so Jetson
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:10,687	| IOT166 |	Can be deployed out at the edge to manage
EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:12,735	| IOT166 |	Some of these sensors that you
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:13,247	| IOT166 |	Find Floyd
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:14,783	| IOT166 |	Coyote
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:17,343	| IOT166 |	Run AI workload on them and then manage
EDL	00:46:17,343	00:46:18,367	| IOT166 |	That Jets North at
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:19,391	| IOT166 |	Collection of Jetsons
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:22,463	| IOT166 |	Through this higher level Amazon Greengrass platform
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:23,999	| IOT166 |	And so we see the sort of a
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:30,143	| IOT166 |	Approach being replicated other areas we believe it's really going to help our customers and their customers to play the technology more
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:33,215	| IOT166 |	So today working with Amazon eventually at work
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:36,287	| IOT166 |	Yeah that's correct so Jetson isn't open
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:41,919	| IOT166 |	Enable our partners and our customers to integrate their technology
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:42,687	| IOT166 |	West Jackson
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:43,711	| IOT166 |	Amazon green grass
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:46,015	| IOT166 |	Are the first ones that have been announced in
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:48,063	| IOT166 |	We expect many more announcements in the future
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:52,159	| IOT166 |	And let's just quickly to Circle back to the nvdla stuff
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,695	| IOT166 |	Because I I saw that
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:55,999	| IOT166 |	Announcement and I was really fascinated
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:58,815	| IOT166 |	Because I covered the arm Trillium announcement
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:02,911	| IOT166 |	Just a quick reminder for you guys the arm Trillium is a machine learning
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:03,935	| IOT166 |	Architecture
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:06,239	| IOT166 |	For the power arm chips
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:07,519	| IOT166 |	Too much snot
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:10,847	| IOT166 |	Sew-in putting nvdla
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:11,871	| IOT166 |	On the arm silica
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,663	| IOT166 |	What should I take away from that
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:15,455	| IOT166 |	At first like all of this small
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:17,247	| IOT166 |	Companies that are out there trying to develop
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,527	| IOT166 |	Really low power
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:19,295	| IOT166 |	Machinery
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:20,063	| IOT166 |	Green chips
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:23,391	| IOT166 |	Yeah one of the things that we recognize is that there is this
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,927	| IOT166 |	Need for artificial
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:26,463	| IOT166 |	Intelligence to solve problems
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:27,743	| IOT166 |	Xen devices
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,023	| IOT166 |	That Judson simply dozen
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:31,583	| IOT166 |	Now of course we've done lot of
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:32,351	| IOT166 |	Research and develop
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:39,263	| IOT166 |	Machine learning artificial intelligence Hardware here at Nvidia leverage. Hardware ourselves
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:41,055	| IOT166 |	But wouldn't it be great if
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:42,847	| IOT166 |	Companies can leverage that research
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,895	| IOT166 |	We've done to solve these problems
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,431	| IOT166 |	For which Nvidia does not bill
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:50,271	| IOT166 |	So that's what the nvdla is all about companies can
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:51,039	| IOT166 |	Can leverage cm
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:52,063	| IOT166 |	Nvdla it's been
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:54,879	| IOT166 |	Open source the RTL is available for download
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:59,743	| IOT166 |	People can find it on nvdla. Org and they can design it into their
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:00,767	| IOT166 |	Own
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:02,047	| IOT166 |	The partnership
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:04,863	| IOT166 |	Enables all of arms
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,399	| IOT166 |	And licensees
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:12,287	| IOT166 |	The Easley leverage the nvdla technology into their designs and so we expect in the
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,567	| IOT166 |	In the future you'll see
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:14,335	| IOT166 |	Many many
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,103	| IOT166 |	Products that are
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:15,871	| IOT166 |	Designed
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:16,639	| IOT166 |	Around
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:19,711	| IOT166 |	Architecture and incorporate the nvdla
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:23,039	| IOT166 |	Deep learning inference
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:24,319	| IOT166 |	Out to all of this
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:25,343	| IOT166 |	Tiny iot
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:26,111	| IOT166 |	Devices that are off
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:27,903	| IOT166 |	2 watt range
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:31,231	| IOT166 |	Historically in videos works with a fairly limited number
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:32,511	| IOT166 |	Partners
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:33,279	| IOT166 |	Because
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:35,071	| IOT166 |	There are only a few server makers out there
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,863	| IOT166 |	Are there only a few game console makers
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:41,983	| IOT166 |	So as you advance and start selling these boards how are you guys changing
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:45,311	| IOT166 |	Cheap because iot is vastly different than any other
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:46,847	| IOT166 |	Tech ecosystems
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:48,895	| IOT166 |	Yeah that's absolutely
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:52,735	| IOT166 |	Play cracked I think one of the things that we realized early on with Judson
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:53,503	| IOT166 |	Is that
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:54,783	| IOT166 |	Instead of having
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,319	| IOT166 |	We typically have had
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:59,135	| IOT166 |	In the past which is a small number of large customers
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:01,951	| IOT166 |	In json we have a very large number
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:03,231	| IOT166 |	Of relatively smaller
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:05,535	| IOT166 |	So rather than having
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:08,607	| IOT166 |	Tens or maybe a hundred large customers now we have thousands
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:13,727	| IOT166 |	Ten thousands of small Cuts person so just from a scale perspective it's not possible
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:15,007	| IOT166 |	More for us to engage Direct
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:17,055	| IOT166 |	Every one of those customers
EDL	00:49:17,055	00:49:22,687	| IOT166 |	We realize that in order for Jetson to be successful we had to make everything publicly-available we had to enable
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:26,783	| IOT166 |	Whether it's a start-up Warren oh yeah Morgan is garage
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:28,831	| IOT166 |	Need to enable them to go
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,367	| IOT166 |	From an idea all the way to
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:31,903	| IOT166 |	The final product without having
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:33,951	| IOT166 |	Ticket on the phone and track somebody down from
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:34,719	| IOT166 |	Nvidia
EDL	00:49:34,719	00:49:40,351	| IOT166 |	When is thinks we're seeing is now the chip vendors are really getting serious about providing
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:42,399	| IOT166 |	Security updates patching
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:45,727	| IOT166 |	For the life cycle of some of these embedded products
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:49,311	| IOT166 |	So we saw Qualcomm do a 7 and 10 year support for their Snapdragon Inn
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:52,127	| IOT166 |	Microsoft announced a 10-year support
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:53,919	| IOT166 |	With their projects Oprah's security
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:55,199	| IOT166 |	Dirty chips so
EDL	00:49:55,199	00:49:57,503	| IOT166 |	With these products the Jetson products
EDL	00:49:58,015	00:50:02,367	| IOT166 |	What kind of support are you guys offering today and then what are you kind of looking to do for the
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:05,951	| IOT166 |	The future sure we actually think about this into different kind of
EDL	00:50:05,951	00:50:06,719	| IOT166 |	Categories of
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:07,487	| IOT166 |	The products
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:08,255	| IOT166 |	We have
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:10,047	| IOT166 |	Products that are more commercial
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:15,167	| IOT166 |	In nature and for those products we support those for five years since the launch
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,215	| IOT166 |	And so by support that means
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:18,239	| IOT166 |	They're still available
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:19,007	| IOT166 |	Purchase
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:22,079	| IOT166 |	You also get software updates from Nvidia
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:24,639	| IOT166 |	Which in the beginning will focus on functional and four
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:25,919	| IOT166 |	Performance improvements
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:27,711	| IOT166 |	Chords to longer life with
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:32,831	| IOT166 |	The project will include security updates to make sure that any vulnerabilities are being patched
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:33,855	| IOT166 |	So five years for
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:36,159	| IOT166 |	Commercial now we realize that that's not enough
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,183	| IOT166 |	For some apps
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:41,279	| IOT166 |	Locations particularly in industrial use cases customers are demanding
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:42,303	| IOT166 |	10 year lifetime
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:47,167	| IOT166 |	And so for a version of our Jetson tk1
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:48,191	| IOT166 |	Base platform
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:49,215	| IOT166 |	And also for
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:50,751	| IOT166 |	A product we just announced called
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:53,055	| IOT166 |	The Jetson tx2 I we offered
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:53,823	| IOT166 |	10 years
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:54,335	| IOT166 |	Of support
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:57,663	| IOT166 |	Although this is saddening to me because I have
EDL	00:50:57,663	00:51:00,479	| IOT166 |	I see it's a one-and-a-half-year-old June oven
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:02,527	| IOT166 |	With an Invidia this is a Tegra processor
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:07,135	| IOT166 |	Oh my gosh I only have three and a half years left on my oven
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,415	| IOT166 |	Triple B's
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:08,927	| IOT166 |	Supported
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:13,023	| IOT166 |	Alright Jesse thank you so much for coming on the show today
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:14,047	| IOT166 |	Thank you very much for having
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:21,471	| IOT166 |	That's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like more iot
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:27,615	| IOT166 |	Sign up for my newsletter and Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next week
