EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:54,784	| IOT183 |	We're going to talk about all about how to manage a digital transformation
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:01:00,928	| IOT183 |	And speaking of SAS they are a sponsor of this week's podcast although I did pay my own way for the summer
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:04,512	| IOT183 |	So all of that and more awaits you
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,536	| IOT183 |	But first
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,584	| IOT183 |	Let's get a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:13,984	| IOT183 |	This week sponsor is aqua keep your iot Fleet growing and trade in the days of remoting into your car

EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:44,704	| IOT183 |	Okay Kevin last week
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:46,496	| IOT183 |	I was at the Amazon announcement
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:50,848	| IOT183 |	Which word actually 70 pieces of news released in about an hour and a half
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,896	| IOT183 |	Was like getting shot in the head with
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:55,200	| IOT183 |	It's about a hundred water balloons was very exciting
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:57,248	| IOT183 |	And we're going to cover all 70 in-depth today
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:05,184	| IOT183 |	What is with Amazon in their timing they know we do this podcast so certain day the weekend yet they had their event right
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:07,232	| IOT183 |	After we did our podcast
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:10,816	| IOT183 |	I know I can't believe they're not appreciating us
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:11,840	| IOT183 |	Subscribers list
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,680	| IOT183 |	It's on our calendars Amazon you can see it
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,496	| IOT183 |	School on them okay so
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,288	| IOT183 |	We've already written a couple things about it
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:27,968	| IOT183 |	So if you want to discover the 11:00 new Echo devices from clocks to microwaves
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,760	| IOT183 |	All kinds of crazy stuff
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,040	| IOT183 |	That's on the website
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,088	| IOT183 |	I also talked about the strategy
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,880	| IOT183 |	There's a couple things we didn't cover
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:40,768	| IOT183 |	In that news that we can talk about and there's actually a couple questions that you guys sent to us the first one
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:44,864	| IOT183 |	And will cover this at the very end so stay tuned for that but that is
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,656	| IOT183 |	Based on all of this news
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,984	| IOT183 |	Would we go to being a straight Google or straight Amazon
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,776	| IOT183 |	Does this mean that
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| IOT183 |	What should somebody
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,592	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,384	| IOT183 |	You got in mind as we talked about some
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,176	| IOT183 |	Pictures so
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,480	| IOT183 |	In addition to all of these devices
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| IOT183 |	Amazon
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,552	| IOT183 |	A really cool thing
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,368	| IOT183 |	Is basically now turned all of your echos
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,392	| IOT183 |	An echo Dot
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,440	| IOT183 |	Security alarm
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:13,792	| IOT183 |	Watch the service called guard and this is something
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:15,584	| IOT183 |	You can say is you're walking out of the house
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,400	| IOT183 |	And it will
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,936	| IOT183 |	All of your echos turn into
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:26,080	| IOT183 |	Glass break sensors so they're listening for the sound of glass breaking the sound
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,896	| IOT183 |	Smoke detectors or carbon monoxide alarms going
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,480	| IOT183 |	And if they hear these I'll actually send you a notice
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:32,992	| IOT183 |	Vacation
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:38,112	| IOT183 |	If it's monitored security you can actually send it to your monitored security system
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| IOT183 |	Intel
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,392	| IOT183 |	Do whatever they do
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,440	| IOT183 |	I thought this was really cool
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,000	| IOT183 |	Waste not just cool it's brilliant
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:50,400	| IOT183 |	Because it doesn't require people to buy any new hardware basically the microphones are all
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,424	| IOT183 |	Very very good in the
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,448	| IOT183 |	Echo products
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:55,520	| IOT183 |	And noticed repurposing them for a very useful service
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,824	| IOT183 |	Yeah and it's free so
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,944	| IOT183 |	Is that now in addition to your wake word
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,528	| IOT183 |	That you have selected Amazon is going to always be listening
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:09,088	| IOT183 |	For glass breaking and the sound of your smoke alarm
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:12,928	| IOT183 |	So in some ways they're using security as a way to
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,464	| IOT183 |	Encroach on privacy
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,536	| IOT183 |	Look at that way which some people will
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:20,351	| IOT183 |	I don't necessarily think so they're always listening anyway
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,655	| IOT183 |	Well yes but now you've got
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,703	| IOT183 |	A greater number of triggers that will
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,727	| IOT183 |	Trigger something happen
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,519	| IOT183 |	And take an action in store that
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,799	| IOT183 |	Snip it to the cloud
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,383	| IOT183 |	If that's fine they want to listen to the sound of breaking glass all day that's
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,199	| IOT183 |	I need the it is a valuable service
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,223	| IOT183 |	Your privacy
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,855	| IOT183 |	Skytran if you're discussing a murder
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| IOT183 |	Baby don't break glass
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| IOT183 |	They just in Corgi
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:50,303	| IOT183 |	Funny hangout let me add that to my rules of when I'm discussing these things
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,839	| IOT183 |	Tuck near broken flask
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,399	| IOT183 |	Got it or if you are in the midst of murdering
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,679	| IOT183 |	TriNet
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,775	| IOT183 |	Could you step away from the window for psych thank you okay
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,823	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,615	| IOT183 |	The other thing to think about here is
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,663	| IOT183 |	They're adding a lot of
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:08,479	| IOT183 |	Intelligence at the edge so now
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:12,575	| IOT183 |	I talked to their
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,367	| IOT183 |	When you're always listening this is happy
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,647	| IOT183 |	This doesn't get sent to the
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,719	| IOT183 |	Alright so now they've got three compressed model sitting at
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| IOT183 |	The edge
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,023	| IOT183 |	What's the Wake word one for class 1
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:24,863	| IOT183 |	Smoke detection you know if you're in the AI world or the edge processor
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| IOT183 |	That's kind of an interesting
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,959	| IOT183 |	And also
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,751	| IOT183 |	Also speaking of the edge
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,543	| IOT183 |	Amazon announced
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,823	| IOT183 |	Local support
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,359	| IOT183 |	4 commands at this event
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,895	| IOT183 |	Animalistic
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,967	| IOT183 |	Don't know when it is coming they said in a cup
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,015	| IOT183 |	Who knows
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,527	| IOT183 |	But
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:45,087	| IOT183 |	This is. This means if your
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| IOT183 |	Internet goes out
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:51,231	| IOT183 |	You could actually still say things like turn on the lights and the lights will go out
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:56,095	| IOT183 |	This was a huge reason I've actually done with Wink in the past
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,959	| IOT183 |	I don't want to see the first but they were among the first to have localized commands in a hub
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:03,007	| IOT183 |	So that was key for me
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:09,407	| IOT183 |	Not that we losing a lot
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:11,199	| IOT183 |	Take a trip over themselves if they had to use them
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,223	| IOT183 |	I'm pretty sure they
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,807	| IOT183 |	In the dark I don't know
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,367	| IOT183 |	I thought that was
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| IOT183 |	Really noteworthy
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| IOT183 |	I got two questions though
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,559	| IOT183 |	What about the guard service not a question why should I comment
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:30,655	| IOT183 |	Did I understand correctly you're also going to automate your smart lights when you're not at home
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,703	| IOT183 |	Yes they are so you
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:36,031	| IOT183 |	You can actually set that up so when you turn on guard it will automate
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| IOT183 |	Your smart lights
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,335	| IOT183 |	Which by the way is a fee
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,359	| IOT183 |	Feature that I had with
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,151	| IOT183 |	Nasty
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:43,967	| IOT183 |	15
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,503	| IOT183 |	But it didn't work super well
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:49,343	| IOT183 |	And I think wink also offers this feature as part of their hubs
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,135	| IOT183 |	An automation
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,183	| IOT183 |	Controls your lights when
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| IOT183 |	But
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,255	| IOT183 |	This is still super awesome.
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| IOT183 |	Because a lot of people don't have a
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,095	| IOT183 |	Exactly the other thing
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:06,495	| IOT183 |	You're talking about the machine learning models now they've got a couple of them now in these devices
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,799	| IOT183 |	And this is just a general question as
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,079	| IOT183 |	We seem more
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:13,663	| IOT183 |	AI machine learning push to Edge devices in the homes
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:14,943	| IOT183 |	Wilda
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:21,343	| IOT183 |	Current Hardware be able to keep up I mean I'm thinking about it from a memory standpoint from a CPU standpoint Sonora
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:25,439	| IOT183 |	As our devices get more complex through these algorithmic learning models
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,999	| IOT183 |	We actually need to upgrade in a couple years
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,535	| IOT183 |	I think we probably will
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,351	| IOT183 |	If I took one thing away from this event is
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,935	| IOT183 |	You know your four-year-old at those they actually are getting a lot of
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,775	| IOT183 |	The big difference right now is that
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,311	| IOT183 |	Speakers sound better in the
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:46,175	| IOT183 |	I'm wondering if maybe we'll get this product iteration and then we'll get
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,711	| IOT183 |	The next one is when
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:51,039	| IOT183 |	Can you swap so maybe we're looking at a smart speaker lifespan of me
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,319	| IOT183 |	It yours
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| IOT183 |	With enough
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,879	| IOT183 |	Overhead in memory for these
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| IOT183 |	Things I don't know
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:02,047	| IOT183 |	Considering the prices at the thing that's not crazy I would agree and also you won't have to upgrade you just maybe
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,839	| IOT183 |	Some of the newest features
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,959	| IOT183 |	What was really interesting is how they talked about
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,007	| IOT183 |	What they did on the AI back into shrink
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,031	| IOT183 |	These models
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,055	| IOT183 |	It's not
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,591	| IOT183 |	Worth diving into here
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,919	| IOT183 |	They have given a lot of thought
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,455	| IOT183 |	I'm trying to make sure every
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:23,039	| IOT183 |	Is close to the edge as possible so you get lots for Stuff
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,599	| IOT183 |	The other thing they have and we didn't talk about this
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,391	| IOT183 |	Is whisper mode
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,183	| IOT183 |	So I love it
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:33,023	| IOT183 |	If you whisper to your Echo
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,303	| IOT183 |	In the coming weeks
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,583	| IOT183 |	Eco Whisper back
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,703	| IOT183 |	Because you're whispering
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:46,847	| IOT183 |	I love love love this because I never said this on multiple servers I stay up late everybody to sleep
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:53,247	| IOT183 |	And when I leave my room my office I will tell one of my assistants shut the light and whoever assistant it is whichever is
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,527	| IOT183 |	It's really loud
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:55,807	| IOT183 |	Super
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,903	| IOT183 |	Google has actually something similar with the Google home
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| IOT183 |	You have
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| IOT183 |	You can turn it on
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,487	| IOT183 |	In the Google home app
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,279	| IOT183 |	Under devices
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,559	| IOT183 |	You can do a setting called night mode
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| IOT183 |	And then
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,399	| IOT183 |	You choose it from one time to another time
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,703	| IOT183 |	And when you have that
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,775	| IOT183 |	Mute notifications in any boot up sound switch
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| IOT183 |	I don't know if the powers ever gone out
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,847	| IOT183 |	Overnight with your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,639	| IOT183 |	She comes and she's like
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,663	| IOT183 |	Hello
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,479	| IOT183 |	Searching for Wi-Fi at everyone said what what just happened
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,295	| IOT183 |	Burglar in the house searching for Wi-Fi
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,063	| IOT183 |	Exactly
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,111	| IOT183 |	So it didn't your LED lights
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT183 |	And it
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,279	| IOT183 |	So those are all really nice things
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:41,119	| IOT183 |	This is a little more intuitive because it just automatically does it when
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,935	| IOT183 |	Can you whisper as opposed to having to set a setting
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,495	| IOT183 |	But just so you know if you're in the Google verse
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,263	| IOT183 |	This is still
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:47,775	| IOT183 |	Something that you
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:50,847	| IOT183 |	That was
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,663	| IOT183 |	The Amazon stock
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,455	| IOT183 |	Was so exciting because they
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,503	| IOT183 |	Came out with not just a bunch of devices
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,807	| IOT183 |	But actually an entire way of
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| IOT183 |	Thinking about the Smart Home
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:04,415	| IOT183 |	Ecosystem that gets us closer to this contextual
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:07,231	| IOT183 |	Easy world that Kevin and I think we should already be in
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,023	| IOT183 |	So they announced
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,327	| IOT183 |	Some things to make it easier to set up Wi-Fi
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,887	| IOT183 |	They talked about creating
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,167	| IOT183 |	Module called
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| IOT183 |	Mute your Echoes for this
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| IOT183 |	The Alexa
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,543	| IOT183 |	Connecticut which is a development
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,103	| IOT183 |	Ford
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,431	| IOT183 |	Bluetooth and WiFi module
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,759	| IOT183 |	That connects to Amazon
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,039	| IOT183 |	What's interesting there
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,319	| IOT183 |	Is that you
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,599	| IOT183 |	You can actually buy that
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,879	| IOT183 |	Ian
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,927	| IOT183 |	Your cost will be covered
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,975	| IOT183 |	Without initial fee for that module
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,511	| IOT183 |	I just made all your clothes
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,839	| IOT183 |	A bird like you're going to send it video that's probably not going to
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:51,007	| IOT183 |	Before a lot of like sensors or one-off devices this is a great thing cuz you no longer have to worry about
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,311	| IOT183 |	He's crazy cost every single year with the
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| IOT183 |	Set device
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,359	| IOT183 |	It solves a lot of the business
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:00,991	| IOT183 |	Problems and what that's going to like even more if you can imagine
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,295	| IOT183 |	More matinee devices
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,063	| IOT183 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,343	| IOT183 |	So this is great
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,415	| IOT183 |	The Amazon ecosystem
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,463	| IOT183 |	Devices
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,279	| IOT183 |	Especially since their support for sensors
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,071	| IOT183 |	So they're really pushing
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,839	| IOT183 |	Forward with
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:19,679	| IOT183 |	A vision for the smart home and I said this before and I'll say it again that really rivals
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| IOT183 |	Apple did with the smart
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:24,287	| IOT183 |	I just came out of this feeling like God
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,311	| IOT183 |	Apple
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:30,175	| IOT183 |	What are you doing man this is the sort of thing that you guys used to be so good at
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| IOT183 |	In
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,247	| IOT183 |	Amazon's really doing so
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:40,671	| IOT183 |	It gets back to something you said a show or two ago that pretty much they're setting the standard and I just mean the standard for
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,719	| IOT183 |	The products but standards
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,255	| IOT183 |	For how these products work
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:45,791	| IOT183 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,071	| IOT183 |	And it's going to be awesome
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,839	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,375	| IOT183 |	Knowing all of this
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:54,495	| IOT183 |	More devices cheaper devices Whimsical devices like $60 microwave for $30
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,823	| IOT183 |	Would I
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| IOT183 |	Invest still
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,639	| IOT183 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,407	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,431	| IOT183 |	That was the question
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:02,943	| IOT183 |	That someone
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,503	| IOT183 |	Is it good question
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,575	| IOT183 |	I am all in on the Google ecosystem for my
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,111	| IOT183 |	Web services soap
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| IOT183 |	Email and all that even
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:11,647	| IOT183 |	You know sometimes it's
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,671	| IOT183 |	Came to get my
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| IOT183 |	Google Apps account
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| IOT183 |	To do anything with me
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:19,071	| IOT183 |	I think I'm going to connect all of my devices
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| IOT183 |	Tomato mayonnaise
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,607	| IOT183 |	For the time being
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,911	| IOT183 |	I'd Focus there for the smart
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,703	| IOT183 |	Hamster but I probably key
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,519	| IOT183 |	Cheap T I have the Lenovo smart display finally
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,823	| IOT183 |	I would keep one of those in my house
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,359	| IOT183 |	As a way to Lake
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,895	| IOT183 |	Interact with my
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,175	| IOT183 |	I guess my professional Inc
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,943	| IOT183 |	Computer-based life
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| IOT183 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| IOT183 |	And just have Amazon
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,783	| IOT183 |	Show me my smart home base life
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,623	| IOT183 |	That makes sense that makes sense 710 G7
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,183	| IOT183 |	Siri in my life 503
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,951	| IOT183 |	And it's
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:50,559	| IOT183 |	It's confusing as all get-out to be talking at three different things in the same room for one thing but it's
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,607	| IOT183 |	This is what we do and there's a reason we do it
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,423	| IOT183 |	I don't think I would commit to any one of them just because of what I
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,263	| IOT183 |	Here with you and so on but if I had to
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,567	| IOT183 |	I'm probably would be leaning to go back
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| IOT183 |	To Madame a
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,919	| IOT183 |	Because I just
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:09,247	| IOT183 |	The Integrations are into so many more types of products
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,551	| IOT183 |	Yeso
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| IOT183 |	Speaking of Integrations this is a big one
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| IOT183 |	The smart
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,927	| IOT183 |	Home skills API
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,743	| IOT183 |	They update
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:23,071	| IOT183 |	Play the updated in a way that makes me feel like they are coming after
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:23,839	| IOT183 |	Device
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,375	| IOT183 |	Data schema
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,911	| IOT183 |	We talked about a lot of show
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,191	| IOT183 |	And that's basically
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,519	| IOT183 |	A universal way for device to say hey this is what I am
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,031	| IOT183 |	This is what I meant
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,871	| IOT183 |	Right now we don't have that we have company
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,175	| IOT183 |	Ocf
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,711	| IOT183 |	Create standards around this
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,783	| IOT183 |	And what we have with Amazon is this smart home skills API
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,575	| IOT183 |	Set allows for
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| IOT183 |	Three different settings
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,671	| IOT183 |	So it has a toggle setting that turns things on or off
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:54,303	| IOT183 |	Has a range of options that let you set a range that could be a temperature it could be
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,095	| IOT183 |	Oven thermostat temperature
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,631	| IOT183 |	Sound
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,143	| IOT183 |	Sound
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,703	| IOT183 |	It has a range
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:04,287	| IOT183 |	It has a mode option that lets a device maker program a
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| IOT183 |	Text function
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,847	| IOT183 |	So this is where you're going to get like in an oven
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,383	| IOT183 |	Is a baker is it real
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| IOT183 |	In a washing machine
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,967	| IOT183 |	Permanent press
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| IOT183 |	Cotton
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,247	| IOT183 |	Owls
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,039	| IOT183 |	Those kind of specific
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,063	| IOT183 |	And
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,879	| IOT183 |	That actually covers quite a wide range
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,927	| IOT183 |	Things that devices can do
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,535	| IOT183 |	And it's going to be really powerful for developers to have this be
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,303	| IOT183 |	Because
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| IOT183 |	Then you can
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,863	| IOT183 |	Basic reading skill
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,399	| IOT183 |	Easily
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:33,471	| IOT183 |	And then they also talked about
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,007	| IOT183 |	Natural invocation
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,799	| IOT183 |	And this is very powerful
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,823	| IOT183 |	As well
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,407	| IOT183 |	This is where you're going to be able to ask Madame just do some
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,687	| IOT183 |	Turn on the vacuum
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,735	| IOT183 |	And it's going to understand what the back
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,015	| IOT183 |	Team is based on patterns of
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,039	| IOT183 |	Usage that it seemed
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,063	| IOT183 |	Mystify senior
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:52,927	| IOT183 |	So this is some of this where it's always going to be learning based on your information
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,975	| IOT183 |	Formation that's happening in your specific home
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,279	| IOT183 |	And it's going to be tied back to that hoe
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,607	| IOT183 |	It's smart contacts its Blossom once we get there
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,399	| IOT183 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,191	| IOT183 |	Very exciting stuff
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,959	| IOT183 |	And now
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,495	| IOT183 |	We talked a lot about it
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| IOT183 |	How to cut a donut hole show on
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,591	| IOT183 |	Zip through to another seattle-based company
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| IOT183 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,663	| IOT183 |	Because they
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,199	| IOT183 |	Are doing their big event
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| IOT183 |	This week Microsoft
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:21,343	| IOT183 |	And they have shown off actually things for Cortana that make it seem like
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,903	| IOT183 |	It's just like Amazon's doing the Smart Home
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,415	| IOT183 |	Cortana
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:29,279	| IOT183 |	And then a lot of industrial support for things like digital twin
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,887	| IOT183 |	Let's talk about how Microsoft is
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,655	| IOT183 |	Making Cortana
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,703	| IOT183 |	I don't know
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:45,663	| IOT183 |	Turn up from a Halo from Halo perspective which is where they got the name Cortana school but other than that I'm not really
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,943	| IOT183 |	Jazz
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:50,783	| IOT183 |	But then again I don't work in an Enterprise anymore if I still did
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:55,647	| IOT183 |	Sure I'd be super psyched over this you know show me our sales figures for last month or even
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:16:02,047	| IOT183 |	You know what's the trend of help desk calls over the last six months and Y or whatever what's the big mean root cause
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:05,631	| IOT183 |	It's just another user interface didn't get it Analytics
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:09,471	| IOT183 |	Yes and it's called Cortana skills for Enterprise
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,031	| IOT183 |	And this is the first major update to
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,079	| IOT183 |	Improve the way Cortana works
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,847	| IOT183 |	Web Developers
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,383	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,663	| IOT183 |	Really exciting
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:18,687	| IOT183 |	And
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,479	| IOT183 |	We'll see how this
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:22,015	| IOT183 |	Works out
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:27,135	| IOT183 |	Is a proof-of-concept Microsoft did an IT Help Desk kill for Cortana to help people file tickets
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,159	| IOT183 |	Which
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,207	| IOT183 |	Back in the day when I was in a large cup
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,511	| IOT183 |	Pain in the butt so
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,023	| IOT183 |	Jay
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:35,071	| IOT183 |	Is it also this will tie into
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,863	| IOT183 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,143	| IOT183 |	But they should have to build
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,471	| IOT183 |	Earlier this year where they had like the super intelligent
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,007	| IOT183 |	Cortana powered conference room
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,823	| IOT183 |	Maps physical spaces
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,359	| IOT183 |	Recognize people
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,895	| IOT183 |	Tok notes for you
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,407	| IOT183 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| IOT183 |	Microsoft at
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:53,247	| IOT183 |	Ignite did talk about
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,527	| IOT183 |	Rodney gets aif
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| IOT183 |	They also
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:59,135	| IOT183 |	On the industrial iot side
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,439	| IOT183 |	Agri services
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:01,951	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,791	| IOT183 |	Azure data box
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,071	| IOT183 |	Set of products
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,095	| IOT183 |	That's going to
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,119	| IOT183 |	Enable
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,655	| IOT183 |	Russian restaurant
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,191	| IOT183 |	Brunetti's which is an orchestration
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:14,239	| IOT183 |	Orchestrate
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,543	| IOT183 |	Services that run at the edge
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| IOT183 |	And the cloud
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,847	| IOT183 |	So they're going to
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,615	| IOT183 |	Bring two birdies
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,943	| IOT183 |	As well
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,223	| IOT183 |	They're going to
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,991	| IOT183 |	Update
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,271	| IOT183 |	Windows server
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:29,343	| IOT183 |	And it's going to support some Azure services this is a big
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,159	| IOT183 |	There are some
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:34,975	| IOT183 |	Devices out there running Windows server
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,255	| IOT183 |	Need to be able to talk
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:42,399	| IOT183 |	Computing model with gateways and sensors and
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,423	| IOT183 |	Clouds at all
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,703	| IOT183 |	Talk to each other
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| IOT183 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,287	| IOT183 |	Is adding
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,079	| IOT183 |	Digital twins
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:57,503	| IOT183 |	One of the brand new cloud services that Microsoft is going
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,271	| IOT183 |	Offer
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,575	| IOT183 |	On Asher in this is a big deal
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,343	| IOT183 |	Because
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,879	| IOT183 |	The industrial world
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,647	| IOT183 |	Love's
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,159	| IOT183 |	Some digital
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,975	| IOT183 |	ABC has been one of the big
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,999	| IOT183 |	Companies pushing this
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,279	| IOT183 |	Concept but basically
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,839	| IOT183 |	It's a virtual version of any machine
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,679	| IOT183 |	Run it
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,215	| IOT183 |	Sensor data from the physical
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,727	| IOT183 |	Device
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:24,639	| IOT183 |	You run it against your virtual version of that device and you can use it for predictive maintenance to understand things
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,919	| IOT183 |	Things that are going wrong
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:29,247	| IOT183 |	It's both a big validation at PTC
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,271	| IOT183 |	Which has been touting this
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,295	| IOT183 |	Yours
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:35,903	| IOT183 |	And also a necessary component for a lot of Microsoft azure
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,927	| IOT183 |	Industrial
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:42,815	| IOT183 |	And you can even use this as like make a digital copy of your workspace maybe fit a large office or
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:46,143	| IOT183 |	Datacenter whatever might be created digital version of it
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,703	| IOT183 |	Duplicated essentially and again
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:55,103	| IOT183 |	Titan sensor data you could have just things maybe when I just temperatures and see if that affects traffic patterns or
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,895	| IOT183 |	Machinery whatever my paper
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,199	| IOT183 |	Cons of opportunity sir this is a really cool stuff
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,015	| IOT183 |	It is and I actually like the fact that Microsoft is
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,319	| IOT183 |	It's aiming this more at the
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:10,207	| IOT183 |	Do you say says it's showing off Hair Design War for Enterprise office space which I thought was interesting
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,743	| IOT183 |	Because PTC is all about like
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:16,607	| IOT183 |	I will borrow your steam trap or your flow meter or is all these crazy
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,167	| IOT183 |	Crazy devices that are very
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,959	| IOT183 |	Where is Microsoft
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,263	| IOT183 |	Hey what's create a virtual version of your office
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:23,775	| IOT183 |	See what you can do
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:30,687	| IOT183 |	Can I see why they did that to be honest right at first hand I cannot tell you how much time I would waste
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:37,087	| IOT183 |	This was a Google anywhere city which was a city block in 15 stories going USA conference room
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,159	| IOT183 |	Wasn't supposed to be occupied but still
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,927	| IOT183 |	Or
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT183 |	Decided to go to the
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:44,767	| IOT183 |	11th floor cafeteria for burritos
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:47,071	| IOT183 |	When the line on the fourth floor was like
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:53,471	| IOT183 |	Nothing it was nobody there right now so I can go up to 11 tonight
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:57,823	| IOT183 |	Waste for your resources on so many environmental things
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,687	| IOT183 |	So this is really exciting and we are going to find out
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:06,783	| IOT183 |	More maybe we'll get something from Microsoft to come on the show to talk about what this makes pasta
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:07,807	| IOT183 |	Because
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,647	| IOT183 |	Okay it's like I'm from Boston all of a sudden
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,183	| IOT183 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:14,975	| IOT183 |	Some quickness bit Sunday
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,535	| IOT183 |	Whiting's
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:23,935	| IOT183 |	Switch
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,983	| IOT183 |	They came out with their newest
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:29,823	| IOT183 |	Hybrid Smartwatch I called a hybrid because it looks like a traditional watch
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,103	| IOT183 |	Perry mechanical
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| IOT183 |	Looking
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:38,527	| IOT183 |	Regular watch but has a small OLED display in it for your heart rate because there's a heart rate sensor in there you can check
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,855	| IOT183 |	Are sleep patterns in their through a Connected app
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,903	| IOT183 |	It will track your workouts
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,439	| IOT183 |	Just got sensors for all that
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:50,815	| IOT183 |	GPS you have to have it connected GPS you have to have a phone with you if you going to go running with this thing but
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:54,655	| IOT183 |	Some people still do that that's fine two hundred bucks killer battery life
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:21:01,055	| IOT183 |	Because it's a very small OLED display like a circular display that just had a limited amount of space in art
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:04,895	| IOT183 |	Backlight on
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,711	| IOT183 |	25 day battery life which is amazing
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,991	| IOT183 |	$200
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:13,855	| IOT183 |	It's not for me because I want a GPS in a heart rate and everything standalone
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,672	| IOT183 |	Which is why I wear an Apple watch
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:20,000	| IOT183 |	Tonight full fledge Smartwatch not take calls on it
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:23,840	| IOT183 |	But for a large number of people this is a perfect
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:26,912	| IOT183 |	Hybrid device it gives you what you want without
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:33,312	| IOT183 |	Too many constraints such as you know charging every day and so on or looking like a smartwatch so I like it if you get enough for me
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,336	| IOT183 |	I like what why things is doing
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,616	| IOT183 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:39,200	| IOT183 |	And I like that you're like it's not full-featured I mean you can't make phone calls on
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,016	| IOT183 |	This is not a feature that I have demanded
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:47,136	| IOT183 |	I was messing with my walkie-talkie feature yesterday on the Apple watch with my daughter so I'm into that stuff
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:47,904	| IOT183 |	No III
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:50,976	| IOT183 |	If I wanted
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:54,304	| IOT183 |	The stuff they showed off at the Apple event a couple weeks back with fall detection
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,864	| IOT183 |	Play something that I've been trying to
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,888	| IOT183 |	Program into my life
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,424	| IOT183 |	Forever
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:21:59,936	| IOT183 |	Using

EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,776	| IOT183 |	East recipes
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:07,616	| IOT183 |	It pull it all into one and I was very excited but not excited enough to go buy an iPhone
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,712	| IOT183 |	So I understand
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,224	| IOT183 |	Please
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,760	| IOT183 |	Please rest of the world
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,808	| IOT183 |	Get on that okay
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,088	| IOT183 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,160	| IOT183 |	Okay last year
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,952	| IOT183 |	Was purchased by Assa abloy
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,024	| IOT183 |	Maker of
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,584	| IOT183 |	Now it's Yale locks
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,400	| IOT183 |	A credit to work with your August
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,680	| IOT183 |	App
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,984	| IOT183 |	So the August lock is not
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,752	| IOT183 |	Deadbolt
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| IOT183 |	Replacement
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,288	| IOT183 |	It is
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,312	| IOT183 |	Replace it over
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,592	| IOT183 |	And this is
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:41,408	| IOT183 |	This is great for some people they like it it's less
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,200	| IOT183 |	Install
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,712	| IOT183 |	But
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,040	| IOT183 |	If you're one of those people who feel like way more secure with
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,344	| IOT183 |	Replacement
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,624	| IOT183 |	But you like the August app
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,160	| IOT183 |	Because it works with
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,696	| IOT183 |	Martinson is kind of interesting
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,232	| IOT183 |	You could actually
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,328	| IOT183 |	This feels kind of niche
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,376	| IOT183 |	There's like a homekit module
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,656	| IOT183 |	You could update your
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,680	| IOT183 |	Yale lock
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:06,240	| IOT183 |	Homekit module that you plug into
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,288	| IOT183 |	With that battery case
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,640	| IOT183 |	And it's going to work
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:13,920	| IOT183 |	With the August app and
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:17,504	| IOT183 |	That's kind of nice for a certain segment of the body
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,272	| IOT183 |	Chelation
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,552	| IOT183 |	No doubt about it I mean
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:25,696	| IOT183 |	Kathy August features like door sensor don't know if the door is locked or unlocked if it's open or closed you know it's
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,000	| IOT183 |	You know dog has to make sense
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:28,768	| IOT183 |	This
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:34,656	| IOT183 |	Also desert Choir in very small Wi-Fi Bridge just to get the information from the lock to your network
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,680	| IOT183 |	It's not a
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,984	| IOT183 |	Like a big box of a bridge is more of a gesture
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,032	| IOT183 |	It sits on your outlet somewhere nearby
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:45,152	| IOT183 |	That exists now for those of you guys who are interested in that
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,176	| IOT183 |	Speaking of homekit
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,968	| IOT183 |	There is a new rachio sprinkler
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,760	| IOT183 |	It is getting homekit support
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,528	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:53,600	| IOT183 |	Yay yashow this is
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,136	| IOT183 |	Free if you have the one or two
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,904	| IOT183 |	You're not going to get it
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:24:00,512	| IOT183 |	You can tell Stacy doesn't use an iPhone
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:08,448	| IOT183 |	Population says I'm going home kit for good reason and that's fine
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:11,008	| IOT183 |	So this is good news
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,800	| IOT183 |	If you're that population
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:13,568	| IOT183 |	Here's a
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,592	| IOT183 |	Rachio which is
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:20,480	| IOT183 |	They're Gen 2 I tested their Gen 2 sprinkler and bought it actually for my father-in-law
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,504	| IOT183 |	And it's great he loves it
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,040	| IOT183 |	It's helped him quite a bit
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:23,808	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,600	| IOT183 |	Now you can ask Siri
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,112	| IOT183 |	Hey
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,392	| IOT183 |	Turn on my sprinklers
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,696	| IOT183 |	Or stop watering the vegetable garden
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,792	| IOT183 |	And this is $230 the Retro 3s
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,328	| IOT183 |	Expensive newer model
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:41,216	| IOT183 |	Okay this is just an update because I had written about this and talked about
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:43,008	| IOT183 |	Twitter
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,544	| IOT183 |	So I have these brilliant
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,312	| IOT183 |	Light switches
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,336	| IOT183 |	I just had someone
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,128	| IOT183 |	Come out and
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,432	| IOT183 |	Replace them for me cuz I had a pre-production unit.
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,968	| IOT183 |	They felt was not
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:52,992	| IOT183 |	Behaving as well
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:56,576	| IOT183 |	So we're going back to the drawing board
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,392	| IOT183 |	Mini the things about
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,672	| IOT183 |	I stand by
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:02,976	| IOT183 |	And they would happen regardless of the hardware it's just the
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,024	| IOT183 |	The criminal light into this thing
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| IOT183 |	I'm going to try that out again
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:10,912	| IOT183 |	And hopefully it will be a better experience
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,960	| IOT183 |	So stay tuned for that probably in another
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,752	| IOT183 |	And now
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:16,288	| IOT183 |	Let us go to a

EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,848	| IOT183 |	Show this week's voicemail is from
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,360	| IOT183 |	Brent
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,224	| IOT183 |	Hello this is Brent mehr I'm calling from Utah
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,248	| IOT183 |	I have
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,784	| IOT183 |	A problem with my
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,552	| IOT183 |	Freezer have I
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,832	| IOT183 |	Stand up
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,600	| IOT183 |	Vertical
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,880	| IOT183 |	Freezer that
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,904	| IOT183 |	Kids
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,696	| IOT183 |	Well sometimes leave open
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,744	| IOT183 |	Circus last 10 years I've lost
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| IOT183 |	The contents of it
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:15,424	| IOT183 |	Three times and we've tried locks but sometimes they get in the way I'd really love something that would alert
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,192	| IOT183 |	Me when
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,728	| IOT183 |	The
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:20,800	| IOT183 |	Freezer is left open or even perhaps if
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,592	| IOT183 |	Temperature changes within the freezer
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| IOT183 |	Thanks
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,640	| IOT183 |	Okay Brent
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,176	| IOT183 |	This is one of those
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:29,760	| IOT183 |	This is so easy I can't believe we have to answer question about this
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:33,344	| IOT183 |	Start at the gate
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,368	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,136	| IOT183 |	Kevin
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,904	| IOT183 |	You get started
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,416	| IOT183 |	With your solution
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,208	| IOT183 |	All right book
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:43,328	| IOT183 |	Probably the least expensive solution I can think of is to buy a
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:47,680	| IOT183 |	Door / window sensor Brands because their battery powered there
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,704	| IOT183 |	Inexpensive
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:50,752	| IOT183 |	One part goes on the
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:54,848	| IOT183 |	Frame of the freezer and one goes on the door and basically when the doors open
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:27:01,760	| IOT183 |	The center says hey I'm open and you can be notified that the doors open however you don't want to know exactly
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,528	| IOT183 |	Open
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,320	| IOT183 |	Left open
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,624	| IOT183 |	So in order to do that
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,904	| IOT183 |	It's a little more expensive
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,672	| IOT183 |	Traps
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:11,744	| IOT183 |	What we don't know is if you have a smart home hub
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,560	| IOT183 |	You can easily set
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:20,448	| IOT183 |	I will alert that says have the sensors been part or the door's been open for more than say 2 or 3 minutes
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,472	| IOT183 |	Send me a notification
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,056	| IOT183 |	So we don't know if you have a hub if you do is pretty easy
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:27,104	| IOT183 |	If you don't I don't
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:30,432	| IOT183 |	You know that this is going to work because you're only get me notified that the door open
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,224	| IOT183 |	What clothes you're not going to know
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:36,576	| IOT183 |	If it left open unless you physically go back and check after you were notified it was open
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,856	| IOT183 |	Yes
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,904	| IOT183 |	Okay so that was one option
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,696	| IOT183 |	And I have some other options
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:42,976	| IOT183 |	None of them are
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,536	| IOT183 |	But we found lots of
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,304	| IOT183 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,096	| IOT183 |	Sensors that measure
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,144	| IOT183 |	Temperature and a lot of them have
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:53,472	| IOT183 |	Why are based temperature probe so what you would do is you take
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,496	| IOT183 |	The temperature probe
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,032	| IOT183 |	Plug it into the sensor
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,592	| IOT183 |	You stick the temperature probe inside
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,104	| IOT183 |	The freezer
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,384	| IOT183 |	Can you leave
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,152	| IOT183 |	Temperature
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,432	| IOT183 |	Nothing on the outside
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:08,832	| IOT183 |	Because you eat the freezer is kind of like it's going to block all signals so he part of this the part with the radio has to be outside
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,344	| IOT183 |	The freezer
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,368	| IOT183 |	Is a giant ferret
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,928	| IOT183 |	How do I have left open
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,464	| IOT183 |	Signal
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,232	| IOT183 |	Then you know
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,792	| IOT183 |	Temperature
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:20,352	| IOT183 |	This is a $40
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,144	| IOT183 |	Inkbird smart sensor
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,912	| IOT183 |	This is $40
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:23,936	| IOT183 |	And
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| IOT183 |	Use case
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,848	| IOT183 |	The exception of this is blue toothpaste so you have to be within
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,360	| IOT183 |	1040
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:32,896	| IOT183 |	Feet are so
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| IOT183 |	So I don't
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,968	| IOT183 |	Love it for this because it's not going to
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,760	| IOT183 |	It can send you alerts
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,296	| IOT183 |	But it's only going to send you alerts when
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:39,808	| IOT183 |	When you walk with him
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:47,232	| IOT183 |	You're not going to be able to remotely be away from home and know that the door has been left open for example either
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,512	| IOT183 |	Let you sit pretty
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,072	| IOT183 |	Why is sampling intervals so Lake
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,864	| IOT183 |	Between 10 seconds
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:57,216	| IOT183 |	I would say for your freezer a 10 minute intervals probably good and will save
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,240	| IOT183 |	Battery life
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,520	| IOT183 |	So that's just
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,800	| IOT183 |	Book If you're looking for sampling
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,408	| IOT183 |	And so that's one option
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,688	| IOT183 |	We did find
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:07,968	| IOT183 |	And
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,248	| IOT183 |	We don't love this for another reason
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:13,088	| IOT183 |	We found it lacrosse Mobile Wireless monitoring system
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:16,416	| IOT183 |	This one comes with a dry probe that should work just 4 in
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,184	| IOT183 |	Inside your freezer
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:20,256	| IOT183 |	It has its own little Gateway this is a $30 device
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,560	| IOT183 |	Gateway gives you the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,352	| IOT183 |	Please and that you need to plug in
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:25,632	| IOT183 |	But
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:30,496	| IOT183 |	To get data to your phone after the first 3 months is going to cost you
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,776	| IOT183 |	99 Cent Store
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,848	| IOT183 |	So that's a subscription fee associated with this
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| IOT183 |	Device that space
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| IOT183 |	12 bucks
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:41,504	| IOT183 |	Which is a lot cheaper than hundreds of dollars of frozen food defrosted
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,272	| IOT183 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,040	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:49,440	| IOT183 |	That is an option I have had lacrosse sensors in the past they tended to work for me for about 2 years before dying
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,720	| IOT183 |	So keep that in mind
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,744	| IOT183 |	This is
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,768	| IOT183 |	Particular
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,304	| IOT183 |	Is only 30 bucks
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,888	| IOT183 |	And then we found
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:01,216	| IOT183 |	The temp stick wireless temperature sensor
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,520	| IOT183 |	$449
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,336	| IOT183 |	Which is pricey as heck
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,616	| IOT183 |	But it's Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,640	| IOT183 |	Connect to a gateway
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,152	| IOT183 |	You're going to have to be
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,688	| IOT183 |	Changing the batteries on
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:11,968	| IOT183 |	Quite a bit
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,760	| IOT183 |	But this gives you everything all in
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:20,928	| IOT183 |	So you can be anywhere at the notified for example the freezer is open so
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,952	| IOT183 |	Option fee on that one right
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,792	| IOT183 |	But it's a big upfront cost
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| IOT183 |	More than this
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,120	| IOT183 |	$30 +
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,632	| IOT183 |	$12
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:38,848	| IOT183 |	I think it's worth pointing out also that when we went down a big rabbit hole looking for all kinds of different solutions here
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:41,408	| IOT183 |	I noticed that a lot of the
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,688	| IOT183 |	Manufacturers of
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:49,088	| IOT183 |	Fridges and freezers are now starting to include sensors for this type of thing such a Samsung NGE for example
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,880	| IOT183 |	So they're in the future
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:56,000	| IOT183 |	When you do replace the freezer cuz he said it was 10 years old Can I some point it's going to have to get replaced
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:59,072	| IOT183 |	I would consider looking at one that has a sensor built-in
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,352	| IOT183 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:00,864	| IOT183 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,144	| IOT183 |	What's the magic
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:03,936	| IOT183 |	All right
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,728	| IOT183 |	So hopefully bread
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,752	| IOT183 |	This helps you
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| IOT183 |	Otherwise
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,288	| IOT183 |	I think you should get rid
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:14,944	| IOT183 |	We don't really know how did they get past the locks
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| IOT183 |	All right
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,272	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:20,320	| IOT183 |	That is a lot we discussed this week
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,344	| IOT183 |	We hope you guys
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:22,880	| IOT183 |	Enjoy this segment of the show
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:23,392	| IOT183 |	Please stay tuned
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,952	| IOT183 |	A conversation with
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,976	| IOT183 |	Rayford Smith
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:27,744	| IOT183 |	Who is with Entergy
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:31,328	| IOT183 |	A utility that serves 3 million customers as he explains
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,864	| IOT183 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:33,888	| IOT183 |	How they're bringing
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,168	| IOT183 |	That company
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,216	| IOT183 |	2 current digital standard
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:39,264	| IOT183 |	It's a pretty involved process in
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:46,176	| IOT183 |	I think it's an interesting interview so stay tuned for that and for a message from our sponsor hey everyone.
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:52,576	| IOT183 |	Taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is SAS
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:57,184	| IOT183 |	And I have json man who is the VP of iot at SAS
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:57,952	| IOT183 |	Here to talk to us
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:00,512	| IOT183 |	We talked about SAS at the edge
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:02,048	| IOT183 |	A new iot division
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,328	| IOT183 |	And his partner ecosystem
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,632	| IOT183 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| IOT183 |	Hey I and II.
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,704	| IOT183 |	So which comes first
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,984	| IOT183 |	Iot data
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:11,264	| IOT183 |	Rai
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,544	| IOT183 |	That's a good question
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:14,080	| IOT183 |	You seen a lot of ink
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,872	| IOT183 |	Towards both topics
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,152	| IOT183 |	Am I singing though it's
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,920	| IOT183 |	Iot data
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:20,224	| IOT183 |	Certainly a I in
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,016	| IOT183 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,296	| IOT183 |	Analytic evaluation
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,064	| IOT183 |	Associated
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,112	| IOT183 |	With that is critical but the fact is
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:26,880	| IOT183 |	AI
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,648	| IOT183 |	Routines Alberta
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,928	| IOT183 |	R train
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:29,696	| IOT183 |	Against data
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,464	| IOT183 |	Anorexic cute
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,024	| IOT183 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:36,096	| IOT183 |	Okidata is required it comes first before you can achieve value
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,632	| IOT183 |	Applied artificial
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:41,216	| IOT183 |	How does AI in iot
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:41,728	| IOT183 |	Work together
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,288	| IOT183 |	AI is certainly a path
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,312	| IOT183 |	To incite
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,336	| IOT183 |	Passive value
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,640	| IOT183 |	Decisioning iot infrastructure
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,664	| IOT183 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,432	| IOT183 |	Provides
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,712	| IOT183 |	The foundational element
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,480	| IOT183 |	4X
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,760	| IOT183 |	Execution of Iowa
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,272	| IOT183 |	Key principles
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,296	| IOT183 |	What you think about
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:56,832	| IOT183 |	To first question
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,368	| IOT183 |	The data is critical
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:02,208	| IOT183 |	But also as you look to the distributed environment in many cases
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:03,488	| IOT183 |	Just pushing to the edge
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:06,816	| IOT183 |	The models may be trained in a persistent environment AI models
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,096	| IOT183 |	In there but the execution
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,632	| IOT183 |	The volume
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,656	| IOT183 |	This generator from EX
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:11,168	| IOT183 |	Execution
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:12,960	| IOT183 |	Scoring of the models
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:15,776	| IOT183 |	Self can only be achieved when you have that infrastructure
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,312	| IOT183 |	Ford appointment
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,848	| IOT183 |	We talked about reduce latency
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,128	| IOT183 |	Can be a primary driver
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:24,224	| IOT183 |	Latency is reduced by pushing his decision and closer to the source
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:26,016	| IOT183 |	Updated so you can have the best
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,296	| IOT183 |	AI model in the world
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,320	| IOT183 |	But if you don't have the
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,600	| IOT183 |	The ability to apply at
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,368	| IOT183 |	At the right time
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,136	| IOT183 |	Right place
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:31,904	| IOT183 |	The value
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,416	| IOT183 |	Is quickly
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:36,512	| IOT183 |	Power companies applying AI to their iot data today
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,816	| IOT183 |	Switching examples across multiple annies
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:41,120	| IOT183 |	Mysteries usually in cases where the
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:41,632	| IOT183 |	Requirement is to
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,424	| IOT183 |	SF state of volume
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,448	| IOT183 |	Games that are just outside
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:47,008	| IOT183 |	One example is in Hi-Tech
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:49,312	| IOT183 |	Manufacturing what are using video.
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:50,848	| IOT183 |	Detect effect
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,408	| IOT183 |	At the most granular level all the way down
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,432	| IOT183 |	Pixel levels
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,968	| IOT183 |	Within high definition picture
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,272	| IOT183 |	And it provides the ability to
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:01,344	| IOT183 |	To do this at scale and generate inside into Gildan
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,624	| IOT183 |	Improve throughput that
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,904	| IOT183 |	You just couldn't do
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,928	| IOT183 |	Human interaction
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,440	| IOT183 |	More required
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:07,488	| IOT183 |	Awesome json so
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:10,560	| IOT183 |	Where can we go to find out more about how fast
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT183 |	Just helping customers use AI
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:13,376	| IOT183 |	In iot
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,912	| IOT183 |	So we have a landing page
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:18,752	| IOT183 |	Sas.com coyote it's a great starting point
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:23,616	| IOT183 |	For both industry use cases in horizontal messaging around on their feet
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:35,392	| IOT183 |	Everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham

EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:53,056	| IOT183 |	Let's talk about your journey because you came into this
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,104	| IOT183 |	Two-and-a-half years ago
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,152	| IOT183 |	You describe it is
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,224	| IOT183 |	Right it feels like a monster
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:04,064	| IOT183 |	Beginning of the Bible right in the beginning it was voided for Maleficent
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:06,880	| IOT183 |	Overtime in a we had seven days
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:09,440	| IOT183 |	More like two and a half years of trying to
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,464	| IOT183 |	Come up with
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,488	| IOT183 |	What defining analytic
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,280	| IOT183 |	Coming up with a guiding Prince
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,352	| IOT183 |	Coming up with our roadmap or strategy
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:20,192	| IOT183 |	And then ultimately now shifting into development end
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,216	| IOT183 |	Appointment of antelope
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,544	| IOT183 |	Okay so he started
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,568	| IOT183 |	You guys from the Dark Ages
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,384	| IOT183 |	You started with nothing
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,664	| IOT183 |	Now you are in a relation
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,432	| IOT183 |	22 people
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,224	| IOT183 |	You help a company
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,504	| IOT183 |	Deliver a 12s
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,296	| IOT183 |	Investment
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:38,112	| IOT183 |	I'm assuming buying analytics software but maybe there's more to this
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:39,392	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:40,160	| IOT183 |	Let's start
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:42,208	| IOT183 |	With some of the concrete
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:44,768	| IOT183 |	Sure
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:47,840	| IOT183 |	I was just coming up with a common definition of what
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:48,352	| IOT183 |	Analytics
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:52,704	| IOT183 |	It's amazing certain terms get used and people
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:54,240	| IOT183 |	Variation of
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,264	| IOT183 |	What they mean
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:59,872	| IOT183 |	But we came up with it which is really that analytics are meant to help us
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,920	| IOT183 |	Use data to predict
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:03,712	| IOT183 |	Create some sort of valuable out
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,808	| IOT183 |	That really been led to
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,600	| IOT183 |	What that's what analytics is
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:13,440	| IOT183 |	What are the rules of the road for how we should go about doing
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,512	| IOT183 |	And we came up with a series
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:19,328	| IOT183 |	Guiding principles that informed our development
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,864	| IOT183 |	One being
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:23,424	| IOT183 |	That we think analytics is synonymous with
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,192	| IOT183 |	Strategy
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,216	| IOT183 |	And as such
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:28,288	| IOT183 |	Cuz it's this key capability we should naps work
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:30,848	| IOT183 |	Instead we needed to develop
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,128	| IOT183 |	Those capabilities in house
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,456	| IOT183 |	And because it's that important that relevant
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,504	| IOT183 |	Toonami the growth and direction of Art
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,040	| IOT183 |	Future
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,600	| IOT183 |	The analects wasn't so much about technology
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,136	| IOT183 |	Tencent about
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:47,232	| IOT183 |	How many weird sounding things I could get in and get the objectives to pay for like Pig
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:48,000	| IOT183 |	Baidu
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:50,560	| IOT183 |	Spark and whatever it was really around
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:51,584	| IOT183 |	Change manager
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,376	| IOT183 |	How do you get
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,936	| IOT183 |	An organization of 13000 people
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:59,008	| IOT183 |	Already got a hundred plus years
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:36:59,520	| IOT183 |	Process
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,848	| IOT183 |	History and everything else on the way they do things
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,152	| IOT183 |	To fundamentally alter
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,200	| IOT183 |	That way of doing business
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,760	| IOT183 |	So how did you do
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,784	| IOT183 |	Pick a project
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,576	| IOT183 |	Pick up
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,088	| IOT183 |	System
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,392	| IOT183 |	You're kind of talking philosophically the lips
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:21,280	| IOT183 |	So yeah so it's really important so we set about creating an analytics roadmap
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:24,864	| IOT183 |	Which was our strategy is a three-year strategy for how to act
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,448	| IOT183 |	And fundamentally create that chain
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:34,336	| IOT183 |	The route map in and of itself the process to create it was the first step in creating the change
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:37,152	| IOT183 |	We gave it The Guiding principles we gave it
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:40,224	| IOT183 |	Architectural high-level architecture what we wanted to accomplish
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:44,064	| IOT183 |	We really executed the change through a whole series of workshops that we
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:45,344	| IOT183 |	We did it
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:51,488	| IOT183 |	The first of which was to identify where the value was that we
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,560	| IOT183 |	And more than just Fanta results
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:57,120	| IOT183 |	Conan just on financial results you
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,424	| IOT183 |	Send it when I called the Grim Reaper affect which
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:02,752	| IOT183 |	I'm here and I'm using air quotes I'm here to help
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:06,336	| IOT183 |	And you cut the budget just once and then you're never invited back
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:10,688	| IOT183 |	And so we knew we needed to get outside of just the narrow or myopic
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:11,712	| IOT183 |	Benefit
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:16,064	| IOT183 |	The workshops really helped us do that we would go eat
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,368	| IOT183 |	Speak with the executives and then later we do
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,392	| IOT183 |	For the workshops with
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,160	| IOT183 |	13 * 2
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:21,696	| IOT183 |	Identify
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:22,464	| IOT183 |	Pain points
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,768	| IOT183 |	What kind of value they thought they
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,560	| IOT183 |	Create Beyond just the dollars
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:29,888	| IOT183 |	Sense that process also help us uncover
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:31,680	| IOT183 |	Talent within our own organization
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:37,568	| IOT183 |	We as a company didn't think we had if I well we're just going to have to build the organization from
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:41,408	| IOT183 |	Hiring everyone from the outside there's no one inside the company
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,480	| IOT183 |	Can you walk with you
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:50,880	| IOT183 |	An example of one of the workshops that what the team did what they were trying to tell you to tackle
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:54,464	| IOT183 |	Sure sure so. It's important who was in the workshop
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:58,816	| IOT183 |	So the first workshops we would typically do they were about 2 hours long
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:01,120	| IOT183 |	And in the workshop we had a purse
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:03,936	| IOT183 |	Me or someone from the Enterprise analytics area
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,216	| IOT183 |	Meaning we also brought in
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,752	| IOT183 |	Consulting outside support
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,288	| IOT183 |	We wanted to bring him
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,616	| IOT183 |	Someone to facilitate that conversation that kind of been there done that
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,408	| IOT183 |	So that they could help
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,944	| IOT183 |	Guide the conversation
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:16,736	| IOT183 |	As a neutral third-party
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,272	| IOT183 |	I think it also layer in
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:20,576	| IOT183 |	Hey I've seen this elsewhere here something
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,856	| IOT183 |	Hangouts you haven't thought of where you
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,928	| IOT183 |	And then of course we also brought it with
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,720	| IOT183 |	Our organization is not
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,256	| IOT183 |	Part of the information technology
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:29,792	| IOT183 |	Organization where I actually like I said
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:32,352	| IOT183 |	If analytics is strategies
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:32,864	| IOT183 |	Strategies
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:36,704	| IOT183 |	But we did bring it because there a key player in
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| IOT183 |	Getting access
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,776	| IOT183 |	Most of the data standing up
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:40,800	| IOT183 |	System
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,312	| IOT183 |	Keeping it patched
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:45,920	| IOT183 |	And then we also started at least the first conversations
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:46,688	| IOT183 |	2 hour one
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:48,992	| IOT183 |	Executive Suite to the major organ
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:53,344	| IOT183 |	That typically the way the process will always start with
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,368	| IOT183 |	What is Analytics
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:56,416	| IOT183 |	Write just a simple question
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:40:02,304	| IOT183 |	Trying to get everybody to bring out their ideas have a conversation around largely to coalesce around that
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,608	| IOT183 |	Forward-looking view up
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,888	| IOT183 |	You want to use Analytics
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,424	| IOT183 |	Freedom Valu black
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:07,936	| IOT183 |	Predictive
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:11,776	| IOT183 |	That was usually the first 30 to 45 minutes
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,592	| IOT183 |	And the remainder the conversation was on
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,360	| IOT183 |	High-level paint
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:18,176	| IOT183 |	Where in your organization
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,712	| IOT183 |	You really see opportunity
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:25,344	| IOT183 |	Interspersed into that we would give them a state of what is the art of the possible
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,136	| IOT183 |	That was tuned to the area
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,672	| IOT183 |	Supply chain
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:31,232	| IOT183 |	It was another reason why we brought third party
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,256	| IOT183 |	Military wise
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:35,584	| IOT183 |	Have a conversation Saved By the way supply chain
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:37,120	| IOT183 |	Outside of our industry
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:40,192	| IOT183 |	What's your summer
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,728	| IOT183 |	Interesting things you can do
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:45,568	| IOT183 |	We'll use that is kind of a way to stir the pot and help create
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:46,592	| IOT183 |	Interest
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:51,200	| IOT183 |	We would ask him vaguely high-level questions but where's your data
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:53,248	| IOT183 |	Where your Key Systems those switches
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:54,784	| IOT183 |	That's the first
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:55,296	| IOT183 |	Conversation
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:58,112	| IOT183 |	We then would go to in-depth conversation
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,672	| IOT183 |	Update full day
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:03,232	| IOT183 |	Then based on the areas that they identified in that
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:06,048	| IOT183 |	How long did this process
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,096	| IOT183 |	Within different word
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,656	| IOT183 |	About a 3-month process
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:15,520	| IOT183 |	We spend another two months after that though harmonizing all the results
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,544	| IOT183 |	We found so we
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,872	| IOT183 |	At the end of the day we created not only a series of use cases
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,384	| IOT183 |	Christmas tree
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:23,200	| IOT183 |	This is of interest to us
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,736	| IOT183 |	This is the value we think we
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,248	| IOT183 |	Free from it
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,296	| IOT183 |	Here's where the data we think
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,832	| IOT183 |	We need for that is
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:30,624	| IOT183 |	And here's the rough Bar Association we might want
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:37,280	| IOT183 |	We have a synthesizer harmonize all that because obviously how one team might make an assumption of Valium
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:38,304	| IOT183 |	Different than another
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,840	| IOT183 |	We need a time to come
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,656	| IOT183 |	Bring all that stuff together so roughly from
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,960	| IOT183 |	Initiation to about the six-month mark
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,240	| IOT183 |	Is how long it took
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,776	| IOT183 |	To go through the full process
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:51,360	| IOT183 |	Workshops interviews executive updates and then
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:54,943	| IOT183 |	Harmonization and ultimately creating this roadmap in terms of where we
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,527	| IOT183 |	Okay so now you have a road map
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:01,087	| IOT183 |	This when you brought inventors or
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,391	| IOT183 |	Did you have them in beforehand like
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,183	| IOT183 |	What's after the route
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:10,559	| IOT183 |	Yeah well so there's one key question you have to ask while doing the roadmap that we had to get in
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,095	| IOT183 |	And that is
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,911	| IOT183 |	What kind of way do you want to cross
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,471	| IOT183 |	Another word for towards
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:22,079	| IOT183 |	The places with the low-hanging fruit or readily available data
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,103	| IOT183 |	Or do you want it
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,895	| IOT183 |	Step back and take a more Enterprise
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,711	| IOT183 |	We call them that no business unit left
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:28,479	| IOT183 |	Behind strategy
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:31,551	| IOT183 |	But we went around we surveyed all the senior
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:35,391	| IOT183 |	With focusing on one or two areas
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:37,439	| IOT183 |	But that creates the halves
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,207	| IOT183 |	And the Have Nots
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:39,999	| IOT183 |	And you may be a have
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:43,583	| IOT183 |	But you're likely going to be a half not are you okay with that
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:46,399	| IOT183 |	By the way if we do the Haves and Have Nots
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:47,679	| IOT183 |	We might go a little faster
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:48,703	| IOT183 |	To start with
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:51,519	| IOT183 |	But it might create some unintended
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:54,591	| IOT183 |	It's right because the Have Nots my team up and go well
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:59,199	| IOT183 |	I really didn't work for me
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:03,295	| IOT183 |	Alt-right terrible Silo don't want to create silage from the
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:05,343	| IOT183 |	Heading into a person every one of the leaders
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,623	| IOT183 |	Demon energy said
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,415	| IOT183 |	We want you to go with the Enterprise
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:12,767	| IOT183 |	Which was really great because it allowed us to take a longer View
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:16,863	| IOT183 |	And it's far more comprehensive you about how to
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,143	| IOT183 |	Roulette
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:20,191	| IOT183 |	Architected and ultimately emblem
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:26,591	| IOT183 |	So when we got the business cases and all the roadmap in the strategy that we
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,359	| IOT183 |	You said okay this is what word
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| IOT183 |	2
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:30,175	| IOT183 |	It been created the next
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:32,991	| IOT183 |	Fertilprep to do which is okay now we have to go pick tools
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:36,063	| IOT183 |	That conform with our architecture on our strategy
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,855	| IOT183 |	We need to hire
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,623	| IOT183 |	Do we have
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:39,647	| IOT183 |	Literally knows that
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:42,719	| IOT183 |	And we have to do this in a very short amount of time because
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:46,559	| IOT183 |	Company wants to start recognizing benefits as soon as they
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:50,143	| IOT183 |	So we went down a couple Tracker boats hiring
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,655	| IOT183 |	And
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:56,031	| IOT183 |	Going out until you shoot a whole bunch of rfps for particular components that we went through
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:58,847	| IOT183 |	Define nauseous the tools like
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,383	| IOT183 |	Yale tour guide
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:03,711	| IOT183 |	Are you going to govern your data what are you going to store it in
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:06,015	| IOT183 |	But also
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,295	| IOT183 |	Some more importantly was
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:10,111	| IOT183 |	Are you going to enhance the data that you already got
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:14,719	| IOT183 |	We knew from the very moment that we started that our data wasn't very good
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:16,255	| IOT183 |	And there was a lot of data we just didn't
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:20,351	| IOT183 |	And so we knew we had to augment our data as much as we
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:20,863	| IOT183 |	We had a manager
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,959	| IOT183 |	Relaunch recipes
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,007	| IOT183 |	We Begin the hiring process
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:30,591	| IOT183 |	And by the end of the year we had selected
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:33,663	| IOT183 |	Vendors that we thought we really wanted
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:38,527	| IOT183 |	And we had also begun rnfl pirate we did not finish the hiring though
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:39,295	| IOT183 |	About
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,087	| IOT183 |	Really up until about the last two weeks
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,879	| IOT183 |	So the me
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:44,415	| IOT183 |	On the vendor side
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:45,695	| IOT183 |	What kinds of things
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:46,975	| IOT183 |	You decide to
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,743	| IOT183 |	So what are they
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:54,655	| IOT183 |	So I would say that I like to explain things
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:56,703	| IOT183 |	The two are senior Executives using
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,215	| IOT183 |	Cartoons
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:01,311	| IOT183 |	RIT infrastructure and our human capital
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:03,359	| IOT183 |	Spring from the womb and
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:05,663	| IOT183 |	Work effort something 30 years in our industry
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:08,479	| IOT183 |	Knowing the ins-and-outs about analytics
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:13,599	| IOT183 |	And so far everything into four different categories of things using a card
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:15,135	| IOT183 |	Arthur really
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:18,719	| IOT183 |	Simple easy to understand we said really there for parts to RL example
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:19,999	| IOT183 |	The first
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:24,095	| IOT183 |	Human capital write the driver or the passengers are really important
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:28,703	| IOT183 |	They're going to tell you where you're going and they're going to steer the car
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,263	| IOT183 |	Second part of it is
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:34,335	| IOT183 |	The fuel for the car which is your data right
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:38,175	| IOT183 |	How do you move your data how do you manage your data how do you augment
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,455	| IOT183 |	Governor
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:41,759	| IOT183 |	That's the second major category
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,575	| IOT183 |	The third was the engine
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:47,391	| IOT183 |	Consumes the fuel to create the
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:49,695	| IOT183 |	Does the mechanical energy to move you down the road
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,047	| IOT183 |	It is the inside itself right
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:46:02,751	| IOT183 |	I had a meeting with Executives and said I'd like to talk to you about a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:04,543	| IOT183 |	Fastest way to end a meeting right
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:05,055	| IOT183 |	Beijing
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:07,103	| IOT183 |	Don't want to talk about that
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:09,407	| IOT183 |	But you say I'd like to talk about
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:12,223	| IOT183 |	I'm inside a really cool inside that we did for your area
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,271	| IOT183 |	That resonates far more
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:17,343	| IOT183 |	I've got to find a way to take the math that you built in the engine
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:20,415	| IOT183 |	Visualize it and created and put it in a way that
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:21,951	| IOT183 |	Really helps Executives understand
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,719	| IOT183 |	Just what the hell
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:26,559	| IOT183 |	In my car exhaust right
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:29,631	| IOT183 |	It helps you see what the engine produce
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:34,495	| IOT183 |	But it also helps you monitor what's happening what's going on
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:38,079	| IOT183 |	And so forth
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:39,615	| IOT183 |	Key components of what we're doing
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:42,687	| IOT183 |	And we're going to try and RFP and
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:43,967	| IOT183 |	Find Partners to helping
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,551	| IOT183 |	Obviously human capital were going to hire
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,367	| IOT183 |	How we did it that's how we went about structuring it
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:55,999	| IOT183 |	And each of those areas that we also had to be mindful because the company isn't just trying to transform using Analytics
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:58,303	| IOT183 |	Trying to transform everything
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,071	| IOT183 |	All at once
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:03,423	| IOT183 |	We are doing our smart meter deployment or Ami deployment going on right now
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:07,775	| IOT183 |	We are at the same time changing out roughly 70% of our it infrastructure
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:09,567	| IOT183 |	Adult management
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:13,407	| IOT183 |	You name it it's all in there and then change out
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:16,735	| IOT183 |	The same time we are trying to rebuild our infrastructure for Analytics
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:20,063	| IOT183 |	We're attempting to launch products and services with our customers
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,599	| IOT183 |	Remake and rebuild our grid
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:25,183	| IOT183 |	Shelley Angela not all this change going on simultaneously
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:31,071	| IOT183 |	So we had two in that contact we had to also coordinate with all those other teams and go like
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:37,471	| IOT183 |	NRP for this but we need you all to be part of that RFP process because while you're putting in your things
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,775	| IOT183 |	We have to put in our time we all got to sing Kumbaya
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:43,871	| IOT183 |	And have one big group hug at the end of this to make sure that we're going in the same direction
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:46,431	| IOT183 |	So those were all resolved
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,455	| IOT183 |	Credited sent out
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:50,271	| IOT183 |	Yes absolutely.
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:51,807	| IOT183 |	So now you
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,343	| IOT183 |	Biot that are thieves out
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:55,391	| IOT183 |	Starting on YouTube
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:57,183	| IOT183 |	Where are you and what are your
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:47:59,231	| IOT183 |	Shores
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:01,023	| IOT183 |	You really get a diversity of responses
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,839	| IOT183 |	In or instance we got a whole bunch of results
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:09,727	| IOT183 |	Anyone tried to do what
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:10,239	| IOT183 |	You were doing
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:13,823	| IOT183 |	And our executive became a little worried they were like
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:15,871	| IOT183 |	We really like what you're doing the world so nervous about it
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:18,943	| IOT183 |	We had to talk to them through about How We Do lyrics
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:19,455	| IOT183 |	Re-implement
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:23,551	| IOT183 |	Risking the process to select even vendors and partners
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:27,903	| IOT183 |	Which is to say that an alarm strategy was really built around Flex
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:28,671	| IOT183 |	Ability
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:30,207	| IOT183 |	Around standards
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:33,535	| IOT183 |	Around broad industry acceptance not just our own engine
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:36,351	| IOT183 |	We found that
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:37,631	| IOT183 |	Taper example
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:40,191	| IOT183 |	Open source is great
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:42,751	| IOT183 |	But at the same time I have a CFO I have a
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:43,775	| IOT183 |	General counsel
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:47,871	| IOT183 |	Eva CEO and they worry incessantly over the operations of our business
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:54,783	| IOT183 |	Are compromised in wanting to get the flexibility and the growth in the capability that open source off
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:57,087	| IOT183 |	Was to buy a license
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:59,647	| IOT183 |	After all Hadoop is
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:01,695	| IOT183 |	And itself an open-source capability but
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:02,463	| IOT183 |	License
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:06,047	| IOT183 |	Similarly we went with a platform
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:09,631	| IOT183 |	What size because it really was broadly used
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,911	| IOT183 |	Well beyond
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,703	| IOT183 |	I never really intended just for RN
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:15,263	| IOT183 |	We knew we could Flex
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:16,031	| IOT183 |	Really quickly
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:21,663	| IOT183 |	On any number of problems that are Executives might come up with whether it was a safety
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:22,943	| IOT183 |	Customer
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:26,783	| IOT183 |	Audit supply chain nuclear anything they could come up with
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:30,367	| IOT183 |	If we picked those tools and conform to those prints
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:33,439	| IOT183 |	And did you also as you were evaluating them
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:37,023	| IOT183 |	Test how well these things could work together in these
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:38,559	| IOT183 |	Player's head work together
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:39,071	| IOT183 |	Correctly
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:40,351	| IOT183 |	Because
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:43,167	| IOT183 |	These things have to work together as a system and that could be
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:48,287	| IOT183 |	Yeah oh yeah could be a huge pain point in Nebraska
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:48,799	| IOT183 |	That's why
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:53,919	| IOT183 |	We in the rfps as well as in our roadmap development we spent a lot of time talking
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:54,943	| IOT183 |	Architecture
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,735	| IOT183 |	And about how those different pieces
EDL	00:49:56,735	00:49:58,783	| IOT183 |	Integrate well with each other
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:02,367	| IOT183 |	We really wanted to make sure that to the extent you're going to pick
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,903	| IOT183 |	One solution
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:10,047	| IOT183 |	That it work well in an ecosystem and had a proven track record of working well on ecosystem
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:13,375	| IOT183 |	Studio Luxe year-and-a-half
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:15,167	| IOT183 |	So what came after that where we ended
EDL	00:50:15,935	00:50:18,495	| IOT183 |	Yeah so we started we continue to hire
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:20,543	| IOT183 |	We started out with hiring five data scientist
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:23,615	| IOT183 |	3D to Engineers one director for the organization
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:25,919	| IOT183 |	As well as a data governance manager in an agile
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:29,759	| IOT183 |	Savory necessary early components
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:35,647	| IOT183 |	Infamous meeting with our CFO general counsel saying what we've got lots of different ways to prioritize use
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:36,415	| IOT183 |	This case is here
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:37,695	| IOT183 |	What do you want to start with
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:40,255	| IOT183 |	And there at least 8 different ways we came up
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:46,399	| IOT183 |	Yeah which means if you have a way to prioritize you have no way to prioritize
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:47,679	| IOT183 |	The end
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:50,239	| IOT183 |	Customer is our number one issue right now
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:51,519	| IOT183 |	You really need to work on customers
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,591	| IOT183 |	Go find some easy winds are from the customer
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:56,895	| IOT183 |	So that's where we started
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:51:02,015	| IOT183 |	With our while we were doing all the hiring everything else we've also started to try some of this risk
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:06,111	| IOT183 |	In that time we prosecuted 19 of our initial 100
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:06,879	| IOT183 |	42 use case
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:10,975	| IOT183 |	142 use cases
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:11,999	| IOT183 |	142
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:15,839	| IOT183 |	Gas are really well and what's so funny is
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:20,959	| IOT183 |	We did after we will start work on the 19 what's really important that we get back
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:21,727	| IOT183 |	Hell
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:23,007	| IOT183 |	All the executives
EDL	00:51:23,007	00:51:26,079	| IOT183 |	What we've been up to but we kind of went quiet there at wework
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:29,919	| IOT183 |	Wake of the RFP process if we were picking Solutions Contracting
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:31,967	| IOT183 |	Tell everybody
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:38,111	| IOT183 |	I'm afraid that was really meant to go around and talk to all the executives
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:40,159	| IOT183 |	Here's what you saw
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:41,695	| IOT183 |	Here's what we've done
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:42,975	| IOT183 |	Are the results we've gotten
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:43,743	| IOT183 |	Today
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:45,279	| IOT183 |	19
EDL	00:51:45,279	00:51:46,047	| IOT183 |	12
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:47,071	| IOT183 |	That's r12x return
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:49,887	| IOT183 |	The good part about the parade that was
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:55,775	| IOT183 |	What person every executive every leadership team that we talked with reservation was blown away with the results
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:57,311	| IOT183 |	Gotten so far
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:52:01,663	| IOT183 |	Those were primarily all in a customer area everything from food forecasting to
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:03,967	| IOT183 |	Segmentation and propensity models
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:06,271	| IOT183 |	Things we could use again and again and again
EDL	00:52:06,271	00:52:08,063	| IOT183 |	Providing instant benefits
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:08,575	| IOT183 |	Company
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:15,231	| IOT183 |	They were also some that we could use in our future deployments for technology Ami Advanced metering infrastructure
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:17,279	| IOT183 |	Takes years to deploy
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:20,351	| IOT183 |	We are ready now with some of those capabilities because we
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:21,631	| IOT183 |	Filthy early stop
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:22,399	| IOT183 |	Priortax
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:25,727	| IOT183 |	We went around to the parade deck
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:27,007	| IOT183 |	The unintended
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:29,567	| IOT183 |	Someone into the consequence was that now
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:33,407	| IOT183 |	All those Executives were so excited by what we had done already they wanted us to work on
EDL	00:52:34,687	00:52:35,455	| IOT183 |	Right there feeling like half
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:41,855	| IOT183 |	Right exactly into that triggered the next round of why we need to start hiring is
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:46,463	| IOT183 |	We need to go ahead and staff up those capabilities but if your resources come on and shocks
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:48,511	| IOT183 |	You really need to flex
EDL	00:52:48,511	00:52:51,071	| IOT183 |	Capabilities that you bring in from the outside
EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:53,375	| IOT183 |	And so what we've been doing in that process
EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:55,423	| IOT183 |	We have Consulting agreements
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:59,007	| IOT183 |	Long as we can form with the architecture in the standards of what we've done
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:01,311	| IOT183 |	To use third parties to come in and
EDL	00:53:01,311	00:53:02,079	| IOT183 |	Help us
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:08,223	| IOT183 |	Manage our workload between your initial hiring to our next level of hiring a smoothie
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:12,063	| IOT183 |	Capabilities for all these different organization saying
EDL	00:53:12,063	00:53:14,111	| IOT183 |	Me too I want some of this stuff also
EDL	00:53:14,623	00:53:18,207	| IOT183 |	Until these are things that can be easily codified in
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:18,719	| IOT183 |	So
EDL	00:53:19,487	00:53:19,999	| IOT183 |	Random
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:22,815	| IOT183 |	People outside the organization
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:26,399	| IOT183 |	Yasmin use case
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:29,727	| IOT183 |	Development process from initial idea all the way to hand over
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:34,335	| IOT183 |	We do not own any of the models at the end of the day that's really important
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:38,175	| IOT183 |	From a change management perspective because of the results
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:42,015	| IOT183 |	But if a business owns the model and they own the result and therefore they
EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:43,039	| IOT183 |	Change
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:45,087	| IOT183 |	Just one of our key drivers
EDL	00:53:45,087	00:53:47,135	| IOT183 |	But for us when we think about this
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:48,927	| IOT183 |	Journey and pain
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:51,231	| IOT183 |	Getting to where they were ization
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:53,279	| IOT183 |	Has this innate capability
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:56,607	| IOT183 |	Are you skis process has a really rigorous.
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:58,655	| IOT183 |	Tatian process wrapped around it
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:01,471	| IOT183 |	We also invited a lot of different players we invite in finance
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:04,287	| IOT183 |	If you want them to document the benefits that are coming
EDL	00:54:04,799	00:54:09,919	| IOT183 |	We don't think that keeps us honest and also keep us out of the Grim Reaper business of trying to cut other people's budget
EDL	00:54:10,431	00:54:15,039	| IOT183 |	We bring an it because they are critically important that getting the data and getting access
EDL	00:54:15,039	00:54:17,855	| IOT183 |	Make sure the infrastructure is up and running the way it ought to
EDL	00:54:17,855	00:54:21,183	| IOT183 |	And we do that and of course the business units the customer themselves
EDL	00:54:21,183	00:54:22,207	| IOT183 |	They're the domain X
EDL	00:54:22,719	00:54:25,023	| IOT183 |	May we bring data science City engineering Adida governance
EDL	00:54:25,535	00:54:31,935	| IOT183 |	We use that process Auto to dictate our order in which we govern data upgrade infrastructure Etc
EDL	00:54:31,935	00:54:34,239	| IOT183 |	Use cases determine the order
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:39,871	| IOT183 |	Exciting is probably not the right word but that was really educational that was a very good to dive into something that's so many
EDL	00:54:41,407	00:54:41,919	| IOT183 |	Thank you
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:49,087	| IOT183 |	Thank you appreciate it that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you'd like
