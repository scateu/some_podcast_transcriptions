EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:17,408	| IOT164 |	Awesome show for you today
EDL	00:00:17,920	00:00:20,992	| IOT164 |	We're going to be talking about the new easy mesh Wi-Fi standard
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:22,528	| IOT164 |	Six foxes brand new
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:25,088	| IOT164 |	3 as a service
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:26,880	| IOT164 |	Plus a crazy sensor
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:27,392	| IOT164 |	Borsuk box
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:29,696	| IOT164 |	We're also found a hob
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:32,512	| IOT164 |	That you're going to want to hear about because it allows for local
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:33,280	| IOT164 |	Control
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,048	| IOT164 |	In your house
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:34,816	| IOT164 |	Aunt
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:37,376	| IOT164 |	We got a bunch of little bits of news including
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,656	| IOT164 |	New lights from Philips
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:41,728	| IOT164 |	A cool intercom system for families
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:44,288	| IOT164 |	And data on who owns a smart home device
EDL	00:00:45,312	00:00:48,640	| IOT164 |	Kevin is going to share his opinion on the wyze camera V2
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:50,688	| IOT164 |	And he also got a Yale lock
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:52,992	| IOT164 |	So we can talk a little bit more about that
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:59,392	| IOT164 |	Our Guest this week is Chris Myers from Misty robotics this is a smart programmable robot ended
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,160	| IOT164 |	Developers
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:02,464	| IOT164 |	And if I had the money I would totally buy one
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:06,560	| IOT164 |	Our sponsor this week is machineq
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,584	| IOT164 |	A Comcast service
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,888	| IOT164 |	And you can look forward to hearing from them
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:10,912	| IOT164 |	In the middle of the show
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:13,984	| IOT164 |	And now a message from one of our new sponsors
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:14,496	| IOT164 |	Bosch
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:21,408	| IOT164 |	Are you interested in all things iot the Bosch connected World blog covers a wide range of iot top
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:27,808	| IOT164 |	Topix from around the world such as industry 4.0 Mobility smart hold blockchain and
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:34,208	| IOT164 |	Agriculture Tech check out the blog at blog. Bosch - s i.com
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:39,584	| IOT164 |	For articles case studies interviews and more and I will say a lot of fees
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:45,984	| IOT164 |	Corporate blogs run promotional this one is what I actually read on a regular basis to see what's happening and what cool thing
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:48,032	| IOT164 |	Things people are doing so do go check it out
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,544	| IOT164 |	All right
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:49,824	| IOT164 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,848	| IOT164 |	Big news of the week
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,384	| IOT164 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:56,992	| IOT164 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance has certified something called easymesh that is
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:03,136	| IOT164 |	Like the Easy-Bake Oven only it's an easy mesh Network which means your mesh networks will
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,672	| IOT164 |	All going forward
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,696	| IOT164 |	Work together
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:08,000	| IOT164 |	Regardless of brand or vendor
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:11,840	| IOT164 |	Yes and this is a big deal cuz right now if you buy it like an orbi
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,376	| IOT164 |	You had to buy the orbi
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,448	| IOT164 |	Main thing I can't remember the Colleton to orbi satellites
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:18,496	| IOT164 |	And you cannot like swap Outlet
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:21,056	| IOT164 |	Acer satellite to work with your orbi satellite
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,824	| IOT164 |	You know
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:25,920	| IOT164 |	Biscuits sad inhibits price competition
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:31,296	| IOT164 |	So now we have the ability for everything to work together which is actually something that Kevin and I
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,320	| IOT164 |	What about a really long
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| IOT164 |	But
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,136	| IOT164 |	There's a fly
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,672	| IOT164 |	Attwifi
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:43,840	| IOT164 |	There is and that's because there really has been a standard for Mesh networking and it is
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,376	| IOT164 |	AAA 802.
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,400	| IOT164 |	11s
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| IOT164 |	End
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,520	| IOT164 |	Current mesh networks either use some of it or
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:57,408	| IOT164 |	Create their own stuff and that's why things aren't you know compatible these days between say
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,944	| IOT164 |	Google wifi
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:02,528	| IOT164 |	Or be a Nero in a plume Etc so now with
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,320	| IOT164 |	Adoption of the standard
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:09,440	| IOT164 |	Turn the Wi-Fi Alliance you think this is great news and in theory it is
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,000	| IOT164 |	But I'm a little concerned because
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:18,400	| IOT164 |	I've seen some research from last year that says the global market Global spin on wireless mesh
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:24,544	| IOT164 |	Networking has already talked over 5 billion dollars and it's expected be about 11 billion by 2025
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:31,456	| IOT164 |	So there's a lot of non-compatible much stuff out there I don't see any information showing this
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,992	| IOT164 |	Stuff is all backwards compatible
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:39,904	| IOT164 |	So that means if you already have a mesh Network system I don't think you're going to be able to mix and match in the future without
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:46,304	| IOT164 |	At least upgrading your router and that's not something I think most people do on a regular basis and it's not like a smart light
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,584	| IOT164 |	A switch I mean that's
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,864	| IOT164 |	Yeah we all did it
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,376	| IOT164 |	Like 2 years ago
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:56,800	| IOT164 |	We did it before that freighter 211 you know AC or and whatever you might have chosen up a tie
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:00,640	| IOT164 |	Time a ex is coming that's going to be even faster which is great but
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:03,200	| IOT164 |	Honestly I don't see this as backwards compatible
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:07,040	| IOT164 |	And I sort of wonder what's the incentive for these companies to
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:10,880	| IOT164 |	Open up the walls and say yeah now will work with anybody here
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,416	| IOT164 |	I don't see the intended to that
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:18,815	| IOT164 |	It may be because of mesh has an important aspect of like a good smart home system and a lot of these companies are getting into those other
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| IOT164 |	Other devices
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,607	| IOT164 |	It might also be
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,375	| IOT164 |	Pressure from
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,423	| IOT164 |	The isps which
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| IOT164 |	For a while
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,727	| IOT164 |	Consumers
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,751	| IOT164 |	They went with
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| IOT164 |	ISP routers
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,847	| IOT164 |	Incredible Never Their Eyes Pete gave them so maybe
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:33,151	| IOT164 |	They adopted this because they realize that that's
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,663	| IOT164 |	That's the way of the world
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,943	| IOT164 |	Going to go now
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,503	| IOT164 |	Baby the isps then adopt this
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:42,623	| IOT164 |	And for many people you're right that would be their new router that they the rent or buy
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:45,439	| IOT164 |	Directly and then compatibilities
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,719	| IOT164 |	Bonus I get that
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:51,839	| IOT164 |	So yeah if you wanted to sell an extra at like it I mean basically allows them to get into
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,631	| IOT164 |	Easier extender market for
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,423	| IOT164 |	Crappy wifi routers
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:55,935	| IOT164 |	But your eyes peep
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:04,895	| IOT164 |	I don't know why it just it sounded good when I saw the headline it didn't feel so good as I thought
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,687	| IOT164 |	Through I just I don't know
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,199	| IOT164 |	You know
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:14,879	| IOT164 |	I don't know I literally just replace a router actually so I mean it is rare but the only reason I did it was not to get faster speed
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,159	| IOT164 |	Need sorting like that
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:22,559	| IOT164 |	It was because it just happened to fall off a table and broke the antennas can be soldered and some pieces fell off and
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:26,399	| IOT164 |	Question the Integrity of it otherwise I'd still have this router that I bought in 24
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,703	| IOT164 |	But that the Google router
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:34,079	| IOT164 |	That was the original Google onhub which was software flash to become essentially a Google Wi-Fi unit
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:39,711	| IOT164 |	So yes and I replaced it with a Google Wi-Fi units now I have to Wi-Fi units instead of a non other than Wi-Fi
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT164 |	Cool
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,271	| IOT164 |	Speaking of network
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,087	| IOT164 |	Let's talk about a low-power wide area
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,879	| IOT164 |	So these are the
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:51,231	| IOT164 |	Big networks ethernet Works cover cities or big Regional areas
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| IOT164 |	Countries possibly
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:56,351	| IOT164 |	There are two flavors are the unlicensed bands and then there are licensed
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,119	| IOT164 |	Bye
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,399	| IOT164 |	Those made by cellular
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:01,471	| IOT164 |	Pay for the other flavors of this our cat M1
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| IOT164 |	And nb-iot
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:08,895	| IOT164 |	Now what we're going to be talking about is sick. Such as doing their own proprietary Network
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| IOT164 |	In
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,199	| IOT164 |	Set
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:15,295	| IOT164 |	Six-axis launching a new sensor device called the sensit discovery
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:15,807	| IOT164 |	And
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| IOT164 |	They
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:20,415	| IOT164 |	Not as part of this but a week ago also launched
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,183	| IOT164 |	A
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,231	| IOT164 |	Assuming they are calling connectivity as a
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:24,255	| IOT164 |	The service or cats
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:27,583	| IOT164 |	Please no one ever use the phrase inside
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:31,423	| IOT164 |	So basically all it is is there going to ship you
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:34,239	| IOT164 |	A base station a subox enable base station
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:37,567	| IOT164 |	If you want to try using their Network in your
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:40,639	| IOT164 |	Farm fields or perhaps your Warehouse
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:47,039	| IOT164 |	So it makes a ton of sense because they've been trying to cover the us but can't cover the whole us
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:50,879	| IOT164 |	Just randomly that takes billions of dollars so what they're doing is if you're like
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,183	| IOT164 |	Hey you know I really like the look of your network
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,463	| IOT164 |	But you don't have coverage area
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,231	| IOT164 |	How can I do this
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,999	| IOT164 |	Is there like
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,839	| IOT164 |	You know what if you got Ethernet or 3-g will send your base station you plug that right in
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,631	| IOT164 |	You are good to go
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:07,775	| IOT164 |	It's almost like the base stations that the carriers usted provide when you had poor cellular service in your home
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:13,151	| IOT164 |	You would connect that to your ethernet connection of your Wi-Fi and that Pam credit many cell area
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,223	| IOT164 |	That's it femtocell
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:20,063	| IOT164 |	Yes and this is actually what our spots are machineq also.
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:23,647	| IOT164 |	So in there doing a different version of a low-power wide area network they're doing Laurel
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,951	| IOT164 |	But they do say they're not working
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,815	| IOT164 |	But anyway this is going to be a common thing for getting these Networks
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,351	| IOT164 |	Spread out over
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:32,863	| IOT164 |	Some more places
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,399	| IOT164 |	Ton of sense
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,679	| IOT164 |	It's basically built it is
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:39,263	| IOT164 |	If you need it and Kevin do you want to talk about the sensitive I switch
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,287	| IOT164 |	Looks pretty cool
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:46,687	| IOT164 |	Yeah I like this it's a really small sensor weighs about 2 oz and it detects up to five different things temperature
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:49,759	| IOT164 |	Pictures of light motion humidity and vibration
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| IOT164 |	Oh and also has magnets and it's easily
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,367	| IOT164 |	A door open close sensor for example
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:08:00,511	| IOT164 |	And it just clicks all that data and sends it to you through the sick Fox network and then you can
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:06,911	| IOT164 |	Presumably do whatever it is you like me know what some animations or things like that or maybe just want to let you know stare at the day today that's up to you
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,471	| IOT164 |	I don't know how much this cost
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,543	| IOT164 |	You can sign up for it now it's kind of been in beta for a while
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,359	| IOT164 |	But yeah I like it's a nice little little sensor
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,919	| IOT164 |	Yes and presumably he'll need a
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,687	| IOT164 |	Sigfox Gateway
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,967	| IOT164 |	For this
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:23,039	| IOT164 |	Yeah I love to put this in my mailbox down the street
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:25,855	| IOT164 |	Well so this actually we weren't going to talk about this
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| IOT164 |	This is not an issue
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,159	| IOT164 |	Some TV rating for the show notes
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,463	| IOT164 |	You guys but I just bought a device
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:35,071	| IOT164 |	Because I want to measure temperature and humidity at my daughter's classrooms cuz they're in a portable building
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,119	| IOT164 |	And she complains that it's too hot
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,911	| IOT164 |	Too stuffy and the school is like
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,447	| IOT164 |	I'm sure it's just find me tired
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| IOT164 |	Air conditioning out there
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,263	| IOT164 |	So I decided Well is he
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:43,775	| IOT164 |	What it's really like
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,055	| IOT164 |	And
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,871	| IOT164 |	Look at you parent with the sensors in the Nevada
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:52,735	| IOT164 |	I know I'm not a helicopter parent heat triggers for migraines
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,503	| IOT164 |	Terrible
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| IOT164 |	Anyway
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:58,111	| IOT164 |	So what happens is I was like Oh I thought I was going to actually
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,671	| IOT164 |	Sponsors the twilio
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,439	| IOT164 |	Sim
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| IOT164 |	And actually just
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,255	| IOT164 |	Use that as a connection for
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,535	| IOT164 |	An Arduino that was going to
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,303	| IOT164 |	Sensors on a
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,607	| IOT164 |	Because I didn't think the school was going to let me
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:13,471	| IOT164 |	But the school said yeah you can come in on the Wi-Fi network that's totally fine
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,287	| IOT164 |	Now I just bought a $90
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,847	| IOT164 |	Was $90 on sale and aware glow
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| IOT164 |	So aware makes a
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,151	| IOT164 |	Air quality
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:25,503	| IOT164 |	That's her that's $200 but the glow is like this night light
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,015	| IOT164 |	Outlet
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:30,367	| IOT164 |	Plus air quality sensor and that's only I think it retails for like
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,391	| IOT164 |	$105
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,183	| IOT164 |	So I bought that
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:37,791	| IOT164 |	It would have also worked for that there was a long way of telling you guys about this and
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:45,983	| IOT164 |	Just out of curiosity I still want to hear about it next week but it does I don't know why I'm not familiar with the device so
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:51,871	| IOT164 |	Because it's called glow is there any visual notification of with the
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| IOT164 |	So
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,943	| IOT164 |	There's a night light component that
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,711	| IOT164 |	Turns on and off
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,503	| IOT164 |	Control it through Google home
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,063	| IOT164 |	And then there's also a light
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,599	| IOT164 |	On top that glows
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:04,159	| IOT164 |	Green yellow or red depending on the air quality
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:11,327	| IOT164 |	And I was just thinking it would be interesting for the kids to see the information you're going to get the data but it would be nice for them to see some
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| IOT164 |	Wellness
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| IOT164 |	Thread in the
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,143	| IOT164 |	Muscovite unplug it
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:18,239	| IOT164 |	Could you already have the data so
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,263	| IOT164 |	Problem solved
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:19,775	| IOT164 |	There we go
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,615	| IOT164 |	Your classrooms get an upgrade
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| IOT164 |	So that's the sick Fox
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,967	| IOT164 |	This is I think really cool
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:34,111	| IOT164 |	Especially for a lot of our listeners who write in every week to complain about having their data in the cloud and there are a lot of
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:36,415	| IOT164 |	So this is a device
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,439	| IOT164 |	Cold habitat
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,767	| IOT164 |	H u b i t a t
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:45,631	| IOT164 |	And it's $159 Smart Hub one of the founders is actually
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,447	| IOT164 |	One of the guys who created the rules engine
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,215	| IOT164 |	Or SmartThings
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,519	| IOT164 |	So this is a
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,055	| IOT164 |	Device could have built
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,359	| IOT164 |	I have the SmartThings experience in mind
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,127	| IOT164 |	But
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,175	| IOT164 |	The owner controls it so
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,711	| IOT164 |	You plug this in
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,247	| IOT164 |	Extra devices
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| IOT164 |	280 create the network and then
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,087	| IOT164 |	Data stays local
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,367	| IOT164 |	It doesn't go
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| IOT164 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:09,695	| IOT164 |	And if you want to update or grab some
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,975	| IOT164 |	Maybe some new apps or
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,023	| IOT164 |	Something for your habitat
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,559	| IOT164 |	You pull it down at your request
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:21,471	| IOT164 |	I like this and I look into it a couple weeks ago as I was researching hubs and I should note that right
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:26,079	| IOT164 |	Right now I'm on the site actually down $215 in the US
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:30,687	| IOT164 |	Yeah it is the Hub or USB stick
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:34,015	| IOT164 |	Which includes zigbee and Z-Wave on ethernet cable
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:40,415	| IOT164 |	So yeah I kind of like the idea of this and I know a lot of our listeners will as well because of the local aspect
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:40,927	| IOT164 |	David
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| IOT164 |	So for this hub
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,023	| IOT164 |	What's also cool is
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:49,119	| IOT164 |	While everything can be done locally it also can go out and talk to cloud-based
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,143	| IOT164 |	Applications
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:54,239	| IOT164 |	Which means it will work with Madam a witches are shorthand for
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,031	| IOT164 |	Amazon Echo digital assistant
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,823	| IOT164 |	We just want to set off yours
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,615	| IOT164 |	So it works with that it works
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,407	| IOT164 |	I believe with if
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| IOT164 |	And
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| IOT164 |	Things like your Lutron
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,759	| IOT164 |	Hub if you have that
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,295	| IOT164 |	Your Hue Bridge your Sonos is
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,879	| IOT164 |	And a bunch of other existing devices that you might have
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,695	| IOT164 |	So it's pretty cool I think
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,743	| IOT164 |	Yeah I love the fact that
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:19,583	| IOT164 |	Aside from the date and not going up to the cloud is your internet does go out
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:25,983	| IOT164 |	The still works 100% I mean it's cuz it's all local and your wife I obviously still going to be around noon.
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:31,871	| IOT164 |	Have to go do anything else with your internet or your network of the move files around but you still have everything working here
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:35,199	| IOT164 |	Yes and it works with a lot of the brands we talked about like lifx
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,711	| IOT164 |	Donkey
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,503	| IOT164 |	Schlage Samsung
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| IOT164 |	Aerotek
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,295	| IOT164 |	Bosch
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,063	| IOT164 |	Sbarro
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,343	| IOT164 |	I don't see ecobee on here
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| IOT164 |	And I don't see nest
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,927	| IOT164 |	Obey Ducey nanoleaf
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,255	| IOT164 |	Lots of products out there
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,815	| IOT164 |	That this will work with and where will be coming
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,583	| IOT164 |	All the time
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,863	| IOT164 |	As people build device driver
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:59,775	| IOT164 |	I was just going to say it you can build your own and absent device drivers with this and that reminds me of the candle
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:06,175	| IOT164 |	Fillers for SmartThings which has a pretty active community and I know you can just take SmartThings handlers but I wonder if
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,967	| IOT164 |	50 Brookside
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:12,063	| IOT164 |	OC so I wonder because the fibaro folks
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:15,391	| IOT164 |	They provide some device Handler stores ampleforth SmartThings
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:18,719	| IOT164 |	That you can download that's how you get your fibaro devices work with SmartThings
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| IOT164 |	I wonder
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:24,863	| IOT164 |	Is there doing the same thing here in which case there's a lot of potential here
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,167	| IOT164 |	On the cheap
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,959	| IOT164 |	On the cheap so
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,519	| IOT164 |	If you guys are interested in that and I should warn you
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:38,431	| IOT164 |	They are very clear in saying that this is for people who really want to play with this stuff this is not yet for people who want
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,735	| IOT164 |	Something that they can set forget that's easy
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,015	| IOT164 |	So most of our peeps
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,039	| IOT164 |	So most of our people
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,319	| IOT164 |	I just want you to everybody
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,855	| IOT164 |	For the people who are like
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,135	| IOT164 |	And Kevin
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:49,695	| IOT164 |	I know you're excited but you did not love your smart
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,231	| IOT164 |	So I'm curious
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,815	| IOT164 |	But that wasn't
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,583	| IOT164 |	For the
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,119	| IOT164 |	It wasn't because I had a tanker
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,959	| IOT164 |	No I don't mind tinker and I love to Tinker Bell movie
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,751	| IOT164 |	But that wasn't it it just
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,775	| IOT164 |	Didn't Do It For Me
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,055	| IOT164 |	The Experience wasn't there for me
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,359	| IOT164 |	Well either Kevin or I will try this out
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:07,871	| IOT164 |	Will fight over
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,967	| IOT164 |	You can try it if you're going to buy me a misty 2 robot
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,295	| IOT164 |	Don't get ahead of yourself my friend
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,111	| IOT164 |	Those are a bit more expensive
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,903	| IOT164 |	Alright so
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:23,231	| IOT164 |	What are big exciting things this week let's talk about some of our smaller bits of news
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:23,743	| IOT164 |	Such as
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,559	| IOT164 |	I ran into this device that I thought was pretty cool
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,375	| IOT164 |	Republic Wireless which is a company that makes
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,167	| IOT164 |	Well the word
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:34,495	| IOT164 |	Cellular mvno I don't know what they're doing now but
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,311	| IOT164 |	They launched this device called the relay
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,615	| IOT164 |	And it's designed for kids
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,919	| IOT164 |	And basically it's a speaker with a button on it
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,455	| IOT164 |	When you press the button
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,991	| IOT164 |	It'll send a
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:49,599	| IOT164 |	Short voice message to your parents phone so I can get that message in SMS form
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,671	| IOT164 |	And I can respond via SMS in the device will read the message
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,695	| IOT164 |	Switch back to your kids
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,463	| IOT164 |	Or
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,231	| IOT164 |	If you have two of them
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,047	| IOT164 |	You can actually just have them set up as like a little
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,071	| IOT164 |	Intercom system
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| IOT164 |	Between the two
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| IOT164 |	Which
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,143	| IOT164 |	I think it's really cool
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:05,983	| IOT164 |	We have actually used are Amazon Echo and Google homes as this
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:09,823	| IOT164 |	Kind of thing for talking to her daughter both when she's upstairs but also
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| IOT164 |	When she is
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:15,455	| IOT164 |	At home and we're away from home and we just want to let chicken with her or she wants to check in with us
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,247	| IOT164 |	A single one will cost
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,039	| IOT164 |	$99 at tu casa
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,551	| IOT164 |	149
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,135	| IOT164 |	Ouch it is kind of pricey
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:26,975	| IOT164 |	But it's nice if you don't have a landline in but they sit me up
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| IOT164 |	Home phone
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,279	| IOT164 |	Well
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:35,167	| IOT164 |	Yeah I mean it's but it's almost like an SMS CB radio to me it's not the voice
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT164 |	Device
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:36,959	| IOT164 |	That's true if you don't have
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,287	| IOT164 |	Fred I should say they do have a service fee
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,311	| IOT164 |	$5
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,127	| IOT164 |	Because this is this is basically like a cellular
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:49,503	| IOT164 |	Sure you know what this reminds me of an I don't know if you recall it to remember that Peak
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,551	| IOT164 |	The small email device
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,087	| IOT164 |	Did nothing but email
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,879	| IOT164 |	Yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:58,719	| IOT164 |	I'm not I mean listen I don't have younger kids these days so
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:03,327	| IOT164 |	You're obviously not the Target customer and for people who are the Target customer
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,607	| IOT164 |	Okay I get it cuz
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,375	| IOT164 |	Probably aren't
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:08,447	| IOT164 |	A ton of great options in this space so I get it I do
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,983	| IOT164 |	You know you don't need
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:14,591	| IOT164 |	Every kid to have an iPhone 10 and paying you $46 a month if they're
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,127	| IOT164 |	6 years old we just need somebody
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:18,431	| IOT164 |	Some way to talk to them in their homes I get it
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| IOT164 |	But I don't know
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,759	| IOT164 |	Okay Kevin's not spending the money
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,039	| IOT164 |	I don't know if you guys will
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,319	| IOT164 |	Synchronicity
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:29,695	| IOT164 |	Maybe you save your money for Misty or maybe you save it for this summer because I was talking with someone from
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| IOT164 |	Philips Lighting
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,791	| IOT164 |	And they're going to launch a colored outdoor light this summer
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:37,887	| IOT164 |	So nothing more than that but I got very
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,423	| IOT164 |	Excited about color
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,191	| IOT164 |	Tunable
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,471	| IOT164 |	Outdoor capable
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:41,983	| IOT164 |	Philips Hue
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,287	| IOT164 |	Pothead
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:48,895	| IOT164 |	Then I was going to buy like a fire pit Meme and just get some colored bulbs to flicker like fire
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,175	| IOT164 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| IOT164 |	Yes that is
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| IOT164 |	Definitely
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,479	| IOT164 |	Cheaper solution
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,759	| IOT164 |	Fire pit
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,295	| IOT164 |	Nothing that is warm
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,319	| IOT164 |	But that would work
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,367	| IOT164 |	Alright Kevin you got some survey data
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,391	| IOT164 |	Just for those
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:03,743	| IOT164 |	Yes it's not a ton here but I just happened to see this
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:06,815	| IOT164 |	Infographic and survey from metova
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:12,703	| IOT164 |	They have survey people in the US and these numbers are kind of Staggering they say
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:19,103	| IOT164 |	From the survey respondents 90% over 90% of consumers in the US have a connected home device not
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:23,455	| IOT164 |	Resume playing like a router or something like that
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:29,599	| IOT164 |	Yeah I exactly although even the new Kindle tablet I just bought one has hands-free Madame a built-in to
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:35,743	| IOT164 |	Crazy speaking of Madame a the results from metova survey say that nearly 70%
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:39,839	| IOT164 |	Already have a voice control system such as Madame a 58%
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:44,959	| IOT164 |	Kuoni connect new device are concerned about how it may impact their privacy I would hope it be more than that
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:48,287	| IOT164 |	And 30% who do not have a connected home device
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,359	| IOT164 |	Currently do plan to make a purchase within the year
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,407	| IOT164 |	So these numbers
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,199	| IOT164 |	Sounded hire me except for the
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:59,295	| IOT164 |	Concern about privacy I thought that would be higher than 90% in the US have a connected home device
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,319	| IOT164 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,183	| IOT164 |	Exactly 30% of the 10%
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:05,951	| IOT164 |	12
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,999	| IOT164 |	Apparently growth is done there now we're just
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,023	| IOT164 |	Can I sell more connected device
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,351	| IOT164 |	And mesh Network routers
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,631	| IOT164 |	Here's how we're going to do it
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,911	| IOT164 |	Mattamy is coming to more stuff
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,703	| IOT164 |	This time TiVo
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:19,263	| IOT164 |	I never had a TiVo
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,055	| IOT164 |	Idea
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,847	| IOT164 |	I forgot about it but hey if you have one
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,359	| IOT164 |	Now you can control
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:28,735	| IOT164 |	Yep this is I was looking to see what you could actually do and it's pretty
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:35,135	| IOT164 |	Full feature mean you can skip commercials by voice with the TiVo skip mode you can launch apps change channels by name
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,647	| IOT164 |	Amber number
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:39,999	| IOT164 |	Course the regular controls of play resume pause fast forward rewind
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:43,839	| IOT164 |	So that you know this isn't just like turn on the TV this is a bunch of stuff
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:47,423	| IOT164 |	It is and if you would like to spend even more money
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,959	| IOT164 |	I'm connected devices
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,983	| IOT164 |	Arlo Netgear
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,031	| IOT164 |	Smart home brand is
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,311	| IOT164 |	Going into
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,615	| IOT164 |	Security lighting outdoor lighting for the home
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,639	| IOT164 |	So they already make
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:02,783	| IOT164 |	Cameras both wired and wireless cameras for the home and I think they make a baby monitor it's adorable that has little bunny ears
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,807	| IOT164 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:05,087	| IOT164 |	Now they have lights
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,391	| IOT164 |	Also change colors
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,927	| IOT164 |	Holy mackerel
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,463	| IOT164 |	Not Justa Phillips
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:16,863	| IOT164 |	You can now buy outdoor Arlo lights these are security lights so you're probably going to have them on bright white most of the time
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:18,399	| IOT164 |	You know if you're being
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,167	| IOT164 |	You enjoy the stuff
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,703	| IOT164 |	Maybe you do something else
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:24,287	| IOT164 |	So you can buy the system which is
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,335	| IOT164 |	One camera plus a
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,127	| IOT164 |	Little converter Hub thing
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,919	| IOT164 |	It's a bridge or low bridge
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,431	| IOT164 |	If that's
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,271	| IOT164 |	I got a bridge to sell you
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:38,111	| IOT164 |	So yes a bridge 440 999
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,183	| IOT164 |	Or
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,207	| IOT164 |	You can buy two
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,231	| IOT164 |	For 249
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:44,767	| IOT164 |	That's a lot of
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:49,631	| IOT164 |	But this Compares with things like the ring floodlight cam
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,191	| IOT164 |	And I feel like there are other netatmo make
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,263	| IOT164 |	Is a present scam that also has a flood light on top of it
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| IOT164 |	So
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,823	| IOT164 |	More options in the
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,847	| IOT164 |	Lighting the outside of your
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:06,271	| IOT164 |	They're very modern looking I couldn't get this past my HOA here unfortunately who still seems stuck in the 90s
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:11,391	| IOT164 |	I like the looks of them and their wireframing they have rechargeable batteries to it's kind of nice
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,159	| IOT164 |	Yes in
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,951	| IOT164 |	Is there anything like the cameras
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:17,023	| IOT164 |	There's so much fun because I got this magnetic Mount you just like
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| IOT164 |	I'm stuck on this
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:20,863	| IOT164 |	It's
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,655	| IOT164 |	And they work with Madden may as well
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,423	| IOT164 |	Baidu
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,471	| IOT164 |	So in the bridge is a nice touch
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,751	| IOT164 |	Because beforehand
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,311	| IOT164 |	I had for my camera I have a massive
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:34,431	| IOT164 |	Bridge device that is plugged into my router and it's kind of large and cumbersome
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,199	| IOT164 |	So this looks
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:37,503	| IOT164 |	Smaller and cuter
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,039	| IOT164 |	Sadly it does not work
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,831	| IOT164 |	The Netgear routers do not
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,599	| IOT164 |	Interface with this
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,439	| IOT164 |	And now it's time
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,231	| IOT164 |	For another camera
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:55,423	| IOT164 |	Oh that's right yes the wyze cam version 2 I decided to put a camera in the back window of
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,983	| IOT164 |	Are townhouse I already have a front camera
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:03,103	| IOT164 |	With a nest indoor camera behind the window unfortunately I can't put cameras outside so I have to
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,895	| IOT164 |	Do with screens in my windows
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,431	| IOT164 |	That the cameras looks real but it's okay
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,479	| IOT164 |	20 bucks I mean
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:14,367	| IOT164 |	Long story short if you need a camera for 20 bucks you cannot go wrong with the new wyzecam
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:18,464	| IOT164 |	It's very similar to the old one it's got a matte finish on the outside instead of glossy
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:22,048	| IOT164 |	Otherwise it looks the same they upgraded the sensor inside
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:28,960	| IOT164 |	They have also added motion detection tagging so you always had motion detection which would tell the
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:34,080	| IOT164 |	Camera yes capture this video somebody's walking past whatever but now they actually show you in the app
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,104	| IOT164 |	Hernia video
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,384	| IOT164 |	A little yellow
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,152	| IOT164 |	Border
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:42,528	| IOT164 |	Where the motion is because maybe there multiple things moving and you need to know what's at the camera off you can do that
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:49,440	| IOT164 |	I did not test the SD card functionalities cuz I'm out of SD cards but just like the old version of the camera
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:53,280	| IOT164 |	You can keep all of your information local for that
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:57,120	| IOT164 |	Or you can use their Cloud which is actually run on AWS I found out
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,888	| IOT164 |	It's
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:02,496	| IOT164 |	14 days of history for free there's no subscription charge the twenty bucks does it that's it
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:08,896	| IOT164 |	I don't know you tried the original one do you recall if you could daisy-chain multiple ones on a single power cord
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,920	| IOT164 |	I don't think so
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,200	| IOT164 |	Cuz it's got to
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:13,248	| IOT164 |	You daisy chain amount of power
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,784	| IOT164 |	Strip
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| IOT164 |	Can I come together
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,600	| IOT164 |	So what they did but this one
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,648	| IOT164 |	Is they have a micro USB port
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:23,232	| IOT164 |	For the power brick that comes with this you power to the micro USB slot
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:25,792	| IOT164 |	But there's also a full size USB port
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,072	| IOT164 |	And you can daisy chain
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:33,728	| IOT164 |	Through that up to two more cameras so one power cord can power all three cameras over USB
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,032	| IOT164 |	But I only bought once I didn't say that
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:40,896	| IOT164 |	That's actually kind of a neat feature and like you could create a little ring of security
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,408	| IOT164 |	I'll be looking at
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,480	| IOT164 |	Well you can call her ring security.
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| IOT164 |	I couldn't have
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,832	| IOT164 |	Was literally talking about a ring
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,136	| IOT164 |	Security however
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,648	| IOT164 |	There are come
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,256	| IOT164 |	Yay wyzecam
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:23:02,400	| IOT164 |	I really like the camera I think it's a great purchase for anyone who just wants to experiment with what you could do with camera
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:05,216	| IOT164 |	And they actually have added if this then that
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,240	| IOT164 |	Compatibility
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:11,616	| IOT164 |	So yay for that you can now use it till like if it triggers motion it could set off a light or
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,408	| IOT164 |	Alarm or
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,432	| IOT164 |	Something else
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:20,064	| IOT164 |	Whatever you could geofence with your phone and if this then that turn the lights came on when you leave for example
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,952	| IOT164 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,000	| IOT164 |	I look for the good in every product
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,816	| IOT164 |	So you also bought something else
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,608	| IOT164 |	I'd love to hear your thoughts on
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:36,704	| IOT164 |	Yes I bought this
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,728	| IOT164 |	So
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:43,104	| IOT164 |	I bought what you talked about last week or the week before that was the nest X Yale lock
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:46,432	| IOT164 |	I already have a Smart Lock it's a Kwikset Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,480	| IOT164 |	In lovely brass thank-you HOA
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:52,064	| IOT164 |	But the motor was insanely loud on that thing
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:55,136	| IOT164 |	So I decided let me try this nest
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,184	| IOT164 |	Add wow it's like
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:02,048	| IOT164 |	By comparison whisper-quiet it's so much quieter and yes you can hear the motor but it's so much quieter
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:07,424	| IOT164 |	Put another way the Kwikset was so loud that when the girls are watching TV they would pause
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:10,240	| IOT164 |	Weather watching because they couldn't hear the TV while the lock
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,008	| IOT164 |	Motor engaged
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,544	| IOT164 |	No problem now so
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,848	| IOT164 |	I know you had a hardware
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:19,456	| IOT164 |	Bad Hardware I guess multi Hardware Co descenders back you got a new one and twerking
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:24,832	| IOT164 |	I thought I did too because I put it in the door to call 20 minutes
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,624	| IOT164 |	And fired up and it says
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:29,696	| IOT164 |	Press the yellow button to your computer that's locked
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:34,304	| IOT164 |	And I did it and nothing happened on the touchpad
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,096	| IOT164 |	It happened to him miss you
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:43,520	| IOT164 |	Wouldn't know it was a legit issue I guess you could call it installer error I decided let me just make sure the key
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:47,360	| IOT164 |	Cable is fully seated because every one of these locks has a cable from the
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,664	| IOT164 |	Front keypad area to the back
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:56,064	| IOT164 |	Smart Serie the board and sure enough it was angled a little bit so obviously during the installation it came
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,832	| IOT164 |	Conceited
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,600	| IOT164 |	So I
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:04,000	| IOT164 |	Seated it receded it put everything back together and sure enough it works just fine so it's working great the girls are very happy
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:04,768	| IOT164 |	I'm happy
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:05,792	| IOT164 |	It's a beautiful
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| IOT164 |	Even in brass
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:08,608	| IOT164 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,144	| IOT164 |	I guess I am bitter about that
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,960	| IOT164 |	Yeah it's really really nice it's very sleek
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:18,848	| IOT164 |	It's much nicer than in the Kwikset that I had and I feel like it's a little more robust of a lock as well
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| IOT164 |	Yes that's it there higher-quality
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:25,760	| IOT164 |	Yes and I checked just for you guys who are like
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:29,088	| IOT164 |	Stacy it was that what happened to you I did check the cable see
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,392	| IOT164 |	The connection between my cable
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,416	| IOT164 |	3 *
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:38,304	| IOT164 |	I will note that when you're installing it should you buy this and install it it's not a crazy error to get because
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,352	| IOT164 |	Putting the cable into the lake
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,888	| IOT164 |	Like wire guys that they have
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,168	| IOT164 |	It's a little thick in it
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,192	| IOT164 |	Requires a little
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:48,032	| IOT164 |	Nothing around very easy for the cable to become a little bit
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,824	| IOT164 |	Disconnect it so you have to watch that when you're
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:55,712	| IOT164 |	Yep but it was an easy fix and I didn't have in the past the nest connect
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:02,112	| IOT164 |	Now you got that included with it because for two I thinks 27999 for the lock with the Kinect
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,416	| IOT164 |	It's 249 99 if you already have a Kinect
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:11,328	| IOT164 |	And I'm not a fan of hugs and bridges new extra ones anyway but this is unlike anything else that I have because it looks like a
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:17,728	| IOT164 |	Small module you just plug into an outlet in your nest products and it didn't even need to be plugged in for me to configure to my
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,240	| IOT164 |	My Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,288	| IOT164 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:23,616	| IOT164 |	It's very nice I like it I like it alot so
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:27,968	| IOT164 |	I was also excited the very day I installed this that Yale announced
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,784	| IOT164 |	Support for Madame a voice unlocking
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:37,184	| IOT164 |	For their locks you could already lock your door with matinee on the Alaskan now you can also unlock and when you do that
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:37,952	| IOT164 |	Ask for you to
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:39,232	| IOT164 |	Recite your PIN code
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:42,048	| IOT164 |	So that way somebody can just shout hey unlock the door and let themselves in
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:47,424	| IOT164 |	But then my enthusiasm was temper because this is not for the nest which actually thought it was
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:49,472	| IOT164 |	It's only for their Usher locks
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,496	| IOT164 |	Oanda
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,032	| IOT164 |	Schlage also
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,568	| IOT164 |	I want to say last week or the week
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,336	| IOT164 |	The four
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:56,384	| IOT164 |	Also announced unlock features
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,152	| IOT164 |	4
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:57,920	| IOT164 |	Bear
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,432	| IOT164 |	Connect
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| IOT164 |	Incense

EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,248	| IOT164 |	So
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,552	| IOT164 |	Through anime
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:07,136	| IOT164 |	So same thing that you got out of pain and actually if you miss
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:09,440	| IOT164 |	State the pin more than three times its
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,208	| IOT164 |	Locks you out
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,256	| IOT164 |	So there you go

EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:49,344	| IOT164 |	Recognizing machineq has
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:52,416	| IOT164 |	Many many different Services were being built upon this platform
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:54,720	| IOT164 |	Rather than having a bespoke
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:31:01,120	| IOT164 |	RFP we're going to a contract manufacturer to help them out with their new use case they look to us in our portfolio of
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:03,168	| IOT164 |	Solutions that we can provide
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,728	| IOT164 |	XYZ as well
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:08,544	| IOT164 |	And as we continue to discuss on the show
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,592	| IOT164 |	Once they have this connectivity
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:14,688	| IOT164 |	That really enables them to do a lot more with their business can you give us an example of that
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,456	| IOT164 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:18,016	| IOT164 |	Pansophic is one of our solution providers
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:20,320	| IOT164 |	Who purchased connectivity from Comcast
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:23,392	| IOT164 |	What are there any Zara customers the New York Housing Authority
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:26,976	| IOT164 |	Has been deployed the pansophic solution using a machine to network
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,768	| IOT164 |	Pansophic first installed
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:32,608	| IOT164 |	The empty flash device for machineq which is a multi-use device
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,144	| IOT164 |	Current temperature humidity
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,168	| IOT164 |	Vibration
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,960	| IOT164 |	And other monitoring capabilities
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:39,776	| IOT164 |	The begin monitoring temperature humidity first
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:44,896	| IOT164 |	Dinosaurs adding air sensors to detect mold then they started adding Leak Detection sensors
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:49,504	| IOT164 |	Throughout the building as well we often find customers starting with one particular need
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:53,344	| IOT164 |	I've been learning on additional sensors and services as they grow
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:57,696	| IOT164 |	Most of our solution providers are certain single-threaded and they go in and
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:01,536	| IOT164 |	Their end users ultimately one thing they've identified as a hero use case
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:05,888	| IOT164 |	So we say what's a temperature and humidity detection is East case number one
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,936	| IOT164 |	Once they're in there with our connectivity
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,472	| IOT164 |	Viennese are my comeback
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,240	| IOT164 |	2 then
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:15,616	| IOT164 |	Bose the landlord and say by the way I also need something for Pest Control to my building and it goes from there
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,944	| IOT164 |	Excellent alright Alex where can I go to find out more
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,456	| IOT164 |	About machine
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,528	| IOT164 |	Start of our website machineq. Com
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:25,344	| IOT164 |	Play some great white papers there including our latest on dense Network
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,880	| IOT164 |	In addition to that we
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:30,720	| IOT164 |	Tactical business conversion guides and network coverage details well
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:45,824	| IOT164 |	Welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is Chris Meyer who is head
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:48,384	| IOT164 |	Developer experience atmosphere
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,152	| IOT164 |	Robotics
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,664	| IOT164 |	Hi Chris
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,456	| IOT164 |	Hey Stacy going to be here
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,992	| IOT164 |	So you guys are on the show
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:55,296	| IOT164 |	Settle cabins in my debate
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,576	| IOT164 |	Over robots in the Smart House
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,368	| IOT164 |	That's not true although you
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,392	| IOT164 |	Totally way it
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:02,208	| IOT164 |	Isaiah robot without arms
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:04,000	| IOT164 |	He wants to camera that he can talk to
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:04,512	| IOT164 |	Juvia
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,096	| IOT164 |	The framing of the debate
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:10,912	| IOT164 |	So what we're going to do first is have you talked to
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:12,192	| IOT164 |	What is Misty
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:16,032	| IOT164 |	Misty is our attempt to try to democratize
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,824	| IOT164 |	Robotics so we realized that
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:18,592	| IOT164 |	Robotics
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,872	| IOT164 |	Industry is still
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,432	| IOT164 |	So we're trying to give
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:24,224	| IOT164 |	People a robot that is sensory
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:29,344	| IOT164 |	Okay now you guys just launched the Misty there's a Kickstarter
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,624	| IOT164 |	I'll put that in
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:31,648	| IOT164 |	You guys
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,952	| IOT164 |	Give us the parameters of what is
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,024	| IOT164 |	What kind of robot
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:37,792	| IOT164 |	Talking about
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:42,144	| IOT164 |	Got it so Misty is a you know like I said sensor Rich robot that we're trying
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:44,448	| IOT164 |	Work so you don't have to No Control
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,472	| IOT164 |	Mechanical
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:51,104	| IOT164 |	So it's programmable via JavaScript and python
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,640	| IOT164 |	How would you describe me
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:53,920	| IOT164 |	She's cute
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:54,944	| IOT164 |	She's round
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,968	| IOT164 |	No hard edges
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,760	| IOT164 |	She has a track drive system and
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:00,320	| IOT164 |	3 degrees of freedom in the neck so I can do that
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,856	| IOT164 |	The role that had songs
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,624	| IOT164 |	Is really sweet really cute
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,184	| IOT164 |	And then a 4in
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:05,952	| IOT164 |	Orange LCD
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:06,976	| IOT164 |	Verizon
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:10,304	| IOT164 |	She looks kind of like Wall-E
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:10,816	| IOT164 |	With a little
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,400	| IOT164 |	Runs around
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:15,936	| IOT164 |	Tank treads
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,728	| IOT164 |	And
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:20,288	| IOT164 |	I think our actual spec is
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,824	| IOT164 |	27 meters per second to a fast
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:25,152	| IOT164 |	Okay in the vision is that this robot is
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,176	| IOT164 |	Roaming around
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,712	| IOT164 |	Holmes and maybe small office
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,480	| IOT164 |	Doing what
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:31,552	| IOT164 |	Well that's why we're trying to enable people to figure out
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,112	| IOT164 |	Everybody uses a computer differently than we know that every
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,648	| IOT164 |	Nobody's going to use and then wrap the robot different
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:40,000	| IOT164 |	So one of the things that I use mine for is it a wait in the foyer
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,536	| IOT164 |	If it recognizes myself
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,560	| IOT164 |	Or my wife
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,328	| IOT164 |	First
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,376	| IOT164 |	Then it'll play my Spotify playlist
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| IOT164 |	But if she's there first
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:46,912	| IOT164 |	Play her Pandora
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:50,752	| IOT164 |	Goose I'd like a race to get in your front door that's exactly what
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:52,032	| IOT164 |	But it is trying to get off work early
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:56,384	| IOT164 |	Nice we have that in my house but it's for the air conditioning
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,408	| IOT164 |	Cold pack
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,200	| IOT164 |	So they're going a lot of
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:03,040	| IOT164 |	Smart home robotics
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,064	| IOT164 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:06,112	| IOT164 |	So what did you guys learn
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,136	| IOT164 |	From head of the previous
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:09,184	| IOT164 |	Experience at small things and I think somebody has
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:09,952	| IOT164 |	Spiro
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,000	| IOT164 |	That you're taking into this project
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,560	| IOT164 |	I know when the smart thing side
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:18,400	| IOT164 |	Trying to do something just developer focus and kind of
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,424	| IOT164 |	Programmable
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,192	| IOT164 |	You
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,520	| IOT164 |	Have a hard time putting that towards the consumer Market upfront
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| IOT164 |	With maintaining the program
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:28,128	| IOT164 |	So with Missy what we're trying to do is really focus on
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,408	| IOT164 |	Developers and makers
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,688	| IOT164 |	A programmer's especially
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:31,968	| IOT164 |	For them first
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,528	| IOT164 |	When we figure out what those consumer applications are there
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:35,552	| IOT164 |	How did Misty
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,344	| IOT164 |	More consumer-friendly
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:40,160	| IOT164 |	Got it so guys this is not necessarily
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:40,928	| IOT164 |	The robot
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,440	| IOT164 |	You want to get to your
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,976	| IOT164 |	But it hasn't
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:45,024	| IOT164 |	Cool stuff so they showed me the robot it's got like a
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:47,840	| IOT164 |	This little backpack areas are in the back
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:48,608	| IOT164 |	Can load all kinds of stuff
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:53,216	| IOT164 |	You're talking actually about an Arduino and what are some things you hope
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,496	| IOT164 |	People try to do with this
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,032	| IOT164 |	Yashow because it's focused on
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:56,800	| IOT164 |	Program
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:57,824	| IOT164 |	The hardware store
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,408	| IOT164 |	So we haven't
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,176	| IOT164 |	Arduino backpack
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:02,944	| IOT164 |	It plugs in
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,456	| IOT164 |	To the back of the
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:08,064	| IOT164 |	And we also have open source connectors for the arms and antenna
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:09,600	| IOT164 |	AdSense
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,440	| IOT164 |	Route that all through your Arduino arrest
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,208	| IOT164 |	Berry pie
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:14,976	| IOT164 |	To make it accessible
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:18,304	| IOT164 |	If I want to add a barometric sensor
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,328	| IOT164 |	That was run
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:21,888	| IOT164 |	Through my Arduino and then take barometric sensor readings around
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,728	| IOT164 |	Hayden Ponder why you would want to be
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:27,520	| IOT164 |	Around your house by
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,824	| IOT164 |	12v temperature would be a better
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,360	| IOT164 |	Kids having a heat map of
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:33,152	| IOT164 |	Why my bedroom is always cold
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,432	| IOT164 |	Is a little bit more interesting
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:35,456	| IOT164 |	The barometric pressure
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,272	| IOT164 |	Got it okay this does make more sense
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,064	| IOT164 |	So
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,856	| IOT164 |	Let's talk about robots in general
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:43,648	| IOT164 |	Cuz we seen a lot of activity right now
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,184	| IOT164 |	Not just right now
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:47,232	| IOT164 |	Over the last few years in robots
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,768	| IOT164 |	You talked about it being
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,280	| IOT164 |	In its infancy
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:50,816	| IOT164 |	What do you mean by
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:53,632	| IOT164 |	We've been trying to crack robotics for
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,424	| IOT164 |	40 50 60 years
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,984	| IOT164 |	And there hasn't been a
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,752	| IOT164 |	Real
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,520	| IOT164 |	Application
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,800	| IOT164 |	In the home or office
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,896	| IOT164 |	Utility base or single-purpose
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:08,736	| IOT164 |	But the problem is robotics today is people are continually building robots for a single purpose
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,040	| IOT164 |	Set the draw the parallel between
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,832	| IOT164 |	Computers in the 70s and 80s
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,624	| IOT164 |	People were in the garage is Belen
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,392	| IOT164 |	Computers
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:18,208	| IOT164 |	Opticians I can build a computer chips
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,000	| IOT164 |	This is where robotics
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:20,512	| IOT164 |	Is today that's why
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:23,328	| IOT164 |	What we saw with personal
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,608	| IOT164 |	Computers is once physical
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,888	| IOT164 |	Was invented
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:26,656	| IOT164 |	Then people started to have
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,192	| IOT164 |	Real use in
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,472	| IOT164 |	Office for
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,496	| IOT164 |	Cheaters you started
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,776	| IOT164 |	To see that awkward escalation
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,544	| IOT164 |	Adoption
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,824	| IOT164 |	So what we're trying to do
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,872	| IOT164 |	Do is make those things accessible
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:36,896	| IOT164 |	Thinking about what they
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,736	| IOT164 |	But instead of worrying about control system
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:43,552	| IOT164 |	Charging
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:44,832	| IOT164 |	That
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,600	| IOT164 |	If those things are
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,112	| IOT164 |	Given
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,392	| IOT164 |	What do I do with it
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,160	| IOT164 |	Indeed
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,928	| IOT164 |	What do I do with
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,488	| IOT164 |	Hands versus roaming 2
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,024	| IOT164 |	So where do you fall in Ark
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:55,584	| IOT164 |	Physical manipulation of objects is a
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,656	| IOT164 |	No problem so obviously is in
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,680	| IOT164 |	Robotics company
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,704	| IOT164 |	Do you want to bite off of
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:01,728	| IOT164 |	We can swallow
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:05,568	| IOT164 |	So we made a deliberate effort to say okay let's not
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,080	| IOT164 |	Tackle physics
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,128	| IOT164 |	Frontlets start
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| IOT164 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,456	| IOT164 |	How do you change the recipe
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,224	| IOT164 |	When you have something
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:12,992	| IOT164 |	It's physical
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:13,504	| IOT164 |	It's mobile
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,344	| IOT164 |	The same way that when your programming
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,112	| IOT164 |	Computer there's different
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| IOT164 |	Do you consider when you programming
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT164 |	Mobile device
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,464	| IOT164 |	So those learnings with
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:22,976	| IOT164 |	Physicality
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,536	| IOT164 |	Duration of
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,328	| IOT164 |	Robotics so we want to start there
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,864	| IOT164 |	And then we have the ability
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:32,448	| IOT164 |	Grab things and say like hey that's a Red Bull can or that's no a balloon
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,216	| IOT164 |	That I can move those
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,520	| IOT164 |	That'll enhance
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,032	| IOT164 |	We've already latex
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:37,824	| IOT164 |	Okay so I should
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:40,128	| IOT164 |	Just give up for another 10 years on the robot
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,968	| IOT164 |	Well I mean there's laundry
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,784	| IOT164 |	Right right I'm not spending that kind of money for a single purpose
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:49,600	| IOT164 |	62 hours to full
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:50,368	| IOT164 |	Cycling shirts
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:51,904	| IOT164 |	Whatever their actual
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:55,488	| IOT164 |	True Okay so
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,024	| IOT164 |	Let's talk about some of the competition
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:57,792	| IOT164 |	Because we've had
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:38:59,328	| IOT164 |	Geebo
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:00,096	| IOT164 |	Is the most famous
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,864	| IOT164 |	There's also
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:01,632	| IOT164 |	Curry
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,400	| IOT164 |	Now
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:04,192	| IOT164 |	Random robots running around
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,240	| IOT164 |	Do you think what happened with Jibo
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,520	| IOT164 |	It's going to hurt the market for what
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:08,800	| IOT164 |	Find offer
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:12,384	| IOT164 |	Is kind of a double-edged sword on one hand it's very clear that the
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:12,896	| IOT164 |	People wants
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:15,200	| IOT164 |	Robots in some sense I mean a raise
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,736	| IOT164 |	I have to go there actual dollar value was
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,040	| IOT164 |	It was a lot it was a lot
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:20,320	| IOT164 |	And then you know
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:21,344	| IOT164 |	3 years delayed
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,112	| IOT164 |	In the things that were
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,624	| IOT164 |	Kickstarter video
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,928	| IOT164 |	We are really hopeful to get to that point where
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:25,696	| IOT164 |	Everything
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,208	| IOT164 |	It was shown
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,488	| IOT164 |	Is possible
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,536	| IOT164 |	And what we realize with robotics
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,072	| IOT164 |	This is not a linear complexity
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,840	| IOT164 |	Scale
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,864	| IOT164 |	You can't add
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,632	| IOT164 |	Movement in
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:35,936	| IOT164 |	Physicality and then all these other subsystems
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:36,960	| IOT164 |	How to be like
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,752	| IOT164 |	3 *
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,264	| IOT164 |	More complicated
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:41,568	| IOT164 |	But it's actually
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:42,848	| IOT164 |	Factorial
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,944	| IOT164 |	We're very glad that she was in the space we love
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:48,992	| IOT164 |	But people
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:50,784	| IOT164 |	Call about some of the promises
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:52,832	| IOT164 |	Robotics Army
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:57,696	| IOT164 |	Yes so you guys speaking of promises you're doing the kickstarter and
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:58,720	| IOT164 |	You expect to ship some
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:39:59,744	| IOT164 |	December
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,792	| IOT164 |	And it's not text
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,072	| IOT164 |	Kickstarter
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,352	| IOT164 |	It is a crowd
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,888	| IOT164 |	Campaign but we're going to
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,168	| IOT164 |	Build it regardless
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,960	| IOT164 |	I'm already hit our goal so
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:12,544	| IOT164 |	So let's talk about designing a robot
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,568	| IOT164 |	And the types of things
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,336	| IOT164 |	State you put in
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,896	| IOT164 |	Like you said before it's cute
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| IOT164 |	Its or maybe ice
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,432	| IOT164 |	That is adorable
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,504	| IOT164 |	When
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,016	| IOT164 |	Designing it
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:24,064	| IOT164 |	How much do cuteness matter
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,112	| IOT164 |	Personality
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:29,184	| IOT164 |	So we realized it personality is
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,464	| IOT164 |	The long tail
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:32,256	| IOT164 |	When you start to have something that
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:33,024	| IOT164 |	People engage with
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,048	| IOT164 |	And meaningful in Rockwood
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,072	| IOT164 |	Has some of that
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:36,096	| IOT164 |	Characteristics
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:36,864	| IOT164 |	It really make it lovable
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:38,400	| IOT164 |	But that's going to be one of the
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,448	| IOT164 |	Sequel to the robot
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:41,984	| IOT164 |	In the short-term
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,288	| IOT164 |	It's really about programmability and getting
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,336	| IOT164 |	And itself to work and function
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,896	| IOT164 |	Auntie very difficult environment
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,664	| IOT164 |	Office
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,944	| IOT164 |	So when we came
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:52,480	| IOT164 |	The design we wanted to enable some
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,760	| IOT164 |	Flexibility and experimentation
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:58,368	| IOT164 |	And then figure out what are those elements
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,136	| IOT164 |	Apps that make it
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,160	| IOT164 |	Cute personal
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,184	| IOT164 |	Personality
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:04,768	| IOT164 |	Heavily and was
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,536	| IOT164 |	We have three degrees of
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,096	| IOT164 |	So instead of just
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:10,912	| IOT164 |	You know up down left right we also have roll that is
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,424	| IOT164 |	Spaetzle
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,448	| IOT164 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,984	| IOT164 |	Is that your psychic
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,288	| IOT164 |	Yeah yeah absolute
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:19,104	| IOT164 |	And so this is such a powerful
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:19,872	| IOT164 |	Motives
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,384	| IOT164 |	Capability
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:21,664	| IOT164 |	And then
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:23,200	| IOT164 |	We put the with the screen
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,736	| IOT164 |	Behind a lens
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,760	| IOT164 |	Because we didn't want
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:26,528	| IOT164 |	What we call tablet
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:28,064	| IOT164 |	We don't want it to look like
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,368	| IOT164 |	Droid phone
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:32,416	| IOT164 |	Inside the robot that that adds like a
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:32,928	| IOT164 |	Another layer of
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:34,464	| IOT164 |	Not so much mystery
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:34,976	| IOT164 |	Butt personality
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:38,816	| IOT164 |	Tell me a cross
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,840	| IOT164 |	Uncanny valley or
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:41,632	| IOT164 |	Live on the other side of it in a cute way
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:44,704	| IOT164 |	What about
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:45,728	| IOT164 |	The nail room
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:46,752	| IOT164 |	Trauma
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:50,080	| IOT164 |	Did SoftBank ESV Alderaan Alder body
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:53,151	| IOT164 |	Pepper robot
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:54,175	| IOT164 |	Danny very much so
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:54,943	| IOT164 |	Misty
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:55,967	| IOT164 |	And its eyes
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,247	| IOT164 |	The fact that it was aimed at develop
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:57,759	| IOT164 |	Clippers
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,551	| IOT164 |	Are you guys
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,063	| IOT164 |	Competitive
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,367	| IOT164 |	I mean it's a different price
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,647	| IOT164 |	If I recall
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:05,695	| IOT164 |	When you have to fill out the application to get it
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:07,231	| IOT164 |	And I believe there
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:07,999	| IOT164 |	The more than seven
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,351	| IOT164 |	And it's just it's just different it's multi-joint
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:13,631	| IOT164 |	Scott legs
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:14,143	| IOT164 |	Scott fingers
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,935	| IOT164 |	It has the arms I'm
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,727	| IOT164 |	Yes button
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:18,495	| IOT164 |	Doesn't pick things up
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,055	| IOT164 |	It does the Macarena
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:22,079	| IOT164 |	Had it very true
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,383	| IOT164 |	But it doesn't have I mean the differences
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,919	| IOT164 |	Crosses doesn't have expressive eyes
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,711	| IOT164 |	It is leg day
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,503	| IOT164 |	They use a proprietary system
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:30,783	| IOT164 |	Choreograph
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:31,551	| IOT164 |	Which
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:32,063	| IOT164 |	Is a little bit
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,111	| IOT164 |	I'll leave it that
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:36,927	| IOT164 |	We talked about earlier was that
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:38,975	| IOT164 |	Programming a robot is not what people like
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:41,023	| IOT164 |	So if I like bought this
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:44,351	| IOT164 |	Versus like maybe another robot what was that experience
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,119	| IOT164 |	Be like
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,423	| IOT164 |	My role is that the head of developer
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:50,239	| IOT164 |	Experience so I'm trying to mitigate that cognitive dissonance
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:52,799	| IOT164 |	The way that you expect the programmer
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:57,151	| IOT164 |	So Misty's Bergamo via JavaScript
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:57,919	| IOT164 |	Python
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:58,431	| IOT164 |	So
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:01,247	| IOT164 |	And anybody that can build a website should be able to
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:03,551	| IOT164 |	So you can do things
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,111	| IOT164 |	Go to the
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,135	| IOT164 |	The kitchen
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,415	| IOT164 |	Name XY location
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:10,719	| IOT164 |	Go there now
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:12,767	| IOT164 |	The
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:14,047	| IOT164 |	What do I do if I encounter an obstacle
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,327	| IOT164 |	What happened
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:16,351	| IOT164 |	And if I hear loud noise
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,375	| IOT164 |	I can stop
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:20,703	| IOT164 |	Or trying to make it as easy as possible
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,727	| IOT164 |	For anybody
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:24,543	| IOT164 |	Be able to do the things that you want to do without worrying about
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:25,311	| IOT164 |	Lower level
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:26,335	| IOT164 |	Programming
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,383	| IOT164 |	What is it lower level programming
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:31,711	| IOT164 |	For let's say that we take it out another Wheels
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:33,503	| IOT164 |	If I wanted to say go to the
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,039	| IOT164 |	What I have to do
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,599	| IOT164 |	Without the subsystems I would have to
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,623	| IOT164 |	Generate a map
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:39,135	| IOT164 |	Do the path
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:40,671	| IOT164 |	And then go down to
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,183	| IOT164 |	Low level of
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:45,279	| IOT164 |	Drive my Motors in a certain way to turn left turn right
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:45,791	| IOT164 |	Avoid
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:47,839	| IOT164 |	Build the entire system around
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:49,887	| IOT164 |	To where
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,191	| IOT164 |	For you
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,495	| IOT164 |	So you can operate at the high level
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,263	| IOT164 |	Go to Kitchen
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,567	| IOT164 |	Without having to do all the stuff down
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:43:59,103	| IOT164 |	Do you like easy
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:43:59,871	| IOT164 |	Simplicity
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:01,407	| IOT164 |	Okay so
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,431	| IOT164 |	I have to ask you
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:03,711	| IOT164 |	Throughout this because
EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:04,223	| IOT164 |	Apparently
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:06,783	| IOT164 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:09,599	| IOT164 |	I have to ask you because we had a conversation about
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,367	| IOT164 |	Party
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:10,879	| IOT164 |	And flatulence
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:12,159	| IOT164 |	And robots
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:12,927	| IOT164 |	So
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:13,951	| IOT164 |	Why do robots fart
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:17,279	| IOT164 |	Which is one of the things that makes robots
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,559	| IOT164 |	Extremely personal
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,327	| IOT164 |	Very very
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:22,143	| IOT164 |	It's one of the things that the biological function
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,471	| IOT164 |	Unexpected
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:25,983	| IOT164 |	Lititz
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:27,263	| IOT164 |	Really kind of funny
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,287	| IOT164 |	I think it's one of the things that
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:29,823	| IOT164 |	Eagle
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:31,615	| IOT164 |	When you know the whole concept
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:32,383	| IOT164 |	The robot
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:34,175	| IOT164 |	The room waiting until you see an individual
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:34,687	| IOT164 |	You'll make an apartment
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:36,479	| IOT164 |	Leaving the room I think it's just
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:37,503	| IOT164 |	Juvenile
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:39,551	| IOT164 |	I would
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:41,855	| IOT164 |	You're right okay and because kids finest
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:44,159	| IOT164 |	Let's talk about kids
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:44,671	| IOT164 |	Robotics
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:46,463	| IOT164 |	It feels like we're in this
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,999	| IOT164 |	Weird like
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:51,327	| IOT164 |	What do we do how do we train them how to be around the robot so
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,351	| IOT164 |	What are your thoughts there I don't know
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:53,887	| IOT164 |	I have a 2 year old
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:56,959	| IOT164 |	Yes I mean I personally think
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:57,471	| IOT164 |	The robots are going
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,007	| IOT164 |	A very powerful
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,287	| IOT164 |	Driver for
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:02,079	| IOT164 |	People to live the life they
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,895	| IOT164 |	Encouraging Behavior
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:06,431	| IOT164 |	Moderated making
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,711	| IOT164 |	Do your own awareness of how
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:08,479	| IOT164 |	You live your life
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:09,247	| IOT164 |	And then
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:09,759	| IOT164 |	Being used
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:12,319	| IOT164 |	So when it comes to kids getting them
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:13,087	| IOT164 |	Familiar with it
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:13,599	| IOT164 |	And then
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:14,879	| IOT164 |	How they work
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,415	| IOT164 |	Is going to be really
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| IOT164 |	What's the standard equation
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,255	| IOT164 |	The program ability
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:21,279	| IOT164 |	How to program
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:25,119	| IOT164 |	Kids just behaving like total jerks
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:28,191	| IOT164 |	And I don't know if your 2 year old is
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,983	| IOT164 |	I'm sure he is a very nice person
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:30,751	| IOT164 |	But
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:31,775	| IOT164 |	How does he react
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:32,287	| IOT164 |	Your robot
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,335	| IOT164 |	Is he getting to the point where he's
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,359	| IOT164 |	Using a door
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,383	| IOT164 |	Taking it for granted
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,943	| IOT164 |	Speak one of his first words exactly
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,479	| IOT164 |	Robot so maybe I'm an outlier in a lot of
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,783	| IOT164 |	It's more curiosity
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,575	| IOT164 |	I know that every time that is sitting on and
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:46,111	| IOT164 |	Messing with the Devil
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:46,623	| IOT164 |	Wave at it
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:47,903	| IOT164 |	Which is really adorable
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:49,951	| IOT164 |	It does
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:54,559	| IOT164 |	He hasn't my son hasn't been to
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,375	| IOT164 |	I think in scenarios where there's
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:57,887	| IOT164 |	Groups of people
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:01,215	| IOT164 |	That there's going to be you know more about abuse
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:02,751	| IOT164 |	You know you see the night sky in summer
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:06,079	| IOT164 |	Stuff like that
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,359	| IOT164 |	I think we're hoping is it summer
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:07,871	| IOT164 |	The personality
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,663	| IOT164 |	Will come through and see where it's like
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,943	| IOT164 |	If you kick it we have it
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:11,455	| IOT164 |	We have an IMU
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:14,527	| IOT164 |	Detect when it's being Joselyn
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,063	| IOT164 |	React
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:17,599	| IOT164 |	Like out
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:18,623	| IOT164 |	I whip my heart might break
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:19,391	| IOT164 |	It's like
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,159	| IOT164 |	IRobot
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,719	| IOT164 |	Just like my dog
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:24,511	| IOT164 |	Okay so I think this robot
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,327	| IOT164 |	Cat roaming around my home
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:30,655	| IOT164 |	But is that the wrong way to think about that or is that how you'd like to
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:36,287	| IOT164 |	I mean that's kind of a difficult question because it depends on how you expect interact
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,591	| IOT164 |	I like the idea of having some
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:40,383	| IOT164 |	In the Bronx around be like hey Missy did I leave my
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,431	| IOT164 |	David on her like he misses my dog
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,991	| IOT164 |	That element of hellofresh
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:47,807	| IOT164 |	Fascinating but I know
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:48,575	| IOT164 |	People that have
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:49,087	| IOT164 |	Large families
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:51,391	| IOT164 |	Did the last they want another thing
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:54,463	| IOT164 |	Quiet
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,231	| IOT164 |	Might be
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:55,999	| IOT164 |	More desirable to them
EDL	00:46:56,511	00:46:59,839	| IOT164 |	Good cheap setting okay anything else you want to tell us about
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,119	| IOT164 |	We got two weeks left
