EDL	00:00:18,944	00:00:19,712	| IOT103 |	Are you today
EDL	00:00:19,712	00:00:20,224	| IOT103 |	First off
EDL	00:00:20,736	00:00:21,760	| IOT103 |	We should say that
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:22,784	| IOT103 |	Hey welcome back
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:24,064	| IOT103 |	Good to be back
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:26,368	| IOT103 |	Rite Aid
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,160	| IOT103 |	A run for your money
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:29,440	| IOT103 |	I heard that
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:29,952	| IOT103 |	I heard that
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:37,376	| IOT103 |	First off Kevin's back today and we have
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,144	| IOT103 |	We can talk about
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,936	| IOT103 |	Cool uses for
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:40,960	| IOT103 |	Lighter
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:42,496	| IOT103 |	Rings
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:43,520	| IOT103 |	Security
EDL	00:00:44,032	00:00:45,824	| IOT103 |	Roomba
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:49,664	| IOT103 |	Iot design Manifesto I learned about at South by Southwest
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:01:00,416	| IOT103 |	You're going to enjoy it and I still can't get my SmartThings and Lutron integration to work
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:05,536	| IOT103 |	We'll have a message from our sponsor Samsung
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:10,912	| IOT103 |	And our guest this week is concerned who is with Hogan Lovells
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:11,680	| IOT103 |	Oh Law Firm
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:13,728	| IOT103 |	And she specializes in
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:16,032	| IOT103 |	Class action suit can we talk about
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:18,592	| IOT103 |	What the iot is going to do
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:21,152	| IOT103 |	For class action lawsuits and
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:23,712	| IOT103 |	Product liability and deceptive trade practices
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:25,248	| IOT103 |	She actually taught me a lot
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,296	| IOT103 |	Before we get
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,392	| IOT103 |	Another one of our sponsors
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,184	| IOT103 |	SSO
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:40,352	| IOT103 |	The world's top three automakers use wolf SSL to secure their vehicles and they aren't alone
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:46,752	| IOT103 |	Wolf SSL secure is 2 billion connections across a multitude of iot devices including Automotive
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:53,152	| IOT103 |	Connected home industrial military and medical devices with the Mirai botnet in the girl
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:59,552	| IOT103 |	Rolling threat of ransomware attacks on the Internet of Things companies have to pay attention to security or wrist litigation
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:05,952	| IOT103 |	Bad PR and their brand value securing the iot is hard but wolf SSL has he
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:08,512	| IOT103 |	Sperian specialized expertise to help
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:12,352	| IOT103 |	Shouldn't you be using both SSL to find out more
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:18,752	| IOT103 |	Visit wolf ssl.com and yes you probably
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:23,360	| IOT103 |	You should be using SSL because as we learned later in Today Show security is a big part of
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,640	| IOT103 |	Risk
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,152	| IOT103 |	Management
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,224	| IOT103 |	All right
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:29,504	| IOT103 |	Kevin
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,040	| IOT103 |	Stacy
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,856	| IOT103 |	Let's just get started with Intel
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,880	| IOT103 |	15
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:38,720	| IOT103 |	Three billion dollar acquisition of mobileye
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:45,120	| IOT103 |	That's huge well I mean not as Huges other Acquisitions until has made but I didn't
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:47,680	| IOT103 |	Not see this one coming and for those who are not familiar
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,496	| IOT103 |	Mobileye is in is really based
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:54,592	| IOT103 |	Company that started back in 1999 and
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:57,664	| IOT103 |	Their technology Powers a large percentage of
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:01,248	| IOT103 |	SA
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| IOT103 |	Vehicles
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,856	| IOT103 |	That's what was using them for quite a while if I recall correctly
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,904	| IOT103 |	Yeah and then I know other automakers are
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,720	| IOT103 |	Are also using mobileye for their
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:16,352	| IOT103 |	Self-driving efforts but yeah
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:16,864	| IOT103 |	Deal
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:21,472	| IOT103 |	It was $63.54 per share
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:26,080	| IOT103 |	Which was a 33% premium to the prior day closing price for mobileye
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:31,456	| IOT103 |	That is up a chunk of their short-term cash they see you and I were looking at until
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,992	| IOT103 |	Recent balance sheet
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:37,088	| IOT103 |	Just before the show minutes it's almost like all of it
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,112	| IOT103 |	I think was 17
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,624	| IOT103 |	2.1 billion
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| IOT103 |	Are cash and short term
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,232	| IOT103 |	That's not to say they can't raise me
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:43,744	| IOT103 |	More cash they can
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| IOT103 |	We sell a lot
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:47,840	| IOT103 |	Or chips
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,608	| IOT103 |	But it's a big deal
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,168	| IOT103 |	Tide like
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:54,496	| IOT103 |	It's actually almost as big as their recent acquisition about Tara
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,288	| IOT103 |	Which was about
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,824	| IOT103 |	Two years ago that they announce the
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,104	| IOT103 |	Still I think it closed last year
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,920	| IOT103 |	And this was Intel spending 16
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,968	| IOT103 |	7 billion dollars
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,504	| IOT103 |	Company that makes
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,784	| IOT103 |	Programmable
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,296	| IOT103 |	Chips
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,344	| IOT103 |	So I'll tear with an F
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,672	| IOT103 |	So you guys might be looking at this
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,232	| IOT103 |	Hey Intel has just bought
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,256	| IOT103 |	Mobil ISO
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,303	| IOT103 |	Computer vision for cars
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:22,143	| IOT103 |	Then they also bought a company called movidius which was computer vision
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,911	| IOT103 |	On battery power device
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,727	| IOT103 |	And prior to that
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,543	| IOT103 |	Nervana systems which was all about AI
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:33,663	| IOT103 |	And there's a company making an AI chip but also an AI kind of software-as-a-service layer
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:39,039	| IOT103 |	And then I'll Tara so what's happening here is Intel is really try this time around 2
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| IOT103 |	Get ahead of where it thinks
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,599	| IOT103 |	Computing is going
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| IOT103 |	Can I just say
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| IOT103 |	Spending a lot to get there but
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,767	| IOT103 |	I want that again I will never bet against it
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,607	| IOT103 |	Cuz they have money and they have
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| IOT103 |	Know-how and
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,703	| IOT103 |	Brian krzanich the current CEO is just like
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,007	| IOT103 |	For a long time until was hobbled by a
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,055	| IOT103 |	It's dedication to x86
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,567	| IOT103 |	Picture witches
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,407	| IOT103 |	And now they're like
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:05,919	| IOT103 |	You know what
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,199	| IOT103 |	It's in the past
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,063	| IOT103 |	And when you say Havel they mean
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,367	| IOT103 |	It was always up for a large
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,671	| IOT103 |	Curative time until was focusing on
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,719	| IOT103 |	Processing speed and Power
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,023	| IOT103 |	Just at the time when we were looking at
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,815	| IOT103 |	Chip efficiency
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,839	| IOT103 |	Hence the rise of
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:26,143	| IOT103 |	Arm architecture and mobile devices which
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,959	| IOT103 |	Sure power is great in your performance
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:33,055	| IOT103 |	Empower a great but you need to be efficient because everything's battery-powered so
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,847	| IOT103 |	We kind of lost out in a large
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,639	| IOT103 |	Way on mobile
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,151	| IOT103 |	So far
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,943	| IOT103 |	What's notable
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,783	| IOT103 |	Is wise chips
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,575	| IOT103 |	Their IQ
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,367	| IOT103 |	Their chips are the IQ
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| IOT103 |	They're basically
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:50,463	| IOT103 |	Massive supercomputing type
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,743	| IOT103 |	Power for doing
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,511	| IOT103 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,839	| IOT103 |	325 Watts
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,143	| IOT103 |	Really
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT103 |	It's not like
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| IOT103 |	Cell phone
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT103 |	It's definitely loafers
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,055	| IOT103 |	Power that is
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,895	| IOT103 |	Pray I mean I think even Intel's Adams back
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,711	| IOT103 |	Time my last used one was probably more like a
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,735	| IOT103 |	5 watt chip
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,831	| IOT103 |	I think that
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:22,975	| IOT103 |	Yes Intel is clearly getting into cars in autonomous vehicles which is going to be huge
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,999	| IOT103 |	Ed koehn Ford
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| IOT103 |	It's also just
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:28,607	| IOT103 |	Look at it as Intel continuing to invest in lower power
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT103 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,679	| IOT103 |	Or even lower power arcade
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| IOT103 |	Rail
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:36,031	| IOT103 |	And for scope of the other potential here
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:40,639	| IOT103 |	Goldman Sachs has a projection for Advanced Driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:45,503	| IOT103 |	They're saying they expect that market to grow from about 3 billion dollars in 2015
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:50,367	| IOT103 |	296 billion in 2025 and 290 billion
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| IOT103 |	20:35
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,183	| IOT103 |	Predator
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,999	| IOT103 |	View out and lot of things can change but
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,279	| IOT103 |	You can see why
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,071	| IOT103 |	15 billion dollar investment
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,119	| IOT103 |	Is chump change with a potential error
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,911	| IOT103 |	Now the question I have
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,495	| IOT103 |	Built its dominance on the fact that
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:11,359	| IOT103 |	The x86 architecture license
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,175	| IOT103 |	Inside out
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:21,087	| IOT103 |	Intel's now moving into markets where it's going to have to be
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:23,391	| IOT103 |	Competitive
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,927	| IOT103 |	This this type of silica
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,207	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,511	| IOT103 |	It will be really interesting to see
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,023	| IOT103 |	Howard
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,071	| IOT103 |	Only
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:38,751	| IOT103 |	Agreed and it's funny because it's competing against the same folks that are it's competing Us in the mobile market medicine video call, so
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT103 |	Citrus soap
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,055	| IOT103 |	It's not like it's competing against
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,847	| IOT103 |	Players here at the same
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,895	| IOT103 |	Players and you're right this is a different
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:48,223	| IOT103 |	Environment for until 2 to try and succeed in
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,247	| IOT103 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,063	| IOT103 |	In other exciting news
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,575	| IOT103 |	About
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,623	| IOT103 |	Kevin actually
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,671	| IOT103 |	Told me something today that had me
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,463	| IOT103 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,511	| IOT103 |	I have Associated a technology called lighter
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,047	| IOT103 |	With
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:04,863	| IOT103 |	Drive self-driving cars only self-driving cars
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:09,215	| IOT103 |	Forever Kevin shared with me that when he was gone last week he was doing
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT103 |	People with lighter
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,055	| IOT103 |	Before I talk about it I'll just
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,919	| IOT103 |	You might standard disclosure that I do work as a consultant for Google and it's actually work
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:22,527	| IOT103 |	I was last week it was working for Google at our Google Cloud next event in San Francisco
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,623	| IOT103 |	And I was Manning the booze for my area which is
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,671	| IOT103 |	Cloud devices and Mobility
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:33,535	| IOT103 |	And we had in that Booth I didn't realize it at the time or beforehand
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:36,351	| IOT103 |	We had a $25,000 lidar sensor there
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| IOT103 |	Nami by velodyne
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:42,751	| IOT103 |	Which of the same type of sensor you see on the self-driving cars that unit sits on top and spins around
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,031	| IOT103 |	And so on and so forth
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:48,895	| IOT103 |	And yes you're my most people associate that with self-driving cars for obvious reasons
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,479	| IOT103 |	Put together a prototype demo
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:56,319	| IOT103 |	Of using lidar to basically instrument
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,367	| IOT103 |	A space that could be any space
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:03,487	| IOT103 |	Some of the ideas that we had we were sharing with customers were hey you could put this in
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,279	| IOT103 |	A retail store for example
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,047	| IOT103 |	And
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:10,399	| IOT103 |	You can then get a physical heat map of your store
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:16,287	| IOT103 |	Showing where people are walking you know it's late to traffic patterns where people are stopping and looking at product etcetera
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:19,871	| IOT103 |	Manufacturing in office environment
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:26,271	| IOT103 |	How many people are standing by the printer right now and why are they standing there is a problem with the printer or you can start gathering this type of
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:30,879	| IOT103 |	Space data and apply in totally different ways from the self-driving vehicle application
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,695	| IOT103 |	It's kind of interesting
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:44,191	| IOT103 |	Yeah that's the exact same sensor yeah we just had it mounted up high
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:47,007	| IOT103 |	And you know people are walking by it was tracking
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,823	| IOT103 |	Weatherlock hanging over there standing
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:56,223	| IOT103 |	There's no personally identifiable information which makes it a very interesting application so as opposed to a camera
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,503	| IOT103 |	Example in the store
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,831	| IOT103 |	You just see these wireframe stick figures essentially people
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:05,695	| IOT103 |	And whatnot but you can't really see who's who
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| IOT103 |	So I think that's
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,767	| IOT103 |	A kind of advantage of a camera and
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:12,095	| IOT103 |	You think about the data that you're capturing a man
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:16,191	| IOT103 |	Tons and tons of data because these things take like seven hundred thousand
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,983	| IOT103 |	Pieces of data per second
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,543	| IOT103 |	Because that thing spins around there's multiple lasers in there
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,079	| IOT103 |	It's just
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,871	| IOT103 |	Amazing amount of data that actually
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,639	| IOT103 |	Generate so
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,479	| IOT103 |	I'm just an interesting number of applications that maybe people haven't thought of
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,759	| IOT103 |	I like it
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,831	| IOT103 |	Anakin versus Cameron
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,855	| IOT103 |	We might be having
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:34,879	| IOT103 |	Until the end
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| IOT103 |	All right
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:38,975	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,535	| IOT103 |	If you have a ring doorbell
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,303	| IOT103 |	Because
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:49,983	| IOT103 |	This is a security challenge for the ring doorbell
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:55,103	| IOT103 |	What happened is somebody noticed that
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| IOT103 |	Was heading to a server in
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,431	| IOT103 |	China
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:58,943	| IOT103 |	And they said
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,039	| IOT103 |	Why are some of my package getting diverted to China
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,343	| IOT103 |	And they wouldn't read it
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:09,439	| IOT103 |	They posted it which is exactly where I would go if I notice some highly technical
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,279	| IOT103 |	The response actually
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,839	| IOT103 |	To their credit the VP of security at ring answers
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,911	| IOT103 |	He basically said that the
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,215	| IOT103 |	End of a live color motion they lose connectivity
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,519	| IOT103 |	Occasionally
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,823	| IOT103 |	Rather than abandoning the entire call
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,639	| IOT103 |	They said the last few audio packets that are
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,407	| IOT103 |	Corrupted
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,175	| IOT103 |	2
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,991	| IOT103 |	A non routable address on a protocol that
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,503	| IOT103 |	No one uses
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:34,783	| IOT103 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| IOT103 |	The plan is that they're going to update the firmware
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,671	| IOT103 |	So this doesn't have
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:45,791	| IOT103 |	And he talks a little bit more about why they're doing that kind of architecture design
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,631	| IOT103 |	What I don't think they talk about and what I imagine is also taking place here
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,935	| IOT103 |	Is ring uses a camera from China
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,471	| IOT103 |	Ring does not build its own
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,079	| IOT103 |	I'm wondering if this is something that was
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:01,407	| IOT103 |	Basically part of the camera architecture and they just for like
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,455	| IOT103 |	Don't mess with that we'll just leave that is it is
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,295	| IOT103 |	I could be I could be
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:11,903	| IOT103 |	It's interesting to me in and I hope we post the link to this conversation in the show notes because
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:15,743	| IOT103 |	Is this actually the whole conversation went on a lot longer than we have time to
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| IOT103 |	Cover
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,791	| IOT103 |	There's a lot of back-and-forth
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,631	| IOT103 |	UDP packet
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,935	| IOT103 |	So long story short
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,007	| IOT103 |	Conversation went back and forth this was a technical user
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:33,407	| IOT103 |	Going back and forth with the VP of security at ring ends explained
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:39,039	| IOT103 |	It's a really good conversation and I'm glad that's person knew what she was talking about
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,111	| IOT103 |	Doubly glad that ring is finally said
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,415	| IOT103 |	Yeah we're going to take it from her since no longer happens
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,719	| IOT103 |	Yeah the point here is
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,791	| IOT103 |	When you are building connected devices
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,327	| IOT103 |	You are building
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,143	| IOT103 |	On top of infrastructure that is
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| IOT103 |	Already in place
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,471	| IOT103 |	And you need to evaluate
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,775	| IOT103 |	Every piece of infrastructure
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,847	| IOT103 |	To create your product
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,615	| IOT103 |	Ridiculously hard
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,687	| IOT103 |	Or we need to come up with some sleep
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:10,527	| IOT103 |	Unified certification layers or levels
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,063	| IOT103 |	For each layer of
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| IOT103 |	Kind of a product
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,159	| IOT103 |	You don't understand how this happened
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:19,487	| IOT103 |	Happens if your sourcing in a products from someplace and
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,303	| IOT103 |	Ear like this is good
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:23,583	| IOT103 |	Put it here
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,887	| IOT103 |	Yeah you don't know what's in the firmware
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:30,239	| IOT103 |	The point root beer need to see here
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,263	| IOT103 |	Is you need to learn
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| IOT103 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,103	| IOT103 |	Where your
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,407	| IOT103 |	Cloud-hosted service provider is
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,431	| IOT103 |	Is putting your data
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:43,295	| IOT103 |	You need to understand what kind of security practices accompanies you contract with
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,575	| IOT103 |	Having place
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,367	| IOT103 |	For example the connected
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,927	| IOT103 |	Teddy bear hat from a couple weeks ago
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:53,279	| IOT103 |	Part of the issue there was it the toy company had contracted with
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,071	| IOT103 |	An outside vendor to set up
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:55,583	| IOT103 |	Therap
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| IOT103 |	Which
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| IOT103 |	Relied on
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:02,751	| IOT103 |	A mongodb database that had it like 14 month old security flaws oh shoot
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,031	| IOT103 |	Right
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| IOT103 |	You can't do
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:08,639	| IOT103 |	Black Sheep tattoo
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:13,503	| IOT103 |	It goes back to what we said many times if you're going to deliver a product or service
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,527	| IOT103 |	You have to
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:18,623	| IOT103 |	Evaluated from a security perspective from beginning to end an everywhere in between
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| IOT103 |	That means every
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,439	| IOT103 |	Server touches
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,207	| IOT103 |	Every
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| IOT103 |	Network
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,999	| IOT103 |	Part uses
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,047	| IOT103 |	Cameras any parlor
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,351	| IOT103 |	The databases
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,911	| IOT103 |	It all has to be secured and evaluated
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,239	| IOT103 |	And now we're going to add another layer into that be
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| IOT103 |	Has Kevin found
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,311	| IOT103 |	Some crazy
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,407	| IOT103 |	Crazy research that puts the physical in the Cyber visit
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:41,919	| IOT103 |	Call security
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:47,295	| IOT103 |	Yeah I never thought of this but it totally makes sense so
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,599	| IOT103 |	University of Michigan
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,623	| IOT103 |	Research esthetician
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,671	| IOT103 |	Different research
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,695	| IOT103 |	Earlier this week
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,487	| IOT103 |	That shows that
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,767	| IOT103 |	How you can use
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,559	| IOT103 |	Sound frequencies
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,839	| IOT103 |	2
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:02,143	| IOT103 |	Kind of wants a hack but I'll say
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| IOT103 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| IOT103 |	Creek
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:07,519	| IOT103 |	Accelerometers that are in common devices that we use everyday such as
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:11,103	| IOT103 |	Watches Fitness tracker smart phones Etc
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,407	| IOT103 |	I didn't make sense when you think about it
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,479	| IOT103 |	Because accelerometers I mean they're measuring movement
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,295	| IOT103 |	And sound waves do
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,343	| IOT103 |	Have movement
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,159	| IOT103 |	So what these folks did was they actually just
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:27,231	| IOT103 |	They use a $5 speaker
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:31,327	| IOT103 |	And injected thousands of fictitious steps into a Fitbit
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,607	| IOT103 |	Just by playing
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,911	| IOT103 |	Particular sound frequency
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:39,519	| IOT103 |	They also used a music file on a smartphone Zone speaker
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,847	| IOT103 |	To Pilot a toy remote control car
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| IOT103 |	And he
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,711	| IOT103 |	They took a different music file and got the word Walnut spelled
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,735	| IOT103 |	Autograph
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,807	| IOT103 |	On a Samsung Galaxy S5 because of its accelerometer
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,367	| IOT103 |	I just never thought of it but sound waves are
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| IOT103 |	Vibrating
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,463	| IOT103 |	Chinese memes
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,279	| IOT103 |	These accelerometers can be affected
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:05,375	| IOT103 |	Basically a meme is a digital component
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| IOT103 |	Physical world
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:10,751	| IOT103 |	So the accelerometer is usually like tiny little Springs
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,591	| IOT103 |	The digital component Translate
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,127	| IOT103 |	The movement of Springs into
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,919	| IOT103 |	Footsteps or whatever
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,199	| IOT103 |	Whatever algorithm
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,223	| IOT103 |	The company is putter
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,295	| IOT103 |	Here it's just
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,319	| IOT103 |	Be somebody
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,343	| IOT103 |	Springs
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:30,463	| IOT103 |	What's crazy is if you know the types of algorithms used you could do something like
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:34,815	| IOT103 |	Fake a seizure across a wide number of the population
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,583	| IOT103 |	For example
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:37,375	| IOT103 |	Aziz accelerometers if they've got
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,935	| IOT103 |	Devices that track Falls right
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,031	| IOT103 |	You might be like Wyatt
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,311	| IOT103 |	Would that matter but then
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,615	| IOT103 |	Emergency resources someplace
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,127	| IOT103 |	Right
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,175	| IOT103 |	I don't know I don't think like someone
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,015	| IOT103 |	If I could but if I did
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,391	| IOT103 |	I guess that's that other layer that
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:08,351	| IOT103 |	And I don't know from a security standpoint how you would protect against that that's that's going to be challenging
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:10,911	| IOT103 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,191	| IOT103 |	So that was a little bit of
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:14,751	| IOT103 |	4r
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:18,847	| IOT103 |	Habits of Happiness we have any happy news today
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:23,199	| IOT103 |	I was at South by Southwest and I didn't do a whole lot of stuff there
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| IOT103 |	Because
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,527	| IOT103 |	It was really raining in cold and terrible
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| IOT103 |	I did
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:33,183	| IOT103 |	Design workshop for iot
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,535	| IOT103 |	Devices and I discovered the iot design Manifesto
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:40,607	| IOT103 |	Manifesto
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,167	| IOT103 |	And it was basically
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,471	| IOT103 |	In this Workshop we actually built
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:47,775	| IOT103 |	We designed it
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:54,175	| IOT103 |	In the one thing I notice there are 10 things to think about with Society design
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,687	| IOT103 |	Manifesto
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,015	| IOT103 |	Privacy of data there's a secure
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:58,783	| IOT103 |	Charity
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,295	| IOT103 |	Element
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,575	| IOT103 |	There is
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:04,671	| IOT103 |	Parties parties associated with an iot product
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,951	| IOT103 |	Explicit
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,719	| IOT103 |	If your
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:09,023	| IOT103 |	Send your data to someplace else that they're using
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,119	| IOT103 |	And all these are awesome but what I didn't see
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,655	| IOT103 |	Is
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,959	| IOT103 |	Anything about business model
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,751	| IOT103 |	And I thought that was really kind of
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,031	| IOT103 |	Huge oversight
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,543	| IOT103 |	Cuz I think
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:23,871	| IOT103 |	I say this all the time so you guys might be sick of it but
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,943	| IOT103 |	We don't know how without a business model
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,223	| IOT103 |	You can't
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:34,623	| IOT103 |	Allocate the resources you need to continuously secure something or you can't tell customers that their device isn't going to die
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,391	| IOT103 |	In
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:40,255	| IOT103 |	Because I think it is
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,023	| IOT103 |	A great
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,535	| IOT103 |	Start
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:46,655	| IOT103 |	So are you suggesting maybe they need to add something that says you know
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:49,215	| IOT103 |	If you're providing a device or service
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,799	| IOT103 |	Promise to go open source if you go under
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,359	| IOT103 |	Oh that's a good idea I don't know how to think of
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,711	| IOT103 |	If you're designing a business model you probably also want to think about like
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,551	| IOT103 |	If your business model is selling data Maybe you
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,623	| IOT103 |	Have to add a clause about how you deal with the
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| IOT103 |	When you sell it
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:12,255	| IOT103 |	If you shut up you don't but if you do
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,351	| IOT103 |	Put the source code in escrow
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:22,239	| IOT103 |	I don't know I just thought you know it's worth thinking the nice thing is
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:28,127	| IOT103 |	If you guys think it's worth doing you can actually
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,943	| IOT103 |	Submit thoughts and ideas to these people and maybe it will
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,223	| IOT103 |	Captain
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,295	| IOT103 |	That was that
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:40,159	| IOT103 |	Which is my favorite store
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| IOT103 |	They don't pay me to say that I just like store
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:48,095	| IOT103 |	A San Francisco location and an Austin location
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:50,399	| IOT103 |	They already have a Seattle
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| IOT103 |	Palo Alto
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:52,703	| IOT103 |	But
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,263	| IOT103 |	They're coming to my state
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,311	| IOT103 |	For my house
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| IOT103 |	Very nice
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,199	| IOT103 |	And it turns out they're already in Seattle you said
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:10,367	| IOT103 |	And I am going out to Seattle in June to run the Rock and Roll Marathon with my other podcasting but
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,159	| IOT103 |	My mobile tech Roundup show
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,951	| IOT103 |	Just to get in through the hole
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:17,279	| IOT103 |	His first marathon and I think I will have time to go visit
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:20,863	| IOT103 |	Because it is
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,911	| IOT103 |	In each store stocks differ
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| IOT103 |	Devices I should say
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,775	| IOT103 |	You could you could go to one in one place and see
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,311	| IOT103 |	Certain devices
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| IOT103 |	And then go to another place
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,615	| IOT103 |	Play something totally different
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:36,223	| IOT103 |	Cool thing is they don't actually care if you buy it there
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,063	| IOT103 |	There gold the companies pay to be in the store
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,087	| IOT103 |	And it's basically
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,599	| IOT103 |	Additional mark
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,719	| IOT103 |	Go try to be our
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,327	| IOT103 |	Let's see we also have everything
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:52,351	| IOT103 |	Which
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,887	| IOT103 |	Doesn't have any vowels in it
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:55,679	| IOT103 |	This is
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:00,287	| IOT103 |	I like you're not going to find this company if you search for it but it's everything
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:03,359	| IOT103 |	With no vowels in it except for that first to eat
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,151	| IOT103 |	Is an iot platform
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,943	| IOT103 |	Based out of Europe
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:10,527	| IOT103 |	Gotten 24.8 million in series B funding
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,343	| IOT103 |	This is an Enterprise kind of corporate platform
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:17,440	| IOT103 |	But it's got deals with like Avery Dennison which is bigger
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:20,768	| IOT103 |	Crown holding
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,328	| IOT103 |	And westrock
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:26,912	| IOT103 |	So these are all big packaging companies and what they do is make smart Packaging
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,960	| IOT103 |	Dave provide the platform
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:30,240	| IOT103 |	For these guys
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,008	| IOT103 |	2
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:31,776	| IOT103 |	Put
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,080	| IOT103 |	No NFC or RFID tags on stuff
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,872	| IOT103 |	Shipman
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,896	| IOT103 |	Monitor
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:37,920	| IOT103 |	Train Transport
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,504	| IOT103 |	It's platform is used to monitor things like
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| IOT103 |	Where to buy citizen the shipment
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,368	| IOT103 |	It gives consumers product information if they
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,136	| IOT103 |	They want it
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,672	| IOT103 |	And it also sends data back to
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,608	| IOT103 |	Like when I buy my
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:03,008	| IOT103 |	Liverpool Football Club Jersey there's an authenticity thing on and I can scan that and register it so it sounds like that's one of the things I can
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,776	| IOT103 |	Theoretically do
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:09,408	| IOT103 |	I actually had a conversation with another company
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:14,272	| IOT103 |	There's some really cool stuff Packaging
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,600	| IOT103 |	And I think I'll probably be ready
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,136	| IOT103 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,672	| IOT103 |	Feels like something we probably shouldn't
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,184	| IOT103 |	Talk about 2
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,536	| IOT103 |	It's a little nerdy not everybody
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,048	| IOT103 |	He's excited about the
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,328	| IOT103 |	Packaging
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,680	| IOT103 |	Let me just leave it at
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,704	| IOT103 |	You will be
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,016	| IOT103 |	Get air
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,040	| IOT103 |	Echo integration
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:51,136	| IOT103 |	This is only the 900 series which has a
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,904	| IOT103 |	Wi-Fi connection
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,184	| IOT103 |	App
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,768	| IOT103 |	The idea is that soon you'll be able to tell your
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:00,352	| IOT103 |	Or ask the echo to start your Roomba
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:00,864	| IOT103 |	Which is
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,656	| IOT103 |	Pretty awesome
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,216	| IOT103 |	I have long wanted
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:07,776	| IOT103 |	Fly my pretties
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:11,104	| IOT103 |	And have my Roomba go because I am
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,872	| IOT103 |	A strange person who
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,200	| IOT103 |	Deep affection for The Wizard of Oz
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:19,296	| IOT103 |	You don't remember seeing the roomba's flying around in The Wizard of Oz but maybe in the
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:22,624	| IOT103 |	Yeah they're they're like the flying monkeys all day
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,392	| IOT103 |	You thinking about
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:23,904	| IOT103 |	Bratz
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| IOT103 |	Or track poop
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,720	| IOT103 |	Whichever
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,000	| IOT103 |	Depending on your situation
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,304	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:33,120	| IOT103 |	Roomba is been really vocal about this in
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,168	| IOT103 |	I'm excited
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,680	| IOT103 |	I don't know if it's
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,264	| IOT103 |	Reba spent a lot of time talking about how they can be
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,288	| IOT103 |	Rooms
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,592	| IOT103 |	But they're not lighter
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,128	| IOT103 |	Twitter
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,152	| IOT103 |	Sensors
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:50,016	| IOT103 |	But it is an economical
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:55,648	| IOT103 |	And sharing that information back to other products in the home
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:59,744	| IOT103 |	Because of where the Rumba is I'm not 100% sure how
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:04,352	| IOT103 |	Useful that's going to be a me the stuff my Roomba normal encounters isn't stuff
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| IOT103 |	The whole lot
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT103 |	Right right
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,704	| IOT103 |	I'm thinking this could be
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,008	| IOT103 |	Maybe you want to vacuum is very specific room
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:16,128	| IOT103 |	Maybe you don't want to pick up the room by bring it in there at the Starbuck whatever
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,896	| IOT103 |	You can just
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,664	| IOT103 |	Tablet
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:19,456	| IOT103 |	You don't go vacuum the dining room
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:21,504	| IOT103 |	Gas coming over something
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:26,112	| IOT103 |	And it will learn what room is what room and and therefore through voice control you can
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,392	| IOT103 |	You can do that
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:30,976	| IOT103 |	Yeah and they're also saying
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,280	| IOT103 |	Since the Roomba knows what room is
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:33,792	| IOT103 |	The kitchen
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,584	| IOT103 |	Eventually
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,120	| IOT103 |	The kitchen
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,400	| IOT103 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT103 |	Information to
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:42,752	| IOT103 |	Other devices and then you can just say turn on lights in the kitchen
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:48,896	| IOT103 |	And you wouldn't have to program it in your essay so it so that I get it so today like when I I have
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:53,248	| IOT103 |	Lights in my kitchen I have them specifically labeled as kitchen light so that my
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,040	| IOT103 |	Want to turn them on to have to say that but
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:58,368	| IOT103 |	Element that naming programming Park in the setup
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:24:59,904	| IOT103 |	Because the information of
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,208	| IOT103 |	Kitchen would be found through the room up raps
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:08,096	| IOT103 |	Everything to make life easier it's all good
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,400	| IOT103 |	All right
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,448	| IOT103 |	I feel like that's pretty good for this week
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,776	| IOT103 |	It wasn't a whole lot of news
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:19,872	| IOT103 |	The Neo Smart Car debuted at South by Southwest and it's pretty
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:21,920	| IOT103 |	It's far offs
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,296	| IOT103 |	We should mention this because we have a lot of people who like their echoes
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,088	| IOT103 |	AWS has
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,136	| IOT103 |	AWS promotional credit
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:31,904	| IOT103 |	It's for
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,928	| IOT103 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:38,816	| IOT103 |	Basically you're saying it's free for Echo and I'm just going to say instead of
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,352	| IOT103 |	How to say Echo
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:46,496	| IOT103 |	So it is now free for Echo Developers
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,520	| IOT103 |	Echo skills
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,544	| IOT103 |	Using AWS
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,336	| IOT103 |	And they're going to offer
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,128	| IOT103 |	You can apply to get
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,896	| IOT103 |	An additional
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,456	| IOT103 |	$100 promotional credit each month
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,016	| IOT103 |	That you know you encouraged
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| IOT103 |	Use your scale says you're skilled
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:03,648	| IOT103 |	What happens if it's free to develop usually it's free for life
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,720	| IOT103 |	Like a small number of users but if it gets really popular
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:08,512	| IOT103 |	Which is fine
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:09,536	| IOT103 |	Is prison
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,632	| IOT103 |	This way
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,680	| IOT103 |	You can apply and get an extra hundred dollars in
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:16,960	| IOT103 |	From
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:20,544	| IOT103 |	I will put the link to that so you can
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,056	| IOT103 |	Can I apply for that
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,432	| IOT103 |	They're letting you scale
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:30,016	| IOT103 |	On the cheap or for free because what they're saying here is if your skill
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:34,624	| IOT103 |	Surpasses the AWS for usage tier you may be eligible to continue receiving promotional credits in
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,136	| IOT103 |	I think
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:41,280	| IOT103 |	To get pass at 4 usage tear it was 1 million AWS Lambda requests in a given month
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:48,192	| IOT103 |	And or up to 750 hours of the Amazon elastic Cloud compute or easy to compute time
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,984	| IOT103 |	So if you're still really takes off
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:54,592	| IOT103 |	Don't panic and think I'm going to have to pay a lot of money to continue scaling
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,384	| IOT103 |	Does not look like you will
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:00,480	| IOT103 |	Exactly you know this make sense they want to get developers on board
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,504	| IOT103 |	There's
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,552	| IOT103 |	Increasing competition
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:07,392	| IOT103 |	And if you have all the skills I mean cuz like if I've developed
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:15,840	| IOT103 |	It will work across any hardware that's also using that platform which is actually really cool because a lot of other companies are
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,632	| IOT103 |	Building devices that have
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:24,288	| IOT103 |	If we should make an echo skill that so you can just say
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,592	| IOT103 |	Her name and save play the latest iPod
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,384	| IOT103 |	So you can actually do
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,944	| IOT103 |	Play that latest I know you could actually
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:36,576	| IOT103 |	Play The Internet of Things
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:38,368	| IOT103 |	Because we are
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,904	| IOT103 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:45,280	| IOT103 |	But I have been thinking about a recipe of the day skill which I think would be kind of fun
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,328	| IOT103 |	Or maybe it's recipe
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,888	| IOT103 |	I like that's a lot of recipes to come up with
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,960	| IOT103 |	I just haven't gotten to the point
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,520	| IOT103 |	Okay I'm ready to do an echo skill
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,032	| IOT103 |	But
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:59,104	| IOT103 |	I'm talking to the Amazon team tomorrow so
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,616	| IOT103 |	We'll see what happens
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,712	| IOT103 |	I have a complete
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:04,992	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:05,760	| IOT103 |	Lutron
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:11,904	| IOT103 |	And SmartThings integration between the two platforms where you can control your Lutron lights with
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,952	| IOT103 |	The SmartThings the Samsung SmartThings platform
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,256	| IOT103 |	Super excited
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:16,768	| IOT103 |	Because
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,120	| IOT103 |	I was like because which one is awesome
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,704	| IOT103 |	Samsung actually works with the Google home and
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,984	| IOT103 |	Currently the wink doesn't
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,288	| IOT103 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,080	| IOT103 |	Now I can control more stuff for the Google home
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,128	| IOT103 |	Well
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,176	| IOT103 |	I haven't gotten a tour
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:36,992	| IOT103 |	So last week I told you guys that for some reason I was having
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:37,760	| IOT103 |	Itachi issue
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:44,160	| IOT103 |	In touch with me they deleted my account
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,696	| IOT103 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:47,488	| IOT103 |	So I could restart from scratch
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,280	| IOT103 |	That did not solve the issue
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,560	| IOT103 |	What was happening as I could
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:51,072	| IOT103 |	Connect
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,608	| IOT103 |	My Lutron
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:53,888	| IOT103 |	Bridge
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,936	| IOT103 |	To the SmartThings app
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,216	| IOT103 |	But when it went to this
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,496	| IOT103 |	Discover my devices
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,544	| IOT103 |	It didn't work
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,056	| IOT103 |	I kept getting an
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,384	| IOT103 |	Send that to them
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,408	| IOT103 |	An
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,688	| IOT103 |	They
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,480	| IOT103 |	The first was like okay
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:09,760	| IOT103 |	Try again
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,296	| IOT103 |	Because
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,320	| IOT103 |	Networks
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:19,232	| IOT103 |	It didn't in this case and then they they looked further they said well we don't see your buchon Bridges connecting
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,024	| IOT103 |	To the server
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,072	| IOT103 |	It doesn't look like it's actually connecting out to the intern
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,120	| IOT103 |	But
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,144	| IOT103 |	That's not true
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,168	| IOT103 |	I
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:28,960	| IOT103 |	Next ACT test
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,264	| IOT103 |	I was like turn off the Wi-Fi on my phone
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:35,872	| IOT103 |	Text my
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,456	| IOT103 |	Bridge turn my lights off
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,016	| IOT103 |	That sounds like
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,784	| IOT103 |	Nope it is connected
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,320	| IOT103 |	Soul for some reason
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,624	| IOT103 |	SmartThings doesn't see
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:47,648	| IOT103 |	Miley Trump
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,232	| IOT103 |	And I've now reached out to
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,256	| IOT103 |	Bouchon
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,560	| IOT103 |	Maybe next week
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,096	| IOT103 |	Cuz I really just want to test this integration
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:04,032	| IOT103 |	If anyone is experienced this issue and knows how to solve it
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,312	| IOT103 |	Please let me know
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,664	| IOT103 |	If you've experienced the integration and you love it
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,432	| IOT103 |	That's also a good thing.
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,992	| IOT103 |	She said I can tell
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,272	| IOT103 |	I can tell all of our listeners
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| IOT103 |	Hey guys
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,392	| IOT103 |	Maybe
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:24,000	| IOT103 |	I mean I know I have a lot of stuff I always I always test the stuff it doesn't work
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:30,400	| IOT103 |	There there are more variables in your environment than most people's I will I will grant you that
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:30,912	| IOT103 |	But
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:34,496	| IOT103 |	I don't really see why this would be an issue
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,800	| IOT103 |	On this case anyone it feels like somewhere
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,848	| IOT103 |	Somewhere there's something getting lost
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,176	| IOT103 |	We'll see
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,456	| IOT103 |	Alright Kevin I feel like
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,992	| IOT103 |	Wechat
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:47,552	| IOT103 |	We should probably move on to our guest

EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,416	| IOT103 |	And we are going to be talking about
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,720	| IOT103 |	Lawsuits and the internet
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,768	| IOT103 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:57,536	| IOT103 |	For that
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:31:01,888	| IOT103 |	And now a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:08,288	| IOT103 |	Hey everyone this is Stacy and we are taking a break in the podcast for a message from this week sponsor this week

EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:13,408	| IOT103 |	And today we're going to learn about smart lighting and
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,688	| IOT103 |	Building automation
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,736	| IOT103 |	Friend Thomas
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:21,088	| IOT103 |	Let's just get started by telling me what Samsung is doing in smart lighting
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,624	| IOT103 |	What we're doing is
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,392	| IOT103 |	2

EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,792	| IOT103 |	In the cloud
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:36,192	| IOT103 |	Imagine a building where your sensors and light switches your flight fixes Luminaires they're from different men
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:39,264	| IOT103 |	The factors to operate on different connectivity protocols
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:42,080	| IOT103 |	And they do not talk to one another
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,360	| IOT103 |	So what you do is
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,920	| IOT103 |	Build a platform that allows two
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,200	| IOT103 |	Connect all this device

EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:50,272	| IOT103 |	And interoperate with one another
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,832	| IOT103 |	And smart lighting is part of
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:53,856	| IOT103 |	A bigger picture
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,392	| IOT103 |	Actually building automation
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:58,464	| IOT103 |	Why are people investing in building automation
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,512	| IOT103 |	That's right lighting
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:04,608	| IOT103 |	Heart of building Automation in the building you have
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| IOT103 |	Traditionally
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,424	| IOT103 |	HVAC systems UFC
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:11,008	| IOT103 |	Security systems of data center North Coast lighting system
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,544	| IOT103 |	All operating in
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,824	| IOT103 |	Silo's today
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,104	| IOT103 |	And by
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:18,176	| IOT103 |	Connecting these different disciplines
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:23,296	| IOT103 |	You can optimize the energy used in buildings you can also
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,576	| IOT103 |	Connect the lights
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,600	| IOT103 |	This remotely
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,880	| IOT103 |	And operator
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,160	| IOT103 |	Building
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:30,208	| IOT103 |	Any place in the world hangzhou smart
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,256	| IOT103 |	How do you bring this together
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,560	| IOT103 |	Using art
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:37,120	| IOT103 |	Brings all these different devices
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,936	| IOT103 |	Together such that third-party devices
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,216	| IOT103 |	Interoperate
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,496	| IOT103 |	One another
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,032	| IOT103 |	In one place
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,824	| IOT103 |	Securely
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,360	| IOT103 |	Easy onboarding
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:53,760	| IOT103 |	It's the one place that brings Hardware software third-party devices and services
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,784	| IOT103 |	Together
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:58,624	| IOT103 |	So that they can truly interoperate which is the true meaning
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:32:59,904	| IOT103 |	Off the Internet of Things
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,720	| IOT103 |	Now that I've taken my building automation
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,512	| IOT103 |	Thumbs all through Samsung
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,304	| IOT103 |	What kind of Roi
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:13,472	| IOT103 |	Yeah that's a great question so the ROI can be brought down to half a year
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:17,056	| IOT103 |	Maybe one and a half years which is significantly better than
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,128	| IOT103 |	The four years you have to have today
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:22,432	| IOT103 |	Traditional building management system
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,200	| IOT103 |	Consider that
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:29,856	| IOT103 |	Traditional building management systems you pay a minimum of $2 50 per square foot sometimes after
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,880	| IOT103 |	$7
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,416	| IOT103 |	Square foot

EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:28,992	| IOT103 |	And today I have a wonderful guest for you guys this is Phoebe Wilkinson
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,784	| IOT103 |	Who is a partner at Hogan Lovells
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:32,832	| IOT103 |	CD
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,112	| IOT103 |	Why don't you tell us
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:34,880	| IOT103 |	What your specialty
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,440	| IOT103 |	Thanks Stacy I'm just
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:40,000	| IOT103 |	Really pleased to be doing this podcast with you
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:45,376	| IOT103 |	My area of specialty is that I represent manufacturers of products
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:48,704	| IOT103 |	In court litigation or perhaps sometimes in arbitration
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:53,568	| IOT103 |	With a heavy focus on class actions as their litigated here in the US courts
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:57,152	| IOT103 |	Basically she tells people how to make things that won't get them sued
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:57,920	| IOT103 |	Is that a good summation
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:04,832	| IOT103 |	I do I try to make sure they do not get sued working with people you know as they bring products to Market but
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:08,928	| IOT103 |	Also to the degree the inevitable happens and they they do get sued
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:12,000	| IOT103 |	Routinely in their defending them and
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:15,328	| IOT103 |	Trying to make sure classes never get certified against my client
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:21,472	| IOT103 |	Exactly so I thought it would be really awesome to have you come on the show to talk about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:24,288	| IOT103 |	Because it feels like a really ripe area for
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,080	| IOT103 |	Gosh class action lawsuits
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:31,456	| IOT103 |	I see a lot of people talking about how the government is not regulating this area so maybe it will be regulated
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| IOT103 |	Quartz
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:34,784	| IOT103 |	And I would love to just get your sun sign
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,808	| IOT103 |	Big picture
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,600	| IOT103 |	What role do you think the Court's going to play
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,440	| IOT103 |	Kind of making the internet of things a little bit
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,720	| IOT103 |	Maybe more secure
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:43,744	| IOT103 |	Baby
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:44,512	| IOT103 |	I don't know
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,792	| IOT103 |	More consumer-friendly
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:50,400	| IOT103 |	Given that these devices are so new and
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:53,728	| IOT103 |	Regulations always sort of lag a little bit behind
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:58,592	| IOT103 |	Technology and advancement that you often find that the courts when they're faced with lawsuit
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:03,712	| IOT103 |	It's often become the first area where where policy or laws or
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:07,808	| IOT103 |	Howa manufacturer needs to operate in terms of thinking about the risk
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:11,648	| IOT103 |	Of operating in the space that courts play a pretty big role
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:16,512	| IOT103 |	And shaping how we all operate before maybe regulators and legislators ketchup
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:23,168	| IOT103 |	Got it so when we talked to earlier you actually gave me this awesome history of class action lawsuits in the first I was like
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,960	| IOT103 |	Why are we doing this
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:26,496	| IOT103 |	But as you explain to me
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:30,592	| IOT103 |	This actually helps understand what's a class action lawsuit and what isn't
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:33,152	| IOT103 |	So I'd love for you to kind of explain that to her audio
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:34,944	| IOT103 |	Sure
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,480	| IOT103 |	So the class action
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:41,344	| IOT103 |	Mechanism in the tool really came about I want to stay in the 70s
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:44,672	| IOT103 |	And it came about for a very logical reason
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:48,512	| IOT103 |	So you had an airplane that unfortunately perhaps
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,280	| IOT103 |	Crashed
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,048	| IOT103 |	Or maybe a
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:51,328	| IOT103 |	Skywalk fell
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:55,424	| IOT103 |	Before they had the class-action rule in the procedure
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:37:01,568	| IOT103 |	Every person who was involved in the crash or the Skywalk that fell
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:02,848	| IOT103 |	They have to sue
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:09,248	| IOT103 |	The manufacturer or any of the defendants one by one and what someone came up with was you know what
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,528	| IOT103 |	I shouldn't really have to
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,040	| IOT103 |	Prove
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,600	| IOT103 |	That the engine was defective
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:17,952	| IOT103 |	But if there was a problem where there was a liability 230 times
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,000	| IOT103 |	I should really only have to do it once
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:22,560	| IOT103 |	Because if we know the person was on the plane
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:25,120	| IOT103 |	There's really going to be no question as to causation
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,912	| IOT103 |	The plane went down
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:29,984	| IOT103 |	Liability was determined to be the fault of
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:31,520	| IOT103 |	XYZ
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,056	| IOT103 |	And then everybody on the plane
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:36,640	| IOT103 |	You should get the benefit of all that work and not have to do it
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,944	| IOT103 |	230 * an individual lawsuit
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,992	| IOT103 |	That made a lot of sense
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,064	| IOT103 |	What's happened however since that time
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| IOT103 |	Is that
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:49,440	| IOT103 |	Lawyers and even technology and products
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,976	| IOT103 |	Have started
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:56,096	| IOT103 |	Look to that tool and they said we'll meet him in it maybe I can use that tool for other loss
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,144	| IOT103 |	And at one stage
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:01,984	| IOT103 |	They were used against the tobacco industry against the Pharma industry
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:08,384	| IOT103 |	The world of el diseno that's really too many individual issues there so we can't really use it for those
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,176	| IOT103 |	Personal injury type cases
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:12,480	| IOT103 |	But then the next advancement was
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:16,064	| IOT103 |	Famous lawyers or litigants who said well
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:19,648	| IOT103 |	But I have a deceptive trade practice or disc
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,696	| IOT103 |	Deceptive thing that a company did
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:24,768	| IOT103 |	In connection with how they advertised
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,280	| IOT103 |	The product
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:28,608	| IOT103 |	Or whether they made it safe and reasonable for youth
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:31,424	| IOT103 |	And the class action tool is actually
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:36,544	| IOT103 |	Really the right tool to use in terms of an action
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:39,360	| IOT103 |	That goes after what those activities were
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,152	| IOT103 |	So for example
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,456	| IOT103 |	Do you secure your data
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,992	| IOT103 |	How do you use your data
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| IOT103 |	What have you told people
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:50,112	| IOT103 |	And that is sort of I think the New Frontier 4
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:53,440	| IOT103 |	Manufacturers are people who are in the
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:58,304	| IOT103 |	In the world of Internet of things and just think about that because it does present
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,328	| IOT103 |	A challenge
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:04,192	| IOT103 |	Going forward but when I think that they can at least think about how to mitigate some of that risk
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:07,008	| IOT103 |	That was really helpful so that the challenge has become
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:08,544	| IOT103 |	Inks Lake
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,848	| IOT103 |	So deceptive trade practice that's things
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:13,152	| IOT103 |	I'm saying my device does something that
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,432	| IOT103 |	May not
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,712	| IOT103 |	Or maybe I'm overstating it
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:16,992	| IOT103 |	Abilities
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:20,832	| IOT103 |	Could it also tie into devices that
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:23,904	| IOT103 |	Consumer might have an assumption that they'll be around awhile but then they get
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,440	| IOT103 |	Richter
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:25,952	| IOT103 |	Turned off
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,488	| IOT103 |	This is actually happen
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,792	| IOT103 |	Find a lot in the internet of things with devices
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:33,888	| IOT103 |	That you know maybe the company goes out of business and they're not going to support it
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:36,704	| IOT103 |	Or music company gets acquired in the new company isn't going to support it
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,240	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,264	| IOT103 |	I really trying to figure out
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,312	| IOT103 |	What cases
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,336	| IOT103 |	Might come up
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,616	| IOT103 |	For class-action status
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:48,480	| IOT103 |	I think there's a variety of them and I think you've identified number
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:51,552	| IOT103 |	But think about a very sort of straightforward one
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:58,464	| IOT103 |	And we've actually seen this play out recently with respect to to a manufacturer of a smart device
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,512	| IOT103 |	Smart devices collect a lot of data
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:02,048	| IOT103 |	And
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:04,608	| IOT103 |	It's a manufacturer is going to do anything
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:07,424	| IOT103 |	Set data so for example maybe they'd like to
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,448	| IOT103 |	To sell the data
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,984	| IOT103 |	To companies that
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:13,312	| IOT103 |	Track advertising or track audience measurement
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:16,128	| IOT103 |	Or track the successive advertise
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,688	| IOT103 |	If the manufacturer of noctis
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,200	| IOT103 |	Closed
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:22,528	| IOT103 |	To the purchasers of the smart device
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:25,600	| IOT103 |	Hey I'm going to be collecting the data
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,368	| IOT103 |	And
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:30,976	| IOT103 |	You can opt-out if you'd like but also I may use that data that omission
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:35,840	| IOT103 |	Not telling a consumer about what you're doing with respect
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:38,912	| IOT103 |	To their privacy their viewing history
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:40,704	| IOT103 |	Whatever it is it the smart device
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:44,032	| IOT103 |	Does Tracking not telling them actually is actionable in this
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:46,336	| IOT103 |	Because every state
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,616	| IOT103 |	All 50 states
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:50,688	| IOT103 |	Pretty much have what they call a deceptive Trade Practices Act
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:54,528	| IOT103 |	All of them in essence a manufacturers
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,600	| IOT103 |	Or sellers of products cannot engage in
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:00,672	| IOT103 |	Deceptive trade practices which includes advertising
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:07,072	| IOT103 |	What you say about a product if it turns out not to be true or what you don't say about a product
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:09,120	| IOT103 |	Internet since that's my omission
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:12,448	| IOT103 |	Example and the danger of these
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:15,776	| IOT103 |	These statutes and the way they can be used very
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,312	| IOT103 |	Aggressively is that
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:21,920	| IOT103 |	Most states allow you to bring a class-action using that statute there's a few that don't
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:24,992	| IOT103 |	But they carry treble damages often
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,040	| IOT103 |	They carry the right
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,576	| IOT103 |	For the manufacturer
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:30,368	| IOT103 |	Have to pay attorneys fees back
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,392	| IOT103 |	To the planets
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,696	| IOT103 |	And in some instances provide
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,720	| IOT103 |	Punitive damages
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,280	| IOT103 |	So the stakes are very very high
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:41,376	| IOT103 |	And the actions you take as a manufacturer
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,912	| IOT103 |	Can very much be
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:46,496	| IOT103 |	Implicated because if you say something but you don't say everything
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,056	| IOT103 |	Or if you say something but you don't say it
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,336	| IOT103 |	Sweetly truthfully
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:55,455	| IOT103 |	There's a lot that can be done with attorneys who say that is a deceptive trade
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:42:00,319	| IOT103 |	It also frankly can come up with a to Securities if you don't secure the data
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:04,415	| IOT103 |	And you have a big reach that's not going to be a deceptive Trade Practices Act
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:07,231	| IOT103 |	Per se but they're either can be class actions
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:10,303	| IOT103 |	That are lodged against you for failing to
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:12,351	| IOT103 |	Secure the data that you've collected
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,911	| IOT103 |	In a way that is reasonable
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:17,471	| IOT103 |	In terms of your obligations to secure that data
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:20,287	| IOT103 |	Okay so we've got ate a security
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:21,311	| IOT103 |	We've got
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,591	| IOT103 |	This idea of decep
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,359	| IOT103 |	How to trade practices
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,407	| IOT103 |	Are there other issues
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,431	| IOT103 |	That
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,455	| IOT103 |	Might be risky
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:28,479	| IOT103 |	Kefir manufacturers of
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:33,599	| IOT103 |	Those are the primary ones if you're going to collect data you have to
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:39,999	| IOT103 |	Secure it but if you're going to collect data or if you're going to do anything with respect to the information that you obtained from your
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,791	| IOT103 |	Are consumers connected to
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:45,119	| IOT103 |	Smart devices you really need to make
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:45,631	| IOT103 |	Disclosures
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:48,703	| IOT103 |	I guess there is one other risk and it's not
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,007	| IOT103 |	Pacific to say a cause of action
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:53,055	| IOT103 |	But the reality is
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:53,567	| IOT103 |	That
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:59,199	| IOT103 |	Data izax it's not expensive to hold we know that these days right
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:01,247	| IOT103 |	It's pretty actually cheap to hold data in the cloud
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:03,295	| IOT103 |	But if you're involved in a litigation
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:07,135	| IOT103 |	And then you have to produce the data through the court process
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:09,183	| IOT103 |	That can be an exception
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:09,951	| IOT103 |	Soleus pain
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:15,327	| IOT103 |	Addition and severe say I think companies need to think about if they are going to collect data is
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:19,935	| IOT103 |	Do we really need to hold on to it for any particular period of time
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:24,287	| IOT103 |	In legal parlance we call it a document retention policy
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:26,591	| IOT103 |	Birthday tarp reservation policy
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:31,711	| IOT103 |	Where you sit beside you know what we really don't need to keep anything for longer than x years
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,991	| IOT103 |	Let's go a little crazy here
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:34,271	| IOT103 |	Because
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:40,159	| IOT103 |	What you're talking about artificial intelligence
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:43,743	| IOT103 |	And how people are using data collected off to train
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:45,791	| IOT103 |	Models in SoHo
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:47,583	| IOT103 |	That becomes really interesting be
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:49,375	| IOT103 |	Because the data
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,655	| IOT103 |	Is used to create
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,215	| IOT103 |	Basically a model that says like this is a dog this is
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:54,239	| IOT103 |	The cat this is whatever
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:55,263	| IOT103 |	R4 Leica camera
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:55,775	| IOT103 |	For example
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:57,823	| IOT103 |	And then that algorithm
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,615	| IOT103 |	Lives on four
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:00,383	| IOT103 |	Forever
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:02,687	| IOT103 |	And then it gets gradually retrained with more data
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,735	| IOT103 |	So if I'm thinking about like
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:06,015	| IOT103 |	Data retention
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:12,415	| IOT103 |	Do I need to keep the data that becomes part of an algorithm especially as algorithm start making things happen so a
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:12,927	| IOT103 |	Actually eating things
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:16,767	| IOT103 |	I may not get a notification on my security camera
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,791	| IOT103 |	If it thinks it's a dog
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:21,375	| IOT103 |	I'm in maybe someone breaks into my house because of that and I'm
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,399	| IOT103 |	Timeout money
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:23,935	| IOT103 |	Maybe there's a fly in there
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,727	| IOT103 |	Product
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:27,007	| IOT103 |	I don't know I'm kind of
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:29,311	| IOT103 |	I feel like it's a little far out there but then I'm also like
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:38,015	| IOT103 |	I don't think there's anything that's far out there and in this evolving world of smart data smart technology
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,831	| IOT103 |	And I think you've identified a lot of things
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,111	| IOT103 |	The people need to think about
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:49,023	| IOT103 |	In terms of the retention there's no question that if the algorithms that you have or any of the technology
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:49,535	| IOT103 |	LG
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,839	| IOT103 |	That you have that operate
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:52,351	| IOT103 |	It's the device
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:59,263	| IOT103 |	You're going to want to keep that right because you're going to want to make sure that you have the ability to always create the history of how we got there
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:00,031	| IOT103 |	And keep it updated
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:06,943	| IOT103 |	But there may be other data that you decide is not necessary to maintain in terms of the Opera
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:07,455	| IOT103 |	Recent
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:12,831	| IOT103 |	Of the business or the or the operation of what your business is doing or what you're looking at
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:15,135	| IOT103 |	And so it's that day that I was
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:19,487	| IOT103 |	Suggesting that they're up there can be instances where companies will not want to keep that data
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,535	| IOT103 |	Because it's expensive
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:24,095	| IOT103 |	Down the road if there's ever any sort of it
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:24,863	| IOT103 |	Disputes have to
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:25,631	| IOT103 |	Producent
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:28,191	| IOT103 |	But you're right there are there going to be categories
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:30,239	| IOT103 |	The data that you're going to want to hold onto
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:33,055	| IOT103 |	For the viability and for the progression of the business
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:38,687	| IOT103 |	Okay well that makes it so maybe they don't need to keep that it's my cat but they should probably keep the record that it
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:39,455	| IOT103 |	It's a cat
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:40,223	| IOT103 |	That is great
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:41,759	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:43,039	| IOT103 |	Let's think about
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:45,599	| IOT103 |	Disclosures because you've mentioned this
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:48,159	| IOT103 |	As a risky area for companies
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:53,023	| IOT103 |	I'm very curious because I buy a lot of connected devices and I
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,559	| IOT103 |	Click through a lot of terms of
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:56,351	| IOT103 |	Service agreements
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:59,935	| IOT103 |	Where a lot of these devices will say hey we're going to sell your data.
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,007	| IOT103 |	Make algorithms
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,031	| IOT103 |	And
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:06,591	| IOT103 |	Enough
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:12,991	| IOT103 |	I feel like when I'm clicking through a terms of service on a 4-inch screen on my oven or maybe it's the 2-inch screen on my
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:13,759	| IOT103 |	My thermostat and like
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:17,343	| IOT103 |	Is it really reasonable that I read a 40-page ulloa on
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:18,879	| IOT103 |	That particular time
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:19,391	| IOT103 |	I don't know
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:20,671	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,951	| IOT103 |	Any any thoughts there
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:24,255	| IOT103 |	I think if you want to be
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:25,535	| IOT103 |	Really
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,071	| IOT103 |	Prudent and manager risk
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:30,655	| IOT103 |	You consider identifying at the top
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,679	| IOT103 |	Of those
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:32,959	| IOT103 |	Documents
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:37,311	| IOT103 |	Or somewhere prominent right where and then user starting to use it
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,847	| IOT103 |	That the
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:41,151	| IOT103 |	30 page or the 40 pages
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,431	| IOT103 |	Contains
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,991	| IOT103 |	The following types of disclosures
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:48,063	| IOT103 |	And identify them by category and say
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,367	| IOT103 |	You have the opportunity if you'd like to opt out
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:52,415	| IOT103 |	And if you do want it
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:53,951	| IOT103 |	See more about this right away
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:57,279	| IOT103 |	To create that link that maybe they can go there right away
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:47:01,375	| IOT103 |	I'm a defense lawyer and I tell my clients all the time it is always safer
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:04,191	| IOT103 |	When you start out to anticipate the worst
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:05,215	| IOT103 |	And work backwards
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,543	| IOT103 |	And so if you think about ways and terms of the
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,055	| IOT103 |	Disclosures
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,591	| IOT103 |	That you make
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:14,175	| IOT103 |	The especially if you are going to
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,455	| IOT103 |	Use the data
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:19,295	| IOT103 |	Sell the data or you want to do something with the data that you capture
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:22,111	| IOT103 |	From a person smart
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:22,623	| IOT103 |	Device
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,671	| IOT103 |	I think it is prudent
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:29,535	| IOT103 |	To be pretty clear about that up front and if you give them the opt-out right and they don't
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:32,607	| IOT103 |	At least if there's ever a problem down the road
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:37,983	| IOT103 |	You can say if your face was some sort of a regulatory inquiry or a lawsuit
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:39,775	| IOT103 |	Hey I was very upfront
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:43,359	| IOT103 |	Early on as to what this document contains
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:47,967	| IOT103 |	I just closed it and I gave them an easy way to opt out
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:48,735	| IOT103 |	And they chose not
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:51,295	| IOT103 |	It does depend on the type
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:54,111	| IOT103 |	Of disclosure and probably the type of device
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,415	| IOT103 |	So your thermostat
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:58,975	| IOT103 |	It's probably not collecting
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:02,303	| IOT103 |	What people would consider what should be a
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:05,375	| IOT103 |	Private data essay
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:06,655	| IOT103 |	Your television viewing
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:12,543	| IOT103 |	Or either we have seen even recently there was some case involving
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:14,335	| IOT103 |	Data involving sex toys
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:16,383	| IOT103 |	So there are there's a
EDL	00:48:16,383	00:48:18,687	| IOT103 |	Whole spectrum of privacy
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:20,479	| IOT103 |	In terms of water
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:21,759	| IOT103 |	Particular device
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:23,039	| IOT103 |	My capture
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:26,623	| IOT103 |	The probably will also dictate the degree to which
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:28,671	| IOT103 |	You should make your disclosures
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:29,439	| IOT103 |	Very prominent
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:30,975	| IOT103 |	Does that make sense
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:33,791	| IOT103 |	It does so my sex toys they should probably be saying
EDL	00:48:33,791	00:48:36,095	| IOT103 |	We are collecting this information and we will share it
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:39,423	| IOT103 |	Also with probably my television or my Broadband viewing history
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:41,471	| IOT103 |	Maybe my thermostat
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,335	| IOT103 |	On the idea of opt out
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:50,687	| IOT103 |	This is always kind of irked me because I usually read these things and then I'm like
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:52,479	| IOT103 |	And to opt-out
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:54,271	| IOT103 |	You can not use our software or device
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:55,807	| IOT103 |	And
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:56,831	| IOT103 |	In many ways
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:59,647	| IOT103 |	That feels eminently reasonable especially when I'm
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,207	| IOT103 |	What is essentially a luxury
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:02,719	| IOT103 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:04,511	| IOT103 |	But
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:06,047	| IOT103 |	As we kind of put
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:09,119	| IOT103 |	Technology in four places it feels very strange like
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:11,167	| IOT103 |	If I buy a car for exam
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:16,031	| IOT103 |	When I sign into the app for the first time after I've taken possession of
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:16,799	| IOT103 |	The car
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:19,103	| IOT103 |	Probably not the best time to tell me I can opt out
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:19,615	| IOT103 |	Play not using
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:22,175	| IOT103 |	So I am very curious like
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:23,455	| IOT103 |	Do you think we'll see a shift in
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:27,039	| IOT103 |	Maybe when were offered an opt-out or how those might work
EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:32,927	| IOT103 |	You raise a good point and I think we probably will and I say that because
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:34,975	| IOT103 |	In other areas
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:39,071	| IOT103 |	Where we have faced opt-out questions we have seen
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:44,959	| IOT103 |	The law of evolved to a place where you have to make it pretty easy for the consumer top doubts
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:48,031	| IOT103 |	The specifically I'm referring to
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:49,567	| IOT103 |	Mandatory arbitration
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,335	| IOT103 |	For example
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:57,503	| IOT103 |	The law has developed over the years where a mandatory arbitration Clause may have been buried somewhere
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:50:00,319	| IOT103 |	Are in a warranty document or in a manual
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:03,903	| IOT103 |	And then you know Court said no you got to be prominent about it and
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:06,719	| IOT103 |	What we saw was that manufacturers
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:10,815	| IOT103 |	Said okay will make the disclosure of the arbitration
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:13,119	| IOT103 |	Claws more prominent but we're going
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:15,167	| IOT103 |	To put conditions on it and say
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:17,471	| IOT103 |	If you return it to us
EDL	00:50:17,471	00:50:19,775	| IOT103 |	Then you can opt out and by the way there's a Reece
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:20,287	| IOT103 |	Restocking fee
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:23,615	| IOT103 |	And Court said no you really can't
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:24,895	| IOT103 |	Put a burden on the
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:26,687	| IOT103 |	Consumer if they want to opt out
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:28,991	| IOT103 |	Answer the manufacturers have been the most
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:29,759	| IOT103 |	Successful
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:32,575	| IOT103 |	Getting arbitration clauses
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:36,671	| IOT103 |	To be deemed valid or the ones who have said very prominently
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:39,743	| IOT103 |	There is an arbitration clause in this document
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:44,863	| IOT103 |	And if you would like to opt out please call the following number within 30 days of purchase
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:47,167	| IOT103 |	And so they've made it easy
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:48,191	| IOT103 |	For the consumer
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:55,103	| IOT103 |	They've made a reasonable amount of time 30 days and courts have said you know what that is appropriate
EDL	00:50:55,103	00:50:59,711	| IOT103 |	And if someone does not opt out by making a phone call in 30 days then yes
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:00,991	| IOT103 |	We are going
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:02,783	| IOT103 |	To enforce arbitration
EDL	00:51:03,807	00:51:06,623	| IOT103 |	So I can see something like that happening
EDL	00:51:06,623	00:51:08,671	| IOT103 |	With smart devices wear
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:10,207	| IOT103 |	If it's litigated
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:13,535	| IOT103 |	I suspected the manufacturers who make it easy
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:15,839	| IOT103 |	For someone to opt out
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:18,143	| IOT103 |	Are the ones who will see
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:19,423	| IOT103 |	The greatest success
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:21,215	| IOT103 |	And having
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:23,519	| IOT103 |	Chorus or Regulators say
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:25,055	| IOT103 |	That was a reasonable step
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:29,407	| IOT103 |	They didn't do so and so you were free to use the data
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:31,711	| IOT103 |	Thank you I'm glad that that might have
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:34,271	| IOT103 |	Because I I've been thinking a lot about that
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:35,551	| IOT103 |	I almost never give something up
EDL	00:51:36,319	00:51:38,879	| IOT103 |	Let's tackle one more issue that I think is really
EDL	00:51:38,879	00:51:39,391	| IOT103 |	I think
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:41,183	| IOT103 |	But we'll see what you say
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:47,583	| IOT103 |	A lot of these devices we're getting to a point where they're not just tracking data and notifying us there actually taking action
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:48,095	| IOT103 |	Action on our behalf
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:49,887	| IOT103 |	Something at things like
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:52,703	| IOT103 |	When I leave I program my door locks
EDL	00:51:52,703	00:51:53,471	| IOT103 |	Tlaloc behind
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:52:00,383	| IOT103 |	And this gets really interesting because like insurance companies are paying for people to put you know connected smoke alarms and things in their house
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:00,895	| IOT103 |	So
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:02,943	| IOT103 |	When you have a connected device
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:03,711	| IOT103 |	Styx
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:05,247	| IOT103 |	Controlling the real world
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:07,807	| IOT103 |	Does that introduce new levels of
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:10,111	| IOT103 |	Caution
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:10,623	| IOT103 |	Baby
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:16,767	| IOT103 |	Can you share a duties that I don't know the legal terms for these things but as a manufacturer what should you be thinking about
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:17,535	| IOT103 |	When your
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:18,047	| IOT103 |	Actually
EDL	00:52:18,815	00:52:19,839	| IOT103 |	It's a great Quest
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:23,167	| IOT103 |	And it's one that is undeveloped yet
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:25,727	| IOT103 |	In our legal system but I do think that
EDL	00:52:25,727	00:52:27,519	| IOT103 |	To the degree that say it doesn't work
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:28,799	| IOT103 |	Write your
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:35,711	| IOT103 |	House doesn't lock for whatever reason or becomes unlocked for some reason after it was locked for a few hours in
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:36,223	| IOT103 |	When you are away
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:37,759	| IOT103 |	And something happens
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:40,063	| IOT103 |	Or for some reason
EDL	00:52:40,063	00:52:46,463	| IOT103 |	The device doesn't give the warnings it's supposed to say it's a thermostat that actually operates also
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:47,487	| IOT103 |	So it's some sort of us
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:49,023	| IOT103 |	Security or fire hazard
EDL	00:52:49,791	00:52:51,583	| IOT103 |	I think there certainly is risk
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:54,143	| IOT103 |	That a manufacturer will face
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:57,215	| IOT103 |	A lawsuit in that regard for
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:53:03,615	| IOT103 |	Basically the product didn't work right or there was a malfunction and it'll go then to was it designed appropriately
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:05,151	| IOT103 |	Or if something happened
EDL	00:53:05,919	00:53:07,199	| IOT103 |	Remotely that
EDL	00:53:07,199	00:53:11,807	| IOT103 |	The company somehow there's something happened at the company that caused the device to
EDL	00:53:11,807	00:53:13,087	| IOT103 |	Turn off or to unlock
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:14,623	| IOT103 |	What were the safeguards
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:16,159	| IOT103 |	That were
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:21,791	| IOT103 |	Use of the company to make sure that that didn't happen did they have warnings had it happened before
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:25,887	| IOT103 |	And there you get into very straightforward product liability law
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:28,447	| IOT103 |	I think you're unlikely in that instance
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:30,751	| IOT103 |	Sia real class-action risk
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:33,567	| IOT103 |	Because those are one-off event
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:37,151	| IOT103 |	Is it a risk of liability for manufacturer sure
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:39,711	| IOT103 |	Because either now they're not just
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:46,623	| IOT103 |	And think about the old days they didn't just sell the product and they weren't they were done with it they're actively now interact
EDL	00:53:46,623	00:53:48,415	| IOT103 |	Staying with the product even while you use it
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:51,743	| IOT103 |	To the degree that it's connected and
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,791	| IOT103 |	To the manufacturer and that
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:55,839	| IOT103 |	Things are happening or not happen
EDL	00:53:55,839	00:53:57,375	| IOT103 |	Running right so it's
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:54:00,191	| IOT103 |	Created a relationship that's almost day-to-day
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:01,471	| IOT103 |	Goes beyond
EDL	00:54:01,471	00:54:02,495	| IOT103 |	The point of sale
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:05,055	| IOT103 |	With the the old way that devices
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:05,823	| IOT103 |	Where sold
EDL	00:54:05,823	00:54:10,175	| IOT103 |	So do you think it's going to be interesting to see how the law developed
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:10,943	| IOT103 |	In that regard
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:15,039	| IOT103 |	But I don't see that lending itself to class action
EDL	00:54:15,039	00:54:16,319	| IOT103 |	Treatment or risk
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:18,111	| IOT103 |	As much as I do
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:21,183	| IOT103 |	The security of the actual data
EDL	00:54:21,183	00:54:22,463	| IOT103 |	Disclosures Etc
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:25,279	| IOT103 |	That's that's over the large
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:27,583	| IOT103 |	Large pool of people versus individual action
EDL	00:54:27,583	00:54:28,095	| IOT103 |	And although
EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:32,191	| IOT103 |	I could imagine if my connected pet feeder you know stopped working in
EDL	00:54:32,191	00:54:33,215	| IOT103 |	Till the whole bunch of cats
EDL	00:54:33,983	00:54:34,751	| IOT103 |	Interesting
EDL	00:54:34,751	00:54:35,519	| IOT103 |	In terrible
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:36,543	| IOT103 |	I should have terrible
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:37,055	| IOT103 |	Okay
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:40,639	| IOT103 |	TV I feel like I have learned a lot
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:43,199	| IOT103 |	Are there any other topics that you're like Stacy
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:46,527	| IOT103 |	Just for all the people making smart devices out here
EDL	00:54:46,527	00:54:47,807	| IOT103 |	You should also think about this
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:49,855	| IOT103 |	I think the big ones are
EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:52,671	| IOT103 |	We started touchdown them indirectly but just
EDL	00:54:53,183	00:54:59,583	| IOT103 |	Assume as you go down the road of new technology and advancement and the more connected your
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:00,095	| IOT103 |	Becoming
EDL	00:55:00,607	00:55:02,911	| IOT103 |	Two people that you're nowhere near
EDL	00:55:03,423	00:55:05,215	| IOT103 |	I do think think about work
EDL	00:55:05,215	00:55:06,751	| IOT103 |	Work from the back what are the risks
EDL	00:55:07,263	00:55:11,103	| IOT103 |	What are the risk of something goes wrong what are the risks of what we're doing
EDL	00:55:11,103	00:55:13,663	| IOT103 |	And work backwards from what anybody see this
EDL	00:55:14,175	00:55:16,479	| IOT103 |	As a infringement of some
EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:17,759	| IOT103 |	Sores that would cause
EDL	00:55:18,271	00:55:23,135	| IOT103 |	A whole bunch of people to be able to in one Fell Swoop say that we had done something wrong
EDL	00:55:23,135	00:55:25,695	| IOT103 |	And I think working backwards like that
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:29,023	| IOT103 |	It's just a great risk management technique and I think
EDL	00:55:29,023	00:55:32,095	| IOT103 |	Is important to always think about risk mitigation
EDL	00:55:32,607	00:55:34,399	| IOT103 |	And risk management
EDL	00:55:34,399	00:55:38,239	| IOT103 |	At the same time that you're evolving and developing technology because
EDL	00:55:38,751	00:55:44,895	| IOT103 |	The companies of Osteen get in trouble or the ones that things get too big too fast and sort of the infrastructure
EDL	00:55:44,895	00:55:48,735	| IOT103 |	And the thought process about how to manage risk and how to
EDL	00:55:49,247	00:55:50,015	| IOT103 |	Mitigate risk
EDL	00:55:50,527	00:55:55,647	| IOT103 |	Doesn't keep up with the Amazing Ideas in The Amazing advancements in technology
EDL	00:55:55,647	00:55:56,671	| IOT103 |	And that imbalance
EDL	00:55:57,183	00:55:58,719	| IOT103 |	Can just create
EDL	00:55:58,719	00:56:01,791	| IOT103 |	A lot of problems down the road it only takes one
EDL	00:56:02,303	00:56:06,911	| IOT103 |	You know bad class action or one really bad regulatory fine
EDL	00:56:06,911	00:56:07,935	| IOT103 |	Manele hits
EDL	00:56:08,447	00:56:10,751	| IOT103 |	Your bottom line in terms of whatever you have
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:11,519	| IOT103 |	Hey
EDL	00:56:11,519	00:56:15,359	| IOT103 |	But it's hugely disruptive to the company to go through that kind of
EDL	00:56:15,871	00:56:20,223	| IOT103 |	Litigation or regulatory oversight or regulatory investigations
EDL	00:56:20,223	00:56:26,367	| IOT103 |	And also you take a hit in the media and in all of those things I really think can be mitigated by a little bit of thought they had
EDL	00:56:27,391	00:56:32,767	| IOT103 |	All right so I made all your techno razzle-dazzle cheerleaders in your smart home companies also hire
EDL	00:56:33,279	00:56:35,071	| IOT103 |	A few Debbie Downer
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:36,095	| IOT103 |	First happens
EDL	00:56:36,863	00:56:38,143	| IOT103 |	Exactly
EDL	00:56:38,143	00:56:44,031	| IOT103 |	I never popular but you love them down the road when you realized oh thank God we put that clause in there the way that we did
EDL	00:56:44,543	00:56:45,055	| IOT103 |	There you go
EDL	00:56:46,335	00:56:48,895	| IOT103 |	Alright thank you so much for coming on the show The
