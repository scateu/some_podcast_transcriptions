EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:50,176	| IOT065 |	Let's talk about the news from Amazon with
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:01:00,928	| IOT065 |	Well so what happened Amazon is making a big to-do about their skills so what
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:03,744	| IOT065 |	What did Amazon announce Amazon is
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,768	| IOT065 |	Celebrating birthday
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:05,792	| IOT065 |	The
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:07,328	| IOT065 |	I'd say her name but I'm going to do it
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:10,400	| IOT065 |	The Alexa skills kit has turned
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:13,216	| IOT065 |	1 and there are now over 1000
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:15,008	| IOT065 |	400 Alexa skills
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:20,384	| IOT065 |	Which is pretty quickly I'm not using any sand I want to talk to you a little about if you are using them
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:24,992	| IOT065 |	But the catalog of skills has grown by over 50% in just one month
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:27,040	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:31,904	| IOT065 |	Yeah you can now also search for skills are you skills by voice which is
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,184	| IOT065 |	New and interesting
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,720	| IOT065 |	And they change their
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,768	| IOT065 |	There's two other things they said that
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| IOT065 |	There
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:38,560	| IOT065 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,864	| IOT065 |	API usage is up by five times
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,888	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:43,168	| IOT065 |	That's great
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:48,032	| IOT065 |	Because I have started out with lights
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,312	| IOT065 |	A couple other things now
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:52,384	| IOT065 |	To it and the other thing they did was
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,176	| IOT065 |	If you go to the
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:59,552	| IOT065 |	The library online you can actually organized the skills Library so it's a little bit easier to navigate
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,320	| IOT065 |	Which is important
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,856	| IOT065 |	Because of the 2000 skills that is
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:10,304	| IOT065 |	Yeah also in one of their stat they say Amazon says customers that made over 3 million request using the
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:13,120	| IOT065 |	Top 10 most popular Alexa skills
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:18,752	| IOT065 |	Cuz you're right there are a lot of them in there some of them I would never use some of them seem very useful
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,544	| IOT065 |	Make sure not using any at all
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,056	| IOT065 |	Really
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,104	| IOT065 |	Yeah and I don't know why
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,432	| IOT065 |	I don't know why maybe I just haven't found in one
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,968	| IOT065 |	Looks like I Gotta Have It
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,248	| IOT065 |	I'm going to use it everyday
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,784	| IOT065 |	I got to get this thing on here
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,856	| IOT065 |	So I don't use any everyday
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,672	| IOT065 |	I've enabled quite a few
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:41,024	| IOT065 |	My biggest challenge is actually been remembering the
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,096	| IOT065 |	Q words like so the semantic keywords that you have to
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,144	| IOT065 |	To use that's why I'm not using them
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,936	| IOT065 |	So I think
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,776	| IOT065 |	Play Jeopardy will will help me out a little
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:58,944	| IOT065 |	Cuz we use it we use it to play games we I'm trying to think of what other skills I've enabled the 7th
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:01,248	| IOT065 |	Workout skill although I think I've only used it twice
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,064	| IOT065 |	When she talks
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,344	| IOT065 |	It is
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,136	| IOT065 |	Not very
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,160	| IOT065 |	Inspiring you're not like
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,696	| IOT065 |	Let me jump
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,512	| IOT065 |	Jump give you a bunch of jumping jacks really fast
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| IOT065 |	Oh
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,560	| IOT065 |	Push-ups yeah
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,656	| IOT065 |	I really really need some A to Z Astic coach boys screaming at me
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| IOT065 |	And she's pretty
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,008	| IOT065 |	We also have tried the farting one
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,288	| IOT065 |	I'll be honest lyrics
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:32,992	| IOT065 |	I could see that I could see that I do like how you can now enable them by voice the thing is unique again you need to know that
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,272	| IOT065 |	That keep it the skill keyword
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| IOT065 |	You could just guess to me
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,392	| IOT065 |	Like you know alarm has a skill alarm.com
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,160	| IOT065 |	Has a scale
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,928	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,464	| IOT065 |	That is
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,000	| IOT065 |	Enable alarm.com
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:45,280	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:49,632	| IOT065 |	And there yeah okay and there's a there's not going to be hopefully one alarm.com
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,144	| IOT065 |	Skill
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,216	| IOT065 |	Is very specific because it's time to their website
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,800	| IOT065 |	The name but I don't know maybe I need to go back and look
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,104	| IOT065 |	And see what new skills are available it's
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,384	| IOT065 |	It's easier now
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:04,224	| IOT065 |	It is easier yeah because it's categorized so that helps
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:10,624	| IOT065 |	I don't know just using a cigarette at an app by voice and having another very specific keyword
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,952	| IOT065 |	Just doesn't seem very natural language to me
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,232	| IOT065 |	It's not
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| IOT065 |	And that's
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| IOT065 |	Best part of Lake
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,815	| IOT065 |	That's a limitation that
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| IOT065 |	Yakko has
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,911	| IOT065 |	I talked to them so I wrote about
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,447	| IOT065 |	The echo being Amazon
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,727	| IOT065 |	App Store
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,239	| IOT065 |	Possibly
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,287	| IOT065 |	The next gen App Store
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,359	| IOT065 |	I asked him if they were going to
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,687	| IOT065 |	Office of Revenue generating opportunities for companies
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,711	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,223	| IOT065 |	They're like
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,271	| IOT065 |	Baby
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:43,391	| IOT065 |	So I'm still waiting to see like maybe the next thing we'll see is something about like
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,671	| IOT065 |	Hey
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:47,231	| IOT065 |	This is how you could pay up cuz there are skills like there's the
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,767	| IOT065 |	The nutritions
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,047	| IOT065 |	The Foot Locker app
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:51,583	| IOT065 |	Sorry food lockers
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:57,471	| IOT065 |	I'm not using that now because it doesn't tie and anything that I use bit
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,751	| IOT065 |	Something like that would be amazing
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:03,359	| IOT065 |	It would it would I'm sure developers would like to see some kind of
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:07,199	| IOT065 |	Revenue stream here I don't know that Amazon cares
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,735	| IOT065 |	Edward wants to monetize this
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:14,111	| IOT065 |	I just I think it's more of let's build at this ecosystem then let's sell the hardware and
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,671	| IOT065 |	And gather information you know
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:20,255	| IOT065 |	That's they're doing a lot of that I'm in for obvious reasons so
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,559	| IOT065 |	Yeah and if that's true so
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,607	| IOT065 |	We shall say Amazon also did
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,935	| IOT065 |	More than 50 new Dash buttons
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:31,775	| IOT065 |	Yeah nerve Play-Doh
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:35,871	| IOT065 |	Fiji Water Milano cookies which I like Clif bars I love Clif bars
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| IOT065 |	Who is ordering
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:44,575	| IOT065 |	I imagine if your kid found it I hit this button Play-Doh comes to my door and I'm sure if I would like
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:47,647	| IOT065 |	6 years old I be bang bang bang hitting that button every day
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:54,047	| IOT065 |	Trident gum I mean I'm more interested in getting a dash button you know that the hacker version or getting one of these and
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,583	| IOT065 |	Andre jiggering it to do it
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,351	| IOT065 |	I wanted to do
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| IOT065 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:04,287	| IOT065 |	I don't I just haven't been sold on this either I know what Amazon trying to do a trying to
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,335	| IOT065 |	Remove any possible barriers
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:10,687	| IOT065 |	Between you and the goods you want to shop for that Amazon can send you
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:17,087	| IOT065 |	But I'd even I've seen a lot of people complain like I don't use it anymore because I don't even get get the guaranteed best price you know the
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:19,903	| IOT065 |	The price variances I can't tell because I hit the button and just
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,951	| IOT065 |	You know I don't know what the price is
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,231	| IOT065 |	And it does vary so
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| IOT065 |	I don't want to chat
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,303	| IOT065 |	It's kind of a step
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,887	| IOT065 |	Surge pricing
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:35,519	| IOT065 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,567	| IOT065 |	Amazon is famous for making up stats
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:40,639	| IOT065 |	That sounds awesome but really tell you very little about their business
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,943	| IOT065 |	Saudi - stat
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| IOT065 |	Kishore is that
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,247	| IOT065 |	Twice every minute
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT065 |	Someone
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,063	| IOT065 |	Order something using a dash button
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,135	| IOT065 |	That sounds kind of cool right
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| IOT065 |	You're like oh that's like
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,463	| IOT065 |	One point
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:57,023	| IOT065 |	It's a little over a million x 1.05
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,815	| IOT065 |	Takes a year
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,095	| IOT065 |	That's a lot of Play-Doh
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,655	| IOT065 |	What is a lot of Play-Doh but it's not a lot of an Amazon order
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:08,287	| IOT065 |	There was a story over at Gizmodo in 2013 that said that people in the Amazon warehouse
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,359	| IOT065 |	We're basically trying to process 35 orders
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| IOT065 |	Second
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,639	| IOT065 |	Which
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,735	| IOT065 |	Make that two minutes or two orders per minute
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,759	| IOT065 |	What kind of lame
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,831	| IOT065 |	And I know in the Christmas surge Seasons they get up to 400
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:27,487	| IOT065 |	In 20 I think was also 2013-2014 they said they were processing like 400
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,535	| IOT065 |	26 orders per second
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,583	| IOT065 |	So it was like it's a lot of orders
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,119	| IOT065 |	It doesn't get
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,399	| IOT065 |	Batman
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,423	| IOT065 |	3 -
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:40,543	| IOT065 |	And I'm kind of curious how it how it interacts with their subscription business because that's probably what the stakes from
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:41,567	| IOT065 |	Is my cat
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:48,735	| IOT065 |	Yeah I mean if you're in on a recurring delivery schedule for something you don't need a dash button I wouldn't think. For that way too many
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,039	| IOT065 |	Maybe this gives you more control
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| IOT065 |	For something fake
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,439	| IOT065 |	Then you can just order it when you need it as opposed to being on the recurring
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,231	| IOT065 |	Down for life
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,023	| IOT065 |	2 weeks and you're not going to use as much
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,351	| IOT065 |	I would be
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:10,239	| IOT065 |	Curious if any of our listeners are using Dash buttons or have tried them and then no longer use them or still use them
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,031	| IOT065 |	That would be kind of interesting feedback
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| IOT065 |	Tell us about your dash at
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,383	| IOT065 |	Question
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,687	| IOT065 |	At iot podcast. Com
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:27,647	| IOT065 |	Okay so that's the Amazon news. Exciting we also have weird to talk about this later in the show
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| IOT065 |	But we'll talk about it a little bit now
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| IOT065 |	On Tuesday
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,743	| IOT065 |	Week
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,559	| IOT065 |	Daymaker The Hub basically said that
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,095	| IOT065 |	They had
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,655	| IOT065 |	Dummies Partnerships with Uber if this then that
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,423	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,191	| IOT065 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,727	| IOT065 |	And it also
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:46,079	| IOT065 |	Talked about something that actually have been going on since June 11th
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,407	| IOT065 |	They've been selling their relaced light switches
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,687	| IOT065 |	4
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:54,271	| IOT065 |	You know 149 for 2 or 99 for 1
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| IOT065 |	Which is a big deal
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:09:02,207	| IOT065 |	Yeah because I looked at the wink relay way back and for those who are not familiar I think it's the
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,743	| IOT065 |	Been around since 2014
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,047	| IOT065 |	It kind of looks like a little
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:11,423	| IOT065 |	Almost like a little smart phone a touchscreen smartphone embedded into a switch
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,007	| IOT065 |	And there were two hardware buttons to the side of it
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:21,151	| IOT065 |	And basically it replaces a light switch and add smarts to whatever is on that circuit for that light switch
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,687	| IOT065 |	Plus it has
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,991	| IOT065 |	Wi-Fi and I think 60 connect connectivity
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,623	| IOT065 |	Okay so it's hardwired to take the place of a
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,415	| IOT065 |	Traditional light switch add smart
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,231	| IOT065 |	I'm the screen against a touch screen
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:41,375	| IOT065 |	So we can show you almost there I can show you the short cuts like you might have set up for a wink in your wing cap for example
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:48,031	| IOT065 |	But now with these new Partnerships bring up a Fitbit I can see my Fitbit stats and such on there
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,871	| IOT065 |	And I forget how much it used to cost I want to say was closed at 2
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:55,455	| IOT065 |	Yeah I was like I've talked to hundreds or 249
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,527	| IOT065 |	It was a non-starter for me because of the price but now
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| IOT065 |	It's 99
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:04,927	| IOT065 |	And I'm thinking especially cuz I'm moving next week and I'm taking my
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:08,767	| IOT065 |	Wink Hub with Maci actually only smart home stuff I'm taking with me
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,327	| IOT065 |	I'm thinking about getting maybe two of them
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:17,983	| IOT065 |	I know you are more because it will broadcast your
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,543	| IOT065 |	But we should say it has a microphone
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,847	| IOT065 |	Present sensor speaker
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,151	| IOT065 |	Temperature yesterday
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,711	| IOT065 |	You getting a bunch of sensors you're getting connectivity
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,807	| IOT065 |	You're getting the ability to access your wig shortcuts
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:38,719	| IOT065 |	And at smarts to whatever is on that circuit where you put the light switch so yeah I think I'm going to grab
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,743	| IOT065 |	That maybe two of them
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,815	| IOT065 |	No I've I'm actually thinking
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| IOT065 |	Same thing you do have to
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,143	| IOT065 |	Install them you need a neutral wire
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,935	| IOT065 |	Which is
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,751	| IOT065 |	I mean I've never seen a Smart Switch that doesn't require one
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:54,079	| IOT065 |	Which is unfortunate for people in old houses by
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,127	| IOT065 |	Okay so yes
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,639	| IOT065 |	In
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:00,479	| IOT065 |	Will wait for Kevin to move and then install them and tell us how many thing
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,015	| IOT065 |	Meantime
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,807	| IOT065 |	I'm actually looking at
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:10,207	| IOT065 |	Plum which is another wifi-enabled smart switch for a while we didn't have great options in the wifi-enabled smart
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,231	| IOT065 |	Which we have WeMo
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,047	| IOT065 |	So both of these
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,607	| IOT065 |	You can set up dinners for
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:19,679	| IOT065 |	And Plum is really interesting because this is
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,447	| IOT065 |	This actually
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,775	| IOT065 |	Launched like two years ago was called a booby
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| IOT065 |	Actually like
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:30,687	| IOT065 |	3 years ago or maybe even in 2012 I cannot remember it's been forever this is a Kickstarter project that what happened was they
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:33,247	| IOT065 |	Did the kickstarter without even having the product
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,527	| IOT065 |	I don't think the product was Eva
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| IOT065 |	And then they realized
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,463	| IOT065 |	Oh no this is not the way we want this to go
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,743	| IOT065 |	And so they
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,767	| IOT065 |	Basically
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,303	| IOT065 |	Went back to the drawing board
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,583	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:52,959	| IOT065 |	Read it the whole thing and so now these are light switches with a touch-sensitive
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,519	| IOT065 |	Panel in the front they look just like a light switch
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,567	| IOT065 |	Looks like a toggle switch almost
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,079	| IOT065 |	Looks like a toggle switch
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,359	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,151	| IOT065 |	Can you see the pricing on their is it
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:07,295	| IOT065 |	99 for a single unit a three-pack is 289
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:13,439	| IOT065 |	And then you can buy 10 packs and 20 packs if you want to go hog-wild it resemble a 20-pack would beat 1807
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,511	| IOT065 |	That's for when you're building your own house
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,303	| IOT065 |	Or someone else's building your house
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,887	| IOT065 |	This product is
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:26,751	| IOT065 |	Cool because what it is is it's got processing power and each light switch
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,055	| IOT065 |	It runs up Applegate runs
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:35,455	| IOT065 |	Honor language is a programming language used in distributed computing and the idea is that each of these switches is
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| IOT065 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| IOT065 |	Part of a distributor cap
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,575	| IOT065 |	Computer network that actually is acting as your Hub in your home
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,135	| IOT065 |	I was just going to say so this is a hubless solution
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,415	| IOT065 |	It's it's a hubless
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,695	| IOT065 |	Solution
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,487	| IOT065 |	Using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,047	| IOT065 |	I don't believe it has the mic and speaker
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,863	| IOT065 |	I do not believe it does
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:59,263	| IOT065 |	My immediate issue is that it requires an iPhone 4S or higher or iPad
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:03,359	| IOT065 |	IPod Touch that's right this is iPhone only
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,687	| IOT065 |	It's not actually I think it's just shipping to the kickstarter
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:08,735	| IOT065 |	People there they're getting ready to do
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,247	| IOT065 |	More stuff
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,551	| IOT065 |	So I'm just saying this is out there
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,855	| IOT065 |	Minkus actually really out
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,415	| IOT065 |	If you want a Wi-Fi switch
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| IOT065 |	Mad at that price
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,047	| IOT065 |	Wink is owned by Flex
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,095	| IOT065 |	So it was on backwards
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:24,863	| IOT065 |	Bankrupt
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| IOT065 |	Hip flexor
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,399	| IOT065 |	She's not going to do
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,959	| IOT065 |	Definitely not
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,727	| IOT065 |	Definitely not
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:32,799	| IOT065 |	We'll talk more about that cuz we're talking about design stuff
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,591	| IOT065 |	I think you'll also hear about the sensors again
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,639	| IOT065 |	Yeah go get a drink of water
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,551	| IOT065 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,063	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,623	| IOT065 |	Other news that was. We've got
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,135	| IOT065 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| IOT065 |	So the WiFi started
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:54,815	| IOT065 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance has a new Wi-Fi certified AC
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,351	| IOT065 |	Addition or enhancement
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,399	| IOT065 |	Right in AC is the most
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,679	| IOT065 |	Recent one
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,727	| IOT065 |	Is it Wireless
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,263	| IOT065 |	Version of
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:07,359	| IOT065 |	Wi-Fi so it's the most recent one for routers and others they also have Wi-Fi Halo
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:11,967	| IOT065 |	Which is actually the new aspect but it's not actually certified or standardized yet
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,503	| IOT065 |	That's for that
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,807	| IOT065 |	Low power
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,111	| IOT065 |	Hard to get to places
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,695	| IOT065 |	So what's new with the
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| IOT065 |	AC
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,767	| IOT065 |	So they've added multi-user Mimo
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,071	| IOT065 |	Which for all of you for going
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:33,727	| IOT065 |	Basically means that your Wi-Fi it's a tennis can send the data to more than one device at a time
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,519	| IOT065 |	Which ads
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| IOT065 |	Basically makes
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,847	| IOT065 |	Connection for reliability
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,639	| IOT065 |	Is make it faster Kevin
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:44,223	| IOT065 |	Can I get faster on certain devices
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,247	| IOT065 |	I'm going to use
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:48,319	| IOT065 |	An example I think it still applies
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:54,719	| IOT065 |	And a lot of older networks you could be slowed down if you had one slow device because made
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,231	| IOT065 |	Maybe it was a
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,839	| IOT065 |	How to say nato to 11. B and everything else is a 211. G
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:03,167	| IOT065 |	You know there was there ways around that to fix that but
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,447	| IOT065 |	You just kind of stuck
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:08,543	| IOT065 |	With your slowest device slowing down everything but now that should not be an issue
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| IOT065 |	And then they also increase
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,359	| IOT065 |	Grease the channel
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,431	| IOT065 |	Yes maximum Channel bandwidth
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,455	| IOT065 |	It's going from
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:21,087	| IOT065 |	80 megahertz to 168 Channel switch they say potentially doubles transmission speeds obviously
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,599	| IOT065 |	We can do the math
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,671	| IOT065 |	But that is good at catching I remember we had
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,975	| IOT065 |	20 megahertz channels what is like
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,255	| IOT065 |	Super fast so this is
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:28,767	| IOT065 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| IOT065 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,119	| IOT065 |	So ye better wi-fi last week we got better Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,959	| IOT065 |	This week better wi-fi in this actually Albion devices in the coming
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,727	| IOT065 |	Weeks
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| IOT065 |	So sad
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,055	| IOT065 |	Wi-Fi lights
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| IOT065 |	I wonder
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,431	| IOT065 |	Yeah I guess this is not just a simple software
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:52,831	| IOT065 |	Upgrade meeting older 802 11ac devices will see this I think this is hard because
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| IOT065 |	They're actually break me up 5
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:58,975	| IOT065 |	Of the first sip Wi-Fi certified AC price to support the new features
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:02,047	| IOT065 |	And comprise a test bed for interoperability so
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,607	| IOT065 |	I think this means new hardware
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,911	| IOT065 |	I'm not seeing everything about older devices
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:12,799	| IOT065 |	If I make sense cuz implementing multi-user
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:14,335	| IOT065 |	I believe
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,151	| IOT065 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,711	| IOT065 |	From an antenna perspective as well as others yeah
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| IOT065 |	Radio
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,527	| IOT065 |	Yep
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,807	| IOT065 |	So free wifi
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,647	| IOT065 |	Little bits of news Columbus Ohio
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| IOT065 |	Was the name to be
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:33,791	| IOT065 |	Winner of a grant from the Department of Transportation
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,327	| IOT065 |	Say
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:38,143	| IOT065 |	40 million-dollar grant for the.
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,935	| IOT065 |	10 million from Vulcan
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,727	| IOT065 |	Capital Paul Allen's company
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,263	| IOT065 |	Basically this is a
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,543	| IOT065 |	To build a smart City
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:45,567	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:50,175	| IOT065 |	I'm a little sad because Austin was also in the running for this 11
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| IOT065 |	Casey and some other cities
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:57,087	| IOT065 |	Columbus apparently had the best plan and they also brought in another
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,159	| IOT065 |	140 million + local
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:00,927	| IOT065 |	Crimson
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,207	| IOT065 |	Can I help
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,487	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,279	| IOT065 |	It's a lot of money going to improve
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,351	| IOT065 |	Transportation with bike smart cities
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:14,239	| IOT065 |	Smart passes for traffic Lanes I think it's that got autonomous buses is something they're looking at 2
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,519	| IOT065 |	What interesting stuff
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,031	| IOT065 |	Coming out of Columbus
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,591	| IOT065 |	Yeah but they have
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,639	| IOT065 |	That's part of the project they have
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:23,967	| IOT065 |	Cars that are kind of have that lidar and radar sensors like a
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:28,831	| IOT065 |	OK Google Maps car and they actually go around all the time in theory
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| IOT065 |	And see where
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,135	| IOT065 |	There is open parking
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:34,719	| IOT065 |	NFL communicated to the people live there that way they can get to the
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,255	| IOT065 |	The closest
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:40,095	| IOT065 |	Open parking spots that are driving around in circles for 10 minutes and so on so
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,375	| IOT065 |	Kind of dressing
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| IOT065 |	I would totally
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:48,287	| IOT065 |	Play I wonder how much extra traffic that adds I putting those
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:54,175	| IOT065 |	Cars out there to actually check the parking spot so I wish there were sensors in the parking spots where you can say it
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:57,247	| IOT065 |	I don't have three times on on top of me so it
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:02,623	| IOT065 |	Yeah I would think you'd want to do it cameras just because he wouldn't have to change the batteries in Those sensors and
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| IOT065 |	That's
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,183	| IOT065 |	More bang for your buck
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| IOT065 |	Anyway
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:10,047	| IOT065 |	The reason why we bring this up is because ye Columbus but also
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:13,375	| IOT065 |	Because we heard from sidewalk Labs which is Google's
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| IOT065 |	Well
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,191	| IOT065 |	Which alphabets alphabets
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,239	| IOT065 |	What are the alphabet
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,335	| IOT065 |	We should also say right now right here
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:22,847	| IOT065 |	Kevin
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,663	| IOT065 |	What's for now that company called Google
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| IOT065 |	There you go
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,223	| IOT065 |	But he has nothing to do with
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| IOT065 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,319	| IOT065 |	Kevin you can't do everything
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,671	| IOT065 |	Santa Claus is
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,695	| IOT065 |	Google Smart City
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,815	| IOT065 |	Santa Claus is alphabet Smart City ever
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,583	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,911	| IOT065 |	What it's apparently do and nobody really knows a lot about what it
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,679	| IOT065 |	It's doing
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,191	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,727	| IOT065 |	We
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:56,127	| IOT065 |	The guardian got papers saying that it is going to run Public Safety or public transportation Networks
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,151	| IOT065 |	In Columbus
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,199	| IOT065 |	So, this is part of its effort
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,527	| IOT065 |	To implement all of this kind of traffic
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,063	| IOT065 |	Stuff
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,111	| IOT065 |	It's using sidewalk labs
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,135	| IOT065 |	Software called
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,647	| IOT065 |	Flow
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,463	| IOT065 |	To help manage its transportation
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,231	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,023	| IOT065 |	I'm not sure exactly what that mean
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,303	| IOT065 |	But that could be part of the public
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,911	| IOT065 |	I've been pretty sure that it is Court will that's according to the guardian
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,703	| IOT065 |	Which found this information
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,799	| IOT065 |	I thought that was interesting
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,591	| IOT065 |	I'm very curious I'm hoping to get someone
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:28,127	| IOT065 |	Sidewalk Labs podcast
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:28,895	| IOT065 |	Because I Got High
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,431	| IOT065 |	I want to know more
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,991	| IOT065 |	Alright other news of the week
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,503	| IOT065 |	Let's see
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:37,599	| IOT065 |	I will let you guys know that I did a review for The Wirecutter on
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,135	| IOT065 |	Connected doorbells
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,671	| IOT065 |	It came out very nice
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,207	| IOT065 |	It did it
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,719	| IOT065 |	Took forever
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,511	| IOT065 |	So I have had
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,535	| IOT065 |	The skybell
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,071	| IOT065 |	HD
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,351	| IOT065 |	The August
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:48,863	| IOT065 |	And the
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,399	| IOT065 |	Ring
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,727	| IOT065 |	Not the pro cuz that wasn't available for reviewers yet
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,287	| IOT065 |	On my door for like
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,055	| IOT065 |	Months
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:57,823	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,615	| IOT065 |	They live through
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:02,175	| IOT065 |	Torrential rain they look through all kinds of stuff
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,943	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,735	| IOT065 |	The review turned out to
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,783	| IOT065 |	I said the skybell HD was my favor
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:11,391	| IOT065 |	Actually change cuz beforehand I thought the August was my favorite in fact I
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,183	| IOT065 |	I now own two August doorbells
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:20,607	| IOT065 |	And finally we have some news from CD insights who actually this week put out a report saying that smart home
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| IOT065 |	Funding
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:25,215	| IOT065 |	Is up for the first time since the last quarter of 2014
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| IOT065 |	And
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,287	| IOT065 |	I thought that was kind of
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,335	| IOT065 |	Worth noting although the biggest eel
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,359	| IOT065 |	It seems like
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,895	| IOT065 |	A lot of that was
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,663	| IOT065 |	Was due to
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,175	| IOT065 |	Ring racing
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,199	| IOT065 |	61 million
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,271	| IOT065 |	That was a good chunk of the of the quarter here
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,063	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:42,367	| IOT065 |	In the first quarter of 2016
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:46,207	| IOT065 |	24 companies raised 114
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,743	| IOT065 |	Million dollars
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,279	| IOT065 |	The peak was in
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:53,375	| IOT065 |	The fourth quarter of 2014 when 36 companies raised
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,703	| IOT065 |	251 million
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,215	| IOT065 |	$10
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:02,847	| IOT065 |	Is that a drop precipitously as often as the case inventor world end
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,383	| IOT065 |	It'll probably come back up again
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:04,895	| IOT065 |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,223	| IOT065 |	In part of that funny
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,783	| IOT065 |	Is it less smart home but it is iot
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,599	| IOT065 |	Ala raised 39 million dollars
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,111	| IOT065 |	Which was a
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,928	| IOT065 |	Endura
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| IOT065 |	Which is a company that's actually providing
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:24,864	| IOT065 |	Back in kind of machine learning and intelligence for smart home devices raised 11 million
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,936	| IOT065 |	There is a really interesting company it's kind of seeking
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,984	| IOT065 |	Three you know houndify
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,288	| IOT065 |	The company that provides
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:35,104	| IOT065 |	A easy way for developers to add voice
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,128	| IOT065 |	To there
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT065 |	Products
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:40,224	| IOT065 |	You're a kind of wants to make it easy to add machine learning and
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,040	| IOT065 |	Context-based intelligence 2
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| IOT065 |	Products
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:44,832	| IOT065 |	Any product
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,928	| IOT065 |	Yeah it is all right so
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,952	| IOT065 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,256	| IOT065 |	All the News That's fit to talk about this week
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,024	| IOT065 |	I think
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:56,352	| IOT065 |	Anything else I know I'm done just debating on how many winks
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,888	| IOT065 |	To buy right now wink relay

EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:09,568	| IOT065 |	They want to come together from
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:13,152	| IOT065 |	The fight side to networking to Cloud application
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:19,040	| IOT065 |	On our side we partnered very closely with chip vendors these include Tommy's like Renaissance
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,368	| IOT065 |	Broadcom Qualcomm Marvell mediatek
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:26,976	| IOT065 |	And also work with companies like apple and WeChat in China to make sure that these

EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:38,496	| IOT065 |	Our customers are typically leading manufacturers
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:41,312	| IOT065 |	And you're some of the public ones are
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,848	| IOT065 |	Companies like Hunter Fan
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:46,944	| IOT065 |	They're launching a homekit enabled fan on or service later this year
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:53,088	| IOT065 |	Air conditioning companies like Fujitsu I sent TCL bunch of Chinese companies door lock
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:57,696	| IOT065 |	Pretty much if you see something in your home today and it's starting to get connected somewhere
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,768	| IOT065 |	We have a custom on our platform that's doing the same thing
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,328	| IOT065 |	All right and if I want to build
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:09,728	| IOT065 |	Some sort of seamless software experience in the cloud how can I find you

EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,888	| IOT065 |	You guys are here
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,656	| IOT065 |	Because
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,680	| IOT065 |	You announce
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:16,032	| IOT065 |	Partners for the relay switch which I didn't even realize was actually back on the market
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,640	| IOT065 |	Your new partners why don't we quickly run to the news so who are your new partners
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,712	| IOT065 |	So we made Partnerships with
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:26,016	| IOT065 |	Marquee brands does Brands art
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,784	| IOT065 |	Uber
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,064	| IOT065 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,856	| IOT065 |	I love if
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,464	| IOT065 |	You don't control things from
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,000	| IOT065 |	My wink
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,584	| IOT065 |	Ecosystem is
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,352	| IOT065 |	Is NASA
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:44,960	| IOT065 |	That's so much cool stuff you can do and we really see this is the first step of
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:48,800	| IOT065 |	You know I'm starting to integrate them with them a little more deeply
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,360	| IOT065 |	And so you know right now you'll be able to use
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:53,152	| IOT065 |	Is the relay button says that if
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,944	| IOT065 |	Component of the
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,712	| IOT065 |	The knot recipe
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,504	| IOT065 |	And so you can say you know
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,784	| IOT065 |	If this button
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,296	| IOT065 |	Express Tax
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,576	| IOT065 |	He said maybe you can
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:03,904	| IOT065 |	Can use that as an alert to text you if you when your kid comes home
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,672	| IOT065 |	School
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,720	| IOT065 |	Another thing you can do it on this way sign in
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,488	| IOT065 |	Is that you can use
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,512	| IOT065 |	Using with the Logitech Harmony
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:14,400	| IOT065 |	You don't have a physical button that turns on your entire a view system in the
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,424	| IOT065 |	Transit off at night
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,192	| IOT065 |	When you go to bed
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:21,056	| IOT065 |	You need at the real and I think it's more convenient than trying to like menu dive to your remote
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:26,432	| IOT065 |	That's true although I can actually control my Logitech Harmony through the echo
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,480	| IOT065 |	Which crazy
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:30,528	| IOT065 |	Superfund
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:35,392	| IOT065 |	Let's go because when you guys at
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:38,208	| IOT065 |	Gosh like a year-and-a-half ago was it
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:43,328	| IOT065 |	Yeah so bad thing was $250 you had to
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:46,912	| IOT065 |	Install it in your wall the relay guys is a
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:51,264	| IOT065 |	Your light switch goes
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,080	| IOT065 |	And it also has an income
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,384	| IOT065 |	Chanel
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:27:00,224	| IOT065 |	What looks like the wink interface on a touchscreen on that switch
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,040	| IOT065 |	Came on the market
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,600	| IOT065 |	In my humble opinion
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:09,184	| IOT065 |	But now it's only $149
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,208	| IOT065 |	2
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:14,816	| IOT065 |	For what we are really committed to
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:18,144	| IOT065 |	Continuing to update this product so you know
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,424	| IOT065 |	Without having
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,728	| IOT065 |	To buy new hardware or anything like that
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,520	| IOT065 |	With the intercom with these new service
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,848	| IOT065 |	Substantially upgrading what the weather be like
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,408	| IOT065 |	And you've mentioned that like
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,968	| IOT065 |	It's sort of like an interpretation of of
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,992	| IOT065 |	Wink you know
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,016	| IOT065 |	On your wall
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:37,088	| IOT065 |	What we really wanted to do it this was
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,136	| IOT065 |	Not so much even about
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,416	| IOT065 |	The wink out itself
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,184	| IOT065 |	It was more about
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:44,512	| IOT065 |	Like what how would we reinterpret the light switch for the dish
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:46,816	| IOT065 |	Like what makes sense
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:47,840	| IOT065 |	What's more
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:52,192	| IOT065 |	When we're Gods with it is that we think that it's B
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,728	| IOT065 |	Becomes really nice coffee
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:54,752	| IOT065 |	Fermented things
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,800	| IOT065 |	Like Amazon Alexa
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,312	| IOT065 |	Internet
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,616	| IOT065 |	It's a sleek and
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| IOT065 |	Unobtrusive
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,432	| IOT065 |	Implants
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:05,248	| IOT065 |	Simple interface and that makes sense for certain use cases
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:09,088	| IOT065 |	You might order an Uber through
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,136	| IOT065 |	Your Amazon Alexa
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:14,208	| IOT065 |	You know voice control device I cannot go or something
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,024	| IOT065 |	You like that where you might order it through your cell phone
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,560	| IOT065 |	But you know you can see
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,864	| IOT065 |	See how long how far away the car is
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,144	| IOT065 |	Anyang
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:26,752	| IOT065 |	Relay and I think that that makes a lot of sense and that interaction between like the active
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,776	| IOT065 |	Blake The Voice
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,824	| IOT065 |	And the passive like the relay
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,640	| IOT065 |	When am I actually on my
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:36,480	| IOT065 |	Original ecobee was that I could literally just walk by and see the weather
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,040	| IOT065 |	It's not like the stupidest thing but it was awesome
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:46,720	| IOT065 |	Yeah we have weather on relay as well and not yeah I use it every single day I rarely ever open up the weather app anymore
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,768	| IOT065 |	So that makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:54,656	| IOT065 |	And you guys have actually been working hard at Integrations why are you doing this focus on
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:59,008	| IOT065 |	All of these other services and what do you think the wink platform provides
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,800	| IOT065 |	Wink is all about connecting things
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:03,360	| IOT065 |	I sometimes think about it as
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,128	| IOT065 |	Like an operating
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,664	| IOT065 |	For the home
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:10,528	| IOT065 |	We have this Mantra internally a twink that is use wink more but use the app less
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,832	| IOT065 |	And what we mean by that is that like
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| IOT065 |	Like we love connect
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,136	| IOT065 |	Together two
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:18,976	| IOT065 |	Create the sort of futuristic experiences that I think that we
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,024	| IOT065 |	We all want from
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,816	| IOT065 |	He's connected products and
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| IOT065 |	You know
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,888	| IOT065 |	It takes a long time to for everything
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,424	| IOT065 |	Immature and
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,704	| IOT065 |	For everything to
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,728	| IOT065 |	You know
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:32,800	| IOT065 |	Potential but we feel like rely just on the precipice.
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:34,848	| IOT065 |	And so
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| IOT065 |	We think about
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:37,664	| IOT065 |	The smart home is something that
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:40,736	| IOT065 |	It's it's more than just like physical Hardware
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,528	| IOT065 |	It is also be services
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:49,440	| IOT065 |	Earlier today you told me that you guys kind of don't believe there's going to be a central Hub in the home and that's kind of
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,720	| IOT065 |	Fyu designs
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,744	| IOT065 |	The relay
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,792	| IOT065 |	You designed the relay to act is that hub
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:59,168	| IOT065 |	What should we take from this given that he don't double A has fewer radios
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:03,008	| IOT065 |	Better than the walls design in it
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,544	| IOT065 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:05,568	| IOT065 |	Biscuit future
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,360	| IOT065 |	Hub replacement
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:10,688	| IOT065 |	We think that there's going to be a house in the future but we think they're going to
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,480	| IOT065 |	Piggyback on other devices
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:13,760	| IOT065 |	Especially as
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,552	| IOT065 |	Low energy
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,576	| IOT065 |	The chair is National
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,392	| IOT065 |	We thank God
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,672	| IOT065 |	It makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,208	| IOT065 |	Combined
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:26,304	| IOT065 |	Browder's a game consoles and like white switches with hub
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| IOT065 |	Yunnan places where you have power you have
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,144	| IOT065 |	Wi-Fi already
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,680	| IOT065 |	And so
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:34,496	| IOT065 |	The reason that we put we take zigbee for the
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,544	| IOT065 |	The relay Hub is that
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,568	| IOT065 |	We feel
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,848	| IOT065 |	That's the real Isaac
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,896	| IOT065 |	Decor a product it's about controlling
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| IOT065 |	Smart light bulbs
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:46,016	| IOT065 |	And because we are focusing on that Whiting use case
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,296	| IOT065 |	And the bad
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,064	| IOT065 |	Adoption of
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:51,648	| IOT065 |	Light switch to the 20
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:52,672	| IOT065 |	Centuries
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:56,768	| IOT065 |	We felt that Digby was the right protocol because
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:30:59,840	| IOT065 |	Of the choice and availability of
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,864	| IOT065 |	Zigbee bulbs
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:04,192	| IOT065 |	We don't particularly endorse one protocol
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,216	| IOT065 |	Over another
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:08,800	| IOT065 |	You have a microphone in there and you have a speaker because it's now an intercom
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:14,688	| IOT065 |	Are there any other kind of sensors
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,968	| IOT065 |	Temperature might be an interesting thing
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,248	| IOT065 |	We have temp
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:21,600	| IOT065 |	And you can also there also is a proximity sensor
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,928	| IOT065 |	So you know we can see if there's activity in the house
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:27,232	| IOT065 |	We have some pretty Advanced machine learning
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:30,048	| IOT065 |	Programs going on right now and they will make use of that data
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,376	| IOT065 |	Outfitting my house
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,680	| IOT065 |	4 and trying to make it a smart home
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:39,520	| IOT065 |	I felt like for advanced users wink was a great place to start cuz it work
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,032	| IOT065 |	A lot of things
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,056	| IOT065 |	So
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:47,200	| IOT065 |	How many of these would I want in my house how should I be thinking about designing my house or is it still too early
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:49,504	| IOT065 |	Well it really depends on the houses
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,040	| IOT065 |	SKS I need
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:52,576	| IOT065 |	I live in New York so
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,344	| IOT065 |	I can only
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:53,856	| IOT065 |	Really have one
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,904	| IOT065 |	But
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,440	| IOT065 |	You know if you got a larger house and
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,744	| IOT065 |	Intercom
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,536	| IOT065 |	Use kiss makes a lot of sense for you
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,840	| IOT065 |	Then you know we've had people that have ordered five
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,632	| IOT065 |	Before
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,168	| IOT065 |	Because I want one in every room
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:09,984	| IOT065 |	You know what you can have a button on one of your relays
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| IOT065 |	That causes down the in
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,544	| IOT065 |	Entire house
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,312	| IOT065 |	For the night right
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:16,896	| IOT065 |	So that might not make sense on a relay in the living room
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,432	| IOT065 |	But you know my name a lot of sense
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,480	| IOT065 |	Relay like by the garage door
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:26,624	| IOT065 |	Something was it difficult to figure out a user interface Works in such a small space
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:31,744	| IOT065 |	Potentially do so much how do you kind of think about menus and accessing that
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:36,864	| IOT065 |	Something about designing for Relay is that we actually have some really interest
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,424	| IOT065 |	Constraints design around
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:41,216	| IOT065 |	And what really does best
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,008	| IOT065 |	And what it does better than
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:43,776	| IOT065 |	Mobile phone
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:47,616	| IOT065 |	It can convey information without being a
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:51,200	| IOT065 |	Answer. So we really try to focus on is
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:54,272	| IOT065 |	Designing widgets in a way where you can look at it for
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,320	| IOT065 |	2 seconds as you're passing it
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:59,136	| IOT065 |	And you know get useful information
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,160	| IOT065 |	Information about things
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,440	| IOT065 |	I'd like the weather or you stopped
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,232	| IOT065 |	Like that
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:07,328	| IOT065 |	And it doesn't work like that with the phone the phone is a device that
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,376	| IOT065 |	You don't always want to have tethered
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,912	| IOT065 |	Why you don't want to carry around
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:11,424	| IOT065 |	Your phone in the house
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,216	| IOT065 |	24/7
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,520	| IOT065 |	And so the relay is sort of that
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,312	| IOT065 |	A match between
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| IOT065 |	The services and
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| IOT065 |	Information
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:19,872	| IOT065 |	Do you care about
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,688	| IOT065 |	Youth at Toronto Raptors
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,480	| IOT065 |	That's why we try to design for it
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,016	| IOT065 |	We don't spend a lot of
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:26,528	| IOT065 |	Time
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,064	| IOT065 |	You know imagining
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,600	| IOT065 |	Use case
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:30,880	| IOT065 |	You
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:31,648	| IOT065 |	China autumn
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,976	| IOT065 |	Relay For example like if you're setting up
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,024	| IOT065 |	You familiar with iRobot system
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,048	| IOT065 |	Automation
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:39,840	| IOT065 |	You wouldn't
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,632	| IOT065 |	Want to set up a robot
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,144	| IOT065 |	The relay
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,448	| IOT065 |	But
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:49,312	| IOT065 |	When it comes to looking at information passes lie the relay
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,080	| IOT065 |	Excel
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,104	| IOT065 |	And sales.
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,128	| IOT065 |	That doesn't use gas
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:52,896	| IOT065 |	Should we try to spend
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:53,920	| IOT065 |	The majority of our
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:54,688	| IOT065 |	Design timeline
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:55,968	| IOT065 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:59,040	| IOT065 |	And speaking of your robots because this is something that
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:34:01,600	| IOT065 |	When Apple just introduced the home
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,416	| IOT065 |	App for iOS 10 I saw this and I was
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:08,256	| IOT065 |	I was frankly a little bit disappointed cuz I was hoping they would push
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,584	| IOT065 |	Kind of the men Ewing and Concepts forward
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:12,864	| IOT065 |	In
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:14,912	| IOT065 |	Kind of the way we've been managing
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,192	| IOT065 |	Multiple devices in our house
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,496	| IOT065 |	And I don't feel like they really did
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:20,800	| IOT065 |	So I'm curious like
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,824	| IOT065 |	Do you see us
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:26,688	| IOT065 |	Programming are smart homes in the not-too-distant future
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:29,248	| IOT065 |	Or could it be something like as simple is
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:32,832	| IOT065 |	Telling something what to do so maybe doing it verbally or maybe it's
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:36,416	| IOT065 |	You know generated by Machine learning and you can say
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:38,208	| IOT065 |	You can offer me like an option
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,256	| IOT065 |	And the app like Stacy I see that
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:46,400	| IOT065 |	You tend to do this at this time or whatever this happens you also do this would you like me to set up a robot
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:49,728	| IOT065 |	Yeah you are alluding to some subjects that are
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,752	| IOT065 |	You know very near
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,520	| IOT065 |	Jerry West
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,288	| IOT065 |	We love
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| IOT065 |	Robots
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,360	| IOT065 |	The ability to set up complex automation
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,664	| IOT065 |	And we think it's really powerful
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,688	| IOT065 |	For a certain type
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,992	| IOT065 |	And that type of user is
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,320	| IOT065 |	Savvy and husband you know
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,344	| IOT065 |	Selling these devices
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,624	| IOT065 |	Destroy a long time
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:08,160	| IOT065 |	It's really familiar with what they
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,696	| IOT065 |	They can do it makes a lot of sense for that
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:14,560	| IOT065 |	The dryer user that is maybe just getting their first couple smart bulbs
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:18,144	| IOT065 |	You know what they're trying to accomplish
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,424	| IOT065 |	Specific use case
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,448	| IOT065 |	Navy
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:21,216	| IOT065 |	To determine
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:24,288	| IOT065 |	Burglars with having lights come on at various times
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,312	| IOT065 |	Things like that
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,592	| IOT065 |	That's her to set up
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,104	| IOT065 |	You know
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:29,664	| IOT065 |	The things that maybe we Azhar
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:31,968	| IOT065 |	Like enjoy doing
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,248	| IOT065 |	Give me some kind of TV
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:34,528	| IOT065 |	Incel
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:40,160	| IOT065 |	You know we are we are looking at ways that we can make that easier through machine learning and
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:41,184	| IOT065 |	We
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:43,232	| IOT065 |	Are going to have a string of I think
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:46,816	| IOT065 |	Really interesting product news throughout the year this year and
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:49,632	| IOT065 |	And savenia stay tuned for announcements
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,168	| IOT065 |	Anada in that area
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,704	| IOT065 |	Okay and
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:56,800	| IOT065 |	What will be talked after kind of after the bankruptcy of Corky
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,384	| IOT065 |	You had said that the smart home was taking
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:02,944	| IOT065 |	How to buy Life twists and turns the gist of it was that
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:07,808	| IOT065 |	The pause between some of the products that you guys have planned when you were part of quirky
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,832	| IOT065 |	End
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,368	| IOT065 |	Ability to take that time
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,416	| IOT065 |	After the bankruptcy
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,000	| IOT065 |	To kind of get things right was really welcome
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,792	| IOT065 |	Because the industry was changing so much
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,864	| IOT065 |	Can you talk to me a little bit about
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:24,448	| IOT065 |	What you've seen change and maybe would surprise you
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:31,360	| IOT065 |	Sure I mean I think that your article in your newsletter touchdown this little bit night
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| IOT065 |	I really
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:35,968	| IOT065 |	Agree with the fact I think that this year is going to be
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,016	| IOT065 |	A year of calling to ascertain
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:38,784	| IOT065 |	Next time
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,808	| IOT065 |	I think that
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,856	| IOT065 |	The changes that are going to happen or that
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,160	| IOT065 |	People are
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,184	| IOT065 |	Going to be the last
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| IOT065 |	Interested
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,256	| IOT065 |	Enteritis
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,792	| IOT065 |	Start new
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:52,096	| IOT065 |	Forms and ecosystems
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:54,144	| IOT065 |	And more interested in
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:57,984	| IOT065 |	And taking advantage of the good mature platforms and ecosystems
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,520	| IOT065 |	Is that are out there right now
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,592	| IOT065 |	So I think that this will be the year when
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:08,224	| IOT065 |	When people start concentrating more on those and devices that work with with the sir great platforms
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:08,992	| IOT065 |	Better out there
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:12,064	| IOT065 |	And I think that's a good thing for us and I think I work
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:15,136	| IOT065 |	Racine that reflect in the in the
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:16,416	| IOT065 |	Popularity the platform
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,464	| IOT065 |	Okay
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:22,048	| IOT065 |	Let's think about your platform because in talking to
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:28,704	| IOT065 |	Some other people they look at the platform is having control of the operating system
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:31,520	| IOT065 |	Apple with homekit
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,288	| IOT065 |	Whatever they do
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:32,800	| IOT065 |	Google home
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,872	| IOT065 |	And then the other platform people seem to be keen on Earth
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,664	| IOT065 |	It's jumping out of them it is
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,456	| IOT065 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:44,064	| IOT065 |	You work with some of these things right
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:46,880	| IOT065 |	But you're also trying to be an OS for the home
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:48,160	| IOT065 |	Which Maybe
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,720	| IOT065 |	And I kind of tend to think the smartphone
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,024	| IOT065 |	Is a great sensor but I don't know if I want
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,328	| IOT065 |	My Holmes OS to live there
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,352	| IOT065 |	So I'm curious
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:00,192	| IOT065 |	Where do you place yourself when you're thinking about competitors
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,240	| IOT065 |	Sure
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,008	| IOT065 |	I mean
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,544	| IOT065 |	I try to not think of
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,568	| IOT065 |	Like anyone
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,848	| IOT065 |	Editor like
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:07,616	| IOT065 |	I try to think
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,920	| IOT065 |	Is that you know
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,456	| IOT065 |	About how we can work together first
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:12,992	| IOT065 |	Because
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,040	| IOT065 |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:15,552	| IOT065 |	It's like
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,112	| IOT065 |	Consumers expect and what
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,672	| IOT065 |	The best experiences is
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:21,440	| IOT065 |	If
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:23,232	| IOT065 |	Thing if you can have choice
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:23,744	| IOT065 |	In what year
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:26,048	| IOT065 |	You know and so
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:28,608	| IOT065 |	If there is a way to work together with someone else
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,376	| IOT065 |	You don't we will
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,448	| IOT065 |	We are a neutral party
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:34,240	| IOT065 |	Next time we're not trying to
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,776	| IOT065 |	To compete with our
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:38,080	| IOT065 |	Core Partners Julianna Grace you know
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,616	| IOT065 |	I feel like you mentioned
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:41,152	| IOT065 |	Google like we're not trying to
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:44,480	| IOT065 |	We are just trying to add a layer of functionality
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,016	| IOT065 |	That you know
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,296	| IOT065 |	Consumers
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,368	| IOT065 |	Fun really engaging get a lot of use out of
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,160	| IOT065 |	Whereas
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,928	| IOT065 |	I think
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:55,744	| IOT065 |	A lot of other companies that are are
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:57,536	| IOT065 |	To make platform
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,560	| IOT065 |	How many block forms
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:00,608	| IOT065 |	Du Hast
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:04,192	| IOT065 |	Teacher conflicts that that limit them from offering the same choices
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:07,520	| IOT065 |	That's where we think we have a big advantage
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,336	| IOT065 |	And what about the business model
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:13,408	| IOT065 |	Is your business model going to stay with
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,432	| IOT065 |	Selling like
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,712	| IOT065 |	The relay in the
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:16,224	| IOT065 |	The hug
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,528	| IOT065 |	Or do you see
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,808	| IOT065 |	Something else evolving
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:24,160	| IOT065 |	Siri actually is quite a bit of evolution going on right now
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:27,232	| IOT065 |	Certainly selling Hardware is
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:29,024	| IOT065 |	Straightforward business
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:31,584	| IOT065 |	Something will continue to do
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:32,864	| IOT065 |	But
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:37,472	| IOT065 |	We also work with companies to help them bring connected products to Market
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:42,080	| IOT065 |	You know a lot of companies are entering this is the first time we've got a lot of experience and
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,896	| IOT065 |	You know that's where our boner Flex
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,688	| IOT065 |	Is a really really great
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:48,224	| IOT065 |	Parent company
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:48,992	| IOT065 |	Because
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:49,760	| IOT065 |	They are
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:54,368	| IOT065 |	One of the best if not the best company in the world that manufacturing connected products
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:56,416	| IOT065 |	And so
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:56,928	| IOT065 |	You know we're trying
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:40:00,512	| IOT065 |	Leverage. To offer companies
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:02,304	| IOT065 |	Is that are in the space s you know
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,840	| IOT065 |	Solutions to
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,376	| IOT065 |	Getting products to the market
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,144	| IOT065 |	Quickly
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:12,544	| IOT065 |	And getting products to the market with a built-in ecosystem that already has a big footprint and a lot of support for
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,568	| IOT065 |	Connect another device
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:18,432	| IOT065 |	But beyond that you know we do have other
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:22,016	| IOT065 |	Other ideas as far as business modeling and
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,552	| IOT065 |	Treatise dialysis
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,112	| IOT065 |	What we we spent a lot of hard work
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:27,392	| IOT065 |	End time
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,440	| IOT065 |	Making is hard as a platform ghost
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:35,328	| IOT065 |	And you know that will be something that will probably touch on in our our product updates lettering
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,608	| IOT065 |	Linear
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,888	| IOT065 |	And for the people
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,936	| IOT065 |	The people at home who have awake system
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:44,032	| IOT065 |	Can you share just a couple of your favorite robots or
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:45,568	| IOT065 |	Anna favorite things
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:46,848	| IOT065 |	Do you like yes
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,616	| IOT065 |	Yes let me tell you
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,712	| IOT065 |	Yeah so what am I adding my favorite
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:53,504	| IOT065 |	Is
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:56,320	| IOT065 |	If the smoke detector goes off turn on all the lights
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:59,904	| IOT065 |	Unintuitive things not like what you
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,184	| IOT065 |	Really think of when you start
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:04,000	| IOT065 |	Connecting something makes so much sense I really love that one
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,536	| IOT065 |	Can help people
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:06,816	| IOT065 |	Safer in it
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:07,840	| IOT065 |	It's not a straightforward
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:11,936	| IOT065 |	Another one that I really like is
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,960	| IOT065 |	Is the ability to
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,728	| IOT065 |	Shoe
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:16,288	| IOT065 |	Enable or disable sensors
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,056	| IOT065 |	With the
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:17,568	| IOT065 |	Canary
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,128	| IOT065 |	We can actually trigger
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:23,200	| IOT065 |	With dictionary mode changes
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,784	| IOT065 |	We can turn on and off robots right so
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:29,088	| IOT065 |	The way that I have mine set up at home
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:30,368	| IOT065 |	Is that a sensor
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,392	| IOT065 |	My doors
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,696	| IOT065 |	When I leave the house
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,232	| IOT065 |	Canary goes
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:36,768	| IOT065 |	You know cuz armed
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:41,632	| IOT065 |	It's basically enables the robot that turns on notifications for this sense
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,936	| IOT065 |	So then get the door open
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:45,472	| IOT065 |	You know well
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:46,496	| IOT065 |	I'm not home
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,288	| IOT065 |	Then I'll get a notification
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:50,336	| IOT065 |	But then when I come home then you can I get back
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,895	| IOT065 |	Privacy mode it turns off that robot
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:56,735	| IOT065 |	And so that you know if I walk out on my patio on Holland
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,271	| IOT065 |	Annoyed
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,551	| IOT065 |	Vacations coming
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:00,831	| IOT065 |	Jenna from the sensors
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:04,415	| IOT065 |	Got it in the canary also send you a notification if that door open
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,719	| IOT065 |	Well the canary
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:07,743	| IOT065 |	It doesn't phase
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,023	| IOT065 |	My front door actually face
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:11,583	| IOT065 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:14,911	| IOT065 |	I seasoned it settings on the backyard but you know
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,935	| IOT065 |	I don't really like having
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:19,775	| IOT065 |	I am so with you
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:23,359	| IOT065 |	That's a good one for people who don't like hammers in the all right
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,639	| IOT065 |	I like these ideas
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,199	| IOT065 |	And I think I'll have to go pick up some relays
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:29,503	| IOT065 |	Could you do the intercom
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:33,343	| IOT065 |	Like install a relay in someone else's house or do they have to be on the same network
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,647	| IOT065 |	You absolutely can
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:39,487	| IOT065 |	If you wanted to have a little like tin can with the string you know between
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:42,815	| IOT065 |	Two houses you could absolutely install a relay NH
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:45,375	| IOT065 |	I am taking it might be fine for like
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:46,911	| IOT065 |	A grandparent or something
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,447	| IOT065 |	Be like Bob
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:49,471	| IOT065 |	Mom
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,287	| IOT065 |	Yeah I'm sure she loves that
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:53,823	| IOT065 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:54,847	| IOT065 |	Totally would not
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| IOT065 |	Why did you bring this to my house
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:00,991	| IOT065 |	But it'll kind of a fun
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:05,343	| IOT065 |	Alright thanks so much for coming this week
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:12,255	| IOT065 |	Thank you for having me well that's it for this week's show please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
