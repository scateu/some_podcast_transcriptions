EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,768	| IOT143 |	I know it's a week late
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:41,376	| IOT143 |	Because we knew the FCC last Thursday was going to vote against
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,168	| IOT143 |	For repealing
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,192	| IOT143 |	Neutrality
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:47,264	| IOT143 |	And see what everybody's hot takes
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:51,360	| IOT143 |	As someone who's covered this for almost a decade I kind of felt like
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,664	| IOT143 |	God is there really anything new to say about
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,456	| IOT143 |	The answer is
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:55,968	| IOT143 |	Not
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| IOT143 |	But
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,784	| IOT143 |	For people who are wondering
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| IOT143 |	Net neutrality
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,856	| IOT143 |	I think is important
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,624	| IOT143 |	To the internet
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,440	| IOT143 |	Mostly because we don't know yet
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:10,304	| IOT143 |	How iot is going to play out in one of the things that I've been thinking a lot about
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,072	| IOT143 |	Is
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,376	| IOT143 |	In talking to people that keep asking me about
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| IOT143 |	Low power
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,680	| IOT143 |	Wide area network
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:21,824	| IOT143 |	Soaking cellular companies really screw around with net neutrality if you're working with like nb-iot
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,592	| IOT143 |	Eeyore
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,616	| IOT143 |	Cat 1M
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,920	| IOT143 |	Am I answer to this is
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| IOT143 |	Maybe
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,760	| IOT143 |	And the reason I say this is today these things are low data rate
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,552	| IOT143 |	Works never
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,088	| IOT143 |	You can always
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:35,648	| IOT143 |	Always use more broadband no one has ever said wow
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,440	| IOT143 |	I have got enough
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| IOT143 |	And so
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:43,072	| IOT143 |	The things constraining devices on the edge right now are mostly power relay
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,352	| IOT143 |	And it's
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:48,192	| IOT143 |	Completely possible that we will have Innovations in the next 10 years it will
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:54,592	| IOT143 |	Allow us to not have to charge things all the time or change the batteries which then suddenly with all of this power
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:57,408	| IOT143 |	You can actually leave this on a lot more often
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:00,224	| IOT143 |	And once things are on you wanted to be communicating
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,016	| IOT143 |	Which means it's going to consume
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,040	| IOT143 |	And so
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| IOT143 |	This is how I think about
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,112	| IOT143 |	I look at it as a resource
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,160	| IOT143 |	And right now it's finite because
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| IOT143 |	Power stuff
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,952	| IOT143 |	The Edge is fine
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:12,256	| IOT143 |	But if that turns incident or
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:16,096	| IOT143 |	Then we're going to want to come inside
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| IOT143 |	Increase in bandwidth
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:20,448	| IOT143 |	And that's when we could see carrier start messing around
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,520	| IOT143 |	Data and collinear networks congested
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,544	| IOT143 |	And all of that fun stuff
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,360	| IOT143 |	Charging people for access to
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,128	| IOT143 |	Do certain
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,664	| IOT143 |	In this is where I think
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,200	| IOT143 |	Don't need net
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| IOT143 |	Neutrality
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:38,880	| IOT143 |	I agree with everything you said it's not necessarily a problem right now but it is something we need to be aware of
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,648	| IOT143 |	For the future
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,160	| IOT143 |	Because
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,208	| IOT143 |	Most of these devices are
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| IOT143 |	Creating small bits of
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:49,120	| IOT143 |	So it's not like we're pushing gigabytes of video for example of we need enough of a pipe for that
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,448	| IOT143 |	But we probably don't yet know everything that's
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,472	| IOT143 |	It's going to be connected
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:57,312	| IOT143 |	And we can't then imagine how much data I think is going to need
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| IOT143 |	Right so I agree with you
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,896	| IOT143 |	John that is very pragmatic I think about it now
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,688	| IOT143 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,992	| IOT143 |	Looking at it from stay-at-home perspective
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:11,648	| IOT143 |	What happens when a PSP has its own security system that it sells to customers and you don't want to use
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,696	| IOT143 |	You want to use your own
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:19,071	| IOT143 |	Morty when he's around Hub instead of their Hub and what if they slow down the Gatorade
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,351	| IOT143 |	To your Hobbit
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:24,959	| IOT143 |	Kind of push you towards their product so that to me it's still another problem that this is going to cost
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:25,983	| IOT143 |	Exactly
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,263	| IOT143 |	I totally agree
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,055	| IOT143 |	You're going for immediate issues I'm going
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| IOT143 |	Essentially
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,991	| IOT143 |	We have to just ask ourselves do you want Broadband to be a scarce resource
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:42,623	| IOT143 |	Which is how the telcos want to create it they wanted to be scarce because then they can charge more
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,159	| IOT143 |	For it and that they have the
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| IOT143 |	The power
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,719	| IOT143 |	Totally rational
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:48,767	| IOT143 |	Business perspective
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,815	| IOT143 |	They have adopted a scarcity
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,863	| IOT143 |	Now if you could argue
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| IOT143 |	And I would argue
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| IOT143 |	The Broadband actually shouldn't be scared
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,751	| IOT143 |	It is like access to
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:02,591	| IOT143 |	This is terrible but gasoline and electricity back in the day
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:06,431	| IOT143 |	And because we had abundant access to those resources
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,503	| IOT143 |	What happened is we built entire new Innovations
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:11,807	| IOT143 |	We are reaping the consequences
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,879	| IOT143 |	But we got all the way from
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,903	| IOT143 |	Electricity
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,671	| IOT143 |	Air conditioning
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,951	| IOT143 |	Two refrigerators
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,535	| IOT143 |	The frozen dinners to being able to store vaccines I mean
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,815	| IOT143 |	Look at how
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,095	| IOT143 |	1
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,887	| IOT143 |	Abundant resource
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,399	| IOT143 |	Changes the
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:31,775	| IOT143 |	Just added that picture at this air-conditioning itself is what help
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| IOT143 |	People
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| IOT143 |	Migrate in the United States down south
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:35,871	| IOT143 |	Really
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,687	| IOT143 |	I'd like population areas and we created massive cities down there in
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,271	| IOT143 |	So it's a
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,551	| IOT143 |	Probably picture stamp
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,831	| IOT143 |	The impact is huge
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,111	| IOT143 |	So yes
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:50,463	| IOT143 |	Broadband should be an abundant resource I think we've moved past the time frame when it
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,231	| IOT143 |	Could be scarce
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,023	| IOT143 |	Resource and also look what happened with
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:57,887	| IOT143 |	Cellular carriers I mean remember how is a great example of be texting in Europe
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,655	| IOT143 |	Versus text
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:05,311	| IOT143 |	We because texting plans were charged per text we never developed much of a texting culture until they be
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,591	| IOT143 |	Unlimited plans
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| IOT143 |	Where is in Europe
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,919	| IOT143 |	It was actually much cheaper to do that then
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,455	| IOT143 |	Roma data
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,991	| IOT143 |	So people texted me
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,551	| IOT143 |	Economic incentives are huge
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:21,951	| IOT143 |	I think broadband's probably in a place where we will develop around it because we are getting closer with things like 5G and
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,767	| IOT143 |	Buy 5G fixed Wireless over millimeter waves
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:28,095	| IOT143 |	But it's worth thinking about you guys and
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:35,519	| IOT143 |	It is frustrating My Hope Is that there's two last chances for the repeal to not happen and that is one
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,103	| IOT143 |	Many many states have filed lawsuits to kind of block it
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,383	| IOT143 |	And to their
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:45,503	| IOT143 |	Could be a congressional review of it as well as which could overturn the passage of it so
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,039	| IOT143 |	Best eyewear We Stand today
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,087	| IOT143 |	And Marsha Blackburn did
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| IOT143 |	Introduce a bill
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:53,439	| IOT143 |	It is not a bill that is actually helping
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| IOT143 |	Preserve net neutrality
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| IOT143 |	It is
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| IOT143 |	Gary Career Center
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:01,887	| IOT143 |	Keep an eye out for Chuck Schumer a Democrat has said that he will also
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,911	| IOT143 |	Try to file a bill
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,751	| IOT143 |	So maybe we will see actual Congressional legislation
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| IOT143 |	Around
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,287	| IOT143 |	Net neutrality
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,335	| IOT143 |	Which is a direct result of a lack of broadband
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:10,847	| IOT143 |	Competition
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| IOT143 |	Now
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:15,967	| IOT143 |	Let's talk about things that consume a lot of broadband and frankly
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,479	| IOT143 |	Are tariffs
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:21,855	| IOT143 |	What is happening as part of a Crackdown in
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,391	| IOT143 |	Dissident activity
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,159	| IOT143 |	Ivy
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,183	| IOT143 |	Uyghurs
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:25,951	| IOT143 |	In China
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| IOT143 |	They have
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,767	| IOT143 |	Put digital surveillance systems
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,791	| IOT143 |	With cameras
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,815	| IOT143 |	Using facial recognition
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,631	| IOT143 |	Addition to track people and then they detain them and
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,655	| IOT143 |	People disappear
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:38,751	| IOT143 |	This ties directly into Chinese efforts around
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,543	| IOT143 |	Lissie when was it
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:46,687	| IOT143 |	Kevin we talked about this earlier it was in China where your
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:50,527	| IOT143 |	Considered a loyal truthful respectable person versus not
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:57,439	| IOT143 |	Yes and so this is an example of the power of the Internet of Things used I would argue for
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:02,559	| IOT143 |	What happens if you do now because of the compute power the sensors and
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,583	| IOT143 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,887	| IOT143 |	We have the capability to track a citizen
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,167	| IOT143 |	Everywhere they go
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,935	| IOT143 |	Endnote
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,983	| IOT143 |	Everything they do in
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| IOT143 |	That
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,287	| IOT143 |	We have to establish rules are
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| IOT143 |	Because
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,847	| IOT143 |	My God it's so
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| IOT143 |	The word
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,151	| IOT143 |	Severe
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,663	| IOT143 |	That
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,455	| IOT143 |	In the article anyway
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,759	| IOT143 |	They say as soon as you stepped foot in
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,575	| IOT143 |	The city whatever City it is that's under surveillance
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| IOT143 |	They know you're there
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:28,671	| IOT143 |	Like almost immediately that's how
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,463	| IOT143 |	Instantaneous this all is
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:35,583	| IOT143 |	In this implementation you have to engage with these systems to do everything from buying gas to pass
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| IOT143 |	Not volunteer
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| IOT143 |	End
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,983	| IOT143 |	It is not necessarily even
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| IOT143 |	Visible
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,263	| IOT143 |	To the citizen
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| IOT143 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,943	| IOT143 |	It's a long but well worth
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| IOT143 |	Reading article
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:56,063	| IOT143 |	Rather scary unfortunately for the IT industry
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:01,183	| IOT143 |	This is going to be another one of those horror stories of people say this is why we shouldn't have everything connected
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| IOT143 |	That's unfortunate
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,999	| IOT143 |	But I can understand why people would say that
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:11,935	| IOT143 |	What a downer show what a downer show this is yesterday Facebook
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:14,495	| IOT143 |	Our government is creating a database of faces
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| IOT143 |	As part of
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,799	| IOT143 |	New license
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:19,359	| IOT143 |	Shepherd so the FBI now has a database of it
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,431	| IOT143 |	Many people's faces because of new state licenses
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,967	| IOT143 |	Driver's licenses
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,735	| IOT143 |	Now
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,551	| IOT143 |	What is also interesting in parallel to any state
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,087	| IOT143 |	Efforts we have
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:29,855	| IOT143 |	Facebook
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,903	| IOT143 |	Which just announced this week
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,439	| IOT143 |	That they can
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,487	| IOT143 |	Recognize you in pictures and
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:38,303	| IOT143 |	They will send you an e-mail when you appear even if you are
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,119	| IOT143 |	Which many people will be like
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:44,191	| IOT143 |	That's nice because sometimes I just don't
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:48,031	| IOT143 |	Me to find the victim of stalking even if I'm not tagged I want my picture off Facebook
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:52,639	| IOT143 |	What is scary as all get-out is Facebook nose
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,919	| IOT143 |	Who many people
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,687	| IOT143 |	Pilar
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| IOT143 |	That is also
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,247	| IOT143 |	Quite scary
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:01,855	| IOT143 |	Facebook is not using this necessarily to Tamp down religious beliefs but
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| IOT143 |	Start in town
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:05,951	| IOT143 |	State activism but you know it could be an agent
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,511	| IOT143 |	On behalf of a government if it wants to work
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| IOT143 |	Country okay
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:15,935	| IOT143 |	The scary part is and I have long been a Facebook user so you know I'm I'm guilty as well
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,495	| IOT143 |	We've been providing
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,055	| IOT143 |	Facebook the smarts the data itself
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,591	| IOT143 |	I previously tagging people
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:25,663	| IOT143 |	Right it's to the point now where it's recognizing
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,687	| IOT143 |	Yeah my wife isn't it
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,271	| IOT143 |	Picture and you know it's just kind of our own fault
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| IOT143 |	It is
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,319	| IOT143 |	But I would say
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,367	| IOT143 |	Facebook is providing one thing
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,927	| IOT143 |	Community whatever
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,487	| IOT143 |	When it's actually monetizing
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,023	| IOT143 |	Building a business
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:41,535	| IOT143 |	I'm completely
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,119	| IOT143 |	And that's actually a really interesting element
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| IOT143 |	Wishing this
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:53,055	| IOT143 |	They're usually do lames in any product so a product
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,079	| IOT143 |	Invisible Hardware
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,663	| IOT143 |	Consumer perspective is trying to serve you by offering
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,687	| IOT143 |	Who sings but you are
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| IOT143 |	Also
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,223	| IOT143 |	Helping
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| IOT143 |	The development of that product
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,551	| IOT143 |	And you may not understand exact
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,367	| IOT143 |	And that doesn't have to be bad
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,903	| IOT143 |	It doesn't have to be
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,951	| IOT143 |	Evil and it's not clear
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,767	| IOT143 |	There's a lot of distress right now for Facebook
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| IOT143 |	They're not picking up
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:18,655	| IOT143 |	You know dissidence off the street and putting them in prison or killing them so
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,679	| IOT143 |	Cello bar
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:27,615	| IOT143 |	But they're building the tools and supporting the tools that they could be used to do that by somebody else
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,687	| IOT143 |	That's computer vision
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,735	| IOT143 |	It's something we really need to start talking about
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,527	| IOT143 |	About and we need to talk about it specifically
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:35,807	| IOT143 |	Around these issues
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,111	| IOT143 |	Also data correlation
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:40,159	| IOT143 |	Once we have all this crazy data
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,975	| IOT143 |	Computers once I can see more things
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,255	| IOT143 |	They can
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,791	| IOT143 |	Amass a lot more data
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,607	| IOT143 |	Wish that can be searched and correlated very quickly
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,911	| IOT143 |	And that is a powerful thing I think we have
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,983	| IOT143 |	Another example of that is Google Street View
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:12:00,127	| IOT143 |	Apparently now Google Street View can determine how areas vote based on the cars that are
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,175	| IOT143 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:08,575	| IOT143 |	I read through this article is very interesting and it's not facial recognition but still recognition of something about people
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,855	| IOT143 |	Their choice of vehicle
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,879	| IOT143 |	You know and then
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| IOT143 |	Basically using the data
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:16,255	| IOT143 |	From the street view car as I drive around seeing which vehicles cars trucks
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,791	| IOT143 |	Etc are in a neighborhood
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:22,911	| IOT143 |	They can pretty much estimate if they lean left or right in the u.s. democrat-republican Etc
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,703	| IOT143 |	And it's uncannily accurate
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:29,055	| IOT143 |	Yes and this isn't actually all that new like there's been surveys in the past likes
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,079	| IOT143 |	Democrats drive Subaru
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,103	| IOT143 |	In general
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,455	| IOT143 |	So Republicans generally drive pickup trucks and we can actually
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| IOT143 |	That is not a crazy
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| IOT143 |	Correlation to make
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,855	| IOT143 |	Maybe not 100% accurate at the individual level but at the broad level
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| IOT143 |	It is in
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,927	| IOT143 |	So this is just basically
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,207	| IOT143 |	Pulling this data
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,999	| IOT143 |	At a massive level
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,279	| IOT143 |	Correlating it and then
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,303	| IOT143 |	Sending out
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,583	| IOT143 |	Useful insight
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,631	| IOT143 |	Siri
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,191	| IOT143 |	All right let's do something a little less distant
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:00,031	| IOT143 |	Where did he born
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| IOT143 |	And
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:07,199	| IOT143 |	Iota Iota which you've written about blockchain many many times for the past several years so you are probably soon
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:12,063	| IOT143 |	I know you're with Iota I was not until very recently because I start a little altar
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,111	| IOT143 |	Coin investment strategy just for fun
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,671	| IOT143 |	Tell me to disclose that actually own
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:20,255	| IOT143 |	.025 5 Iota tokens right now
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,303	| IOT143 |	Which is worth next to nothing but
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,863	| IOT143 |	By investing in it I learned that
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:29,983	| IOT143 |	It's rather interesting use of blockchain because it's device-to-device transactions worth
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,751	| IOT143 |	With
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:34,335	| IOT143 |	Currency all currency that uses blockchain is typically
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| IOT143 |	People transaction
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:39,199	| IOT143 |	Buying something for somebody your exchanging currency at cetera
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:44,063	| IOT143 |	But this is device-to-device so this is like the blockchain for IRT apparently it's
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,623	| IOT143 |	Stun over 10 billion dollars worth of
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:49,439	| IOT143 |	Transactions already so I did not know about it but it
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:55,583	| IOT143 |	Been around for a couple years now and recently they just earlier this week rather Robert Bosch venture capital
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,679	| IOT143 |	Invested I don't know how much but invested enough to make news
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,959	| IOT143 |	In Iota token so
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:06,847	| IOT143 |	An example of how Iota would work would be power a car with a ton of sleep
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,871	| IOT143 |	Pay for Town parking
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:13,503	| IOT143 |	So take our two parking meter transaction for example that would use the Iota blockchain and
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:19,903	| IOT143 |	No human interaction needed so it's something that I'm looking into a little further but against a so you probably heard this
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,183	| IOT143 |	Before I have
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,463	| IOT143 |	No
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,767	| IOT143 |	What's interesting is I've written about
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,815	| IOT143 |	There are two things that are really great about
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,095	| IOT143 |	Just probably the black sheep
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,655	| IOT143 |	Wishes that it's distributed
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,983	| IOT143 |	Countability so
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:37,567	| IOT143 |	The distributed nature of it is scalable which is awesome for iot
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,871	| IOT143 |	Trillian
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,895	| IOT143 |	Billions of sensors
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:45,503	| IOT143 |	And the accountability is good because I passed her security and Trust which is important
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,015	| IOT143 |	Things like Mike
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:50,111	| IOT143 |	So is far back is like 2014 I've been
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:50,879	| IOT143 |	Talking to people
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,647	| IOT143 |	Like IBM

EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,183	| IOT143 |	About
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,719	| IOT143 |	How to develop
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,279	| IOT143 |	Blockchain based Technologies for
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,559	| IOT143 |	Device to device
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,327	| IOT143 |	Microtrans
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,095	| IOT143 |	Actions
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,399	| IOT143 |	And IBM had a platform for this
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:05,215	| IOT143 |	I think it went anywhere but it is part of
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,263	| IOT143 |	That demo that you saw her
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,287	| IOT143 |	The parking
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,359	| IOT143 |	It's also things like your washing machine
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,639	| IOT143 |	Initially
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,919	| IOT143 |	At CES in nice
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:18,271	| IOT143 |	2015 Samsung and IBM shut off a washing machine that can order its own detergent
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,295	| IOT143 |	Based on their
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| IOT143 |	Technology they're watching
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| IOT143 |	Which was not
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:24,159	| IOT143 |	There's also a network
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,439	| IOT143 |	Company called filament
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:27,231	| IOT143 |	They're using it to share data
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,279	| IOT143 |	Cross very small
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,327	| IOT143 |	Proprietary Wireless net
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,863	| IOT143 |	It works and they do it
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| IOT143 |	As a way to
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,911	| IOT143 |	Distribute
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,447	| IOT143 |	Signals when there's no cellular
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:40,031	| IOT143 |	There's also a security company for the industrial
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:43,103	| IOT143 |	She called sage that I wrote about this week they're using the blockchain to track
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,895	| IOT143 |	Data requests across the system
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| IOT143 |	And then there's an algorithm called
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,479	| IOT143 |	Shamir's secret sharing
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:52,831	| IOT143 |	And that is another distributed way to scatter data and then reconstructed
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,599	| IOT143 |	Set from different now
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,367	| IOT143 |	Notes
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,647	| IOT143 |	What's important to note
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:59,487	| IOT143 |	For any of these to be useful these blockchain-based kind of Micro Center
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,511	| IOT143 |	Security whatever
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,559	| IOT143 |	You need to combine the blockchain
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,863	| IOT143 |	And there's various forms of that iota
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT143 |	Bitcoin ethereum
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,423	| IOT143 |	Whatever
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,471	| IOT143 |	With other technology
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,287	| IOT143 |	You just can't just be like black magic
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,823	| IOT143 |	File transfer
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| IOT143 |	Yeah you need
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:19,455	| IOT143 |	No it's eating people verified
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:25,855	| IOT143 |	Directions and keeping track of things and misses what the miners are doing when they're mining for Bitcoin for example their cream
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,135	| IOT143 |	Reading more blocks
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,159	| IOT143 |	On the chain
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,183	| IOT143 |	Or verifying am I
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,975	| IOT143 |	I should say it's more technically accurate
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,743	| IOT143 |	And you have to pay them
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:32,767	| IOT143 |	Because
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:36,351	| IOT143 |	They're using their electricity Computing time so
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,399	| IOT143 |	It's a whole infrastructure needs to be built
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,703	| IOT143 |	Nachos you can decide use blockchain
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,751	| IOT143 |	Well so some of them are
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,519	| IOT143 |	And I guess
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| IOT143 |	Iota works that way
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:47,103	| IOT143 |	Some of them are actually
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:49,407	| IOT143 |	Like hyperledger is actually internal to a
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,479	| IOT143 |	So these standards are the company can develop in
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,247	| IOT143 |	Control
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,527	| IOT143 |	The issuance of Tokyo
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,831	| IOT143 |	Because they don't want actually
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,343	| IOT143 |	External
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,415	| IOT143 |	Different ways of doing
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,719	| IOT143 |	And I was actually just tell you about the tech
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| IOT143 |	This happened
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,607	| IOT143 |	That's basically
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,655	| IOT143 |	Kids keeping a record of something happening
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,935	| IOT143 |	So
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:15,263	| IOT143 |	There's a lot here in this was kind of maybe not the world's best over
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,615	| IOT143 |	I have long believed that watching has an important role to play
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,383	| IOT143 |	And IRT
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,431	| IOT143 |	And I have kept an eye on iota
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,479	| IOT143 |	And now that Kevin's invested High
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,271	| IOT143 |	Ask him all my questions
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,063	| IOT143 |	I think it's worth $0.07.
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,415	| IOT143 |	All right he's not quitting his day job
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:32,927	| IOT143 |	Or his
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| IOT143 |	Wednesday morning Joe
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,791	| IOT143 |	Okay let's move on to some news
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,607	| IOT143 |	Let's do this really quickly so
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,143	| IOT143 |	People really like the echo spot
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:48,287	| IOT143 |	Echo spot is the hundred and $29 camera I don't know what it is right now cuz Amazon probably has a smoking hot deal ahead of the house
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,591	| IOT143 |	This is a tiny little
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,919	| IOT143 |	Screen that shows you what the weather in a clock face
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,991	| IOT143 |	Curly videos but not yet YouTube videos
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,783	| IOT143 |	Nope
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,599	| IOT143 |	Don't take that show Amazon Prime video
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,135	| IOT143 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,415	| IOT143 |	In IMG
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,463	| IOT143 |	Surprised because I would never want
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,231	| IOT143 |	A camera
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:07,743	| IOT143 |	Because this thing has
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,023	| IOT143 |	By my bed
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,839	| IOT143 |	Well I'm in the bed
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:18,239	| IOT143 |	Inside is a good place for a device like this yes so the camera is an issue there I mean you could have this
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:20,543	| IOT143 |	Maybe in your kitchen or somewhere else it would be okay
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,127	| IOT143 |	There we go
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| IOT143 |	This is a round 2.5 inch display and
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:33,599	| IOT143 |	Amazon is touting it as hell you can watch Amazon video on it or you can view your webcam and so on so forth
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:37,695	| IOT143 |	I just don't see the point of that on a 2.5 inch display but
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:42,815	| IOT143 |	Chances are you have another better display for that you had your phone in your hand which has a
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,863	| IOT143 |	456 inch display
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,655	| IOT143 |	Maybe you bought the show
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,935	| IOT143 |	Video of tablets
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,703	| IOT143 |	Around the house
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,263	| IOT143 |	Tell me this is more of a solution
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,055	| IOT143 |	Persuasion
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,615	| IOT143 |	Yes I do
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,895	| IOT143 |	Let's give that to him
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,919	| IOT143 |	And
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,687	| IOT143 |	Blink
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,223	| IOT143 |	The maker of a
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,759	| IOT143 |	Smart home camera that we talked about
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:05,087	| IOT143 |	They have created a $99 video
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,367	| IOT143 |	Doorbell and
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:10,719	| IOT143 |	This is part of this influx of Cheaper Gadget so we talked about the wise camera that was
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| IOT143 |	Matthew 13
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:20,447	| IOT143 |	Basically the doorbell will cost you $99 or $129 if
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:25,055	| IOT143 |	If you need to Blink sync module so I don't have a lot to say about this people seem like
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:25,823	| IOT143 |	It's a
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,335	| IOT143 |	Good
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,615	| IOT143 |	Deal
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,895	| IOT143 |	Everybody has a doorbell
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:32,735	| IOT143 |	Typically they've been priced at 2:50 or $200
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,295	| IOT143 |	So this actually really is going to put a lot of pressure
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| IOT143 |	Ring skybell
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,111	| IOT143 |	August
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,623	| IOT143 |	Nest
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:39,903	| IOT143 |	Who's got a Toradol coming out
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,207	| IOT143 |	But worth looking at
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:46,815	| IOT143 |	People apparently it's got a live video stream motion sensor two-way audio and night vision
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,607	| IOT143 |	And it can't run
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,143	| IOT143 |	On batteries or
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,727	| IOT143 |	Two Double AA lithium batteries or you can hardwire
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,775	| IOT143 |	So it's pretty awesome
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:59,103	| IOT143 |	Actually yeah I know it's got all the features that most of the other
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,383	| IOT143 |	Smart doorbell
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:02,687	| IOT143 |	Cameras have and it is at least half the
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:08,319	| IOT143 |	Price so you're right it's going to put pressure on the other folks maybe they'll say we've got a better service or
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:14,719	| IOT143 |	Peanut because lotteries have monitoring plans and so on so forth capturing the data saved in the cloud making clips and all that will have to see but
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,607	| IOT143 |	That's your right is going to put pressure on it reveals
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,119	| IOT143 |	Is a strong
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,143	| IOT143 |	All right
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,679	| IOT143 |	So that is available
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:24,703	| IOT143 |	Pre-order
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:25,983	| IOT143 |	I want that chicken
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:31,615	| IOT143 |	Electricity consumption of iot devices I'm putting this in the panic
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,639	| IOT143 |	Except
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,663	| IOT143 |	There is a
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,175	| IOT143 |	Computing cost for
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,455	| IOT143 |	Listen we should pay attention
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:42,367	| IOT143 |	So the communications industry could use 20% of all the world's electricity by 2025 according to
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,135	| IOT143 |	To a nuke
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:45,439	| IOT143 |	Paper by us researchers
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,999	| IOT143 |	It is not yet published but this is from the guardian
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,279	| IOT143 |	They think that
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:55,679	| IOT143 |	Information and communication technology ICT to create up to 3.5% of global emissions by 22
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:58,239	| IOT143 |	20 surpassing Aviation and shipping
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| IOT143 |	Is huge
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,519	| IOT143 |	That is
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:00,543	| IOT143 |	That is
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,079	| IOT143 |	The
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:06,687	| IOT143 |	Global Computing demand from Smart TV surveillance cameras video streaming
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:09,759	| IOT143 |	Blah blah blah is increasing by 20%
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,527	| IOT143 |	A year
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:14,111	| IOT143 |	And just to add to this one because we talked about blockchain earlier in the show
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:18,720	| IOT143 |	I haven't seen a different article that said blockchain mining right now is
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| IOT143 |	Do you think
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,280	| IOT143 |	More electricity than five
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,072	| IOT143 |	Nations in their small
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT143 |	They're not dirty
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:33,824	| IOT143 |	Totally understand that but still it's a scary Prospect me start thinking about how much juice is being used in the emission
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,848	| IOT143 |	Airport
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:38,688	| IOT143 |	Okay we also have news for wink
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,712	| IOT143 |	And sodas lovers
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,992	| IOT143 |	Which is
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| IOT143 |	Me
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,064	| IOT143 |	Kevin yes now works with
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| IOT143 |	WIC
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,600	| IOT143 |	And Kevin
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,112	| IOT143 |	Tell us lyrics
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:53,024	| IOT143 |	Yeah it works really well I mean it just like any other connected device in your wake up it will appear once you're at it
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,560	| IOT143 |	And then you can create
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:59,424	| IOT143 |	Triggers and robots and things like I said a robot up that when I come to my office at night and
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:03,264	| IOT143 |	Voice control my lights turn the lights on that the Sonos automatically plays
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:07,104	| IOT143 |	What turns into one of my favorite XM radio channels and just starts playing
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:12,480	| IOT143 |	So I don't know we had a question on the voicemail couple months back about somebody wanting to do something similar
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:18,112	| IOT143 |	When she walk into her house she want her son us to start playing well you could do that now if you had the right locking
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,904	| IOT143 |	Dwayne can do it
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,184	| IOT143 |	She had the August lock
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,744	| IOT143 |	Which means that she actually could
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,536	| IOT143 |	Now integrated with wink
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,560	| IOT143 |	And have herself
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,656	| IOT143 |	So there you go yay technology will provide
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:36,032	| IOT143 |	Let me ask you because most of my Sonos Integrations only play like a favorite station
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,056	| IOT143 |	I assume
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,336	| IOT143 |	You have to set
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,872	| IOT143 |	Does it automatically play
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,944	| IOT143 |	Just whatever the default favorite is or can you set a favor
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,272	| IOT143 |	You can set a favorite for that robot
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,368	| IOT143 |	Let's move on
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:54,464	| IOT143 |	Question Public Service answering mood answer

EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,368	| IOT143 |	Religiously
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,648	| IOT143 |	Here's my question
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,184	| IOT143 |	And please forgive me a
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,768	| IOT143 |	I've got a tiny apartment in LA with
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,560	| IOT143 |	100 square foot
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:33,632	| IOT143 |	That's far it's outfitted with Hue lighting
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,448	| IOT143 |	And WeMo smart plugs and switches
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:38,752	| IOT143 |	Which I control via no less than
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,544	| IOT143 |	Three Google home devices
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,824	| IOT143 |	Occasionally enamel
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,640	| IOT143 |	Yes there are really
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,920	| IOT143 |	This mini digital assistant
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:47,456	| IOT143 |	In my small space
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,784	| IOT143 |	Everything is integrated and occasionally alternate
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,832	| IOT143 |	To ask for stringify to fill in the gaps
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,368	| IOT143 |	My question is this
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,928	| IOT143 |	What would the advantage
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,976	| IOT143 |	Set up a Smart Hub
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| IOT143 |	Be in my setup
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,024	| IOT143 |	If any
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,072	| IOT143 |	Is it just a matter of
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,840	| IOT143 |	Speed
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,608	| IOT143 |	That is rude
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,376	| IOT143 |	Reducing latency
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,424	| IOT143 |	She or are there other benefits
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,704	| IOT143 |	Smart home hub I should get
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,800	| IOT143 |	At this juncture I don't see the necessity of one
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,336	| IOT143 |	Hoping you can shut
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,616	| IOT143 |	For me
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,640	| IOT143 |	Thanks in advance
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,664	| IOT143 |	Happiest
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,176	| IOT143 |	Holidays today
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,504	| IOT143 |	Okay Chris that is an excellent
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,016	| IOT143 |	Question
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,296	| IOT143 |	It's at
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:26,368	| IOT143 |	It is so good that I'm going to tell you you don't actually need
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:26,880	| IOT143 |	Itsmarta
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,416	| IOT143 |	If you are content
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:30,464	| IOT143 |	What's your setup do not bring in
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:33,792	| IOT143 |	More devices more complexity and above all more hubs
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:39,936	| IOT143 |	The only reason I would do it if I were you is if I wanted to do something with sensors because hubs will open the wide world
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:43,008	| IOT143 |	Have sensors so if you want to automate your lights
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,312	| IOT143 |	And have them turn on would like a closet door
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:48,128	| IOT143 |	Opens for if you want a temperature
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,664	| IOT143 |	Change to set something up
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| IOT143 |	Ascent
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,456	| IOT143 |	You would need a hug
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:56,064	| IOT143 |	Yeah I just I literally just had this conversation with a neighbor the other day
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,832	| IOT143 |	And
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:00,416	| IOT143 |	He was wondering why some things he could control through his Echo
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,696	| IOT143 |	Where is other things he couldn't
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:05,792	| IOT143 |	And I said we got to have a hug for certain things so
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:11,168	| IOT143 |	Going to your point Stacy if you're going to add other things such as sensors or maybe a smart door lock
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:14,240	| IOT143 |	What you want to simplify and there's nothing wrong with
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,008	| IOT143 |	Iftin
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:15,776	| IOT143 |	Stringify
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,824	| IOT143 |	If you want to just do it in one app
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,640	| IOT143 |	You get an app with your hug when you can
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,176	| IOT143 |	Create your automations that way
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,944	| IOT143 |	So
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:26,272	| IOT143 |	I agree it's probably not necessary unless you're going to add more things
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:31,648	| IOT143 |	Okay now if you want to play and go a little nuts
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,672	| IOT143 |	Go right ahead
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,208	| IOT143 |	It might be a question is Chris
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:36,000	| IOT143 |	Why do you have so many smartass
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,048	| IOT143 |	In your eyes
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:42,912	| IOT143 |	That's more smart assistance per square foot than I've ever heard I'm impressed
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,984	| IOT143 |	All right that rounds out the news portion of Today Show

EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,728	| IOT143 |	With Mozilla
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,264	| IOT143 |	Hi Janice how are you doing
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| IOT143 |	Thanks for having me on
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:56,128	| IOT143 |	I am super excited so you
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,408	| IOT143 |	Are a human
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,688	| IOT143 |	Computer
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| IOT143 |	Interaction
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,992	| IOT143 |	Research scientist specifically
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,296	| IOT143 |	Specifically
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:06,368	| IOT143 |	What's called usable privacy and this means
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:08,160	| IOT143 |	Privacy and how people interact with things
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:15,072	| IOT143 |	Got it this is going to be a fun conversation because
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:19,168	| IOT143 |	In general I feel like The Internet of Things is a privacy nightmare
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,192	| IOT143 |	It's not even waiting
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,472	| IOT143 |	And it is
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,496	| IOT143 |	Right now
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:25,056	| IOT143 |	So in terms of privacy
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,336	| IOT143 |	It's one of these things that she
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:29,664	| IOT143 |	Really difficult right cuz like when you are trying to go out
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,944	| IOT143 |	Buy some connected
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,456	| IOT143 |	Device
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:34,272	| IOT143 |	It's probably because you have some kind of use case
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,064	| IOT143 |	Like you want to make it
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:38,368	| IOT143 |	Easier to turn your lights on
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,160	| IOT143 |	Control your thermostat
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,720	| IOT143 |	From upstairs but having to come back downstairs
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,048	| IOT143 |	So usually there's a reason why
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,608	| IOT143 |	People want to buy a bunch of connected things
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| IOT143 |	And
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,656	| IOT143 |	Trying to figure out
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,960	| IOT143 |	The Privacy that goes along with it is pretty much a
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,264	| IOT143 |	Because right now we have
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,056	| IOT143 |	What kind of a legal regime
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,104	| IOT143 |	For privacy in the United States
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,640	| IOT143 |	Space
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,688	| IOT143 |	And so the way this works is
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:05,248	| IOT143 |	If a company posts a privacy policy
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,784	| IOT143 |	At three matches all they really have
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,856	| IOT143 |	Legal perspective
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,672	| IOT143 |	Government normal person perspective
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,464	| IOT143 |	We know that no one reads privacy
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:23,168	| IOT143 |	Trying to even decipher or understand anything about leaving
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,192	| IOT143 |	Did the Bison
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,984	| IOT143 |	What is connected to the internet
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,520	| IOT143 |	You know where it's going and who's using it
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,824	| IOT143 |	So the way I view
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,616	| IOT143 |	Privacy is really looking at
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,920	| IOT143 |	How can you explain things
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,224	| IOT143 |	Normal people
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,528	| IOT143 |	Can understand and then make decisions
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,136	| IOT143 |	Where's relevant in context
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:47,744	| IOT143 |	And actually have some real control over your data and
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:53,888	| IOT143 |	Space
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,704	| IOT143 |	Okay so let's
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,728	| IOT143 |	Dive Right In
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,752	| IOT143 |	With the big challenge
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,032	| IOT143 |	Because
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,568	| IOT143 |	I think you did a good job explaining like
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,616	| IOT143 |	Oh my gosh if I'm buying a Kinect
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:08,736	| IOT143 |	The thermostat and I'm going to see that notice and consent thing on the thermostat which is a terrible place to read 40
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| IOT143 |	Is right
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:12,832	| IOT143 |	It's also I think
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:15,648	| IOT143 |	You hit on something a little bit more subtle witches
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:17,952	| IOT143 |	If you're buying these things in their use case to
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:18,720	| IOT143 |	Dependent
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:21,792	| IOT143 |	The Privacy impact of it may depend on
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:25,632	| IOT143 |	That particular use case like I may not mind
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,424	| IOT143 |	The company that makes
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,472	| IOT143 |	My light switch knowing that I got up and
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,264	| IOT143 |	Turn off the lights at 8 at night
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:35,616	| IOT143 |	But then there's another layer to that which is if I connect that light switch to light
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,384	| IOT143 |	My garage door
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,176	| IOT143 |	Then that company
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:40,224	| IOT143 |	I might also know when I've actually left
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,248	| IOT143 |	My house
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,552	| IOT143 |	There is this concept
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:49,440	| IOT143 |	I guess it's a changing use case as you connect more devices this sort of
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,464	| IOT143 |	Privacy in the
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:52,000	| IOT143 |	Data that's available to pee
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,768	| IOT143 |	People about you be
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:53,536	| IOT143 |	Becomes a lot
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:56,352	| IOT143 |	I'm curious what you're thinking about
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,632	| IOT143 |	How to deal with
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:58,912	| IOT143 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| IOT143 |	You're absolutely right
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:03,776	| IOT143 |	He's just having one single data point like light switch on
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:09,664	| IOT143 |	In the whole ocean of data that's available but that's not
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,432	| IOT143 |	Usually the goal
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:13,760	| IOT143 |	The goal of most companies as well as
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:17,344	| IOT143 |	Everything else that you are interacting with in terms of the iot platform
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,392	| IOT143 |	The gold companies
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,672	| IOT143 |	Typically class
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,696	| IOT143 |	Information
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT143 |	Overtime
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:25,536	| IOT143 |	Bacon do fancy machine learning things
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,072	| IOT143 |	Nowadays
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| IOT143 |	Remove docker from Jessie
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:28,608	| IOT143 |	Having
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,960	| IOT143 |	Now everything is artificial intelligence
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT143 |	And so
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,264	| IOT143 |	But they do that's collected
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,824	| IOT143 |	You may think it's pretty innocuous
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:41,920	| IOT143 |	Or low risk
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:44,480	| IOT143 |	Combining
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,504	| IOT143 |	Aldi's differ
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,784	| IOT143 |	Sources of data
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,856	| IOT143 |	That begins to help other people
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,904	| IOT143 |	Accompanies developer really
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:55,744	| IOT143 |	Detail picture of the going-ons inside of your house
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,792	| IOT143 |	Right now consumers are worried about the
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,560	| IOT143 |	Their privacy
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,352	| IOT143 |	Why do companies
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,120	| IOT143 |	Wanted
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:01,888	| IOT143 |	Information
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,424	| IOT143 |	There's a couple goals
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| IOT143 |	What are the goals obviously
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,984	| IOT143 |	Is make money
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,776	| IOT143 |	By either selling more products
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,312	| IOT143 |	Or selling services
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,360	| IOT143 |	To go along with your product
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,664	| IOT143 |	For example if you have an S
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:16,480	| IOT143 |	Ask him if you want to save your videos
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:17,760	| IOT143 |	And you have to subscribe
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| IOT143 |	That you have data storage
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,112	| IOT143 |	Further down like
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,136	| IOT143 |	Bigger picture
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:23,904	| IOT143 |	Issue is
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:27,744	| IOT143 |	Making money through being able to profile you and or sell you
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,304	| IOT143 |	And I think it's a lot of data
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,584	| IOT143 |	Now is
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,632	| IOT143 |	It's kind of based on a
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,144	| IOT143 |	Hope in a
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:39,008	| IOT143 |	Figure out some cool things to do with it later
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:42,336	| IOT143 |	And that's kind of like the worst way to have dinner
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,640	| IOT143 |	You don't have a specific goal
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:46,688	| IOT143 |	Is just by collecting a lot of it and
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,712	| IOT143 |	Get around
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,992	| IOT143 |	That's where you open
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:51,040	| IOT143 |	Companies open themselves up to a lot of risk
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:54,368	| IOT143 |	Because everyone has data breaches all the time
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:32:00,768	| IOT143 |	As a counter argument to that a lot of the current advances in machine learning
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,536	| IOT143 |	Been made
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:06,400	| IOT143 |	One because hey we got more powerful in a parallel processing in gpus but two
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,960	| IOT143 |	Because we have a lot of this data of
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,728	| IOT143 |	Available
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:13,312	| IOT143 |	And so in some sense and I'm curious what happened
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,080	| IOT143 |	Pens as we
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,384	| IOT143 |	Double down on AI and machine
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,432	| IOT143 |	As we definitely are
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:20,736	| IOT143 |	Does that kind of outweigh the need for
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,248	| IOT143 |	Privacy
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:28,416	| IOT143 |	I feel like there's a lot of things that you can do to be a responsible
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT143 |	Company
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:29,952	| IOT143 |	In terms of the day
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,024	| IOT143 |	And then you could have mentioned some of it now
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:34,048	| IOT143 |	You mentioned the word
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,096	| IOT143 |	Right now I think it's a matter of
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:36,864	| IOT143 |	How did is
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:38,144	| IOT143 |	Win tickets to words
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,424	| IOT143 |	And
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,960	| IOT143 |	What is attached along
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,728	| IOT143 |	Cheetah
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:47,872	| IOT143 |	And a lot of companies are working really hard at figuring out ways the kind of still take advantage of collecting lots of date
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,920	| IOT143 |	Doing
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:52,224	| IOT143 |	Either transforming it slightly
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:53,760	| IOT143 |	With mathematical methods
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,040	| IOT143 |	White differential privacy
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:59,904	| IOT143 |	The kind of guarantee you a little bit more
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,184	| IOT143 |	And also still being used
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:04,768	| IOT143 |	So if I am a company striving to
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:05,792	| IOT143 |	Napa evolve
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:06,560	| IOT143 |	For example
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,072	| IOT143 |	How should I
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:11,936	| IOT143 |	I think you should first of all have a good understanding of
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,472	| IOT143 |	What you want to do with the data
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:16,544	| IOT143 |	And the ones you collected figure out what needs to be
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,312	| IOT143 |	Stewart
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,080	| IOT143 |	In terms of
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,360	| IOT143 |	From an identifiable person
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:22,176	| IOT143 |	My Windows machine
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,736	| IOT143 |	Is Sunday at 2
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,040	| IOT143 |	And that is usually attached with
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:31,136	| IOT143 |	Several really unique identifiers like a machine ID your device ID
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,440	| IOT143 |	Along with save my IP address
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:35,488	| IOT143 |	And so
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:39,328	| IOT143 |	When the things that companies can do is decide how much of a story
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,656	| IOT143 |	Jenna specifically
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:45,216	| IOT143 |	Or just someone in the Pacific Northwest
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:46,496	| IOT143 |	Is using a computer
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,544	| IOT143 |	And be able to start
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:51,104	| IOT143 |	Lopping off the data that isn't needed
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,664	| IOT143 |	And you mentioned things like differential privacy
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,456	| IOT143 |	What are ways that companies
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:34:00,064	| IOT143 |	Treatdata respectfully and still have it retain it
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,624	| IOT143 |	I think that's one thing that's really important
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,928	| IOT143 |	Is for companies to really kind of
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:07,232	| IOT143 |	Treat their own responsible did he use
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,768	| IOT143 |	Policies inside the company
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,560	| IOT143 |	This is kind of separate from
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,328	| IOT143 |	Differential privacy
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,912	| IOT143 |	It's being able to have
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,448	| IOT143 |	Methods and systems in place
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:16,960	| IOT143 |	Attract
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,544	| IOT143 |	Does it have audit mechanisms
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,080	| IOT143 |	So bad
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:25,408	| IOT143 |	People can't access the other not supposed to have access to
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,480	| IOT143 |	Or if they are and it's kind of
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,064	| IOT143 |	How many companies
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,624	| IOT143 |	Play they're doing it more and more now
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,416	| IOT143 |	Thank you
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:40,768	| IOT143 |	From years and years ago there was news about people searching for likes
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,816	| IOT143 |	Celebrity taking Ubers
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:49,216	| IOT143 |	Or someone like Britney Spears going to the hospital and people within the hospital system
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,496	| IOT143 |	Funny people
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:54,592	| IOT143 |	People who are it system administrators are more of these issues
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,872	| IOT143 |	And they have
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,920	| IOT143 |	Probably done more in terms of access controls
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:03,552	| IOT143 |	Here comes a challenge cuz I talk to people about connected devices all the time
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,064	| IOT143 |	In private
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,856	| IOT143 |	How do you communicate
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:07,648	| IOT143 |	Good data practices
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,928	| IOT143 |	What matters
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,208	| IOT143 |	And all of that
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:13,792	| IOT143 |	To Consumers and maybe we should even start that with like my God which is
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,328	| IOT143 |	Primary things a consumer should
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:15,840	| IOT143 |	Care about with Rick
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,400	| IOT143 |	Let me think about this
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,448	| IOT143 |	And I think that we
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,752	| IOT143 |	We need to have a whole bunch of different
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:23,264	| IOT143 |	Ways to Die
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:27,616	| IOT143 |	If I were to go to Home Depot right now and I want to buy a Kinect
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,920	| IOT143 |	Probably half a dozen
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:33,504	| IOT143 |	People are companies are manufacturers offering things now
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:35,552	| IOT143 |	But there's nothing that packages
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,344	| IOT143 |	Unpackaging
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,624	| IOT143 |	For any of these products
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:39,904	| IOT143 |	That actually says
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,184	| IOT143 |	Anything about the date
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,000	| IOT143 |	Right and so there needs to be something that's
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,304	| IOT143 |	Imagine all the different points
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:46,816	| IOT143 |	Upsell
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,656	| IOT143 |	Physical packaging or
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,704	| IOT143 |	When you go to Amazon
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:54,496	| IOT143 |	There's some kind of disclosure around
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:56,544	| IOT143 |	Hey you either need an app
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:59,360	| IOT143 |	Or we're going to share data with
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:01,408	| IOT143 |	This many companies are these types of come
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:04,224	| IOT143 |	Some kind of nutrition label
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,528	| IOT143 |	Provide some
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,064	| IOT143 |	Let's talk about you
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:10,880	| IOT143 |	Because you guys did for the holidays
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,416	| IOT143 |	Of things
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:13,696	| IOT143 |	Well may or may not
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,488	| IOT143 |	Tweaker date not leak your data cuz it's not
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,024	| IOT143 |	Kits and intend
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:19,840	| IOT143 |	Sharing
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,632	| IOT143 |	Intentional and unintentional
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:23,680	| IOT143 |	So talk to me about this
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,984	| IOT143 |	Sure so we created this guy again
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:29,824	| IOT143 |	50
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,920	| IOT143 |	The kind of their permissions
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,944	| IOT143 |	That would be
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,968	| IOT143 |	Whether they act
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,552	| IOT143 |	Or your microphone or track your GPS location
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,088	| IOT143 |	And it also kind of
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:44,416	| IOT143 |	Did a little investigating whether you had what kind of
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,440	| IOT143 |	Information about
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,256	| IOT143 |	Whether it requires you to create an account
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:50,560	| IOT143 |	Or if you have any privacy control
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,352	| IOT143 |	Or she could delete your data later
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,400	| IOT143 |	And when the kind of the funny thing
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,168	| IOT143 |	Things about
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:57,472	| IOT143 |	We're not funny but tricky things about connected things
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,752	| IOT143 |	Is that
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,776	| IOT143 |	Everything isn't just
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| IOT143 |	The most obvious
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,104	| IOT143 |	When I buy a rubber duck
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,152	| IOT143 |	That is called
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,944	| IOT143 |	What is a connected rubber ducky
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,992	| IOT143 |	Please music in his LED
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,784	| IOT143 |	It's not just
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,600	| IOT143 |	Cuz you're also usually have to interact with
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,672	| IOT143 |	To get your thing to work
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,696	| IOT143 |	I had to download an app
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:19,232	| IOT143 |	I kind of said everything
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,768	| IOT143 |	So you have to think about
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:22,304	| IOT143 |	Device
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| IOT143 |	Which I hadn't really thought about
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,936	| IOT143 |	And each of these things
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,544	| IOT143 |	Bye-bye Dropcam
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,640	| IOT143 |	The camera on the outside of my house
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:39,712	| IOT143 |	It's obvious that hey it's probably record video cuz I just bought it
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,808	| IOT143 |	But when you're buying like a
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:46,368	| IOT143 |	No electric toothbrush and you have to use the app
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,416	| IOT143 |	It might be weird or kind of like
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:50,208	| IOT143 |	Not really make sense why
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:51,232	| IOT143 |	Collecting your GPS
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,768	| IOT143 |	Location information
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,912	| IOT143 |	GPS information to use the app
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,936	| IOT143 |	Pastor askew
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,752	| IOT143 |	And I don't understand why he needs
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:06,592	| IOT143 |	In some of these cases you can just not
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:10,688	| IOT143 |	Say yo
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:15,552	| IOT143 |	But in some cases you can't and that actually brings us up to a really good
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,088	| IOT143 |	Kid point which is
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:19,648	| IOT143 |	A lot of these things you have to purchase it
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:20,928	| IOT143 |	To find out that it's going to
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:22,464	| IOT143 |	Have objections all data
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:27,840	| IOT143 |	And that feels terrible because sometimes
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,608	| IOT143 |	Can you return it
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,144	| IOT143 |	What is that sort of
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,168	| IOT143 |	Consumer rights issues
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,544	| IOT143 |	Army figure
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:39,360	| IOT143 |	You're the only person who's talking about this
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,128	| IOT143 |	Because
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,408	| IOT143 |	You just don't know
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:43,968	| IOT143 |	Until you get home and you open it and send oculi
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,504	| IOT143 |	Why is my thermometer
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:46,528	| IOT143 |	Reply
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:49,344	| IOT143 |	Be right back by that time it's too late
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:56,512	| IOT143 |	Unpackaged giving it away is a holiday or birthday present
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:57,792	| IOT143 |	5 year old child
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,840	| IOT143 |	I want to take your present away from you
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,912	| IOT143 |	That's hardcore
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:08,032	| IOT143 |	Because in 10 years time he don't want those naked pictures of you in the bathtub going anywhere I promise
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:12,384	| IOT143 |	I need one good thing though that people do do now
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:15,200	| IOT143 |	I think a lot of people do they look things up online
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:17,760	| IOT143 |	Or they look through lots of different reviews like
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:20,064	| IOT143 |	You know the ratings for everything
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:23,392	| IOT143 |	Maybe this is a called that two people who really like doing product review
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:26,208	| IOT143 |	But when you are reviewing something
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,048	| IOT143 |	Somewhere else that you can
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:31,584	| IOT143 |	Something about her
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:35,936	| IOT143 |	I returned this because it was really weird that I was taking my picture all the time
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:37,984	| IOT143 |	Words of advice for
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,008	| IOT143 |	For people who are like
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:39,776	| IOT143 |	Man
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:42,848	| IOT143 |	I really think a lot of this like I'd love to turn off my lights from
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,872	| IOT143 |	Using my voice for my cat
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,432	| IOT143 |	Do you think they should buy into this
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,200	| IOT143 |	Switch they look
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:47,712	| IOT143 |	Or if they
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:49,760	| IOT143 |	When you are making a purchase
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,088	| IOT143 |	Just spend some time going to
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:54,880	| IOT143 |	Through all the settings and controls
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,904	| IOT143 |	And the permission
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:58,464	| IOT143 |	And just turn off the things that you don't think
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:02,560	| IOT143 |	For example on the rubber ducky if you don't want to
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,584	| IOT143 |	Have your location
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:04,864	| IOT143 |	Turn off the location permission
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,400	| IOT143 |	Ender settings
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:09,728	| IOT143 |	And sometimes our settings are in the actual
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:10,752	| IOT143 |	Like system settings
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:12,800	| IOT143 |	And sometimes those settings are in
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,384	| IOT143 |	So just check out both areas
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:19,456	| IOT143 |	But if we can just do it once
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:23,808	| IOT143 |	When you're for sitting up your device or a port or what not
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:28,672	| IOT143 |	There's other simple things that you can do like a lot of people put tape over their webcam
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,696	| IOT143 |	Laptop
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:34,560	| IOT143 |	So if there's something physical that you can do to like or unplug your Echo
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,584	| IOT143 |	If you want to go ahead
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:36,864	| IOT143 |	Try that
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,400	| IOT143 |	But check out settings
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,680	| IOT143 |	And
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,472	| IOT143 |	I really hope
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,008	| IOT143 |	And thought that
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:46,336	| IOT143 |	The state of privacy would be a little bit better than where it was
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,616	| IOT143 |	Currently
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,640	| IOT143 |	In terms of
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,432	| IOT143 |	The iot connected things
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:52,480	| IOT143 |	Most things did not have any privacy
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,248	| IOT143 |	Controls
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,272	| IOT143 |	Mustangs
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,552	| IOT143 |	We're very opaque
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:58,880	| IOT143 |	In terms of what data was being sent when
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,160	| IOT143 |	For what purpose in hell
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,696	| IOT143 |	And so I think that
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:04,256	| IOT143 |	Still have to be a lot of
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:04,768	| IOT143 |	Work.
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,608	| IOT143 |	Before things are really
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,936	| IOT143 |	I think
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,472	| IOT143 |	There's a lot of really interesting things
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:17,056	| IOT143 |	Special 2018
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:17,824	| IOT143 |	Is the gdpr
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:21,152	| IOT143 |	Are these new privacy regulations that come online
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,968	| IOT143 |	As a result of his privacy regulation
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,552	| IOT143 |	Regulators are going to start just going after
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:32,160	| IOT143 |	In terms of their data collection their transparency
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:35,232	| IOT143 |	Where do you sing it now
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:38,304	| IOT143 |	With regulators and the really big tech companies
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:41,376	| IOT143 |	And I think that it will just get more and more interesting
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:49,056	| IOT143 |	Okay so I'm going to go down a list of popular iot device
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,336	| IOT143 |	And you can tell me
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,384	| IOT143 |	Would you put this in your house or no
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:52,895	| IOT143 |	How's that for
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:58,271	| IOT143 |	Your own personal like utility like
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:00,063	| IOT143 |	Is it going to be valuable to you
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:00,575	| IOT143 |	It is there's a
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,647	| IOT143 |	You just tell me so here we go
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,415	| IOT143 |	Connected light bulbs
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,535	| IOT143 |	And I feel perfectly capable of
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:10,815	| IOT143 |	Turn on the switch
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:12,607	| IOT143 |	Also
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,911	| IOT143 |	Want to make sure I get light bulbs that last long
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:18,751	| IOT143 |	So anything that requires firmware updates
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,287	| IOT143 |	I probably try to avoid
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:23,615	| IOT143 |	Especially because typically really high in the ceiling
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,663	| IOT143 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,687	| IOT143 |	Connect two thermostats
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,039	| IOT143 |	Programmable
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:34,879	| IOT143 |	Pretty happy with just setting the different times on it
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:35,903	| IOT143 |	Daniel Lee
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:39,231	| IOT143 |	What to see how cold my house is
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,535	| IOT143 |	Any particular time when I'm not home
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:43,327	| IOT143 |	Smart door locks
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:45,119	| IOT143 |	No
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,167	| IOT143 |	Smart
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:50,495	| IOT143 |	But I would get one of the ones where you can type in a code
