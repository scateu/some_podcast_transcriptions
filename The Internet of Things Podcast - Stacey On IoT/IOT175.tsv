EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| IOT175 |	IO
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:04,416	| IOT175 |	Alright Kevin the big news this week comes I'm going to save for the Enterprise and Industrial side which is the Wall Street
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,952	| IOT175 |	Journal reported that GE
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:09,280	| IOT175 |	He was considering selling off some of its a digital businesses
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,048	| IOT175 |	V
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:16,448	| IOT175 |	Proposals here are at servicemax business which helps get service Personnel in installers in people to fix stuff
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,216	| IOT175 |	Out into
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,008	| IOT175 |	To the field managers those employees
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,544	| IOT175 |	Therapeutics
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,312	| IOT175 |	Business
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,592	| IOT175 |	Might also be on
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:28,736	| IOT175 |	That's a time-series database analytics and all sorts of good stuff that they've been marketing for a really long
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,272	| IOT175 |	The industrial average
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:33,344	| IOT175 |	And a couple other Acquisitions they made
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,368	| IOT175 |	Radium
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT175 |	Which was a
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,416	| IOT175 |	Audio Analytics
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,976	| IOT175 |	Company that does Predictive Analytics
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,560	| IOT175 |	Prediction machine's fail so there's a lot Happening Here
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:46,912	| IOT175 |	We haven't talked much about it but GE for the last year or so is really been
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,728	| IOT175 |	Oh struggling is not the right word
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,312	| IOT175 |	Coming to grips with a new reality might be a good way of putting it
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,640	| IOT175 |	Basically they're like all of that marketing dollars
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,408	| IOT175 |	Can I spend a lot on
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,456	| IOT175 |	Digital transformation
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,504	| IOT175 |	It was just too rich for their blood
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,552	| IOT175 |	And basically there
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,856	| IOT175 |	Slimming down there selling off all kinds of division
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:09,440	| IOT175 |	And it's not a huge surprise but it is a sad thing
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| IOT175 |	Because
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:14,816	| IOT175 |	GE really created the industrial iot that in actuality but in terms of Market
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| IOT175 |	Probably
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,144	| IOT175 |	4 years ago there like a virgin spend billions on
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,448	| IOT175 |	Send by God they did
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:23,520	| IOT175 |	They didn't think was like 2015 so maybe
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,056	| IOT175 |	3x years ago put
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,360	| IOT175 |	They said they want to be like a top 10 software
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:33,504	| IOT175 |	And even closed but that didn't get close to being a top 10 software company but they
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,784	| IOT175 |	Had a huge software
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,064	| IOT175 |	Right
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:42,464	| IOT175 |	It's right but the thing is in this is interesting at the eclipse Foundation had a little study for cloud services do you
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:47,840	| IOT175 |	Use planning use or any of the following cloud service offerings for implementing your it solution was the question
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,400	| IOT175 |	Of course AWS docker azure
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,936	| IOT175 |	Private on-premises cloud
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,216	| IOT175 |	Google Cloud the top
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,520	| IOT175 |	4 and like my own vast majority
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,336	| IOT175 |	The very last one with a 2.1%
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,616	| IOT175 |	Choice was GE fridge
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,896	| IOT175 |	That was probably in
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:01,920	| IOT175 |	LGE custom
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| IOT175 |	They learn a lot of things
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:11,136	| IOT175 |	The hard way like they started building their own data centers to host the products analytics stuff and
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,160	| IOT175 |	Everybody was like
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,696	| IOT175 |	G I don't want to talk to you
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,720	| IOT175 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,536	| IOT175 |	It's a reinvention of the wheel at this point as well
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,863	| IOT175 |	And then they also were very ambitious in terms
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,887	| IOT175 |	Is hiring people to
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,447	| IOT175 |	Sell this so like I don't think it was a mistake
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,263	| IOT175 |	Because I think there's a lot of there there
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,567	| IOT175 |	But I do think it was a bit early
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,615	| IOT175 |	And they spent a lot of money
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,663	| IOT175 |	On the marketing side
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,711	| IOT175 |	Did they couldn't necessarily backup
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,735	| IOT175 |	On the other side
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:37,759	| IOT175 |	I mean
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,063	| IOT175 |	The really interesting thing
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,087	| IOT175 |	If they sell this
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:45,951	| IOT175 |	And still they're not we're not sure they're just said they were selling digital assets and it's not clear which one
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,463	| IOT175 |	One second a cell
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,791	| IOT175 |	But if they sold something like products I think of you
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,327	| IOT175 |	Who the heck's going to buy products
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,863	| IOT175 |	You know that's it's a
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:57,471	| IOT175 |	So would it be would you want to see like a Microsoft or someone
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,495	| IOT175 |	Come in.
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,287	| IOT175 |	I don't think they want to but
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,591	| IOT175 |	This is what I think I'm going to explore this weekend
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,151	| IOT175 |	Epicurious cuz
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,431	| IOT175 |	The people that come to mind
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,247	| IOT175 |	There will be some overlap there but I'll be curious what you
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| IOT175 |	Did you
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:11,807	| IOT175 |	My deductions
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,647	| IOT175 |	In other sad news
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,415	| IOT175 |	Is for the internet
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,463	| IOT175 |	Oh man it's like
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,999	| IOT175 |	Everything's coming home to roost
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,047	| IOT175 |	Way back in 2014
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:25,119	| IOT175 |	I read about a company that I just loved it was called
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,655	| IOT175 |	Well the device was called mother
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,703	| IOT175 |	The company was called cents
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,983	| IOT175 |	Send that essien
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| IOT175 |	Dot SE
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,567	| IOT175 |	Azusa French design company
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:37,407	| IOT175 |	And they put out a smart home hub called the mother and then they
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,711	| IOT175 |	About little sensors called peanuts
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:42,783	| IOT175 |	That you basically program to be like asleep detect
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,807	| IOT175 |	Motion detector
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,855	| IOT175 |	Or any number of things
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,623	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,647	| IOT175 |	I loved this is
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:51,231	| IOT175 |	I thought it was it didn't give me the programmability cuz I was super nerdy on
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,279	| IOT175 |	Yeah I was like the smart thing
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,815	| IOT175 |	Person back then
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:59,935	| IOT175 |	I was like I love spending time tweaking these things making these weird recipes to do weird stuff in my house
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,959	| IOT175 |	Before everybody else
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,287	| IOT175 |	This was a really well-designed pretty in
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:04,799	| IOT175 |	Cute
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,079	| IOT175 |	Cute cute
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,847	| IOT175 |	Cute device
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,127	| IOT175 |	And sadly this company
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,151	| IOT175 |	Apparent
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,943	| IOT175 |	Yeah the little
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,479	| IOT175 |	Mother Unit looks like a little
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,551	| IOT175 |	Squash bowling pin videos remind me the current Google home
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,599	| IOT175 |	In some regard it was a cute product
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,367	| IOT175 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,415	| IOT175 |	I mean and I love the fact that he
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,463	| IOT175 |	These things where you can buy these peanuts in
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,231	| IOT175 |	Program them
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,999	| IOT175 |	Basically the
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,767	| IOT175 |	You flash them
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,559	| IOT175 |	So they have the algorithms they need to
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,327	| IOT175 |	To do like
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,863	| IOT175 |	Truck sleeper truck stop
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,423	| IOT175 |	Really well I even
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,447	| IOT175 |	Remember putting
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:32,959	| IOT175 |	Through the wash
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,543	| IOT175 |	Yeah so if you have that product
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,079	| IOT175 |	Tell you
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,127	| IOT175 |	You might not have it working for me
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,943	| IOT175 |	What is that cost back in the day I'm trying to think
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| IOT175 |	Cost
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| IOT175 |	300
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,087	| IOT175 |	It cost 200
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| IOT175 |	$99
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:53,439	| IOT175 |	And I should tell you that the creator of this system
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| IOT175 |	Was it
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,023	| IOT175 |	We're going back in iot history he's the guy who found the
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,303	| IOT175 |	Now that's
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,071	| IOT175 |	Stacked I don't know how to
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,887	| IOT175 |	It was a connected rabbit and it just
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,935	| IOT175 |	Glow different colors and people loved it
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,959	| IOT175 |	So yeah
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,007	| IOT175 |	Bye-bye mother
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,519	| IOT175 |	Bye-bye
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:12,127	| IOT175 |	There we go and I still to this day would like just a sensor that I could
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,967	| IOT175 |	Stick on top of like my dog food container and just have it be like
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,759	| IOT175 |	Has anyone fed the dog
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,295	| IOT175 |	I wanted to tie into metal made
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,343	| IOT175 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:23,391	| IOT175 |	So that was our sad news segment
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,183	| IOT175 |	Of the show let's talk about
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,303	| IOT175 |	We don't talk about homepod that much why is that
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,583	| IOT175 |	Because it's not good
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,095	| IOT175 |	Okay then
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| IOT175 |	That settles that
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,679	| IOT175 |	There just hasn't been much in the way of
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:38,751	| IOT175 |	Development lately I mean week through AirPlay 2
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:41,567	| IOT175 |	Was announced maybe a month ago
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,895	| IOT175 |	The latest IOS 12 beta beta version
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:48,479	| IOT175 |	5 which I have not upgraded to yet however it includes
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:54,879	| IOT175 |	The ability or at least the setup ability to use the homepod to make phone calls so this
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,671	| IOT175 |	Has to do with the way Apple
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:02,815	| IOT175 |	Uses continuity that's the function where you can spread data and activities around on different iOS devices so
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,631	| IOT175 |	You can pick up a phone call on pretty much any iOS device is it
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,167	| IOT175 |	It's tidy your iPhone and so on
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:10,751	| IOT175 |	So that will come in homepod with probably I was 12 I think it's a fair
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| IOT175 |	After Beth
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,311	| IOT175 |	Really it's kind of table Stakes to
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,127	| IOT175 |	Do this kind of stuff that I think you're a little late here but
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:20,991	| IOT175 |	It's coming so that's good nothing else to talk about though cuz nothing else has happened with homepod
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,807	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,367	| IOT175 |	I only talk about it
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,951	| IOT175 |	Ann's Apple just had their quarterly investor
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,975	| IOT175 |	Chicagoland
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,511	| IOT175 |	No reports this week
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,839	| IOT175 |	And homepod is lumped in with their other category which also includes
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,143	| IOT175 |	They're your phone's there
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,703	| IOT175 |	Watches Etc that's a growing segment
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| IOT175 |	They did talk about
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:45,567	| IOT175 |	How strong those products are for the other category
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,591	| IOT175 |	Not a peep
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,103	| IOT175 |	Of homepod
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,943	| IOT175 |	Not it's growing not its meeting expectations
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| IOT175 |	Zippo
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| IOT175 |	Read into that
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,551	| IOT175 |	What you will
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| IOT175 |	Okay guys
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,903	| IOT175 |	We're here there's going to be like a hundred of you
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,927	| IOT175 |	Maybe more I don't know
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,207	| IOT175 |	We're going to find a center
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:08,607	| IOT175 |	But it is heavy duty heavy duty but very specific in its there is a
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,679	| IOT175 |	Okay it's either
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,191	| IOT175 |	Mackinaw
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| IOT175 |	Moschino
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,263	| IOT175 |	Or, do you want to go with the pronunciation
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,335	| IOT175 |	No I'm going to go with one of those two I'll say
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,103	| IOT175 |	Mackinaw
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,615	| IOT175 |	Mackinaw
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,455	| IOT175 |	This is a device that has
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,479	| IOT175 |	Mini input
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,039	| IOT175 |	And you pop it into a pie and you can control
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,319	| IOT175 |	Your smart home
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,879	| IOT175 |	These are four devices that you actually
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,439	| IOT175 |	I can wire them into it so
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,463	| IOT175 |	Like maybe you want to
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,255	| IOT175 |	Create like a special breaker box
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:40,351	| IOT175 |	Used to measure electricity consumption your house or even Italian to some
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| IOT175 |	Appliance somewhere
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| IOT175 |	This is too hardcore for either of us
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,471	| IOT175 |	But I would agree
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,543	| IOT175 |	If you are a doubly or just really into this stuff
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,823	| IOT175 |	Baby
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,615	| IOT175 |	Perfect for you and
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| IOT175 |	Is it out yet
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:59,551	| IOT175 |	I don't believe it is out yet what you can do is you can sign up to say you're interested on the the website
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:04,415	| IOT175 |	Which is makinen., she puts on the show notes cuz I don't want to have people type it based on a pronunciations
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,463	| IOT175 |	What could be wrong though it's not available yet
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| IOT175 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,303	| IOT175 |	Built on a lot of Open Source
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:14,143	| IOT175 |	Raspberry Pi read E46 input outputs
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,935	| IOT175 |	You're right that you're going to be hard wiring a lot of stuff
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,983	| IOT175 |	But if you're that kind of guy
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,055	| IOT175 |	This might be a great product for you so
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,615	| IOT175 |	Check it out if so far if we haven't scared you out feel like
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,407	| IOT175 |	We'll do it live
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:31,807	| IOT175 |	You know I'm thinking about you wouldn't have to hardwire a lot of things because your pies going to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:37,439	| IOT175 |	And I'm only saying that because now that I look at the web interface for the switch axe looks very pretty
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:40,255	| IOT175 |	In terms of controlling things you know they've got a light
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,815	| IOT175 |	Is one of the switches and their temperature sensors
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,887	| IOT175 |	You're not going to hardwire everything in your house this one little box
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,703	| IOT175 |	So there should be Wireless connectivity through the pie
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,519	| IOT175 |	Okay but there is the option
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT175 |	Control wire should you
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,871	| IOT175 |	Oh yes there is I mean you can
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,663	| IOT175 |	Home and there's analog inputs that
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:02,271	| IOT175 |	You can configure for all kinds of currents and resolutions oh my yeah
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,295	| IOT175 |	So
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,367	| IOT175 |	Check it out if you're interested sign up and
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:06,879	| IOT175 |	If you get it
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,159	| IOT175 |	Tell us know what you think
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,183	| IOT175 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,463	| IOT175 |	All right
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,255	| IOT175 |	This is for the industrial people out there
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| IOT175 |	Your cellular modems are now Gateway
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,375	| IOT175 |	Sierra Wireless just introduced
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,423	| IOT175 |	The airlink lx40
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,727	| IOT175 |	You don't need to remember that
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,775	| IOT175 |	Specifically but the idea behind
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:28,127	| IOT175 |	This line of products from Sierra is that you get the cellular modem
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,663	| IOT175 |	And you also get
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,431	| IOT175 |	A gateway
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| IOT175 |	Weight is part of this
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:34,783	| IOT175 |	And that will handle things like analytics of
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:39,903	| IOT175 |	The information coming in so basically you don't have to send every piece of data up to the cloud
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:43,999	| IOT175 |	Which is important when you're at a cellular connection because by God that band with this
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| IOT175 |	Pensive
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,631	| IOT175 |	So I know that we talked about this in the home like why aren't our routers
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| IOT175 |	Also
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,215	| IOT175 |	UPS on the case of the Enterprise world
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:56,287	| IOT175 |	Your router's are indeed at home hubs but
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:58,335	| IOT175 |	Enterprise Hobbs that can do some
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| IOT175 |	Fairly reasonable computer
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,663	| IOT175 |	Seems good to me
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:08,063	| IOT175 |	Yeah I'm going to Pick n Save on van with costs on a cellular connection that can be a lot of money depending on how many devices you have implemented in
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,831	| IOT175 |	And so on so forth
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,879	| IOT175 |	Seeing it supports LTE
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:13,183	| IOT175 |	Em&m dirt both
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,975	| IOT175 |	So that's good
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,255	| IOT175 |	Power over ethernet
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| IOT175 |	Battery Master
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,071	| IOT175 |	Pretty nice
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| IOT175 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,119	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,143	| IOT175 |	This is in the
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,911	| IOT175 |	What the heck
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,703	| IOT175 |	Category Kevin
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| IOT175 |	In his
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,567	| IOT175 |	Search his regular perusal of the FCC database found
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| IOT175 |	Wait a second
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,895	| IOT175 |	No no
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:35,967	| IOT175 |	You make it sound like nobody else check the FCC database two or three times a day
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:36,991	| IOT175 |	Oh well
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,831	| IOT175 |	Sorry I meant
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,391	| IOT175 |	Surely there are other people who
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:47,999	| IOT175 |	Check it more than I do but you're right and then you were going to say I found a Lenovo smart bulb
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| IOT175 |	And when I found it I'm like
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,559	| IOT175 |	Who
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,839	| IOT175 |	Emmanuel Lenovo
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,399	| IOT175 |	They make phones computers and so on so forth
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:13:00,799	| IOT175 |	But a smart bulb and I checked I could not find a single Lenovo iot product maybe I just didn't look hard enough but this
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,567	| IOT175 |	This appears to be there first
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| IOT175 |	Foot in the door
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:07,455	| IOT175 |	I guess it was smart home if a wifi-enabled smart home and I only know that because they have
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:11,807	| IOT175 |	CC tested the 802. 11bgn end
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,343	| IOT175 |	Make it particles on it so
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,415	| IOT175 |	I guess it's exciting for Lenovo but
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:18,463	| IOT175 |	Not really for the rest of us is it
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:18,975	| IOT175 |	I saw the sign
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,255	| IOT175 |	Miss Marple
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| IOT175 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,559	| IOT175 |	Why
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:27,167	| IOT175 |	I don't know why this is everyone's intro product if I were doing an intro product for the io
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,935	| IOT175 |	31
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| IOT175 |	I probably would do something highly Spa
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,007	| IOT175 |	Pacific just because
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,591	| IOT175 |	Try to integrate with others because we're so far into the
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:36,639	| IOT175 |	But if I were going to be like a giant
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:42,527	| IOT175 |	Smart outlet because they're so much more versatile and because
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:50,463	| IOT175 |	I mean I'll keep looking maybe they have a suite of products that are coming I don't know I mean this has not been announced yet
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,535	| IOT175 |	Clear on that maybe two days for results
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,303	| IOT175 |	Indicate that
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,863	| IOT175 |	Tickets an outlet and a hub in
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| IOT175 |	Lord only knows what else
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,679	| IOT175 |	I don't know but I will keep looking
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,727	| IOT175 |	There we go we have
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,775	| IOT175 |	This is not DIY but in the world of coke
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:06,079	| IOT175 |	Control4 which is kind of Defense here hiring
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,871	| IOT175 |	Connected home stuff
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,895	| IOT175 |	We have
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,455	| IOT175 |	Suntrup Hyundai introduced an intercom feature
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,223	| IOT175 |	End
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:16,063	| IOT175 |	I thought this was interesting because it basically turns your control 4 system
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:19,391	| IOT175 |	If you have it any touch panel that you have turns into a
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,695	| IOT175 |	Prudential screen that you can talk to from your smart
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,791	| IOT175 |	Which and you can also to see video clips like from your connect
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,559	| IOT175 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,119	| IOT175 |	So I thought this was interesting for anyone who has these
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,887	| IOT175 |	Systems
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,959	| IOT175 |	And I also went to a dealer to actually check out the
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,495	| IOT175 |	Control4 system because they
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,519	| IOT175 |	Launched
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:38,335	| IOT175 |	With their dealers a very comprehensive
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:38,847	| IOT175 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| IOT175 |	Showroom
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,431	| IOT175 |	So if you have one of those fancy high-end
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,223	| IOT175 |	Home automation
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,247	| IOT175 |	Dealerships
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,527	| IOT175 |	Pop in and check out
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,063	| IOT175 |	The control for stuff cuz they
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,343	| IOT175 |	Created a really compelling
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,879	| IOT175 |	System
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,159	| IOT175 |	It's actually cheaper than I thought it would
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,695	| IOT175 |	Sol cerveza
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:54,975	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,767	| IOT175 |	Yes this is difference when Elsa
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:00,351	| IOT175 |	You're buying it all at once and someone's going to install it and then
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:04,191	| IOT175 |	You know there's I think for the intercom it's part of like a $100 a year
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:08,287	| IOT175 |	Service fee but if you're like many people in your like I do not want to
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:10,847	| IOT175 |	Program a smart home I do not want to install all this stuff
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,151	| IOT175 |	It's not an unreasonable thing to do
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,431	| IOT175 |	So
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:17,247	| IOT175 |	I'm taking a guess here that this intercom
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:20,831	| IOT175 |	You said be thinknear use your phone and communicate to one of the panels
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,111	| IOT175 |	I guess I'm going to be on the same Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:28,255	| IOT175 |	Don't you can actually do it from your phone when your remote that's what I was going to ask me what vehicle feature
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,791	| IOT175 |	So you could actually I could be
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,863	| IOT175 |	You know at work somewhere and
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,167	| IOT175 |	Intercom back to my house and talk to my wife
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:40,543	| IOT175 |	It's basically the same way I have used the Echo Show with my daughter when I'm traveling and
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,335	| IOT175 |	The way you might use
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| IOT175 |	Google
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,943	| IOT175 |	Duo program
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| IOT175 |	What's Duo
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| IOT175 |	Sorry sorry sorry
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,391	| IOT175 |	So actually this gives us a choice
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,975	| IOT175 |	I like your new product that you just bought
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,535	| IOT175 |	Or should we talk about these silliest iot product
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,839	| IOT175 |	Tricky Bowman suspense a little longer
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,887	| IOT175 |	It'll keep them in suspense
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,911	| IOT175 |	Alrighty
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:10,751	| IOT175 |	Let's talk about your first impressions of the Lenovo smart display
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:16,383	| IOT175 |	All right so I ordered the Lenovo smart display the 10in Honda del Sol at 8 in Persian
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,223	| IOT175 |	Late last week when I was first available and I'm going to say
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,039	| IOT175 |	If you haven't ordered one yet and you're a Costco member
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:28,671	| IOT175 |	Take a look at Costco because I paid 199 for the larger one which everywhere else that's the price
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,719	| IOT175 |	For the smaller one normally it's 249
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:36,351	| IOT175 |	$50 savings are there a derived about 36 hours ago so I got some more
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:40,447	| IOT175 |	Testing to do my first impressions remember Stacy when you when I saw this
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:43,263	| IOT175 |	Sexy yes in January and like we pretty much fell in love with it right away
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,079	| IOT175 |	All those feelings came back
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,151	| IOT175 |	Right away you didn't regret your field
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,943	| IOT175 |	Not at all
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,527	| IOT175 |	Not at all I am super impressed so far with it
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,599	| IOT175 |	They're easy to set up you do all the setup with your phone
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,903	| IOT175 |	Through the Google home app
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:02,975	| IOT175 |	Get off that your Wi-Fi password is just a code here or there
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:04,255	| IOT175 |	Very very easy to set up
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:07,839	| IOT175 |	Display is fantastic it's a full h
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:13,727	| IOT175 |	Pictures of full HD display the larger one but it's a 720p display on the smaller one so you get a better resolution on the large one
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,543	| IOT175 |	The speaker as I know a lot of people are going to want to know
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,823	| IOT175 |	I'd say it's better than the
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:23,711	| IOT175 |	Stand-alone Google home but he's not going to compete with a homepod or Sonos it gets loud
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:29,087	| IOT175 |	Like those but the face is just not going to be there it's more scooters that the higher end of the sound
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:32,927	| IOT175 |	I don't see any microphones on this thing but obviously it's got a microphone array
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,207	| IOT175 |	One thing I've noticed
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:40,607	| IOT175 |	This is really meant to be facing in towards the center of a room so to speak Lee I put this on the nightstand in the
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,655	| IOT175 |	Bedroom we'll talk about that in a minute
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,727	| IOT175 |	Most people would not put a product like this there but I'll explain while you can
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:52,127	| IOT175 |	You know it's the screen it's not something I can sit in the middle of the room because you can't see it then from the other side
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,151	| IOT175 |	It's the same issue we have with the echo
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,943	| IOT175 |	We just going to turn it around with
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:59,295	| IOT175 |	But I will say though I mean I got a tangled
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:03,647	| IOT175 |	On the corner of the nightstand facing into the center of the room and it's been pretty good
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| IOT175 |	About listening
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,463	| IOT175 |	But obviously I'm not behind it so
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,487	| IOT175 |	That helps
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| IOT175 |	ABC's built-in with
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,583	| IOT175 |	Google Assistant some of the features
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,607	| IOT175 |	Are cool
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:15,679	| IOT175 |	Wake Netflix is actually built in so I can just say
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,983	| IOT175 |	AG play such-and-such on Netflix
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,775	| IOT175 |	And boom it just starts playing on the
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,079	| IOT175 |	Awesome 4K videos on YouTube
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,359	| IOT175 |	Actually
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:25,919	| IOT175 |	YouTube is also built in
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| IOT175 |	So that would work
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:29,503	| IOT175 |	What's not till 10 but still works
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:36,159	| IOT175 |	Is YouTube TV which is I switch my service providers now from PlayStation Vue to YouTube TV however
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:42,303	| IOT175 |	Smart display is a cast Chromecast basically it's a receiver so anything you can Chromecast
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:47,423	| IOT175 |	To the Chromecast you could send to that so I did that with my phone Chromecast and YouTube TV
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:53,823	| IOT175 |	I was watching the news and then I put huh I wonder if I can voice control it so I said Haji change to channel
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,591	| IOT175 |	10
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:19:00,991	| IOT175 |	On YouTube TV it sure enough it did it so even though YouTube TV is not built-in and other services are not yet built in
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,319	| IOT175 |	Is casting you can voice-control it just like it was made over there
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,367	| IOT175 |	That's awesome down here this is
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,647	| IOT175 |	Really nice but I'm
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| IOT175 |	I'm very curious
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,719	| IOT175 |	I have too many photos on Google photos
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,767	| IOT175 |	Is it possible for me to set that up
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,327	| IOT175 |	In spare time when it's not being used
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,375	| IOT175 |	Corgi videos in my house
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| IOT175 |	Could I actually just have it run
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT175 |	My Google photos
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:25,567	| IOT175 |	You absolutely could because there are three options for the display when you're not using it
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:29,663	| IOT175 |	When's the next standby mode I'm just using the base clock display because
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,455	| IOT175 |	At night in the middle of night I want to see the clock
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:35,551	| IOT175 |	You know I want to see anything else but another one is Google photos
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:39,903	| IOT175 |	And then I think the third one is just kind of like what you have on a Chromecast like a backdrop future worth
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,439	| IOT175 |	Google just provides photos
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| IOT175 |	Nice
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,231	| IOT175 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| IOT175 |	Now
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| IOT175 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:45,791	| IOT175 |	The nest
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,119	| IOT175 |	Let's talk about that so
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:53,471	| IOT175 |	I've been tested everything but I would say anything that integrates today with Google home
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:59,615	| IOT175 |	Should certainly work with this display and that includes video streaming I know somebody on Facebook asked us if
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,663	| IOT175 |	Pekin Stream ring
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,967	| IOT175 |	And wyze cameras to this
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,295	| IOT175 |	You can't because you can't they don't agree with Google home today
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| IOT175 |	Is problem with a platform not with this
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,111	| IOT175 |	If that makes sense
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| IOT175 |	It's on sand
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,671	| IOT175 |	It's possible.
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:18,047	| IOT175 |	I did test messed my Nest hello doorbell camera and
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,143	| IOT175 |	Just you know it's a Haji show my front door that's the name of the camera
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:27,775	| IOT175 |	And what did you say about 6 7 Seconds of latency from the time I asked it to the time and actually showed it
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,543	| IOT175 |	Yes we got
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,359	| IOT175 |	Few seconds like maybe two seconds of like
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,407	| IOT175 |	After you ask where it's like sending it to the cloud
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,175	| IOT175 |	Thinking about it
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:36,223	| IOT175 |	Okay and then you get before second Subs
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,759	| IOT175 |	Spinning Wheel pulls up
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,063	| IOT175 |	And that's on the same Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,599	| IOT175 |	It is
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:44,159	| IOT175 |	I mean it's not instant
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:50,303	| IOT175 |	It's probably the same performance as I see with my Nvidia Shield TV when I'm watching TV and I can just voice command because that's a crime
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,863	| IOT175 |	You can also pull up
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,887	| IOT175 |	Was that your nest
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,935	| IOT175 |	That was the nest doorbell
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:58,751	| IOT175 |	I have another nest camera
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,031	| IOT175 |	But I didn't test that
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| IOT175 |	I just presumed it would work because one did
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,615	| IOT175 |	Never assume in
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,455	| IOT175 |	She part of my testing
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:09,247	| IOT175 |	Challenge now is
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,807	| IOT175 |	I got to go home we can so dependent on
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:17,440	| IOT175 |	Amazon for controlling the harm that I really never set up the rooms and devices in Google home very well
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,720	| IOT175 |	So now I need to do that
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,000	| IOT175 |	So part 2
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,280	| IOT175 |	Will be
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,328	| IOT175 |	More in-depth on how the Google home
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:23,840	| IOT175 |	Works with the
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,888	| IOT175 |	Which is
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,400	| IOT175 |	Today
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:27,680	| IOT175 |	Bye
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,448	| IOT175 |	Not by who
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:34,848	| IOT175 |	Let's wear this way if you are already into the Google platform for your voice user interface
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,616	| IOT175 |	With your smart home
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,920	| IOT175 |	I think this is great if you have a
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,992	| IOT175 |	Play sport I mean yes could be in the kitchen where you can do
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:44,576	| IOT175 |	Recipes and other things you want to watch YouTube or TV in the kitchen
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,624	| IOT175 |	We put on the nightstand and as I said
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,416	| IOT175 |	We normally don't put things like this
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:51,232	| IOT175 |	In the bedroom and I say things like this meaning it has a camera
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,280	| IOT175 |	Yes I was going to tell people I'm like
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,816	| IOT175 |	Yeah I know it does have a camera
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:57,888	| IOT175 |	Does Kevin actually now with this I could call
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,656	| IOT175 |	Kevin on Duo
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,936	| IOT175 |	And it just like
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,704	| IOT175 |	Pops up
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:04,544	| IOT175 |	Write in fact I said Haji call Stacy and it says
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:10,944	| IOT175 |	Video call or voice call and I just say video and it called you on Duo the devices typically best in lands
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:13,504	| IOT175 |	The only thing that works in portrait mode because you can switch
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:17,600	| IOT175 |	This device is kind like a dual stand the only thing that works in portrait mode is Duo
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,136	| IOT175 |	Can't have it set up
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,416	| IOT175 |	Fuse in portrait all the time
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:23,744	| IOT175 |	And when I did do that you said my video got a lot better I wasn't
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,512	| IOT175 |	Extract
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,024	| IOT175 |	For a little while
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:30,912	| IOT175 |	Yeah which may be a good thing but anyways going back to the camera itself
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:33,728	| IOT175 |	There's a hardware built in switch
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| IOT175 |	Shutter
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,080	| IOT175 |	Hover built into this device you just flip it down and it a little
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:41,408	| IOT175 |	Red indicator on that says hey I've covered up the camera right now and
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:44,736	| IOT175 |	And also an impact the device itself will say the camera is now off
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,808	| IOT175 |	Just like you if you muted the microphone it will say the microphone is now
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,624	| IOT175 |	All right
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:54,464	| IOT175 |	Real quick it's touchscreen to even talk about all the voice stuff but
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,256	| IOT175 |	You can navigate through touch
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:23:01,376	| IOT175 |	Like when it said you want to call video voice I could have tapped the screen so there's a lot to his prerogative
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,656	| IOT175 |	So far I am loving it
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,216	| IOT175 |	Okay well I can't wait to get mine
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,496	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:11,360	| IOT175 |	Will come back to you in a week or two and check in on the home performance
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,664	| IOT175 |	Aspects of this and I'm sure you'll rights
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,176	| IOT175 |	Something up at some point
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,224	| IOT175 |	That was an assignment
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:16,736	| IOT175 |	That wasn't
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:21,344	| IOT175 |	Okay
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,880	| IOT175 |	And let's see
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,904	| IOT175 |	Kevin
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:26,464	| IOT175 |	Good Pro tip from you and then we'll get into a crazy idea
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,744	| IOT175 |	All right
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:34,144	| IOT175 |	So it's funny because it's before the show Stacy you're not at your home your way right now and you would said my hug at
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,168	| IOT175 |	Home is not responding
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,752	| IOT175 |	It's so funny brought that up because I was going to share this pro-tip
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,544	| IOT175 |	What do you do if you can't
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:44,896	| IOT175 |	Access your hubs in remotely maybe need to be rebooted etcetera etcetera and on the wink
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,176	| IOT175 |	Facebook page
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,456	| IOT175 |	People have
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:50,272	| IOT175 |	Talk about this and that first thing people said was
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:53,088	| IOT175 |	Plug your Hub into a WiFi smart
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,392	| IOT175 |	Outlet and I never thought of that but it's
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,160	| IOT175 |	Brilliant
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,952	| IOT175 |	Because you can remotely access
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,976	| IOT175 |	Bat Outlet
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| IOT175 |	To reboot the Hub
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| IOT175 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,048	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:06,912	| IOT175 |	I talked to people who actually have their routers plug into a smart outlet and they actually schedule so it just
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,960	| IOT175 |	Power Cycles through at like 2 a.m.
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,264	| IOT175 |	So hey
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,544	| IOT175 |	Good idea
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:15,360	| IOT175 |	Okay let's talk about I'm calling this
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,920	| IOT175 |	My silly iot product
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,712	| IOT175 |	Haven't you actually it do this
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:23,296	| IOT175 |	I am are you ready let's get naked
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:26,368	| IOT175 |	Not you not you and me not I'm not listeners
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:29,696	| IOT175 |	The product is called The Naked home body scanner
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,976	| IOT175 |	It's not what you think
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:35,840	| IOT175 |	You don't get naked on this you still can wear clothes although it's probably best to wear
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:36,864	| IOT175 |	Minimal clothes
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,424	| IOT175 |	Maybe underwear whatever it is a
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:41,216	| IOT175 |	Scale that you step on
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,496	| IOT175 |	As well as
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,776	| IOT175 |	A mirror
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:46,336	| IOT175 |	That has the top of it one of Intel's
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,616	| IOT175 |	Prosense sensors
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,456	| IOT175 |	Sensors for 3D Jap and
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:57,344	| IOT175 |	Descale actually rotates you 360° wireless sensor checks you out
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,368	| IOT175 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,184	| IOT175 |	You have to howl
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:03,744	| IOT175 |	How else would it get your 3D body composition
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:06,048	| IOT175 |	I mean I guess the mirror could go around you but no
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,120	| IOT175 |	It's okay
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,936	| IOT175 |	Okay so I'm on this turntable in my
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,704	| IOT175 |	Skivvies and it's
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:20,128	| IOT175 |	And it basically uses the infrared sensor to scan you and
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,920	| IOT175 |	Attend will create
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| IOT175 |	3D
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,736	| IOT175 |	Map remodel in a Connected app
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,528	| IOT175 |	To show you what you look like
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,088	| IOT175 |	And it does body fat composition weight
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,368	| IOT175 |	Azure sizing
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,392	| IOT175 |	Body parts
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:33,952	| IOT175 |	Well
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:40,864	| IOT175 |	I don't know what to tell you I mean if that's the whole point is to measure and then the idea is it's for Healthy Living and as you transform your
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:44,448	| IOT175 |	Body by living healthier you get a better sense of your progress
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,240	| IOT175 |	And I think that's actually great
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,056	| IOT175 |	I don't know if I would pay $1,400 for it
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:53,152	| IOT175 |	But whatever you actually raise a good point before the show with this
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,432	| IOT175 |	Isn't used for but
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,968	| IOT175 |	Should be used for an I love this life
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:00,064	| IOT175 |	Yes this is the only reason I would ever shame myself into getting on 80
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,088	| IOT175 |	Table that would
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,368	| IOT175 |	My body fat composition
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,648	| IOT175 |	Which is
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,928	| IOT175 |	If you could use this
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:08,000	| IOT175 |	Actually send those measurements to like a shopping
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:13,376	| IOT175 |	Excursion select Amazon or to Nordstrom's and then they be like oh well in the following Brands you're a size
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,936	| IOT175 |	And then the other bands are a size 8
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:18,240	| IOT175 |	And that would be amazing cuz then you could like
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:22,336	| IOT175 |	Buy things online in Ashley try it on virtually and it would actually be
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,872	| IOT175 |	Supposed to
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:27,968	| IOT175 |	Now what you're just like all by two in different sizes and send one or both back
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:32,576	| IOT175 |	I wonder if that infrared scanner could actually do that could it detect
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:36,160	| IOT175 |	I measure you so to speak actual converted into inches and so on
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:36,928	| IOT175 |	Converse sizing
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,696	| IOT175 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,464	| IOT175 |	Judging by the
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:41,024	| IOT175 |	Judging by what it offers now I think
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:46,144	| IOT175 |	I guess I just because you're going to stand on this little turntable
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,472	| IOT175 |	And you may place it further away each and every time and it's going to have to
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:52,032	| IOT175 |	I mean I can measure the depth I guess so yeah I guess I could work
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:56,384	| IOT175 |	Yeah even if it's going to tell me that because it says it offers you measurements of like your biceps
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,408	| IOT175 |	Waste India
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,712	| IOT175 |	Hips and all of those other body parts
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,528	| IOT175 |	Play tabs but I only have one I have an app
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,808	| IOT175 |	You mad
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,344	| IOT175 |	You got it
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,624	| IOT175 |	But yeah
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,928	| IOT175 |	So that is our crazy product of the week
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:12,768	| IOT175 |	If you have $1,400 and no dignity you go right ahead Just Like Heaven
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:16,352	| IOT175 |	And let us let us know I'd be curious to see how it works
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:20,192	| IOT175 |	Somebody I don't know if we could ever get a review into this and I'm not putting naked pictures of my
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:26,592	| IOT175 |	Pictures of model where I don't blame you but they're not pictures it's kind of like bringing the TSA security scans

EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,936	| IOT175 |	Let's see this week's voicemail is from
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,216	| IOT175 |	Dan
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| IOT175 |	And he has
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:27,520	| IOT175 |	Question that we actually
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,592	| IOT175 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,640	| IOT175 |	This is Dan from North Carolina
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:36,224	| IOT175 |	I'm hoping you can help me with an idea I have for using my wyze cam
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,784	| IOT175 |	I'm pretty mainstream on the smart home I use
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,064	| IOT175 |	SmartThings to control lights
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,856	| IOT175 |	A few other things in my house
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,136	| IOT175 |	And I bought a
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:45,184	| IOT175 |	Cy scams recently because of the Great
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,696	| IOT175 |	$20 price
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:51,072	| IOT175 |	There is not a wyzecam the SmartThings integration yet but both of those system
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,352	| IOT175 |	Do you have if immigration
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,400	| IOT175 |	I want to use the motion
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:56,192	| IOT175 |	Answer on the wyze cam
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,008	| IOT175 |	Trigger a SmartThings connected light
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,776	| IOT175 |	Turn on
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,824	| IOT175 |	But I can't figure out how to do it and I don't
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,592	| IOT175 |	CNS
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,360	| IOT175 |	Stop with the Dozen
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:07,968	| IOT175 |	Can if Bridges got for me and if so can you explain how I do it
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,248	| IOT175 |	And as a side note
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:13,344	| IOT175 |	Assuming that there is a way to do it I wonder if there's a way for the light to then turn
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,624	| IOT175 |	Turn off after few minutes
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,904	| IOT175 |	Thanks again guys love yourself
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,208	| IOT175 |	K Den
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:18,720	| IOT175 |	I have good news
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,256	| IOT175 |	I have mostly canoes
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,048	| IOT175 |	Which is we can actually do this
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| IOT175 |	So the way you would do this
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,888	| IOT175 |	Is you go to f
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,912	| IOT175 |	I went to
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:29,216	| IOT175 |	Austin sauce look up why
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,776	| IOT175 |	So the wise motion is a trigger
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:33,824	| IOT175 |	So when it senses motion we can trigger something
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| IOT175 |	And in this case
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,944	| IOT175 |	We can trigger a SmartThings device to turn on
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:39,712	| IOT175 |	So
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:41,760	| IOT175 |	This is very easy for you to make yourself
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:46,624	| IOT175 |	If you were having troubles just email us and I'll make an applet for you and send it to you
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:48,416	| IOT175 |	You basically
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,184	| IOT175 |	Turn on
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:49,952	| IOT175 |	Your
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,720	| IOT175 |	Light
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:51,744	| IOT175 |	We can't
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,512	| IOT175 |	Get it
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,792	| IOT175 |	Ted turn off after
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,840	| IOT175 |	So
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,864	| IOT175 |	That is the
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,888	| IOT175 |	Imitation
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,400	| IOT175 |	A vest
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,192	| IOT175 |	Which
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:03,264	| IOT175 |	It would be nice if you could say you know after no motion detected
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,056	| IOT175 |	Per 5 minutes Etc
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,360	| IOT175 |	Can you turn it off but I don't see any trigger done for that
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:11,712	| IOT175 |	So you could try and I went into SmartThings to see if there was
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,224	| IOT175 |	They have app
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,504	| IOT175 |	And SmartThings
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:16,320	| IOT175 |	But you could use since wise is not supported yet by smart
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,136	| IOT175 |	Now it's
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| IOT175 |	Possible
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:23,744	| IOT175 |	That you could create an app in smart things for the state your porch light
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:27,584	| IOT175 |	Turn on if the porch light has been on for more than
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,096	| IOT175 |	10 minutes
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,656	| IOT175 |	After a certain time
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,704	| IOT175 |	You could create a SmartThings app that would turn the
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,776	| IOT175 |	So then you're looking at creating an if tablet
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,056	| IOT175 |	And then a
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:37,568	| IOT175 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:38,848	| IOT175 |	Automation
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:39,872	| IOT175 |	So
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:45,504	| IOT175 |	You know what this is an interesting use of the wyze camera any camera that has motion detection
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,528	| IOT175 |	And I guess
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:51,136	| IOT175 |	The dance trying to do is innocent because the why is cancer so darn cheap I mean is 20 bucks
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,416	| IOT175 |	Because what you could do
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,720	| IOT175 |	Throw another alternative out there
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:57,024	| IOT175 |	Buy a motion detector
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,816	| IOT175 |	Motion sensor that works with
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:01,120	| IOT175 |	SmartThings and what are you say they would cost
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,168	| IOT175 |	40 bucks
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,960	| IOT175 |	Yes it probably like a Z-Wave
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:11,104	| IOT175 |	And just use that because then you could actually have not just light turn on but you could probably set it to turn off as well
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,664	| IOT175 |	That's pretty typical fare for a motion set
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,944	| IOT175 |	Yes
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,736	| IOT175 |	But it is
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,784	| IOT175 |	Because basically everything
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,344	| IOT175 |	Cups of coffee and tea
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,696	| IOT175 |	So bad

EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:07,168	| IOT175 |	And that concludes this portion of the show stay tuned for a message
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,704	| IOT175 |	Shemar sponsored Netgear
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,472	| IOT175 |	And
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,752	| IOT175 |	An interview with
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,800	| IOT175 |	Chris Smith from Otis Elevator
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:17,920	| IOT175 |	You sure is there story about building a predictive algorithm for the elevator what went wrong
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,456	| IOT175 |	Eventually went right
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,480	| IOT175 |	Annie tells us
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,272	| IOT175 |	If the door close button
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:24,064	| IOT175 |	Actually works on these things
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,600	| IOT175 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:32,000	| IOT175 |	Everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:35,584	| IOT175 |	Sponsor is Netgear and I have John McHugh who is
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:38,144	| IOT175 |	A senior vice president of commercial
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,168	| IOT175 |	Parking at
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,728	| IOT175 |	Most of us know what is but
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:45,312	| IOT175 |	Do you want to give us a short summary a lot of people do no nut here
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:48,896	| IOT175 |	But they don't know that they actually we have a very important
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:52,736	| IOT175 |	Strategic role in commercial networking for small businesses
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:54,528	| IOT175 |	Especially for kind of do-it-yourself
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,320	| IOT175 |	Business owners and small office
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:57,344	| IOT175 |	Is home office business
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:02,976	| IOT175 |	And before this we were talking and you said the networking needs to change for the internet
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,512	| IOT175 |	You talk about
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,024	| IOT175 |	What you mean by that
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,584	| IOT175 |	Yeah you know it's so funny because
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,352	| IOT175 |	The internet
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,656	| IOT175 |	Saints runs over networking
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:15,008	| IOT175 |	And the ironic part of this whole thing is networking hasn't changed
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:19,104	| IOT175 |	In the last 10-15 years and it's not taking advantage
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,384	| IOT175 |	Of all the power
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:24,992	| IOT175 |	Potential that is brought with good Internet of Things implementation
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:28,832	| IOT175 |	What is that mean for Netgear and how you guys design your product
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,112	| IOT175 |	Like I said
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,648	| IOT175 |	All networking devices
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:34,208	| IOT175 |	By definition are connected to the network
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:38,560	| IOT175 |	They can be connected to the internet as won't be iot
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:43,424	| IOT175 |	But nobody designed them to do that thing back there two things that really I think make
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,704	| IOT175 |	An Internet of Things
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:46,240	| IOT175 |	Things to buy one is
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:48,032	| IOT175 |	Did user interface
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:49,824	| IOT175 |	Hilton connected to the cloud
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:53,664	| IOT175 |	And it's remotely accessible a drawers on the internet to do
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:56,992	| IOT175 |	Really much more advanced user experience capabilities
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,016	| IOT175 |	And the other thing is
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,320	| IOT175 |	Did it immediately can find the cloud
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,624	| IOT175 |	And get connected to the cloud NFC
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:06,976	| IOT175 |	Cure in a reliable Manner and those two things haven't really been address
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:10,560	| IOT175 |	Networking product until today
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT175 |	Designing your products
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:17,216	| IOT175 |	How did you implement a better user experience and this idea finding the cloud
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:17,984	| IOT175 |	And that was
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:19,520	| IOT175 |	Exactly what we start out to
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| IOT175 |	To do cuz we
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:26,432	| IOT175 |	Other people that were kind of doing internet-of-things networking sort of connected and where they made
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,992	| IOT175 |	Things that jumped off a
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:29,760	| IOT175 |	The page to us
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,784	| IOT175 |	One was
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,832	| IOT175 |	A bunch of cloud connected network devices
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:35,392	| IOT175 |	Don't work at all without
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,928	| IOT175 |	Cloud will guess what
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:38,976	| IOT175 |	People's internet goes up and down
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:41,024	| IOT175 |	And especially small business owners
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,048	| IOT175 |	There's a lot of
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:45,376	| IOT175 |	Complexity of getting something up and rounding that doesn't just
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:47,168	| IOT175 |	Turn on and run for you
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:49,216	| IOT175 |	So the first thing about our inside
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:49,728	| IOT175 |	Cloudconnect
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:52,032	| IOT175 |	Is when you turn them on
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:52,800	| IOT175 |	State-run
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,848	| IOT175 |	Exactly the way existing products
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,408	| IOT175 |	The other thing that we wanted to make
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:03,040	| IOT175 |	Extremely easy was for this thing to automatically home to the cloud and get Uconnect
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,320	| IOT175 |	Without local
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:07,136	| IOT175 |	Servers are Cloud keys or
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,928	| IOT175 |	Weird things you have to put on your network
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:12,000	| IOT175 |	You just discovered the device with an app on your phone
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:12,768	| IOT175 |	And boom
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,816	| IOT175 |	You're connected to the cloud you're connected
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:15,584	| IOT175 |	Sebastian Vice
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:17,632	| IOT175 |	Those were the two things we really
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,656	| IOT175 |	Wanted to do differently
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:22,752	| IOT175 |	Okay sounds good where can we go to find out more about netgear's
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:28,128	| IOT175 |	At www.netgear.com inside
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:42,976	| IOT175 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,256	| IOT175 |	Is Christmas
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:46,304	| IOT175 |	Who is VP of service Innovation that
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,584	| IOT175 |	Otis
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,096	| IOT175 |	Are they turkey
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:49,888	| IOT175 |	Hi Chris how are you doing today
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,168	| IOT175 |	I'm doing great steaks
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,448	| IOT175 |	Thanks for having me on
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:54,240	| IOT175 |	Man I am super excited
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,520	| IOT175 |	Because
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:56,800	| IOT175 |	They're like the thing that allowed
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,336	| IOT175 |	Skyscrapers actually
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,872	| IOT175 |	Steel with that but then we also need Adele
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:01,664	| IOT175 |	Water jet
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,432	| IOT175 |	You guys
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,968	| IOT175 |	So you guys are now doing
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:05,760	| IOT175 |	Connected elevator
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:09,088	| IOT175 |	And you are very clear.
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:11,136	| IOT175 |	So tell me a little bit about the role of
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,160	| IOT175 |	Communication
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:17,024	| IOT175 |	Sure so you know it's 30 years ago when we transition
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:19,328	| IOT175 |	From older relays called relay logic Tech
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,608	| IOT175 |	The microprocessor
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,424	| IOT175 |	It was a big change for our mechanics
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:24,960	| IOT175 |	And the mechanics
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:28,032	| IOT175 |	Needed some help literally instead of tracing wiring diagram
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:31,616	| IOT175 |	GrandStay had to there's this black box a PC board that had all the in
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:34,432	| IOT175 |	So our engineers said you know what
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:37,248	| IOT175 |	Let's come up with a way
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:40,064	| IOT175 |	How to remotely Connect into an elevator using a
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:44,672	| IOT175 |	Dietary homegrown REM system we called it Ram remote elevator Bonner
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,952	| IOT175 |	And analog phone
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:50,048	| IOT175 |	So we would dial in and help troubleshoot the information
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:53,888	| IOT175 |	It was designed to be read by a very senior experience
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| IOT175 |	Engineer and
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,960	| IOT175 |	Was for them to help and kind of thin translate back to me
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,264	| IOT175 |	Pentagon hey this is what the issue is
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:02,592	| IOT175 |	So for 30 years we've been doing that
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,360	| IOT175 |	And evolving.
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:07,456	| IOT175 |	Technology and then of course the new technologies came along called The Internet of Things and
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:10,528	| IOT175 |	Industry 4.0 and we said we need to do this a
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,808	| IOT175 |	And that's where we are today
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,624	| IOT175 |	Is product called Otis one
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,416	| IOT175 |	And you still use microphone
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,720	| IOT175 |	So what exactly is changed
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,256	| IOT175 |	You're swapping out your analog phone lines
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,072	| IOT175 |	Borgia cellular initially
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,096	| IOT175 |	You know we'd eventually
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,912	| IOT175 |	The landline or buy firewood
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:31,264	| IOT175 |	Comfortable with just yet in their buildings we will
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:33,312	| IOT175 |	Use that but initially our initial product
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,872	| IOT175 |	Cellular and we're not building this ourselves
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:36,640	| IOT175 |	Parking without a cup
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,944	| IOT175 |	Tell you about another's work
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:39,968	| IOT175 |	I can't right now but
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:44,064	| IOT175 |	We didn't take the data off the elevator put it through a gateway
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:45,088	| IOT175 |	Do some Edge computing
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:50,208	| IOT175 |	With some of the data those that which we need to process and then we send it to the Azure cloud
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,976	| IOT175 |	One of our Park
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:54,304	| IOT175 |	Is Microsoft and Course once it's in the cloud that's where you
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:59,936	| IOT175 |	Do all your big data analytics and get all these different Insight switch before it was for that engineer
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:03,008	| IOT175 |	But now it's insights that we can give it directly to a customer
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,544	| IOT175 |	Biba directly to our mechanics
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,616	| IOT175 |	In it to anyone else
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:09,920	| IOT175 |	Reporting. End-user the passenger
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,200	| IOT175 |	You can even start connecting
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:12,224	| IOT175 |	The elevator in ways I can say
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:15,552	| IOT175 |	So it's done in a very different way with partners
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,112	| IOT175 |	Okay
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,136	| IOT175 |	We're going to dig into all of that
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,696	| IOT175 |	Temptations project to do but
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,000	| IOT175 |	What does enable your customers to do
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:26,048	| IOT175 |	What are they excited about when you offer
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:30,656	| IOT175 |	Yeah tour customers actually have no we done extensive
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,168	| IOT175 |	Research over the
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:32,448	| IOT175 |	Jerry cancel
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:34,496	| IOT175 |	Customers tell us they want
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:35,264	| IOT175 |	Predictive
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,288	| IOT175 |	Proactive and Tran
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,336	| IOT175 |	Predictive text
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:41,920	| IOT175 |	The first thing is everyone's heard about it hey I don't want things to break
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:44,480	| IOT175 |	I want my elevators to be up and running we call that up.
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| IOT175 |	So that's the first thing we do
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,296	| IOT175 |	You can do with that
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:50,112	| IOT175 |	So elevators are the outside doors with
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,392	| IOT175 |	Proceed actually
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:52,672	| IOT175 |	70%
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:53,696	| IOT175 |	All shutdown
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,000	| IOT175 |	So one of the advantages of doing this
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,536	| IOT175 |	For 30 years connecting elevators
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:59,072	| IOT175 |	We have a lot of data
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,352	| IOT175 |	Elevator shutdown
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:03,680	| IOT175 |	And so we did the Pareto chart and says okay if you're going to come
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,704	| IOT175 |	What are you
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,520	| IOT175 |	First and we said okay let's go after these door calls
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:13,408	| IOT175 |	How do we prevent door calls and so we took all this data and working with vendors and we have a research center
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:15,200	| IOT175 |	Because United Technologies Research Center
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,992	| IOT175 |	Bunch of really smart phds
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:20,064	| IOT175 |	We came up with an algorithm that helps us
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:22,112	| IOT175 |	Predict when the elevator maintenance should be
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:24,416	| IOT175 |	It actually was an interesting Journey when we started
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,208	| IOT175 |	Predictive Solutions
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:27,488	| IOT175 |	We were trying to figure out a
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,024	| IOT175 |	Exactly when the elevator was shut down
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,816	| IOT175 |	In quite frankly it wasn't very sick
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:36,192	| IOT175 |	What we were able to then do is when we went to our Research Center they said you know you're looking at the problem
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,728	| IOT175 |	Wrong way you really can't predict
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:40,800	| IOT175 |	Like your doctor can't predict you know you have 27
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,336	| IOT175 |	Years and 3 months to live
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,128	| IOT175 |	The doctor can predict your health
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:50,016	| IOT175 |	I can't your health your numbers are going up or down and keep doing this change this and that's what we are able to do
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:50,784	| IOT175 |	Squishies
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:52,576	| IOT175 |	We were predicting now we predict
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,136	| IOT175 |	And therefore
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:58,720	| IOT175 |	Time when to send a mechanic to get there to do the preventive maintenance
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,864	| IOT175 |	So instead of saying when is
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:05,888	| IOT175 |	It's not feasible
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:07,680	| IOT175 |	Is it not feasible
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:12,032	| IOT175 |	Well at least four doors we went through successfully shifted that mindset
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:13,824	| IOT175 |	Again I don't want to say we can't get there
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,616	| IOT175 |	Someday but you know now it's within range
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,408	| IOT175 |	We know below a certain
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,432	| IOT175 |	Score week
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:21,760	| IOT175 |	Score at we say that's now in the yellow category and we should get out there within
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,296	| IOT175 |	21 days
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:25,344	| IOT175 |	And when it goes red we like oh no now we need
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:25,856	| IOT175 |	To get out there with something
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,904	| IOT175 |	So it's not as
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:29,184	| IOT175 |	We were trying to get it really precise
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,000	| IOT175 |	But when we
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:32,512	| IOT175 |	Talk to health
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,048	| IOT175 |	And trending health
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,072	| IOT175 |	That's when we started
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,096	| IOT175 |	Great results
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,424	| IOT175 |	Just help me out here how many factors
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,472	| IOT175 |	Are there in an elevator door close
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:42,496	| IOT175 |	Closing play into the
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,056	| IOT175 |	Well dozens and dozens
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:48,128	| IOT175 |	Because the elevator doors ride on a sill you mites
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:49,664	| IOT175 |	See that when you walk cross news
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:51,200	| IOT175 |	Ridges in it and so there's
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:54,784	| IOT175 |	Call Gibbs that keep the elevator in the seal and that still can get dirt in
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:56,320	| IOT175 |	Which has nothing to do with the elevator
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:58,368	| IOT175 |	How to do how much dirt is being tracked
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,648	| IOT175 |	The building was there contractor
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,440	| IOT175 |	Building the elevator
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,720	| IOT175 |	Doors run on roller
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:05,024	| IOT175 |	And the rollers you know again in
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:05,792	| IOT175 |	That's on a track
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,560	| IOT175 |	Back in the game
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:08,352	| IOT175 |	Dirt and debris in Elevator Shaft
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:12,192	| IOT175 |	Similar to a chimney so everything is where's the building located
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:13,728	| IOT175 |	What time of year is it where's the
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:18,848	| IOT175 |	The front door when the front door is opened is all this wind coming in and going up the chimney so
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:20,640	| IOT175 |	Different job site conditions are
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:26,784	| IOT175 |	A critical time of year is critical what's going on the building so we will see you don't see a nice smooth trend
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:28,576	| IOT175 |	Building a
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:33,696	| IOT175 |	Office building three stories we should see the same Trends know it's all
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,720	| IOT175 |	Mothers of Aries facts
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,256	| IOT175 |	Geography
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,816	| IOT175 |	So now let's we talked about for your custom
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,376	| IOT175 |	What is connecting your elevators
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,144	| IOT175 |	In this fashion
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,424	| IOT175 |	Do for you guys
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:49,056	| IOT175 |	Oh so ultimately if I can when the customer say I want predictive I want pract
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:51,104	| IOT175 |	Xidan transparent obviously if we can
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:52,128	| IOT175 |	Keep our customers
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,687	| IOT175 |	Inform and give them all those three things they don't want to leave
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:56,735	| IOT175 |	Sprint so they want to stay with us
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:59,039	| IOT175 |	Notice you're giving doing a great job
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:01,087	| IOT175 |	I will continue with under a maintenance agreement
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:03,135	| IOT175 |	Can you having a service you
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,415	| IOT175 |	Competitive industry
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:05,439	| IOT175 |	We have anyone wants
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:08,511	| IOT175 |	Product with a good reputation
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,535	| IOT175 |	Competitors would love to have our
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:12,095	| IOT175 |	So then you start getting into a price game
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:12,863	| IOT175 |	Yes you can
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,911	| IOT175 |	Chilton like why would I leave for
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,191	| IOT175 |	A few dollars cuz Otis's
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:16,703	| IOT175 |	Lighting X
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,519	| IOT175 |	And we should point out for people that
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:22,079	| IOT175 |	You might buy an Otis Elevator
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,871	| IOT175 |	And put it in your building
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,663	| IOT175 |	Over the years you also have two choices
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:26,943	| IOT175 |	Choosing contractors
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,271	| IOT175 |	It's not right
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,807	| IOT175 |	Some people might think
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:32,831	| IOT175 |	Clearly
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:33,599	| IOT175 |	If you don't work out your own
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,415	| IOT175 |	Duct a c if I had a nickel for everytime
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:39,999	| IOT175 |	Someone said to me you don't have any competition do you you're the only elevator come
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:40,767	| IOT175 |	I'd be very
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:42,303	| IOT175 |	Now we have plenty of
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:43,839	| IOT175 |	Listening people do on their elevator
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,471	| IOT175 |	Okay so continuing on
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:50,239	| IOT175 |	With your
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:50,751	| IOT175 |	Benefits to you
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,079	| IOT175 |	So the other key benefit to us
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,871	| IOT175 |	Is we can start scheduling
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,895	| IOT175 |	More practice
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:58,687	| IOT175 |	So in my example earlier
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:00,223	| IOT175 |	We now
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:01,247	| IOT175 |	Return day
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:02,271	| IOT175 |	Reactive
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:03,295	| IOT175 |	Murphy's Law
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:05,087	| IOT175 |	Situation where is Murphy's Law
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:07,647	| IOT175 |	For a mechanic I was just in the middle of doing it
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,671	| IOT175 |	Detailed maintenance
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:10,463	| IOT175 |	Routine at this one building and then I got a service
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:13,279	| IOT175 |	And now I have to leave pack up my tools and
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:13,791	| IOT175 |	Drive
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:16,351	| IOT175 |	And driving is the most unproductive timing
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,399	| IOT175 |	And get to the next building inmate
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,471	| IOT175 |	So obviously now when we can say no
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,495	| IOT175 |	We think in the next
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,775	| IOT175 |	5/7 days
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:24,799	| IOT175 |	21 days
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:26,335	| IOT175 |	Elevator a
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,871	| IOT175 |	In this building is going to shut down
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| IOT175 |	The doors
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:29,919	| IOT175 |	We can now schedule that
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:31,199	| IOT175 |	Put it into his maintenance
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:38,367	| IOT175 |	When he's going to still be there so think about it the customer was going to have a shutdown they were going to have someone come and look at
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,391	| IOT175 |	Shutdown ended
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,951	| IOT175 |	The doors but it's going to be after a very
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,975	| IOT175 |	Tinsel events
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:45,023	| IOT175 |	Now we are still getting that same service
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:45,791	| IOT175 |	Beginning a corrective
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,839	| IOT175 |	And we can put into an ice maker
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,631	| IOT175 |	Schedule as opposed to being reactive
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,911	| IOT175 |	Totus more efficient
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:53,471	| IOT175 |	What metrics are you implementing
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:54,751	| IOT175 |	To account for
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,031	| IOT175 |	Things that don't
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,823	| IOT175 |	Because it's really hard
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:00,127	| IOT175 |	As we start making things more efficient
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:05,247	| IOT175 |	It's harder to say hey this terrible thing didn't happen and it was because of us
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:10,111	| IOT175 |	Exactly until that's where the transparency comes in place
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,647	| IOT175 |	What we're doing is for sharing with
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:12,927	| IOT175 |	Sonic custom
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:15,743	| IOT175 |	Portal for sharing with them their health scores available
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:18,303	| IOT175 |	Lyrics to show them and then when we do do a proactive
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:22,399	| IOT175 |	Close to react if we also showing them that as well hey
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,167	| IOT175 |	We came and did maintenance
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:25,215	| IOT175 |	Because your elevator door health
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,519	| IOT175 |	Sending negative and therefore your main
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,287	| IOT175 |	This is being done
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:32,127	| IOT175 |	Before we only shared with them hey we did a call back and we only shared kind of the bad
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:34,175	| IOT175 |	So now we're sharing
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:34,943	| IOT175 |	The bad news in the good
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,991	| IOT175 |	And so that hopefully of the
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:38,527	| IOT175 |	Scentsy while you guys are
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:41,087	| IOT175 |	I do have 99.9% uptime which
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:42,111	| IOT175 |	But there's a reason
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,903	| IOT175 |	Write instead of just
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:44,415	| IOT175 |	Just unlocked
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:47,999	| IOT175 |	Because I can see the maintenance you're doing in the timing that you're doing it
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:49,023	| IOT175 |	And my building is in the
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,071	| IOT175 |	Our customers tell us if
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:53,375	| IOT175 |	If you could delimited one thing for us
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,399	| IOT175 |	Illumination
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:56,703	| IOT175 |	Shut down
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,263	| IOT175 |	Okay this overarching trend
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:02,591	| IOT175 |	You know I see it in my connected devices I see it
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,615	| IOT175 |	Industrial
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:05,151	| IOT175 |	If we leave Eliza
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:05,919	| IOT175 |	A lot
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:06,943	| IOT175 |	People having trust with
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,271	| IOT175 |	Because I can see a lot of people being like
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,319	| IOT175 |	What is this
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:15,391	| IOT175 |	Came out did this right
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,671	| IOT175 |	Feeling like
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:17,439	| IOT175 |	Padding your numbers
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,719	| IOT175 |	Does people wear
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,279	| IOT175 |	Playwright
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:25,375	| IOT175 |	Transparency is key but how do you think other companies trying
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:25,887	| IOT175 |	How to do this
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:28,191	| IOT175 |	Create that trust
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:33,567	| IOT175 |	Have their bills or insert some sort of
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:36,383	| IOT175 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,919	| IOT175 |	You know I think the other keys
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:39,967	| IOT175 |	You saying is to share with the cuss
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:41,503	| IOT175 |	Tomorrow at the line of sight
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,271	| IOT175 |	Where they will have to
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:43,551	| IOT175 |	Most mechanic
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:46,879	| IOT175 |	Trevor Wright elevators will not last
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:49,951	| IOT175 |	The building is now a hundred years old original elevator
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:50,975	| IOT175 |	It needs to be upgrade
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:57,375	| IOT175 |	Great there's new needs in the building they need to move people faster in the building so they can have to upgrade the machines and make it faster in the
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,911	| IOT175 |	Brains to make it move faster
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:01,215	| IOT175 |	So when you can give
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:03,263	| IOT175 |	And it's all good
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,799	| IOT175 |	Apparently but give that customer
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:06,591	| IOT175 |	Because of the data you're getting
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:07,871	| IOT175 |	Usage information
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:09,919	| IOT175 |	Like your car hate my tires are going to last
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:11,455	| IOT175 |	So many miles between an oil change
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:14,015	| IOT175 |	That's the same thing you have to start giving that customer
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,295	| IOT175 |	That line of sight that
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,855	| IOT175 |	Customers understand hate I know eventually
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:19,391	| IOT175 |	I know we got to change my
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:21,951	| IOT175 |	So here
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:26,047	| IOT175 |	With data you know what you're going to get another hundred thousand trips out of that door
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:27,839	| IOT175 |	Operator before scot-free upgrade
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,375	| IOT175 |	Cricket in this is going to cost
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,143	| IOT175 |	This much
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:32,447	| IOT175 |	And it's three years out to want you start putting away some
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:38,335	| IOT175 |	Any of the next thing that's going to go is your machine but that can last a million trip
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:40,127	| IOT175 |	And you're so many trips out from that
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:40,895	| IOT175 |	Start investing
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:42,175	| IOT175 |	You're putting this song
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,991	| IOT175 |	I think that's where then you're truly are
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:47,039	| IOT175 |	Kiss I hate surprises
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:48,319	| IOT175 |	It's right no one wants to hear
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:51,647	| IOT175 |	Hey I guess what you have to spend $20,000 on this system
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:53,183	| IOT175 |	And just like we didn't budget.
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:54,463	| IOT175 |	Well feel sorry
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:55,487	| IOT175 |	But you need to do it
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:59,327	| IOT175 |	That's true okay that's a good point I like that okay and finally
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:01,119	| IOT175 |	What is his offer to
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:04,191	| IOT175 |	The people who ride in the elevator
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:05,727	| IOT175 |	The people who are waiting for
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:07,775	| IOT175 |	Is there anything that
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:09,055	| IOT175 |	You can build off of
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,335	| IOT175 |	You're one platform to
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:13,919	| IOT175 |	Yeah so you know what you're saying and that's
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:17,759	| IOT175 |	Passenger experience we are talking a lot about it in our customers are talking
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,783	| IOT175 |	How do we improve
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:21,343	| IOT175 |	Audi can you make it seem
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:22,879	| IOT175 |	I don't have to
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:23,391	| IOT175 |	Presents
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:26,719	| IOT175 |	Security badge and then go up in
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:29,023	| IOT175 |	Identify myself Uniden pick which elevator
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,839	| IOT175 |	So I can check myself into
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:34,399	| IOT175 |	To the building using my phone which 10 knows that it's
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,423	| IOT175 |	8 in the morning
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:37,215	| IOT175 |	And I work on the 12th floor
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:40,799	| IOT175 |	And if therefore seamlessly assigns me the elevator to get on
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,847	| IOT175 |	So that kind of seamless pastor
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:44,895	| IOT175 |	Elevators are knock
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:47,711	| IOT175 |	Straight people don't know where to look
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:50,527	| IOT175 |	Where to turn should I talk to somebody who I know but they're
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:52,063	| IOT175 |	Three other people in the elevator
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:54,623	| IOT175 |	It's so giving them some infotainment
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:55,647	| IOT175 |	In the elevator cab
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:58,207	| IOT175 |	Your music different things like that we actually Alex
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:00,255	| IOT175 |	Recalling a talking elevator
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:02,303	| IOT175 |	Integrating Alexa
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:03,327	| IOT175 |	And Cortana
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:04,351	| IOT175 |	And when we
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:07,167	| IOT175 |	Put this at a trade show recently the amount of excitement
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:08,703	| IOT175 |	Star Trek
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:11,775	| IOT175 |	4 Captain Kirk would get on and say you know Bridge
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:14,335	| IOT175 |	And the elevator were just taking to the bridge and you know
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:17,151	| IOT175 |	The idea of going into an elevator and say take me to mister Smith's off
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:18,687	| IOT175 |	Instead of having to remember
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:25,343	| IOT175 |	On the 12th floor so it's things like that that you start making the ride a little more fun and more
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:29,695	| IOT175 |	Have you actually tried out mattimeo
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,231	| IOT175 |	China Inn
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:34,815	| IOT175 |	I just feel like it would be super awkward to be shouting out
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:36,351	| IOT175 |	Take me here take me there
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:37,375	| IOT175 |	Take me to my divorce lawyer
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:39,167	| IOT175 |	I don't know
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:41,983	| IOT175 |	So we've done it demonstration
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:43,263	| IOT175 |	Big trade show
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:46,079	| IOT175 |	They got a lot of interest you're right they're developing
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,359	| IOT175 |	Believe It or Not developers of the
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:48,383	| IOT175 |	Most interested but
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:51,711	| IOT175 |	Particularly they saw an initial application and let's say in a residential
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:55,295	| IOT175 |	We're in the Residential Building typically there's not too many
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:55,807	| IOT175 |	People riding elk
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:49:00,927	| IOT175 |	So that could be very helpful in a commercial building where there's any
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,695	| IOT175 |	5
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:06,815	| IOT175 |	12 people on the elevator one time you're right I think we have a ways to go but the only certain applications
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:07,583	| IOT175 |	They can see this
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,095	| IOT175 |	Speed working out
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,631	| IOT175 |	Okay cool
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:11,423	| IOT175 |	So let's not talk about
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:12,447	| IOT175 |	My goodness
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,471	| IOT175 |	How have you are
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:18,847	| IOT175 |	I thought it's a little nerdy but you know we talked about Edge Computing and
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:22,431	| IOT175 |	Predictive Analytics I don't know what you're doing
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,991	| IOT175 |	What is this look like from
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:25,759	| IOT175 |	Physical
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:26,527	| IOT175 |	Technology
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:27,039	| IOT175 |	Perspective
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:31,903	| IOT175 |	So you know for Otis elevators obviously we know the language right
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:33,951	| IOT175 |	With the brain and how it talks so
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:37,023	| IOT175 |	Those elevators we can pull information directly off
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:42,911	| IOT175 |	The controller and we like I said we put it to an edge Computing device where some information is just in from
EDL	00:49:42,911	00:49:45,215	| IOT175 |	Usage things like that you don't have to say
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:47,775	| IOT175 |	Send that up every elevator
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:50,335	| IOT175 |	Is it for a bank of elevators
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:53,407	| IOT175 |	Yeah that the Gateway can be shared between monks
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:56,223	| IOT175 |	There's a limit but the Gateway can be shared
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:58,015	| IOT175 |	But every elevator itself would have
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:01,855	| IOT175 |	I so wanted to buy spur elevator but then the Gateway can be shared
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:03,903	| IOT175 |	Okay so
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:06,463	| IOT175 |	You're sending it to the Gateway some of it goes to the cloud
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:08,511	| IOT175 |	So we send it
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:09,279	| IOT175 |	And in the cloud
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:10,815	| IOT175 |	That's where we
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:11,839	| IOT175 |	How to State a witch
EDL	00:50:11,839	00:50:14,655	| IOT175 |	We can share with whatever information we need if it's an immediate shutdown
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:16,959	| IOT175 |	Elevator
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:17,983	| IOT175 |	We know it's a meter
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:20,799	| IOT175 |	Right that'll make this meaning this isn't going to
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:21,567	| IOT175 |	Self heal
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,591	| IOT175 |	Do we have things that at
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:23,615	| IOT175 |	Kind of grocery
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:27,199	| IOT175 |	And that we meet Lee
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:28,223	| IOT175 |	Send notification
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:32,063	| IOT175 |	And we've actually been now informed the customer that you know
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:33,343	| IOT175 |	Instead of you calling us
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:34,111	| IOT175 |	This is where practice
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:35,647	| IOT175 |	Which by the way
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:38,975	| IOT175 |	In the old way 99.9% of our customers
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:39,743	| IOT175 |	Call this a couple
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:40,255	| IOT175 |	Use an app
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:42,815	| IOT175 |	Say hey Malibu
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:43,583	| IOT175 |	Shut down
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:45,119	| IOT175 |	You say really who are you where are you
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:46,911	| IOT175 |	Okay we'll send a mechanic
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:52,543	| IOT175 |	DayQuil with this now we know when the certain fault codes are it's a hard shutdown in the only thing it's going to fit
EDL	00:50:53,311	00:50:53,823	| IOT175 |	The sound of a cat
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:56,127	| IOT175 |	So instead of waiting
EDL	00:50:56,127	00:50:57,407	| IOT175 |	You can imagine in the building
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:59,455	| IOT175 |	Sometimes hours we work
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:02,015	| IOT175 |	Say we just found out her elevator is down for 3 days
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:03,039	| IOT175 |	We now know me
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:05,087	| IOT175 |	Be much more proactive
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:07,647	| IOT175 |	We send the info so we kind of
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:08,415	| IOT175 |	That
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:10,975	| IOT175 |	Computing says none of this is really important data
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:13,279	| IOT175 |	Information I need to send this up immediately and it's
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:15,071	| IOT175 |	Straight the eyes we didn't notify differ
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:16,863	| IOT175 |	Systems and say this is a shutdown
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:18,399	| IOT175 |	Send a trigger to the customer
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:19,423	| IOT175 |	Senator going to mechanic
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:20,959	| IOT175 |	Everyone know that
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:24,031	| IOT175 |	We need to get out there and fix it and then other information is just
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:25,311	| IOT175 |	More like I said
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:25,823	| IOT175 |	It was more kind of
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:30,175	| IOT175 |	Useful information how many trips did it make on Tuesday afternoon what's the most
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,711	| IOT175 |	Know how many trips
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:33,503	| IOT175 |	Did it make in a day and that's it
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:34,527	| IOT175 |	Information now
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:37,087	| IOT175 |	Help us with predictions it will help us with
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:37,855	| IOT175 |	Estimating how long
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:40,415	| IOT175 |	What is not critical information
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:44,511	| IOT175 |	And like I said earlier we use cellular technology to
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:47,583	| IOT175 |	So how much data does
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:48,607	| IOT175 |	Elevator generator
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:49,375	| IOT175 |	How much data
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:52,959	| IOT175 |	It's less than you think and then month
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:53,983	| IOT175 |	Probably about
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:55,519	| IOT175 |	When is less than 20 megabytes
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:57,823	| IOT175 |	Really it's not that much now it depends on if
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:52:01,151	| IOT175 |	If you move into voice and video and things like that
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:01,919	| IOT175 |	The date is
EDL	00:52:03,199	00:52:03,967	| IOT175 |	When it's just
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:07,295	| IOT175 |	Regular data just deleted off an elevator is not a lot of data
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:10,111	| IOT175 |	Okay and that you're sending
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:13,439	| IOT175 |	Powdered is 28 overall
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,487	| IOT175 |	Yeah that's much less data than
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:17,279	| IOT175 |	Yes small packets
EDL	00:52:18,815	00:52:20,863	| IOT175 |	I've been conditioned by the GE airplane
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:21,631	| IOT175 |	Tangent example
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:24,959	| IOT175 |	So what other
EDL	00:52:24,959	00:52:27,007	| IOT175 |	Technology iot initiative
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:27,519	| IOT175 |	Are you guys in
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:35,711	| IOT175 |	Stacy was a pleasure you know we were part of a society or this one is bigger part of a bigger service transfer
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:37,759	| IOT175 |	Cremation and we started with giving all of
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:39,039	| IOT175 |	IPhone screen
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:41,599	| IOT175 |	So
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:42,879	| IOT175 |	That is a plastic
EDL	00:52:42,879	00:52:44,159	| IOT175 |	Which stem weed adult apps
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:46,463	| IOT175 |	So now that we have this
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:48,767	| IOT175 |	Common platform we can share information with the
EDL	00:52:48,767	00:52:49,535	| IOT175 |	Mechanics
EDL	00:52:49,535	00:52:52,351	| IOT175 |	Much easier but I'll give you an example of one app that are mechanics really low
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:53,631	| IOT175 |	It's a party
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:54,655	| IOT175 |	So 106
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:55,423	| IOT175 |	55 years
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:57,471	| IOT175 |	You can imagine there's a lot of different elevator
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:52:59,519	| IOT175 |	Anatomy course all the competitors
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:01,311	| IOT175 |	So imagine the parts list
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:03,615	| IOT175 |	And it literally would take
EDL	00:53:04,383	00:53:04,895	| IOT175 |	Hours for
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:08,223	| IOT175 |	So we built an app where
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:08,991	| IOT175 |	Steak and
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:10,527	| IOT175 |	If I start typing in
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:11,551	| IOT175 |	Product you working on
EDL	00:53:12,063	00:53:13,855	| IOT175 |	Name it I know it's I know that
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:14,879	| IOT175 |	It's a relay
EDL	00:53:14,879	00:53:18,207	| IOT175 |	And I know it's on this type of elevator and then it starts shorting it
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:19,999	| IOT175 |	4 man mechanics are saying it's saving them
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:21,791	| IOT175 |	In the field
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:23,071	| IOT175 |	Which means our customers elders
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:25,375	| IOT175 |	So the oldest
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:27,167	| IOT175 |	One in the iot is just
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:28,447	| IOT175 |	Is part of a much bigger
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:30,495	| IOT175 |	Transformation with your by the way also
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:31,519	| IOT175 |	Involves the culture
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:32,031	| IOT175 |	You know that's
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:33,823	| IOT175 |	Animation
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:34,591	| IOT175 |	Begins and ends
EDL	00:53:34,591	00:53:35,359	| IOT175 |	Culture
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:36,127	| IOT175 |	And although
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:37,407	| IOT175 |	Digitalization that we do
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:38,431	| IOT175 |	It's just the support
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:40,223	| IOT175 |	So that was 51
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:44,063	| IOT175 |	And my final question
EDL	00:53:44,063	00:53:46,367	| IOT175 |	Are you close by
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:47,903	| IOT175 |	On the elevator
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:48,415	| IOT175 |	Actually
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:50,719	| IOT175 |	So the answer is it.
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:51,743	| IOT175 |	And it does
