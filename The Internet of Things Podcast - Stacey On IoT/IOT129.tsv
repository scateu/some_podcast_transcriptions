EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,280	| IOT129 |	. com for more information
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,864	| IOT129 |	Already Kevin did you watch the
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,376	| IOT129 |	Apple
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:45,984	| IOT129 |	Chino products lunch newsreels / press conference
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:53,152	| IOT129 |	The Extravaganza yes I did a whole two hours of it which we're not going to discuss in detail a lot
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:54,176	| IOT129 |	What they talk about
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,992	| IOT129 |	Partly because they didn't talk at all about
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:02:01,344	| IOT129 |	Homekit not much about Siri the dimensional homepod that's coming out
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,904	| IOT129 |	Is there assistant with speaker so there isn't
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,952	| IOT129 |	With a lot of iron T stuff I came out of that
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,232	| IOT129 |	True I'm wondering
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,512	| IOT129 |	Do you think
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,024	| IOT129 |	So you've watched
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,304	| IOT129 |	Long time
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,328	| IOT129 |	Longer than
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:13,376	| IOT129 |	So do you think the lack of
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:19,776	| IOT129 |	Any message in your own home kit or homepod is indicative of any like lateness for the product which is supposed to be
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,544	| IOT129 |	December
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:23,104	| IOT129 |	I personally think they've had a continued
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:25,664	| IOT129 |	Lateness for a lot of their
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,200	| IOT129 |	Homekit + Smart Home
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:29,760	| IOT129 |	Efforts quite honestly this is so I'm not surprised
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,296	| IOT129 |	I really did it
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:35,136	| IOT129 |	Specs that serious selfie would show off how much better it's gotten
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,160	| IOT129 |	That was what I was
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:45,376	| IOT129 |	Exactly exactly so they didn't do that
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,424	| IOT129 |	Instead it focused on the traditional products app
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,240	| IOT129 |	Apple TV iPhones and Apple watch
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:52,288	| IOT129 |	So yeah maybe the
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,568	| IOT129 |	Apple homepod event
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:58,176	| IOT129 |	Later in the year and that's when I say look how great Siri is for this device and all your other devices
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:58,688	| IOT129 |	I don't know
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:00,992	| IOT129 |	We'll wait and see
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:01,760	| IOT129 |	We don't have anything today
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:02,784	| IOT129 |	But I was surprised
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT129 |	We talked about whereabouts
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,112	| IOT129 |	Especially
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:09,696	| IOT129 |	With Kevin tofel Runner extraordinaire on the show so
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,488	| IOT129 |	Let's talk about the Apple watch
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,512	| IOT129 |	Which ticket
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,536	| IOT129 |	Big
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:19,168	| IOT129 |	Did did basically the biggest feature that they're adding is
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,960	| IOT129 |	As rumored in LTE radio
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:26,336	| IOT129 |	I'm actually considering on this is crazy cuz I'm not
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,128	| IOT129 |	Big I'm paying for additional
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,432	| IOT129 |	Pictures and such that they don't use that much but
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:34,528	| IOT129 |	I'm actually think about buying or upgrading my Apple Watch 2 to an Apple Watch 3 with cellular
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:40,160	| IOT129 |	I believe it has about $79 to the cost just for that radio edition and then of course it's the service
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:44,768	| IOT129 |	That's really got me kind of hung up because I was hoping to be like five bucks a month at most
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,608	| IOT129 |	Unfortunately it looks like all the carriers are going to at least in the US are going to
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| IOT129 |	Offer
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:52,960	| IOT129 |	Three months of free service to try it and then it will be $10 per month
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| IOT129 |	Going forward
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:59,616	| IOT129 |	And the thing is if we use the same phone number as you were Apple phone which is convenient
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:02,944	| IOT129 |	That's great but there's color issues with battery life
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,712	| IOT129 |	We can talk about that in a second
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,504	| IOT129 |	+ 2
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:11,904	| IOT129 |	Is it really worth adding an LTE option for $10 a month on someone's going to use such little data and
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:16,768	| IOT129 |	They charge $10 a month at a tablet where with the big screen you can use gobs of data
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,559	| IOT129 |	Disparity that I'm not
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| IOT129 |	Comfortable with self
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,351	| IOT129 |	That's cuz you
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,167	| IOT129 |	Now most people in this is what
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,679	| IOT129 |	Cellular carrier
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,959	| IOT129 |	Counting on
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,727	| IOT129 |	These look like
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:26,751	| IOT129 |	Oh
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:30,079	| IOT129 |	Look I have always-on access to music and whatever on my watch
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,615	| IOT129 |	I have Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,895	| IOT129 |	But I don't have my phone with
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,687	| IOT129 |	Right at work
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT129 |	$10
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| IOT129 |	Most people say no
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,039	| IOT129 |	I really do
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,111	| IOT129 |	I don't know we'll have to see it meaning
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,647	| IOT129 |	It's a personal choice obviously
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,463	| IOT129 |	Because the question is are you doing something that
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:50,303	| IOT129 |	You need your phone with you or you can leave it behind in my particular use case I run everyday
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:57,215	| IOT129 |	And I also now I write out small scooter motorcycle type device and having my phone with me of course in emergencies important
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,007	| IOT129 |	But
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:02,335	| IOT129 |	If I can have the added convenience of leaving the pain behind if
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:04,127	| IOT129 |	I'm in an emergency situation and
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,407	| IOT129 |	Make a call from iWatch
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,967	| IOT129 |	That's handy I'm out by myself in all of these cases
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT129 |	So
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| IOT129 |	Well that's a good
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,575	| IOT129 |	Until what we should talk about battery life cuz I
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,367	| IOT129 |	I think that's a big issue but I've also
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,671	| IOT129 |	Thinking about let's take it a little bit further
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,207	| IOT129 |	Imagine like a nearpod world
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,303	| IOT129 |	Phone is essentially on your wrist not need your phone then
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,327	| IOT129 |	For very
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| IOT129 |	All when you're just going out
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,423	| IOT129 |	Casually not mean right if you're going to be out
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:27,935	| IOT129 |	For a while
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,495	| IOT129 |	Browse the internet but if you're just
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,567	| IOT129 |	Suddenly becomes kind of like this is the next version
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,127	| IOT129 |	At the computer in your hand maybe it's a computer and
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:36,895	| IOT129 |	Tristan
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,175	| IOT129 |	It's kind of compelling
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:41,247	| IOT129 |	Yeah it is kind of compelling they also in this
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,527	| IOT129 |	Kind of coincides
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,807	| IOT129 |	Because you now have connectivity
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT129 |	You can
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:48,927	| IOT129 |	And I'm surprised you're doing this because of battery life you can stream songs
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,719	| IOT129 |	Directly from Apple music
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:57,119	| IOT129 |	So they're saying hey you got 49 songs on your wrist now you can obviously take and receive calls and messages get notifications
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,399	| IOT129 |	Is that I don't care about what I'm running
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,423	| IOT129 |	But interesting
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,191	| IOT129 |	Siri will work
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| IOT129 |	End
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,495	| IOT129 |	She can now talk
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,823	| IOT129 |	As opposed to today's Apple watches you have to look at the screen
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,383	| IOT129 |	So with the connectivity and the boosted speaker
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,199	| IOT129 |	You can actually interact with Siri to ask questions get directions
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,991	| IOT129 |	And so on without having your phone
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| IOT129 |	So $10 a month
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,087	| IOT129 |	I don't know I'm actually thinking about it that prefer it was five
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,111	| IOT129 |	Included
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,903	| IOT129 |	There's a lot of these cases
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,231	| IOT129 |	I know
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,743	| IOT129 |	Stock. The battery
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,583	| IOT129 |	How far can you
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:28,095	| IOT129 |	You running
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,167	| IOT129 |	Well I'll be okay so
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,191	| IOT129 |	Overall
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:35,263	| IOT129 |	Annapolis testing they say you can pretty much get 18 hours
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:41,663	| IOT129 |	On a charge and they base that on 4 hours of an LTE Connection in 14 hours connect to your phone via Bluetooth
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:48,063	| IOT129 |	They even say it's you know it works out to like 90 notifications 90 time checks 45 minutes of Athens in a 30-minute
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| IOT129 |	Workout with music
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,135	| IOT129 |	I Ran 2 hours on Sunday morning
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,927	| IOT129 |	Just a GPS and my heart rate
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| IOT129 |	So I need
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,255	| IOT129 |	Battery life and I usually listen to music
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| IOT129 |	So again
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,047	| IOT129 |	I need battery life
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,095	| IOT129 |	I think 18 hours in combination
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,375	| IOT129 |	It's fine
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,399	| IOT129 |	You're gonna have to charge it every night
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:03,679	| IOT129 |	That's fine
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,983	| IOT129 |	Using the LTE connection to tok
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,823	| IOT129 |	You can do that for about one hour on the watch and then your battery is dead
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,871	| IOT129 |	Which I mean
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,895	| IOT129 |	No one's going to have
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| IOT129 |	Like a heartfelt conversation
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,039	| IOT129 |	I could be
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:24,671	| IOT129 |	It's a secondary phone device in my opinion so I agree with you you know that I have to make a phone call
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:31,071	| IOT129 |	My family is call me in an emergency when I'm out on the roads it's going to be less than a five-minute call so I'm fine with that I just want to
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,607	| IOT129 |	Should be aware
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,447	| IOT129 |	If you think you just leave it from behind all day or leave it at home and use this
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,727	| IOT129 |	Watch as your phone all day
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| IOT129 |	Probably not going to work
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,055	| IOT129 |	All right
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:45,919	| IOT129 |	Well so we don't know if Kevin's going to buy an Apple Watch but he seems to be leaning towards it
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,991	| IOT129 |	I assume you sell your old one on eBay
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:51,551	| IOT129 |	Not eBay but you also assure
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,343	| IOT129 |	Alright let's talk about
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,647	| IOT129 |	Nasty new security vulnerability
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,671	| IOT129 |	Discovered
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,439	| IOT129 |	This week actually
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,463	| IOT129 |	I think was it this week
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,255	| IOT129 |	Last week I believe it was this week
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:04,351	| IOT129 |	Okay Blue Barn not to be confused with Bluebeard the murderous pirate
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,119	| IOT129 |	I believe
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:09,215	| IOT129 |	Automatic this is a security flaw that
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:12,031	| IOT129 |	Books at people's Bluetooth connections and if
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:17,919	| IOT129 |	Can connect to it it will take over your device in some cases or it will use it for
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,199	| IOT129 |	A man-in-the-middle attack
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,503	| IOT129 |	No
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,527	| IOT129 |	Bueno
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,295	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,087	| IOT129 |	A lot of devices are still four more
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,391	| IOT129 |	Going to talk to us about how many
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:30,975	| IOT129 |	Yeah actually to just put this in perspective because this
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,535	| IOT129 |	Effects Bluetooth devices
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,815	| IOT129 |	This is not just like
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| IOT129 |	A one-off
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,631	| IOT129 |	Device type where we talk
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:42,239	| IOT129 |	Before about light connected DVRs and security cameras this is like anything with Bluetooth
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| IOT129 |	Which is
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,311	| IOT129 |	Mind when you think of the scope of devices
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,079	| IOT129 |	Spell potentially
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:53,247	| IOT129 |	So we should say this was found that April and released to various companies so that they can patch it and some have his
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| IOT129 |	We were just going to say
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:59,391	| IOT129 |	Several Android devices iPhones already been patched Windows devices Linux devices
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,695	| IOT129 |	But we have to keep in mind that
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:07,839	| IOT129 |	Not all of those devices when I think of these as when your phones and tablets are running Android not all them are going to get up to
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:14,751	| IOT129 |	Because there's a lot of older phones anymore but
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,775	| IOT129 |	.0 and up
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,847	| IOT129 |	So that's good if you're an older phone there could be issue
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:24,479	| IOT129 |	Samsung Galaxy LG watch pumpkin car audio on Android
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,503	| IOT129 |	These are all Impact
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT129 |	Active devices
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| IOT129 |	Apple's not immune to this
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| IOT129 |	They have patched it
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,391	| IOT129 |	And the nice thing is with Apple
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:34,207	| IOT129 |	Roughly 89% of those devices
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,791	| IOT129 |	Consumers upgrade the software when they get a security update notes
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,583	| IOT129 |	Much less fragmented
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,863	| IOT129 |	There's not as many device types
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:45,727	| IOT129 |	So that examples in a better spot here then say OK Google or another device maker
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,287	| IOT129 |	Question is what happens to
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,847	| IOT129 |	Iot devices in the house like Bluetooth locks and such
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:56,735	| IOT129 |	Where we typically don't update the software or it's not made available to us these updates from the manufacturer
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,759	| IOT129 |	Well I was going to say
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,295	| IOT129 |	Here's yes
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:05,695	| IOT129 |	I imagine that if your Bluetooth lock maker you were going to be on this at least at the public release maybe you didn't get a call back in a
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,463	| IOT129 |	April because
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,999	| IOT129 |	That's another thing if you're sick
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,511	| IOT129 |	Security firm
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,047	| IOT129 |	You know you can't notify
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,143	| IOT129 |	Right if you're going to try to do something behind the scenes in
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,911	| IOT129 |	Proactively
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,983	| IOT129 |	You can get the big guys but you can't call every Bluetooth
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:25,407	| IOT129 |	April distinctly I agree with you but all of those devices should be registered through the Bluetooth Sig and I wonder if they should have coordinate
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,943	| IOT129 |	Maybe they do I do not know
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,455	| IOT129 |	That's an interesting
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,783	| IOT129 |	So I was going to say that Linux is also a
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| IOT129 |	Assassins
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| IOT129 |	And they
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,135	| IOT129 |	Talk about the most commercial and super int
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:35,903	| IOT129 |	Two platforms
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,719	| IOT129 |	Linux is tizen Samsung operating system
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:41,279	| IOT129 |	This is going to affect your Samsung
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,071	| IOT129 |	The gear S3 smartwatch
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:45,887	| IOT129 |	You're smart TVs and your smart refrigerator
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,959	| IOT129 |	And this is where it gets interesting to me
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,239	| IOT129 |	Because
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| IOT129 |	Samsung
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,031	| IOT129 |	Will probably push out
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:57,407	| IOT129 |	But is anyone who sat there and wanted to watch TV turns on their television and
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,223	| IOT129 |	Update now or later you're like
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,247	| IOT129 |	I got my popcorn ready
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,783	| IOT129 |	Later
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,087	| IOT129 |	Later becomes never
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:11,487	| IOT129 |	Exactly what I wanted even think about a fridge because like I have had fridges in my home that I've owned for 10
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,303	| IOT129 |	Even 11 years and I don't know if Samsung
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,327	| IOT129 |	Patch field
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| IOT129 |	Apollo information to maybe
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| IOT129 |	Give an indication if they will
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,335	| IOT129 |	Hi I just noticed in the report that are missed the company that actually found this
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:29,407	| IOT129 |	They share details on who they contacted
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,431	| IOT129 |	And what the response was
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,759	| IOT129 |	So good was contacting April and
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,831	| IOT129 |	They have updated as of September 4th
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,647	| IOT129 |	Microsoft also in April and
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,951	| IOT129 |	Updates are made in July so that's good
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:48,351	| IOT129 |	Apple was contacted in August and I'm going to just clarify something as I thought that ability affected them Apple had no longer doing in his
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,935	| IOT129 |	Current version so they may have pre patch that may have done something before August
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,471	| IOT129 |	But here's the interesting relevant
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:53,983	| IOT129 |	Samsung
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,775	| IOT129 |	I'm just going to read this out loud
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:59,359	| IOT129 |	Contact on three separate occasions in April May and June
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,663	| IOT129 |	No response was received from any Outreach
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| IOT129 |	Alright Samsung
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:03,967	| IOT129 |	I know their pee
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:09,087	| IOT129 |	You guys if you want to be a credible iot
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:13,439	| IOT129 |	Vendor to Consumers and businesses because we're going to talk about later that's
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:14,975	| IOT129 |	That is unacceptable
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,303	| IOT129 |	You should have if you don't already
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,351	| IOT129 |	And maybe they couldn't find it a bug Bounty program
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:23,935	| IOT129 |	And you should have a way for security people
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,447	| IOT129 |	Contact you
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,775	| IOT129 |	Because that's how a lot of things are being found out
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,335	| IOT129 |	Vulnerabilities are really nasty
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,383	| IOT129 |	Yeah and it's even better to
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,407	| IOT129 |	Have a response
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,175	| IOT129 |	Weather
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:40,575	| IOT129 |	Affects you or not because at least explain to people that you're looking into it your way the situation and you're doing something or you don't need to
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,343	| IOT129 |	Do something about it
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,367	| IOT129 |	Write a message with
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,415	| IOT129 |	Bingo
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:48,511	| IOT129 |	Cuz guess if people know that you have policies and you should advertise
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| IOT129 |	Because let's say
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,815	| IOT129 |	You say hey
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,351	| IOT129 |	If we get your vulnerability
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,399	| IOT129 |	We will acknowledge its receipt
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,959	| IOT129 |	Meet people if they don't get the acknowledgement
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| IOT129 |	They will
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,751	| IOT129 |	Look for other ways to
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,799	| IOT129 |	Otherwise they're just like
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,335	| IOT129 |	Recordable Teddy
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| IOT129 |	So you send out
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,175	| IOT129 |	Enquiries Into The Ether and then suddenly
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,223	| IOT129 |	If you don't get anything back after awhile you just stop
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,527	| IOT129 |	So
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,063	| IOT129 |	Samsung
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,855	| IOT129 |	Not cool man
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,159	| IOT129 |	All right
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,671	| IOT129 |	They're coming up later
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,463	| IOT129 |	Let's talk now
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:20,255	| IOT129 |	About something not as scary
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,791	| IOT129 |	Superstar.
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,559	| IOT129 |	Please buy this
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,351	| IOT129 |	So what this is
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,119	| IOT129 |	This is
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,399	| IOT129 |	Last week Chamberlain
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| IOT129 |	Put a message on it
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:32,287	| IOT129 |	Sift page basically saying that if you want to connect your garage door to a service like if
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,591	| IOT129 |	Or even possibly Google home
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:37,151	| IOT129 |	You're going to have to pay a dollar a month
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:37,919	| IOT129 |	End
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,479	| IOT129 |	The outrage was not tremendous cuz I don't know how many people are alive
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT129 |	On this device
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,295	| IOT129 |	Although I do and
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:43,807	| IOT129 |	What's connected to it
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:46,111	| IOT129 |	But the people noticed we're not please
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:51,743	| IOT129 |	Now I know they actually reached out to us on Twitter and that's how we found out about it and I wonder if
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,767	| IOT129 |	A lot of people leaving
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| IOT129 |	Do you know about this yet
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:57,119	| IOT129 |	Yes so I sent some questions to Chamberlain yesterday
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,447	| IOT129 |	Trying to figure out the Twitter account for Chamberlain
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| IOT129 |	Was like yes we are charging
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,287	| IOT129 |	So it is a real thing
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,567	| IOT129 |	They didn't
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,079	| IOT129 |	Acknowledge the
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| IOT129 |	So
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,503	| IOT129 |	I asked him what
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| IOT129 |	Services
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| IOT129 |	They were going to start charging
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,831	| IOT129 |	Why
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,599	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,879	| IOT129 |	Didn't hear back so
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,927	| IOT129 |	Kevin the absence of Chamberlain
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:21,951	| IOT129 |	Think about this
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:31,935	| IOT129 |	Yeah as soon as I saw this on Twitter I started digging around the gift page and I noticed that they
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:38,335	| IOT129 |	I had a link for partners and like I wonder if Chamberlain is now a partner and what is it really mean cuz I didn't know anybody and
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:42,943	| IOT129 |	Any listener if you want to create your own if this then that recipe and all that you can certainly do that there's no charge
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:46,271	| IOT129 |	X-ray with that that has not changed but if you go into the partner program
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,551	| IOT129 |	We noticed that
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,343	| IOT129 |	There are two pricing tiers
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,135	| IOT129 |	That Partners have
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:57,535	| IOT129 |	Hey and one is $199 a month for and that allows a partner to create a single service and
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| IOT129 |	It's triggers
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,863	| IOT129 |	And therefore a to make that available as a service
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,655	| IOT129 |	I don't think that's what
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:05,983	| IOT129 |	Chamberlain is doing I think they're in the partner plus program
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,007	| IOT129 |	Because what partner
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:12,383	| IOT129 |	Surplus does is it gives you the ability to make multiple products and services available with triggers and if
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,687	| IOT129 |	It gives you an unlimited number of end users
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,223	| IOT129 |	Square Dashboard you have
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,247	| IOT129 |	Prioritize
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,527	| IOT129 |	Server space in
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,551	| IOT129 |	Nashua is
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,367	| IOT129 |	Yeah CSI lazerport
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:22,879	| IOT129 |	Exactly
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,159	| IOT129 |	So
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,951	| IOT129 |	It sounds to me like
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:30,303	| IOT129 |	Chamberlain is probably done this taking it into the partner plus program and that gets into the
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:34,655	| IOT129 |	The pricing and it's a minimum of $499 per month
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,447	| IOT129 |	Duck-billed annually and that
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:42,847	| IOT129 |	Minimum is because the price will vary based on company size number of services and customizations to Chamberlain's paying at least five
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| IOT129 |	The month I suspect
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,431	| IOT129 |	To offer the gift integration
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,967	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:53,855	| IOT129 |	Having to recoup some of that well looks like they said let's start of people at Buck a month or $10 I think it's
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,927	| IOT129 |	The $10 annual fee if you want to do it that way so well I
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,695	| IOT129 |	Get it
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:04,095	| IOT129 |	I understand the need to make money back if it's really comes back again so the question we can talk about buying Hardware services
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:09,215	| IOT129 |	You know when you bought a Chamberlain MyQ Stacy you didn't expect that you would have to pay this for example if you want to connect right
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:15,103	| IOT129 |	I will admit that it was a long time ago
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,407	| IOT129 |	I don't think it actually had an ifta integration bee
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,431	| IOT129 |	Because the Chamberlin guys
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,199	| IOT129 |	So worried about it from a secure
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,247	| IOT129 |	Perspectives it was highly demanded
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,087	| IOT129 |	When I bought it it's not like they're taking a
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:27,903	| IOT129 |	It is
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,695	| IOT129 |	I am sure Golling
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:35,839	| IOT129 |	Oh my God I can't wait to connect this cuz it's a connected thing and being connected means you should be able to
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| IOT129 |	So that
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,263	| IOT129 |	User
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,311	| IOT129 |	And I'm not I can't fault them for
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,103	| IOT129 |	Doing this because Integrations
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:50,943	| IOT129 |	Take developer time they're going to take a continual amount of developer time be
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,479	| IOT129 |	Because it will make platform updates
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,599	| IOT129 |	Minimum to be
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,647	| IOT129 |	Partner when you start
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,671	| IOT129 |	Multiplying that out
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| IOT129 |	Across lots and lots
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,743	| IOT129 |	Jasmine
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:11,935	| IOT129 |	Right plus the partners have scalability included in the so as they get more users or add devices
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:17,311	| IOT129 |	We'll have more service pays more dedicated bandwidth and so on and those resources involved here as well
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| IOT129 |	But
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| IOT129 |	You know if you bought your device
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,663	| IOT129 |	Thinking you're buying connected
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,455	| IOT129 |	Set device that would open up this entire new
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| IOT129 |	SeaWorld
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,527	| IOT129 |	Suddenly that world seems
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,319	| IOT129 |	Not moving for you without more money
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,903	| IOT129 |	I feel that way about
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,415	| IOT129 |	My doorbell
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,975	| IOT129 |	Having an additional charge on it
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,999	| IOT129 |	To get historical views
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| IOT129 |	Ever
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| IOT129 |	I'll pay for
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:39,839	| IOT129 |	4 extra
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,375	| IOT129 |	Extra
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,423	| IOT129 |	24-hour. To see my videos
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,703	| IOT129 |	I'll pay for anything.
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,751	| IOT129 |	It does irk me that I'm like
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,543	| IOT129 |	Oh so basically I can talk to my
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,079	| IOT129 |	When they're outside my door
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,151	| IOT129 |	Oh well yeah
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,431	| IOT129 |	So I get it
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:57,503	| IOT129 |	Yeah it sucks again maybe Chamberlain
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,527	| IOT129 |	Will clarify
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,575	| IOT129 |	The conversation that you're having with them
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:06,463	| IOT129 |	The communications I should say and we can get some information I suspect we should probably prepare ourselves for other
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,255	| IOT129 |	Ifft partners that are going to have to
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,303	| IOT129 |	A charge unless they're going to eat these costs
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,071	| IOT129 |	In the future
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,095	| IOT129 |	Eat the cost
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:19,263	| IOT129 |	So we have a start-up that I have followed for a while because I knew its founder Jesse Robbins who is
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,799	| IOT129 |	Chef
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| IOT129 |	Which is a
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,359	| IOT129 |	Cloud configuration manager
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| IOT129 |	If you guys are like what the heck
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,431	| IOT129 |	Just ignore it
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,735	| IOT129 |	The point is I've known him for a while
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,783	| IOT129 |	A couple years ago he started a pushed
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,807	| IOT129 |	To talk device
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,391	| IOT129 |	Ryan and this company basically you
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,951	| IOT129 |	Got a little microphone speaker thing
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,511	| IOT129 |	He clipped it under your shirt or your lapel when you push it
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,791	| IOT129 |	And you say something
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,095	| IOT129 |	And then a team member whose part of that Circle
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,631	| IOT129 |	To hear it
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,911	| IOT129 |	I like walkie talkies like
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,471	| IOT129 |	They're fun so I like the idea and now
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,519	| IOT129 |	What they're doing is real-time translation
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,359	| IOT129 |	I actually thought that was a really powerful
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| IOT129 |	Thing to put
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,943	| IOT129 |	On a walkie-talkie like device that is
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,735	| IOT129 |	Just attached to your lapel
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,015	| IOT129 |	Kevin says
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:08,159	| IOT129 |	I fail to see why people keep trying to companies keep trying to
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,719	| IOT129 |	Reinvent things add-ons
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,767	| IOT129 |	Stand-alone devices when
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:19,167	| IOT129 |	All the functionality could easily be done with the phone that you would likely already have because this Tech is very cool don't get me wrong
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| IOT129 |	I know you like a saying
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:24,031	| IOT129 |	Can you show me the video and it definitely changed my mind that's what they're doing here but
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:25,567	| IOT129 |	These are little clip on
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,591	| IOT129 |	Microphone speakers
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,127	| IOT129 |	That you press
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,663	| IOT129 |	To talk Wichita
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,479	| IOT129 |	They're bluetooth-connected so you can only do this from
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,295	| IOT129 |	You know within 30 feet or so charge your phone
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:38,111	| IOT129 |	It actually goes back to your phone and there's an app
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:42,975	| IOT129 |	Cat with the translation and so on so you're already relying on a phone I'm just struggling why
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,279	| IOT129 |	They're doing another device approach
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,047	| IOT129 |	To be honest
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,327	| IOT129 |	I think it's up to me I'm excited
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,351	| IOT129 |	Hands-free
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,631	| IOT129 |	Or mostly hands
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,935	| IOT129 |	So I don't have to hold my phone
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:56,287	| IOT129 |	If my phone is in my pocket and it's on and I'm trying to communicate with someone doing real time
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:00,127	| IOT129 |	Speech-to-text is going to be muffled because it's in my pocket so that was
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:00,639	| IOT129 |	My thought
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,455	| IOT129 |	I'm like this is just clicked on your body just hit it
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:09,599	| IOT129 |	Yeah and I get that I do it it's to that extent it snow a little wearable device
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:15,743	| IOT129 |	I don't know if you have to push talk before you say everything or it's just the one time on and one time off but I mean again
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,047	| IOT129 |	They're leveraging the cloud in the phone
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,327	| IOT129 |	Foreign the app
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,887	| IOT129 |	All the communication bits and so on so to me it's like
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:25,727	| IOT129 |	My phone can be used hands-free it's already got the mic and speaker in the Bluetooth built-in
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,519	| IOT129 |	Why do I need another Mike going to speaker
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,335	| IOT129 |	I think
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:30,847	| IOT129 |	I don't know
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,639	| IOT129 |	I think the functionality
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:37,759	| IOT129 |	Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:42,879	| IOT129 |	Sad
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,159	| IOT129 |	Sympatico we are at
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:49,279	| IOT129 |	So let's do some quick news fits before we get to our voicemail question
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:52,351	| IOT129 |	Do shorter are actually I guess it would be do Samantha
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,375	| IOT129 |	Of the week but
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,399	| IOT129 |	District 7 fancy dress
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,447	| IOT129 |	Samsung
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,983	| IOT129 |	Samsung
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,263	| IOT129 |	Which we have talked about earlier
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,823	| IOT129 |	Has joined Edge X Foundry
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,591	| IOT129 |	Which
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,359	| IOT129 |	You don't have to remember
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,687	| IOT129 |	But this is an industrial iot
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| IOT129 |	Middleware
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,735	| IOT129 |	Organization
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,295	| IOT129 |	Which again not the sexiest
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,575	| IOT129 |	Staying in the world
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| IOT129 |	But crucially
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:18,976	| IOT129 |	I like this project it feels to me like what pivotal was for cloud cam
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,536	| IOT129 |	Shooting people still don't use pivotal
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,304	| IOT129 |	Enterprises do
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:23,840	| IOT129 |	Amazon
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,608	| IOT129 |	All those guys are
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,144	| IOT129 |	We got our own cloud
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:30,496	| IOT129 |	These guys for industrial iot I feel like it's
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,544	| IOT129 |	Probably going to be really relevant
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,336	| IOT129 |	Because not everybody wants to
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,896	| IOT129 |	Put all their industrial secret data
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,664	| IOT129 |	In the clouds
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| IOT129 |	Amazons
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,712	| IOT129 |	Measure
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:42,272	| IOT129 |	So edgex Foundry
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,576	| IOT129 |	You may not but I
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| IOT129 |	Actually really hot
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,624	| IOT129 |	Optimistic about it
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,392	| IOT129 |	Sociocentric
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,416	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:51,488	| IOT129 |	They did it because they want to do their Industrial iot
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,768	| IOT129 |	And make sure
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,304	| IOT129 |	It is applicable
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,072	| IOT129 |	To all of the
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,096	| IOT129 |	Potential industry
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,888	| IOT129 |	Customers so
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,912	| IOT129 |	They have been working with
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:21:59,936	| IOT129 |	Ocf
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,496	| IOT129 |	Activity Foundation
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,032	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,824	| IOT129 |	This is just to ads
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,128	| IOT129 |	So just just a little news bit
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:15,040	| IOT129 |	I suspect that they also are doing this because it's less of a compartmentalised
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,344	| IOT129 |	Approach like some of the other vendors that you mentioned
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,136	| IOT129 |	If this is a Linux Foundation
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:19,904	| IOT129 |	Project
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| IOT129 |	And Tyson is
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,976	| IOT129 |	Linux paste
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:27,328	| IOT129 |	Samsung's iot platform so I can do it with don't want to be shut out
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,376	| IOT129 |	In terms of industrial iot when it comes to tizen
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,936	| IOT129 |	Samsung
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| IOT129 |	Security game online
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,520	| IOT129 |	All right we also headache
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,544	| IOT129 |	Kickstarter projects
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,080	| IOT129 |	Is
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,128	| IOT129 |	Glow
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:41,920	| IOT129 |	More energy
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,200	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,784	| IOT129 |	Just came across my radar this
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,576	| IOT129 |	Past weekend it is still an open
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:54,976	| IOT129 |	In project if you'd like to back it it's an all-or-nothing project as well so it's only fun that it reaches its Gold by fry
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,512	| IOT129 |	Geez September 14th
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,792	| IOT129 |	It did reach the goal
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:04,192	| IOT129 |	So I'd go with 75000 something 96,000 reminds me when I look at the device itself
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,472	| IOT129 |	Reminds me a lot of
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,496	| IOT129 |	Hey Google
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:11,616	| IOT129 |	Device has the same similar air freshener shape but it doesn't do anything except
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,896	| IOT129 |	Show a light
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,176	| IOT129 |	And that light will be
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:16,736	| IOT129 |	Ranging in color from green to red
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:20,576	| IOT129 |	Depending on how much energy you're currently using in your house
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:23,136	| IOT129 |	And at the other piece of this there is a
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,928	| IOT129 |	A device that you put on top of
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:27,232	| IOT129 |	Your outdoor
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,000	| IOT129 |	Smart
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:33,632	| IOT129 |	Meter in that sensor uses magnetoresistance technology to wirelessly measure power usage
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,936	| IOT129 |	So it's simple to install and
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,960	| IOT129 |	And use
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,008	| IOT129 |	And when using a lot of juice
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:44,384	| IOT129 |	Spending the lights candy red also web-based dashboard so that you can see real-time innovation
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,920	| IOT129 |	If I repair air conditioner Heat
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:48,224	| IOT129 |	You'll see a jumper spike in that and so on
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:52,064	| IOT129 |	This thing about this I do find it very interesting obviously I would have brought it up
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:55,648	| IOT129 |	We seen other more complex systems that offer for more info
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,928	| IOT129 |	Permission and I think
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:00,768	| IOT129 |	Do you still have a system like that that gets down to the Circuit level
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,536	| IOT129 |	Baidu
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,328	| IOT129 |	I don't have it on anymore because
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| IOT129 |	And here's my issue
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,632	| IOT129 |	All of these things are like
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,424	| IOT129 |	Yo you're using a lot of energy
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:09,216	| IOT129 |	But I have taken as a homeowner
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| IOT129 |	Almost all the steps
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,776	| IOT129 |	Without
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,288	| IOT129 |	Really impact
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:13,312	| IOT129 |	Quality of life
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,664	| IOT129 |	Things but I'm not going to keep my air conditioner.
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,432	| IOT129 |	AT&T middle of the summer
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:25,088	| IOT129 |	I totally get that I think if you've gone as far as you and I have as well
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:31,232	| IOT129 |	It's more of a behavioral thing like Jesus did somebody leave lights on or something cuz we were using a lot of juice that we don't normally use here
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,304	| IOT129 |	Automated the heck out of our house so
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| IOT129 |	Don't usually
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:43,520	| IOT129 |	I'm not against this I think at CD I saw some more interesting energy monitoring things so so
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:46,080	| IOT129 |	Which is a professional installer product
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:48,384	| IOT129 |	Had a really interesting
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,408	| IOT129 |	System that work
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,944	| IOT129 |	Plug into your all of your Breakers
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,480	| IOT129 |	And control them so like
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,528	| IOT129 |	1/2 generator power you
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:58,880	| IOT129 |	You could say hey you know what I want my generator only to power my fridge and
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| IOT129 |	And my freezer
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,208	| IOT129 |	And actually that you could do if you hardwire
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,488	| IOT129 |	My dad
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,048	| IOT129 |	Crazy so he hardwired his Jenner
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,096	| IOT129 |	For most people that's
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:13,728	| IOT129 |	There was also some interesting battery storage options
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,264	| IOT129 |	Like Sonnen has one
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,056	| IOT129 |	It allows you to automatic
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,848	| IOT129 |	Are the powerful
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,360	| IOT129 |	Batteries
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,920	| IOT129 |	Which again
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,224	| IOT129 |	Is super cool especially if you
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:24,736	| IOT129 |	Do you have like an event
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,856	| IOT129 |	That was like a this is kind of cute to be good for
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,904	| IOT129 |	For kids like I could see installing when in the classroom
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT129 |	Middle school tutor
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,696	| IOT129 |	Educate people about this
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,488	| IOT129 |	Take a piss
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,000	| IOT129 |	I didn't want
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:43,424	| IOT129 |	Yeah they close not for me either I'm going to do think it's very interesting but you and I are at a different stage when it comes to a home automation
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,448	| IOT129 |	Energy monitoring
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,216	| IOT129 |	For somebody who
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:51,616	| IOT129 |	Is new to energy monitoring and doesn't have a lot of devices that can already going to be automated to help reduce electricity
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| IOT129 |	Might be worth it
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:58,528	| IOT129 |	So is going to cost you $199 right now which is 30% off the expected retail price
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,808	| IOT129 |	So much cheap
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,320	| IOT129 |	So cheap
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,344	| IOT129 |	Which energy does a
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,928	| IOT129 |	That's an LED bulb inside at least
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,280	| IOT129 |	Alright let's take a question
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,560	| IOT129 |	From our hotline
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,840	| IOT129 |	But first
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,400	| IOT129 |	Let us tell you what are iot hotline is
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,680	| IOT129 |	It is the number is
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,216	| IOT129 |	512
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,008	| IOT129 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,544	| IOT129 |	742 4
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,848	| IOT129 |	Awesome so call us with your question
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:23,872	| IOT129 |	And this week
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,664	| IOT129 |	We have a question
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,176	| IOT129 |	From
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,760	| IOT129 |	Anita
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:30,784	| IOT129 |	This is
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,320	| IOT129 |	Kevin from Raleigh
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:36,672	| IOT129 |	In Raleigh North Carolina
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,464	| IOT129 |	And yes you can use this on the air
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,744	| IOT129 |	I'm
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,536	| IOT129 |	In possession of a butterfly
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:44,864	| IOT129 |	15 + year old home security system
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,400	| IOT129 |	It's not very high tech
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,424	| IOT129 |	Works fine
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,752	| IOT129 |	And what I'd like to do is do away with the dialer
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,288	| IOT129 |	And monitoring clause
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,336	| IOT129 |	And leverage that are newer
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:58,176	| IOT129 |	Internet-based and wondering if there's a way to breach the two
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:00,224	| IOT129 |	I know it matters a lot as
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,248	| IOT129 |	To which one
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,784	| IOT129 |	Generically
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,832	| IOT129 |	Can we use that as an uplink
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,856	| IOT129 |	Instead of the
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,136	| IOT129 |	Cellular.
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,160	| IOT129 |	They provide
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,184	| IOT129 |	Some kind of a
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:13,536	| IOT129 |	Thanks a lot look forward to more info
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:17,120	| IOT129 |	Okay Kevin that is a tough question but probably a really common one
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:19,680	| IOT129 |	And we are going to punt a little bit
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,008	| IOT129 |	We think your best option is probably to
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,824	| IOT129 |	I'll be honest you may have to make
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| IOT129 |	I could get rid of that monitor
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:36,064	| IOT129 |	That's definitely an option I mean I hate to say that when there's probably a lot of wired sensors that are still good obviously they see you say they stole
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,600	| IOT129 |	I work everything works well with
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:42,464	| IOT129 |	You know you're paying a service fee to somebody and so on plus you're stuck on a dial-up line for the canoe
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,000	| IOT129 |	Nativity to the vet system
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,280	| IOT129 |	Again if you want to keep what you
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,304	| IOT129 |	You want that
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,864	| IOT129 |	Fine they're actually options to do that
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:52,960	| IOT129 |	Depending on your service provider if its ATT or some other
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:59,104	| IOT129 |	Similar service they will likely offer you at a very low cost or maybe even free an option to switch from dial
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| IOT129 |	Does cellular for the
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,920	| IOT129 |	Modern bits
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:06,784	| IOT129 |	So that way you don't need to have the landline and kind of upgraded you'll still obviously pay your service
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:11,392	| IOT129 |	But at least you can do that but you can also look into the options to do that you're
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:16,256	| IOT129 |	Self such as using devices like the or the magicJack
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:18,048	| IOT129 |	Which will switch you from
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| IOT129 |	Cellular used to
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:25,728	| IOT129 |	Voice over IP but again if you try to give her the service fee I hate to say it but it's going to be really tough
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:32,128	| IOT129 |	What to do with a fifteen-year-old system in my opinion I mean unless you want to do some heavy-duty coding and monitor these old sis
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:32,896	| IOT129 |	Distance yourself
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:36,224	| IOT129 |	Frankly I think it's well worth your time and effort to just to upgrade it
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,552	| IOT129 |	Yes if you are technically minded I believe
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,064	| IOT129 |	Asterix
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:42,624	| IOT129 |	Has you can look for some code
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,904	| IOT129 |	That you can use
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,952	| IOT129 |	Using Asterix that will actually
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,976	| IOT129 |	Communicate
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,768	| IOT129 |	With the wired alarm system
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,048	| IOT129 |	As a dialer
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,352	| IOT129 |	That's that's
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,376	| IOT129 |	Pretty hardcore
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,144	| IOT129 |	If you want to go hardcore
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,424	| IOT129 |	That's what
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:29:02,336	| IOT129 |	It comes down to it what are you going to do with the data from that system then if not somebody else isn't going to monitor it and because it's old
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:06,176	| IOT129 |	JL torticollis old approaches old
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:10,272	| IOT129 |	It's going to be a challenge I just I really don't know that would be worth it in the long run
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,808	| IOT129 |	But if you want a new security system
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,320	| IOT129 |	Can we have some option
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,112	| IOT129 |	Abode
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,136	| IOT129 |	Is actually very good
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:21,536	| IOT129 |	Biotin install it but it's very easy to install I've Heard lots of good things about it
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:24,352	| IOT129 |	SimpliSafe a lot of people like it it does have a monitoring
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,376	| IOT129 |	Component but
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,144	| IOT129 |	It is
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,424	| IOT129 |	Most expensive
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:33,824	| IOT129 |	And another option that if you want to keep a monitored security system you could also call
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,640	| IOT129 |	Call someone like an alarm.com and see what
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,408	| IOT129 |	They will do
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,688	| IOT129 |	U-kiss baby
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,712	| IOT129 |	Be able to provide
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,760	| IOT129 |	An integration kind of
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,320	| IOT129 |	From the old sensors to a new platform
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:48,928	| IOT129 |	Before but alarm has the added bow
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:49,440	| IOT129 |	Jonas
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:50,720	| IOT129 |	Colados
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:59,168	| IOT129 |	And actually I mean I used to have an ADT system exactly what Kevin is describing and I wasn't thrilled with a
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:03,520	| IOT129 |	Tengo Madre service after a couple of years so today at just throwing it out there
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:09,664	| IOT129 |	I'm using my wink Hub which is relatively inexpensive a bunch of different door window sensors and an Eskimo
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:12,224	| IOT129 |	And I admire it myself there's no
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:16,832	| IOT129 |	Fee for any of that so I can check in on the system at any time from wherever I am
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,856	| IOT129 |	Maybe even coming up a lot
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:22,208	| IOT129 |	It wouldn't be that expensive to change out the
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,488	| IOT129 |	Depending on how many
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:26,048	| IOT129 |	Things you need monitoring if you got 50 windows
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,840	| IOT129 |	5 doors obviously it's going to
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,864	| IOT129 |	Add up quick but
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:33,984	| IOT129 |	Depending on how you do it or how much you need it can be relatively inexpensive
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,544	| IOT129 |	And you could also do things with motions
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,080	| IOT129 |	Detection that you used to
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,616	| IOT129 |	You have to have a
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:40,128	| IOT129 |	Like a window
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,688	| IOT129 |	Thinking outside the box
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,456	| IOT129 |	Are you call somebody like
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,992	| IOT129 |	The Canary Islands
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:45,760	| IOT129 |	Let's see what happens
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,552	| IOT129 |	Options
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:52,672	| IOT129 |	None of which are exactly what you're after but hopefully this gives you the direction depending on how you decide
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:53,696	| IOT129 |	Play this you have some
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,488	| IOT129 |	You have some pads
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,304	| IOT129 |	That is it
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,584	| IOT129 |	For this part of the show
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,864	| IOT129 |	Stay tuned

EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,264	| IOT129 |	Who is a
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,544	| IOT129 |	Jolly Old Australian
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:16,224	| IOT129 |	Talking about how to build a distributed and resilient energy
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:16,736	| IOT129 |	Using
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:17,760	| IOT129 |	Blockchain
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:20,320	| IOT129 |	Yeah it's a really timely one given
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,600	| IOT129 |	Catastrophes that we
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:22,624	| IOT129 |	Experienced recently
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,184	| IOT129 |	Us and also because
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,208	| IOT129 |	Blockchain is like
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,232	| IOT129 |	Oh my God.
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,280	| IOT129 |	Did you enjoy it
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,304	| IOT129 |	It's super fun and
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,840	| IOT129 |	Really thoughtful
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:38,240	| IOT129 |	Forget about the future of our Energy System stay tuned we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:44,384	| IOT129 |	What's with the message from our sponsor portrait Ashley Stevenson here who is the identity and Technology director
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:50,784	| IOT129 |	We're going to talk about personalizing cars using for trucks digital identity manager
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:55,648	| IOT129 |	Which rock is working with auto manufacturers like Toyota on a bunch of digital
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:56,160	| IOT129 |	Initiatives
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,976	| IOT129 |	Why is identity technology needed
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,536	| IOT129 |	It is
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:06,400	| IOT129 |	Is really needed more now than ever before because of something that is disrupting the automotive
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:11,008	| IOT129 |	Industry
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,800	| IOT129 |	Needing to monetize services
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,336	| IOT129 |	Through the vehicle platforms
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| IOT129 |	Just like apple did with their
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,920	| IOT129 |	Play music in order to do that
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,944	| IOT129 |	The Autumn Manufacturing
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:25,856	| IOT129 |	Know who the user is inside of the car not just for personalization but also for monetizing public services
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,648	| IOT129 |	Kaitlyn
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:29,952	| IOT129 |	Wow that is a lot of really cool
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:30,464	| IOT129 |	Cool things
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,512	| IOT129 |	My vehicle so
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,792	| IOT129 |	We are hearing more about the
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,560	| IOT129 |	Automotive grade Linux
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:38,400	| IOT129 |	Can you tell us what that's about what role for truck
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,472	| IOT129 |	Absolutely so Automotive grade Linux
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:45,312	| IOT129 |	Is an organization under the Linux foundation and it was put together by
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,336	| IOT129 |	Consortium of
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,872	| IOT129 |	Different Automotive OEM
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:54,016	| IOT129 |	To basically cut the cost initially of the infotainment system in a vehicle that was engineered separately
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,808	| IOT129 |	Different build cycle
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,088	| IOT129 |	Instead it's
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:57,856	| IOT129 |	Secure
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:59,136	| IOT129 |	Baseline operating so
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,440	| IOT129 |	Vehicle
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,720	| IOT129 |	Any auto manufacturer
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,744	| IOT129 |	On top of it
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:11,168	| IOT129 |	I feel but that they would get a secure Base Line operating system on top of which they could build
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:16,032	| IOT129 |	Years ago and we have become the identity layer of automotive
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:19,872	| IOT129 |	So that Vehicles can actually be identity aware and can authenticate user
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:23,456	| IOT129 |	Susan understand who the user is in the context of the vehicle
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,992	| IOT129 |	Not just the driver but also the past
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:29,344	| IOT129 |	Vehicles with the baby for a vehicle that they're renting or just
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:33,440	| IOT129 |	No I'm not sure the general listener understands
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,464	| IOT129 |	Tao complex
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:36,000	| IOT129 |	The overall connected-car environment
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:39,072	| IOT129 |	Can you talk to me about what's going on with
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,864	| IOT129 |	Vehicle 2 cloud vehicle
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,400	| IOT129 |	Vehicle-to-infrastructure you
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:46,752	| IOT129 |	Personalization inside the vehicle is only half
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,056	| IOT129 |	The battle because the connected car is
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:55,456	| IOT129 |	Is essentially a note on the internet once that cellular radio goes live every vehicle is essentially a rolling iot
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,736	| IOT129 |	To that end
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:34:00,320	| IOT129 |	The vehicle itself and all the components inside of the vehicle
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,344	| IOT129 |	Also needs
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:04,928	| IOT129 |	Secure digital identities and relationships between each other
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,464	| IOT129 |	In order to secure their active
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:09,536	| IOT129 |	So for a vehicle to make a call to the clouds
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,328	| IOT129 |	Azure cloud service
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:17,728	| IOT129 |	Send a secure aliviar update to a vehicle or traffic signal
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,520	| IOT129 |	Vehicles
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| IOT129 |	Json has to be
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,056	| IOT129 |	Be trusted
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:27,456	| IOT129 |	And Trust comes back to understanding the identity of an attribution of what that vehicle itself actually is
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:29,504	| IOT129 |	All right that is a lot to digest
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,552	| IOT129 |	Where can I go to find out more
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,064	| IOT129 |	About 4
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:37,184	| IOT129 |	Edible.com in under one of the dropdowns we have this
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:40,000	| IOT129 |	Page dedicated to are connected.
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:49,216	| IOT129 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the intern
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:54,848	| IOT129 |	This is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is David Martin
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,640	| IOT129 |	Who is the CEO of
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,152	| IOT129 |	Power Ledger
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,688	| IOT129 |	Hi David how are you doing
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,736	| IOT129 |	I sent you I'm really well thank you
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,504	| IOT129 |	Awesome
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,784	| IOT129 |	So I have been told
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:04,576	| IOT129 |	That I always tell people that I
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,344	| IOT129 |	Really excited
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,648	| IOT129 |	So today
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,160	| IOT129 |	I am not real
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:10,464	| IOT129 |	Ecstatic
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,488	| IOT129 |	To have you on the show
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,352	| IOT129 |	So we are going to talk about
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,400	| IOT129 |	Something near and dear to my heart which is
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:18,912	| IOT129 |	Blockchain
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,960	| IOT129 |	Renewable energy
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,032	| IOT129 |	Alright David
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,056	| IOT129 |	You're the CEO of the
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,872	| IOT129 |	Why don't you tell us
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,152	| IOT129 |	What it is that you're trying
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,712	| IOT129 |	We're trying to become
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:38,112	| IOT129 |	That distributed Ledger after I distributed Energy Future I'm not distributed Energy Future is typically renewable and
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:42,208	| IOT129 |	And it's typically owned by the citizens of the world so I quit trying to do it
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:45,792	| IOT129 |	Put the power to manage the Energy System back in the hands of every diaper
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,072	| IOT129 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:47,584	| IOT129 |	The power to the
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:49,888	| IOT129 |	Literally
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:51,168	| IOT129 |	All right
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:54,496	| IOT129 |	So you guys have started out with a trial
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,032	| IOT129 |	In Perth Australia
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:56,800	| IOT129 |	Waukesha
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:57,824	| IOT129 |	Through what this
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:02,432	| IOT129 |	So actually started a trial phase in October Alaska
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,968	| IOT129 |	Manafort trial
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:07,552	| IOT129 |	A place called Bustleton it's about 200 kilometers south of Perth
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:09,344	| IOT129 |	And it was in a lost dog
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,880	| IOT129 |	Can we had something about 20
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:13,952	| IOT129 |	Consuming some with payday and some of that and we installed
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:14,720	| IOT129 |	Marches
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:20,352	| IOT129 |	Each of the Alameda and we started reading how much energy that are producing and consuming as a group
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,376	| IOT129 |	Were these people living
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:21,888	| IOT129 |	Totally off the
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:24,704	| IOT129 |	That were tied into an embedded net worth
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,264	| IOT129 |	Worksite pteropodidae a lifestyle Village
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:33,664	| IOT129 |	And that Village had a single point of connection to the local grid and then an embedded Network. Supply.
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,688	| IOT129 |	Private Network
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| IOT129 |	Supplied all of the
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:36,736	| IOT129 |	Consumers
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:42,368	| IOT129 |	In that embedded almost microgrid scenario sorry some of those consumers have payday panels already
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,160	| IOT129 |	And when I still going to be in
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:49,280	| IOT129 |	Into the network that I wasn't getting anything for it so I thought I need making money off their solar panels on the roof when they were harmed
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,400	| IOT129 |	Trinity side rather than just
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,424	| IOT129 |	Spilling that energy
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:56,704	| IOT129 |	Make directed into a
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,216	| IOT129 |	Capoeira
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:00,032	| IOT129 |	Energy bars
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,568	| IOT129 |	Acreage by the energy
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:05,920	| IOT129 |	And then I remember right the generator for their trouble sorry we use the blockchain to
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:09,248	| IOT129 |	Disintermediate the whole energy supply chain process
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:13,856	| IOT129 |	Music generated directly in touch with a consumer and zap prices
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,904	| IOT129 |	Then in real-time measures
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,184	| IOT129 |	Generation output
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:17,952	| IOT129 |	Consumption
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,512	| IOT129 |	King size three things together as a physical transaction
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:27,424	| IOT129 |	And because of the blockchain giving us an immutable record of all the terms and conditions and values in the transaction Bravo the time
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:27,936	| IOT129 |	Financial trends
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:32,032	| IOT129 |	Instead of saying to a customer you're not going to get anything
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,312	| IOT129 |	If your energy that you're storing it
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,616	| IOT129 |	The great inside you can sell it to next door neighbor
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:38,432	| IOT129 |	Next door neighbor Robinson you have to
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:38,944	| IOT129 |	Depay
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:43,808	| IOT129 |	The energy that you're buying from the grid how about you pay your next-door neighbor $0.20
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,344	| IOT129 |	Identify Gap in the middle
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:48,928	| IOT129 |	Finding the local distribution Network tonight imma keep it upright
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,464	| IOT129 |	Wow that was a whole lot
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,512	| IOT129 |	So we're going to break some things down
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,048	| IOT129 |	You did a great job explaining
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,352	| IOT129 |	Why I generator
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,680	| IOT129 |	Somewhere in there
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,472	| IOT129 |	They're usually utilities are
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:03,520	| IOT129 |	Are people who put an investment in a
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:04,032	| IOT129 |	Grid system
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:06,336	| IOT129 |	And we are still using
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,872	| IOT129 |	That Grid 2
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:09,152	| IOT129 |	Send power back
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:10,176	| IOT129 |	Can 4th even
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:10,688	| IOT129 |	In the scenario
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:12,736	| IOT129 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,784	| IOT129 |	Using a local network is really important
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,832	| IOT129 |	Because it's tacky point out to Big investment
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,112	| IOT129 |	Is billions of dollars of
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:24,256	| IOT129 |	Investment locked up in in networks around the world. And we're not trying to destroy value while we're trying to disrupt the energy
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:27,328	| IOT129 |	What we're saying is that consumers who are using that net
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,608	| IOT129 |	I've been
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,376	| IOT129 |	Unfairly
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:31,936	| IOT129 |	Charge for the amount of the network that actually use
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:34,752	| IOT129 |	And the value of their investment
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,776	| IOT129 |	In Renewables
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,568	| IOT129 |	Something Family Guy
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:39,360	| IOT129 |	We're looking at a while
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,384	| IOT129 |	Of making sure that consumers
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:43,456	| IOT129 |	I finally got them out of the network that I use
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:45,760	| IOT129 |	And that dream directly Translate
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:48,064	| IOT129 |	Interesting engagement or sales process with
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:50,112	| IOT129 |	I need a picture of Len plus proximity Tatum
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,392	| IOT129 |	Okay so
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,672	| IOT129 |	Y tho what are utility
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:55,488	| IOT129 |	Want to let you in on their power meter
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,256	| IOT129 |	Paris to do
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,792	| IOT129 |	This that's the important
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,560	| IOT129 |	Thanks
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,352	| IOT129 |	If we look at what's actually happening
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:02,144	| IOT129 |	In energy Supply around the world
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:05,216	| IOT129 |	Is it normal to protecting from the Greek
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:07,008	| IOT129 |	In some way so they buying this energy
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:11,360	| IOT129 |	That process going to it's almost your logical
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,384	| IOT129 |	Conclusion
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,432	| IOT129 |	Batteries get cheaper consumer
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:18,784	| IOT129 |	Houston net worth less and less and less
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:19,808	| IOT129 |	The cost of running
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:20,320	| IOT129 |	The networks
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,904	| IOT129 |	Australia the regulated tariff process
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:27,232	| IOT129 |	An impact of consumers going off grid with Paving storage
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:33,376	| IOT129 |	And you got 10 years Tom Alico Network business will be losing a hundred million dollars a year
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:39,264	| IOT129 |	Going to Raytown tariffs as well as lose
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:41,824	| IOT129 |	Of revenues because of that fall in consumer purchasing
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:45,152	| IOT129 |	The worst thing for the network is that more and more consumers
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:45,920	| IOT129 |	Eloquent
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:47,712	| IOT129 |	Because it's Network pricing website

EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,288	| IOT129 |	Had to kick the network utilized
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,824	| IOT129 |	Highlights of the distribution metal
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:16,128	| IOT129 |	At night time the body of networks I belong to
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:19,456	| IOT129 |	Talk to me about the economic so what do you get out of this
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,224	| IOT129 |	Guess what are you selling
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:20,992	| IOT129 |	And then
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,528	| IOT129 |	What do the utilities get out
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,552	| IOT129 |	I understand it
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,088	| IOT129 |	You can tell them hey
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:27,648	| IOT129 |	You're not going to die cuz not everyone's going to leave you
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:28,928	| IOT129 |	But at the same time
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,952	| IOT129 |	They probably want some
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:32,000	| IOT129 |	Nothing today plus they got the investment they need
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:32,768	| IOT129 |	Continue making
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:33,280	| IOT129 |	In the local
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:37,632	| IOT129 |	That's right side what way I will to do is pull out some of
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,656	| IOT129 |	The cost associated with
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,424	| IOT129 |	With the existing
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:42,240	| IOT129 |	Power supply Dalian China
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:44,288	| IOT129 |	When you're buying electricity or buying
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:47,360	| IOT129 |	A combination of energy of energy transport a transmission

EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:56,576	| IOT129 |	Andre, what we're trying to do is pull out as many of those cost
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:58,624	| IOT129 |	Since we can't set that those costs can be shared
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:40:59,904	| IOT129 |	That the generator
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:02,464	| IOT129 |	In consumer we need to understand
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,744	| IOT129 |	What it actually cost
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:07,584	| IOT129 |	How to use just save 50 of the distribution Network at the end
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:10,656	| IOT129 |	Inside this is how much
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:12,448	| IOT129 |	Pasta wheel
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:14,240	| IOT129 |	From your last one night or two

EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:25,504	| IOT129 |	Insecurities and I saw
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:29,088	| IOT129 |	Prices. Costs need to be worth
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:34,208	| IOT129 |	Going to understand if a consumer is only using
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,488	| IOT129 |	I really small slice of
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,768	| IOT129 |	Distribution Network
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,304	| IOT129 |	What actually is a fair price
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,632	| IOT129 |	Bearing in mind that we can't get that right
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:42,656	| IOT129 |	Bill Kennedy
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,960	| IOT129 |	Thanks but nice
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:46,752	| IOT129 |	I'll put a battery in my garage
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:47,520	| IOT129 |	And I'll see you later
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,848	| IOT129 |	Well it we've also discovered that there are a lot of hidden costs
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:56,223	| IOT129 |	They may be hidden costs they may be actually the externalities associated with some of this dysentery
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:58,527	| IOT129 |	Mediation so I'm thinking about things like
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:01,599	| IOT129 |	The health and safety of workers with Uber taking
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,367	| IOT129 |	The sheriff

EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,951	| IOT129 |	So what do you see like
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:08,255	| IOT129 |	When I hear you talk about this I worry about
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:11,071	| IOT129 |	The cost associated with operating
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:11,839	| IOT129 |	The backbone
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:12,607	| IOT129 |	The pig
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:13,119	| IOT129 |	Nationwide
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,447	| IOT129 |	What we have at the moment is an energy bar
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,471	| IOT129 |	That is splitting down the
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:23,871	| IOT129 |	The same way we've always had the view that large-scale generators exist somewhere a long way away
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,919	| IOT129 |	Why were you can't hear the most smell the most
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,455	| IOT129 |	And I push electricity through
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,503	| IOT129 |	Transmission systems in distribution system
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:35,903	| IOT129 |	Deliver electricity to your front door and that's the way that the physical system is always locked
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:36,927	| IOT129 |	What's evaporated
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:38,975	| IOT129 |	Givenchy Frameworks of operated
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,511	| IOT129 |	But now in the last 10 years
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,791	| IOT129 |	More and more consumers
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,559	| IOT129 |	7 Stone
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:44,095	| IOT129 |	Power stations on the road specially
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,887	| IOT129 |	And there's more of an input
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:48,959	| IOT129 |	Distributed generation outweigh the consumers
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:50,751	| IOT129 |	Whole Market model doesn't make sense any
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:53,823	| IOT129 |	The industry
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,847	| IOT129 |	Kind of force
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:58,175	| IOT129 |	Small plastic play I bought a big Market Rose doesn't make sense
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:02,783	| IOT129 |	Trying to track my fat rolls that. Big blast off right in the same like a little guy so it doesn't
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:05,343	| IOT129 |	So what we need to do is text talk
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,647	| IOT129 |	What the market actually looks like we have
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,671	| IOT129 |	A primary and a secondary
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:14,303	| IOT129 |	So we just need to sit back take a deep breath
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:20,191	| IOT129 |	Understand that this change is happening the Genie's out of the bottle consumers will continue to do and Siemens do
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:26,591	| IOT129 |	We need to change that the market Frameworks in the regulatory Frameworks to reflect the fact that the system doesn't look like it's OS
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,383	| IOT129 |	So we've got this by 4
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:28,895	| IOT129 |	Located
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:31,967	| IOT129 |	And on one side we've got
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,759	| IOT129 |	The Long Haul generation
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,039	| IOT129 |	Transmission
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:38,623	| IOT129 |	On the other side we have microgrids local
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:41,439	| IOT129 |	Peavey neighborhood-based things
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,743	| IOT129 |	Neighborhoods that have access to renewable
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:44,767	| IOT129 |	Falls in
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:46,815	| IOT129 |	Possibly battery storage that
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:48,351	| IOT129 |	Could create their own
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,119	| IOT129 |	Market inter
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:51,167	| IOT129 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,447	| IOT129 |	Cuz you're going to need to still
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:56,543	| IOT129 |	Call on the larger generation facilities you know in the middle of the night
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,311	| IOT129 |	The wind doesn't blow
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:57,823	| IOT129 |	Ain't that sort of thing
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:01,151	| IOT129 |	In my we use electricity to keep out fridge is running in
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:06,783	| IOT129 |	Electricity we don't use it for electricity so I can use it for the amenity
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:12,927	| IOT129 |	What we get from the analogy of security is it fair that we don't need to have huge backup Taylor Swift
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:17,279	| IOT129 |	It's a huge Camino back up for some rich there because there are markets available
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:18,559	| IOT129 |	And services about
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,167	| IOT129 |	We can replace one or we can with a lot of pretty quickly
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:26,751	| IOT129 |	So we'll go in the future for energy Supply
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:30,591	| IOT129 |	So we can't really live without future thinking of the energy
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:31,615	| IOT129 |	System 5
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:36,735	| IOT129 |	Assisting framework to sign up we will always need large-scale backup over
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:37,503	| IOT129 |	Made some phone
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:38,783	| IOT129 |	Redundancy summary
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:41,343	| IOT129 |	Will probably always need some form of alternate
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:42,623	| IOT129 |	But what that looks like
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:44,927	| IOT129 |	Like in the shark attacks in the next 5 to 10 years is
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:50,815	| IOT129 |	He said five years ago you wouldn't need a taxi because the guy next door to you has another by and you
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,095	| IOT129 |	Controlling up on your phone
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:52,863	| IOT129 |	To an app
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,143	| IOT129 |	I'm getting to deliver you where you need
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:58,239	| IOT129 |	Now we really used to Aruba
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:05,919	| IOT129 |	Since I woke my battery is running down I've had 3 days of really heavy Cloud love you so my energy energy storage
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:09,247	| IOT129 |	An app to get somebody with an electric vehicle
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:12,575	| IOT129 |	Blocking my driveway plugging and discharges battery into my battery
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:15,647	| IOT129 |	That's the sort of redundancy the sort of market for energy
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:17,439	| IOT129 |	Future
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,975	| IOT129 |	Again before we get into the technical stuff
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:20,511	| IOT129 |	Which I promise you will do
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:22,559	| IOT129 |	What happens when you have something
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,607	| IOT129 |	Like
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:28,703	| IOT129 |	Harvey or something when you have like a massive situation
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,751	| IOT129 |	It maybe this doesn't happen
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,543	| IOT129 |	TVs are real
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:33,311	| IOT129 |	I don't know
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,335	| IOT129 |	Cuz that's what people
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,359	| IOT129 |	Build the grid
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,127	| IOT129 |	For today
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,407	| IOT129 |	So in this model
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:38,943	| IOT129 |	How should we be thinking about the
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:39,455	| IOT129 |	The future in
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:40,991	| IOT129 |	Managing catastrophe
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:46,111	| IOT129 |	Thank you point is it for you but I don't know if you're aware of the Rave New York progress
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:47,647	| IOT129 |	That was developed after Hurricane
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:50,207	| IOT129 |	Find Sandy Hurricane Sandy
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:51,231	| IOT129 |	Transmission systems
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:52,511	| IOT129 |	A New Yorkers black
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,023	| IOT129 |	4 a number
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,167	| IOT129 |	Happy City
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:04,287	| IOT129 |	Without any looking at how you bring distributed energy sources back
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:06,847	| IOT129 |	And it's not just paleo
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,895	| IOT129 |	Backup generator
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:11,967	| IOT129 |	Gonzaga University campus
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:16,575	| IOT129 |	Actually bringing the generations back to where they can soon as outside
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:18,623	| IOT129 |	There are two things going on number things going on
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,047	| IOT129 |	Whether it's renewable or what
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:30,143	| IOT129 |	Generation if you're bringing generation back to where the
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:30,911	| IOT129 |	Consumers
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:34,495	| IOT129 |	You're the making the system more resilient in the face of things like anime
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,287	| IOT129 |	Hurricane Sandy
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:37,055	| IOT129 |	Catastrophe
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,079	| IOT129 |	Alright and now
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,103	| IOT129 |	Now it is
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:43,455	| IOT129 |	I should stress that the reason
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:45,247	| IOT129 |	Dave is on the show is
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,783	| IOT129 |	Because none of this would be
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:47,551	| IOT129 |	Possible
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,063	| IOT129 |	Without
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:49,599	| IOT129 |	Hbase.
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,879	| IOT129 |	Computing which
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:51,647	| IOT129 |	And connective
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:53,439	| IOT129 |	Which is basically The Internet of Things
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:57,023	| IOT129 |	You can't do this without having some sort of distributed
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:57,535	| IOT129 |	Processing
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:58,559	| IOT129 |	Acacia Network
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,351	| IOT129 |	Just a bit
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:01,375	| IOT129 |	Update for you
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,423	| IOT129 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,191	| IOT129 |	About
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:05,471	| IOT129 |	What this entails
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,495	| IOT129 |	We talked about the blockchain
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,543	| IOT129 |	But let's break it down further
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,591	| IOT129 |	What else are using in addition to the
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:15,199	| IOT129 |	We trade all the makers all the time
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:17,247	| IOT129 |	So we can tell how much a consumer is
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,783	| IOT129 |	How much is generator
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:19,551	| IOT129 |	Generating
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,879	| IOT129 |	Awaken Paradise 2 inputs and outputs together
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:25,183	| IOT129 |	Using the blockchain as an immutable record
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:27,487	| IOT129 |	Permanent historical record of the
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:29,023	| IOT129 |	Transaction has taken place
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:34,399	| IOT129 |	And because we have that certainty around the physical contribution to the transaction we can then tie Financial
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:40,799	| IOT129 |	Transaction to a very quick time in the energy in tuvalu marketing tool in which the energy is produced and consumed
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,079	| IOT129 |	Speaking Thai Financial
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,103	| IOT129 |	Transaction to that as well
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:45,151	| IOT129 |	And the blockchain aspect
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:47,455	| IOT129 |	Of this is part of your software
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:49,247	| IOT129 |	So you got your software that runs in the cloud
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:50,527	| IOT129 |	Are the trading
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,855	| IOT129 |	Okay it's figuring out pricing and
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| IOT129 |	And
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:56,927	| IOT129 |	You've got
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:58,463	| IOT129 |	Is it aetherium is a
EDL	00:47:58,463	00:48:00,255	| IOT129 |	Bitcoin is it something about yourself
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:04,351	| IOT129 |	It's something we build ourselves we use of private blockchain
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,119	| IOT129 |	Can cold Pikachu
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:06,655	| IOT129 |	We created ourselves
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:08,191	| IOT129 |	It's a proof of
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:09,215	| IOT129 |	Start blockchain
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:11,519	| IOT129 |	And we use it as I
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:12,287	| IOT129 |	Close look
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,055	| IOT129 |	Triton Bar
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:14,847	| IOT129 |	So we have trusted nodes
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:16,895	| IOT129 |	Recording. Tattoo that blockchain
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:21,759	| IOT129 |	And if we don't have enough noise on the but trying to give a sip sufficient security that we made with
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:23,295	| IOT129 |	Entangle that. I with the
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:29,439	| IOT129 |	Consumers and regulators and Banks
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,975	| IOT129 |	A level of comfort.
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:32,767	| IOT129 |	The energy that's being traded
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:33,791	| IOT129 |	Fallout rain jacket
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:37,119	| IOT129 |	Is not being used for any other
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:40,703	| IOT129 |	Southway next door neighbor for a value
EDL	00:48:40,703	00:48:42,495	| IOT129 |	I got baggage handler games for
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:43,519	| IOT129 |	Application
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:45,567	| IOT129 |	China
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:46,335	| IOT129 |	Apple cash
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:48,127	| IOT129 |	But I can see my who's buying energy in that
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:55,039	| IOT129 |	Can log into the pallet of sod but I can pre-purchase they spend that you talking to me that you buy mobile telephone minutes
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,831	| IOT129 |	She can buy tokens that represent
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:58,623	| IOT129 |	Set the value of energy stock
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:48:59,391	| IOT129 |	Taipei
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:00,927	| IOT129 |	So you got the lowest denomination
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:04,511	| IOT129 |	Where you're from and then
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:07,327	| IOT129 |	It depends at conditions of the Triad identified by your energy
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:08,863	| IOT129 |	94 / $0.20
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:12,447	| IOT129 |	And you get $0.15 in the network gets $0.05
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:14,751	| IOT129 |	Spend I will transfer 20 spots
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:15,519	| IOT129 |	Into that environment
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:16,799	| IOT129 |	You'll get 15 of them
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:17,823	| IOT129 |	The network will get father
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:23,455	| IOT129 |	Guys fighting to the networks and your online wallet and Iver. Of time as you
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:24,735	| IOT129 |	Fact fluency

EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:54,175	| IOT129 |	Because you've got to
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:55,967	| IOT129 |	We also improve cash flows
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:50:00,831	| IOT129 |	Because you imagine you're the network and you'll get in five stock to every throw it out if he's being transact
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:05,439	| IOT129 |	Your balance is going to rush it out really quickly

EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:23,615	| IOT129 |	Awesome from your perspective are you guys a tech company
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:24,383	| IOT129 |	How do you think
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:27,711	| IOT129 |	Registration document in the office of the time
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:29,759	| IOT129 |	How a blockchain company Huawei in energy
EDL	00:50:30,527	00:50:31,807	| IOT129 |	On the energy guide
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:33,087	| IOT129 |	In the business so I've got to
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:36,159	| IOT129 |	Particular by spit I think one of the things that strikes me around
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,183	| IOT129 |	China
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:39,487	| IOT129 |	At the moment is it's a remarkable piece of chicken
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:41,791	| IOT129 |	Send amazing things
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:48,191	| IOT129 |	But if you're not directing it towards a particular opportunity or dressing particular problem in many respects it's just
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:52,031	| IOT129 |	Solution looking for a problem rather than a problem looking for a solution
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:54,335	| IOT129 |	With the energy issue wait time for the engine
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:56,383	| IOT129 |	Expected we saw Allied defection
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:57,407	| IOT129 |	And falling you like I should
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:02,015	| IOT129 |	The problem we saw apartment buildings that couldn't Bondi
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:03,039	| IOT129 |	That's fine with that allowed
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:05,343	| IOT129 |	Tenants to install payday as a problem
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:08,927	| IOT129 |	And we realize it has a really good solution to those two
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:12,511	| IOT129 |	A problem sorry Energy company that uses
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:13,023	| IOT129 |	Is the blockchain
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:14,303	| IOT129 |	Provide solution
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:19,423	| IOT129 |	Because I'm very curious what you think all of the currency speculation
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:21,215	| IOT129 |	I don't know how else to put it but the
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:23,263	| IOT129 |	Currency speculation around
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:24,543	| IOT129 |	Blockchain
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:26,079	| IOT129 |	Ethically cerium and pick
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:30,175	| IOT129 |	Kind of what that means for a company whose trying to use this
EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:32,479	| IOT129 |	I think it's kind of being tended
EDL	00:51:32,479	00:51:34,527	| IOT129 |	Purpose which is distributed trusted
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:35,039	| IOT129 |	Transactions
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:36,063	| IOT129 |	On the internet
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:37,855	| IOT129 |	But that doesn't
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:44,511	| IOT129 |	That's a utility token
EDL	00:51:44,511	00:51:49,119	| IOT129 |	And that allows application host with the network business is our apartment building managers
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:50,143	| IOT129 |	ShopRite
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:51,167	| IOT129 |	The Den Bar
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:52,191	| IOT129 |	Amanda Lawson
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:53,471	| IOT129 |	Inside the pouch hiking
EDL	00:51:53,471	00:51:54,239	| IOT129 |	Would be
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:57,311	| IOT129 |	I Surrender door and held in escrow by pallet jack
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:51:59,871	| IOT129 |	Animatronic device Paltalk and we will give
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:01,663	| IOT129 |	The application has the license
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:05,503	| IOT129 |	How to use the platform and a pool of stocks to operate riding in barn
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:08,575	| IOT129 |	And then that training environment because the stock is pegged
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:09,599	| IOT129 |	To the lowest form
EDL	00:52:09,599	00:52:13,951	| IOT129 |	The local currency there's no volatility so we don't get that the impact of speculation
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:16,255	| IOT129 |	Cryptocurrencies flowing through into.
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:18,559	| IOT129 |	That why either
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:19,583	| IOT129 |	Consumers are protect
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:20,863	| IOT129 |	Wicked from any volatility
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:28,031	| IOT129 |	But we still get the benefit of a distributed Ledger that allows does specific training barnsby
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:29,567	| IOT129 |	Interoperable
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:30,079	| IOT129 |	Platform
