EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:59,136	| IOT101 |	And he's actually going to talk about what it means when everything becomes a service and how that affects the Enterprise
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:01,184	| IOT101 |	Value chain and how small our company
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,464	| IOT101 |	Can actually
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:04,256	| IOT101 |	Create value and work with bigger cam
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,048	| IOT101 |	It's a really
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:07,328	| IOT101 |	Thought-provoking interview
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,096	| IOT101 |	At least it was for me
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:10,400	| IOT101 |	You guys may all be a lot smarter
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:10,912	| IOT101 |	Who knows
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:15,264	| IOT101 |	Before we get to all of that I have another message from our spot
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:22,176	| IOT101 |	This week's weather is Wolf SSL the world's top three automakers use wolf SSL to secure
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:28,576	| IOT101 |	Their vehicles and they aren't alone secures 2 billion connections across a multitude of eye
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:34,976	| IOT101 |	Iot sectors including Automotive connected home industrial military and medical device
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:41,376	| IOT101 |	What the Mirai botnet in the growing threat of ransomware attacks on the Internet of Things companies have to pay to
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:45,984	| IOT101 |	The security or wrist litigation bad PR and their brand value
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:51,360	| IOT101 |	Securing the iot is hard but wolf SSL has the experience and specialized expertise to help
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:54,176	| IOT101 |	Shouldn't you be using both SSL
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,456	| IOT101 |	To find out more
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,992	| IOT101 |	Is it wolf SSL
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:57,504	| IOT101 |	Dot-com
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| IOT101 |	All right
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,064	| IOT101 |	Kevin
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:03,648	| IOT101 |	Let's pick a topic you want to talk about
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:07,744	| IOT101 |	Oh that's just go right to the big news this week which is
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,256	| IOT101 |	So far
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:13,120	| IOT101 |	We should say this week so far because this week is only halfway over when we start recording
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:17,216	| IOT101 |	But on Tuesday Amazon web services
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,032	| IOT101 |	Experienced an outage in
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,568	| IOT101 |	Virginia Virginia
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:26,176	| IOT101 |	I was trying to remember what it's called but it's their Virginia Datacenter this guy goes down all the time
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:26,944	| IOT101 |	It's super old
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:31,552	| IOT101 |	85 years anyway
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| IOT101 |	It's their least reliable
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT101 |	Data Center
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,184	| IOT101 |	Basically when you hear problems it's almost
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,464	| IOT101 |	Almost guaranteed to be that pretty
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,256	| IOT101 |	But
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:40,768	| IOT101 |	A lot of stuff
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,560	| IOT101 |	I think it's called East
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:45,376	| IOT101 |	Stash one cuz they'll have designations obviously
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,168	| IOT101 |	And I noticed
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:50,752	| IOT101 |	It's happening yesterday afternoon
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:54,336	| IOT101 |	When I was listening to satellite radio over the web
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,384	| IOT101 |	So SiriusXM was using the app
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:00,480	| IOT101 |	As I was working at a sudden stop playing music and I'm like well that's weird
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:05,856	| IOT101 |	And then I might go switch to Apple music as a screenplay he couldn't play that
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,416	| IOT101 |	Then I told my echo to
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,464	| IOT101 |	Play music you know I listen you age
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| IOT101 |	Play new agent
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,048	| IOT101 |	She said okay Shuffle new age
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:20,192	| IOT101 |	And then I went to the web and saw that the East one
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:23,008	| IOT101 |	Amazon data center was having problems and
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,312	| IOT101 |	That the list of companies that
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| IOT101 |	Were affected
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,872	| IOT101 |	They're at their several dozen
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,408	| IOT101 |	Sympathizer
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:38,112	| IOT101 |	Canary apparently admitted to struggles ring connect to doorbell maker had some issues
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,160	| IOT101 |	Piper another all-in-one security product
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,440	| IOT101 |	Hazmat shoes
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,768	| IOT101 |	And the assistant that mean
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,048	| IOT101 |	Caused a lot of problems
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,840	| IOT101 |	People were complaining that
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,888	| IOT101 |	Oh my gosh I can't turn on my lights
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,448	| IOT101 |	Which
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,472	| IOT101 |	I wish I was a little bit bad
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,288	| IOT101 |	Because if this then that
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:00,128	| IOT101 |	What are you doing tell him to get a proper hug or something
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,920	| IOT101 |	Italy
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,224	| IOT101 |	I know I did
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,016	| IOT101 |	When the internet
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,552	| IOT101 |	Goes down
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,600	| IOT101 |	Sure
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,904	| IOT101 |	If this then that goes down
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,976	| IOT101 |	So Kevin
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,256	| IOT101 |	Is going to use this
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:16,768	| IOT101 |	Time to
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,143	| IOT101 |	You knew I was going to go there today
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:29,567	| IOT101 |	See I had no problems had to test this be right away as soon as I did
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,615	| IOT101 |	Amazon server issue
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,431	| IOT101 |	Powercloud issue I started
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,735	| IOT101 |	Tell me my echo to turn lights on and off
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| IOT101 |	It still work
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:45,183	| IOT101 |	Because the how did I use the wink Hub does allow for local
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:49,023	| IOT101 |	Type commands and schedules and so on so what it's not completely Cloud Reliant
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:52,351	| IOT101 |	So I know I said it before it's one of the reasons I
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,911	| IOT101 |	I decided to stick with it I'm not going to say it's the best hub
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,215	| IOT101 |	But obviously in this instance it was
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,519	| IOT101 |	Still working out for my smart home so that was
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| IOT101 |	It's something to keep in mind
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| IOT101 |	And if you want
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,383	| IOT101 |	Would also
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,431	| IOT101 |	Turn on things
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,199	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,223	| IOT101 |	I believe SmartThings
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,295	| IOT101 |	Would too because they thought local control
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,111	| IOT101 |	Even though SmartThings is actually hosted in
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| IOT101 |	AWS
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,743	| IOT101 |	And so this gets into a topic that we probably should talk about more
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,255	| IOT101 |	We don't
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,303	| IOT101 |	But a lot of people were like
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,655	| IOT101 |	Oh no this is a problem because everything is hosted in the cloud
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| IOT101 |	It's actually not
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:30,751	| IOT101 |	It's a problem because of the way the systems architect
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:36,127	| IOT101 |	In Amazon is by far the most popular
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:36,639	| IOT101 |	Platform
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,735	| IOT101 |	For smart home services it's the backend for services
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:45,855	| IOT101 |	We've already mentioned but it's also the back in for platforms like SmartThings
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,415	| IOT101 |	Ala network switch
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,743	| IOT101 |	Actually provides service for Hunter fans and a lot of other
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:52,767	| IOT101 |	The devices
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| IOT101 |	Until what
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:01,471	| IOT101 |	Companies need to take into account is you need to design for resiliency and Netflix actually doesn't excellent
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:07,871	| IOT101 |	People talking about chaos monkeys what they're talking about is Netflix's design philosophy
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,687	| IOT101 |	54 their architecture which is basically like
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| IOT101 |	Plan for
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:14,527	| IOT101 |	Crap to happen and things to go down including
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| IOT101 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,343	| IOT101 |	InDesign across multiple regions
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,671	| IOT101 |	So that means don't put all your eggs in one data center basic
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:28,607	| IOT101 |	This is going to be complicated is going to be slightly more expensive
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,655	| IOT101 |	But you're going to have up time
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,703	| IOT101 |	When the sort of thing happens so
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,751	| IOT101 |	Despite the fact that AWS
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,055	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,103	| IOT101 |	I think it's a great time to talk about
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:44,223	| IOT101 |	Finding hubs that work locally even when the cloud is down
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,527	| IOT101 |	People who design their
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,807	| IOT101 |	Cloud architectures
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:54,207	| IOT101 |	Who are hosted on AWS to think about hosting across multiple availability zones and resiliency which can be
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,975	| IOT101 |	Be done
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,767	| IOT101 |	We also want to talk about some new
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,047	| IOT101 |	Echo skills
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:01,631	| IOT101 |	The big one
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:04,447	| IOT101 |	Is if you have a wink Hub Kevin you're going to appreciate this
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,007	| IOT101 |	You can now connect several types of locks
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,079	| IOT101 |	You can connect your Schlage Locks
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| IOT101 |	Your Kwikset lock
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,127	| IOT101 |	Fox Andrew yellow
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT101 |	To work with wink
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,503	| IOT101 |	And you can use the echo to check if a door is locked or unlocked
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| IOT101 |	And luck
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,367	| IOT101 |	You cannot use the echo 2
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,135	| IOT101 |	Unlocked
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,647	| IOT101 |	But you're right
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,231	| IOT101 |	It is true that if you have an August lock
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,023	| IOT101 |	You can unlock your door using the
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,095	| IOT101 |	Just so you're aware
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,607	| IOT101 |	I tested it
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,399	| IOT101 |	I should actually tell you how to do this
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,703	| IOT101 |	So if you haven't done it
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,495	| IOT101 |	Connect your locks
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,287	| IOT101 |	Through the wink hub
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,335	| IOT101 |	Which I done already
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:44,639	| IOT101 |	And you have to set individual names
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,967	| IOT101 |	I'm going to tell you that my naming convention
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,039	| IOT101 |	My garage door is actually garage lock
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,575	| IOT101 |	Don't do that
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,623	| IOT101 |	Cathay garage door
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,183	| IOT101 |	Call your front door back door
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,279	| IOT101 |	Sep just just a little warning for you
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,303	| IOT101 |	Then
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,375	| IOT101 |	If you haven't been able to link scale with the Echo app
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:10,239	| IOT101 |	And then sign into all that good stuff and then tell the echo to discover new devices
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| IOT101 |	Once that's done
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,079	| IOT101 |	You are
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,127	| IOT101 |	Done and then you can say
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| IOT101 |	Is garage door
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,431	| IOT101 |	Locked
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,967	| IOT101 |	Ilse
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,247	| IOT101 |	Hold on checking on that
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,039	| IOT101 |	And it's come back and tell you
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,319	| IOT101 |	Or you can say hey
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,599	| IOT101 |	Lock the garage door
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,879	| IOT101 |	So again
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,975	| IOT101 |	When you're naming your lock you may want to go back in and rename it needed something you want to say to
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:36,607	| IOT101 |	Yep and I actually just ran through the steps cuz I already had a
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:39,679	| IOT101 |	Kwikset lockset already connected to my wink hub
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:45,823	| IOT101 |	I went into the Amazon app for my echo and didn't discover devices and I now see you lock
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,407	| IOT101 |	Which I don't really like the name of but I can change that later
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,735	| IOT101 |	Yes you will probably want value only have one but you may want to
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| IOT101 |	I may have more later I don't know
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| IOT101 |	There you go
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:00,415	| IOT101 |	Only because your lock is actually part of a ruler
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:06,047	| IOT101 |	Run through that maybe sometime this week and see cuz one of the things with Smart Home
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| IOT101 |	Products
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,095	| IOT101 |	Is state
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,863	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,399	| IOT101 |	If you change it from
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,679	| IOT101 |	One type of app
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| IOT101 |	Instead of the other
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:17,055	| IOT101 |	Sometimes they don't always the state doesn't match up so
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,079	| IOT101 |	If you lock it in one app
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| IOT101 |	The other apps may still think they not know
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,967	| IOT101 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,551	| IOT101 |	Alluding to is the one I set up to automatically lock my front door
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,879	| IOT101 |	It's lock is unlocked for 5 minutes
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,391	| IOT101 |	Because
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:35,231	| IOT101 |	Kids are leaving the front door unlocked so it does that automatically survival test
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| IOT101 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,887	| IOT101 |	So I tried this out
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,423	| IOT101 |	Works like a charm
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,471	| IOT101 |	It's very nice so
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| IOT101 |	I'm excited by this
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:52,127	| IOT101 |	Speaking of the Amazon Echo you can now connect your Netgear orbi or
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,687	| IOT101 |	Nighthawk routers to the echo
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,991	| IOT101 |	Which means you can ask it things like
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,503	| IOT101 |	Echo
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,807	| IOT101 |	Ask Netgear to enable guest Network
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:03,135	| IOT101 |	Ask Netgear to enable disable 5G Gessner
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,671	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,951	| IOT101 |	What are my WiFi
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,719	| IOT101 |	Settings
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,487	| IOT101 |	Which is
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:07,999	| IOT101 |	Is very handy
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,071	| IOT101 |	These are all very good
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,399	| IOT101 |	We will include a link in the show so you can see which Nighthawk routers
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,471	| IOT101 |	And which Netgear routers work with us
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,775	| IOT101 |	You're going to have to go enable the skill
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,335	| IOT101 |	It's not a direct kind of Hub things so
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,127	| IOT101 |	Very easy very fun
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,407	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,711	| IOT101 |	Are useful if you
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,223	| IOT101 |	Do you have the sword
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,503	| IOT101 |	I
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:32,575	| IOT101 |	I use my Eero settings on the echo to pause the network
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,599	| IOT101 |	Work on occasion
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,623	| IOT101 |	Which is super fun
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| IOT101 |	I'm just frustrated everyone in my
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,231	| IOT101 |	That's nice
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,279	| IOT101 |	Evil family dinner time should not be
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,839	| IOT101 |	Put the phones down
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| IOT101 |	Actually they can't unpositive
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,191	| IOT101 |	Akame unpause
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| IOT101 |	Sneaky
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| IOT101 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,591	| IOT101 |	All right before we stop talking about
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:57,663	| IOT101 |	Echoes can I just throw one more thing
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,199	| IOT101 |	I should have been I will
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,271	| IOT101 |	I will also it seems like there's a concerted effort
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,807	| IOT101 |	By phone makers
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:04,575	| IOT101 |	2 *
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,599	| IOT101 |	Bringing
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,415	| IOT101 |	The echo services in 2 handsets
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:13,791	| IOT101 |	And we saw this at the Consumer Electronics Show I believe it was Huawei that said we're going to have
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:18,143	| IOT101 |	Android app built right into a phone it's not there yet it's still there still working on that
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:21,471	| IOT101 |	But interesting land enough at Mobile World Congress last week
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,775	| IOT101 |	Was it Lenovo
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,311	| IOT101 |	Who owns Motorola
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,103	| IOT101 |	Showed off
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,687	| IOT101 |	A concept video of a new Moto mod annies
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:35,295	| IOT101 |	These mods or add-ons that you would buy the name attached to your Motorola phones
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,599	| IOT101 |	Could be a speaker could be projector
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,415	| IOT101 |	A better camera Etc they have a couple of them out right now
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,487	| IOT101 |	They're going to have a new one I showed it off at
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,767	| IOT101 |	Mwc
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:49,119	| IOT101 |	And basically it turns the phone into a portable Amazon Echo
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:52,447	| IOT101 |	So that the mod stick to the back of the Moto Z for example
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:56,031	| IOT101 |	You put your phone face down and use the back as a speaker
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:02,431	| IOT101 |	Even has the blue glow around the edges so it knows so you know rather when you were speaking to it just like you would be true
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,711	| IOT101 |	Additional Echo Hardware
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:05,247	| IOT101 |	So it's coming later this month
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,551	| IOT101 |	Expectedly no price or anything but
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,831	| IOT101 |	It's just interesting that
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,159	| IOT101 |	Companies have been working on their own voice Service as an AI for quite a while
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,695	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,999	| IOT101 |	Now they're really embracing Amazon in a big way
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,303	| IOT101 |	Well it's that they did a lot of the high
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| IOT101 |	Work for you so
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,119	| IOT101 |	Why not
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,399	| IOT101 |	Why Google
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,703	| IOT101 |	Haven't really pushed its
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,751	| IOT101 |	Natural language processing
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,287	| IOT101 |	Like its speech recognition
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,847	| IOT101 |	AI for Developers
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,615	| IOT101 |	Very much
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,639	| IOT101 |	Because
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,431	| IOT101 |	There's clearly a hunger for this
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,735	| IOT101 |	I would say so I'd I don't know
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| IOT101 |	What
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:42,111	| IOT101 |	Google has provided to developers in that respect but I do know that
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,391	| IOT101 |	The Google Assistant
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:48,255	| IOT101 |	Which was the exclusive to the pixel phones is now coming to all
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:54,399	| IOT101 |	Android 6.0 and 7.0 phone so that's no yeah I no longer going to be an exclusive
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,935	| IOT101 |	That's kind of interesting
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:13:00,799	| IOT101 |	Doesn't answer your question about what can developer so much
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,359	| IOT101 |	But at least it's coming to a much wider audience
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:08,223	| IOT101 |	And I'm taking my comments about developers from people who've been developing speech Rec
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,991	| IOT101 |	Recognition apps for a
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,831	| IOT101 |	What's the weather this is and they many of them in this is about
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:16,159	| IOT101 |	8 months ago hit reached out to Google in
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,975	| IOT101 |	They figured there was something there but Google just
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,999	| IOT101 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,023	| IOT101 |	What's this
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:27,679	| IOT101 |	That's interesting and I'm not disputing that at all I just don't know but I look back to my Wink app
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,447	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,215	| IOT101 |	I can create
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,007	| IOT101 |	There's a beta for like Google
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,567	| IOT101 |	Voice-activated shortcuts that use
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,151	| IOT101 |	Use that so there's got to be some hooks available to folks
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:42,015	| IOT101 |	Creating apps and such but I don't know what they are with to the extent they are
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,295	| IOT101 |	Yes they do have them
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,599	| IOT101 |	Hadn't been marketing them
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,135	| IOT101 |	In some cases
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:50,207	| IOT101 |	You kind of had to ask and then you were stuck in a queue forever
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:52,767	| IOT101 |	But
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,815	| IOT101 |	With the Google home that is changing
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,327	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,375	| IOT101 |	Yay we should also mention
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,399	| IOT101 |	Kevin
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,263	| IOT101 |	I do I'm a consultant for Google
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,799	| IOT101 |	An Android Chrome sided
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| IOT101 |	Mark was the IRT focuser
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:13,503	| IOT101 |	Google Assistant jokes
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:17,087	| IOT101 |	To make assistant available in other places because I have a Nexus 5
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,927	| IOT101 |	Do I have an exercise yes I have a Nexus 5X
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,463	| IOT101 |	And I
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:22,975	| IOT101 |	Very excited
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,535	| IOT101 |	Futures you get an assist
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,815	| IOT101 |	Continue getting the system
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,839	| IOT101 |	And you get an assist
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,375	| IOT101 |	I had nothing to do with it
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,703	| IOT101 |	It was all over
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,031	| IOT101 |	Let's now talk about
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,823	| IOT101 |	This is also a hot story
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:38,847	| IOT101 |	Hacked
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| IOT101 |	Teddy bears
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,759	| IOT101 |	I wanted a satyr
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:50,367	| IOT101 |	That was actually much saturated it much better than I did. I'm in a good mood
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,159	| IOT101 |	This is like
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,439	| IOT101 |	This is aggravating
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:59,839	| IOT101 |	Sounds like a recurring Story 2 because it's not the first time this has happened with children's toys that have
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,375	| IOT101 |	Some type of microphones and so on
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,447	| IOT101 |	Yes basically if you're making a children's toy
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:09,311	| IOT101 |	Get your security in at the beginning so what happened here is a company called
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:12,639	| IOT101 |	It's spiral toys to make a product called cloud
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:17,759	| IOT101 |	And they basically contracted out to a company to do there
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT101 |	Connectivity and
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:23,135	| IOT101 |	Grab like they're filled out the backend architecture for this connect
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| IOT101 |	Teddy bear
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,951	| IOT101 |	And that company basically left
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:29,023	| IOT101 |	An open mongodb database
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:32,351	| IOT101 |	Just hanging out there not secured
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,631	| IOT101 |	On the internet
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:36,959	| IOT101 |	Which over 800,000 account records
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,983	| IOT101 |	Yes and
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,775	| IOT101 |	To make matters worse
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:46,943	| IOT101 |	They dropped all of their files the recording files over two million of them were stored in an Amazon S3
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,223	| IOT101 |	Repository and like
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,527	| IOT101 |	I don't want a server
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,063	| IOT101 |	Instant thank you that is the word
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,879	| IOT101 |	Imagine it was multiple instance
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:16:00,767	| IOT101 |	But you could actually find that file wasn't protected so if you knew where to look
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,559	| IOT101 |	In this this is a little bit less agree
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,863	| IOT101 |	God storing passwords
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,935	| IOT101 |	Just on the internet in a database with no security that
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:12,799	| IOT101 |	Yeah that's just a tough time in this toys
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,335	| IOT101 |	Interesting in that you could
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:18,175	| IOT101 |	Record a message to your kids and send it over the Internet to the teddy bear and all
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:22,015	| IOT101 |	But now the account information on an icing recordings are all stored as well
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:27,903	| IOT101 |	Geez I mean as a people getting into these
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,207	| IOT101 |	Teddy bears in like sending
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,743	| IOT101 |	Disturbing messages to
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,535	| IOT101 |	People's teddy bear switch
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,047	| IOT101 |	Cool
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:40,191	| IOT101 |	As a hacker I can see how it be super funny in your head to send a terrifying message to a toddler
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,471	| IOT101 |	But you know
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,543	| IOT101 |	It's it's Dad that's over the line I mean
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,567	| IOT101 |	Obviously
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:48,383	| IOT101 |	Everybody has their own Line in the Sand it to me that's over the line
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,663	| IOT101 |	Yeah someone had a Twitter
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:50,687	| IOT101 |	They showed it where
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,991	| IOT101 |	I will eat your
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,759	| IOT101 |	Face
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,271	| IOT101 |	RushCard
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,295	| IOT101 |	That's great
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,855	| IOT101 |	Haha but
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,439	| IOT101 |	That is the situation
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:01,951	| IOT101 |	The
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| IOT101 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,303	| IOT101 |	I swear to God I say this all the time
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,327	| IOT101 |	But
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:10,143	| IOT101 |	You guys are getting the Internet of Things a bad name
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,447	| IOT101 |	When you build a connected product
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:14,751	| IOT101 |	You have to think of security
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,543	| IOT101 |	From the ground up
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,079	| IOT101 |	Killer Contract
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,103	| IOT101 |	Have to think of Siri
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,383	| IOT101 |	Underground
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,943	| IOT101 |	And there are companies out there
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,711	| IOT101 |	Who do this
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:24,735	| IOT101 |	And is a consumer
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| IOT101 |	You're going to have
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:31,647	| IOT101 |	I was just going to say that's what it comes down to I think it's cost
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,671	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,207	| IOT101 |	You know it's so
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:39,583	| IOT101 |	A company and I'm not trying to single out that the company that has spiral toys here but any companies making a
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,143	| IOT101 |	Device it's connected
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,471	| IOT101 |	Different want to keep costs down obviously I totally get that
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,775	| IOT101 |	It's not in the end
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,847	| IOT101 |	Yeah there you go in this situation
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,127	| IOT101 |	I love
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,919	| IOT101 |	The idea of being able to
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT101 |	Do this but
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,271	| IOT101 |	Plenty of teddy bears out there that you
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,295	| IOT101 |	You can record your voice and
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,439	| IOT101 |	By golly guys and if you're a consumer
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,231	| IOT101 |	Maybe don't buy the stuff
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,511	| IOT101 |	Or maybe
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,535	| IOT101 |	Don't buy it
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,583	| IOT101 |	Cheap I hate to say that
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:15,423	| IOT101 |	One of the things you can look for is to see if the company making the product
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:17,471	| IOT101 |	Has a bug Bounty program
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:20,287	| IOT101 |	That's actually really good way to look and be like
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,359	| IOT101 |	Care about Security in this case
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:26,431	| IOT101 |	This company was actually informed of the breach
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,967	| IOT101 |	In December and January
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,759	| IOT101 |	And never did anything about it
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,575	| IOT101 |	That feels like a situation
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| IOT101 |	No
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:41,279	| IOT101 |	It's getting to the point where it like any product it comes down to who do you trust what company or brand do you trust and
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:46,399	| IOT101 |	With Fire TV because it's a relatively new
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,679	| IOT101 |	Industry
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,703	| IOT101 |	Consumer level
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,751	| IOT101 |	And we still don't know
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,567	| IOT101 |	You don't know all the security practices of all these companies either
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,615	| IOT101 |	So it's it's really ad
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,151	| IOT101 |	Tricky situation
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,711	| IOT101 |	Any product on the Internet
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,527	| IOT101 |	It's going to be hot or has the potential to be high
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:06,623	| IOT101 |	If your device if you're designing a product is going to be connected
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,183	| IOT101 |	You probably want to design for resiliency
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,743	| IOT101 |	Stuff happen
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,303	| IOT101 |	So you have to build your product
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,399	| IOT101 |	With a mindset that you're always going to be tinker
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,215	| IOT101 |	You're always going to be testing it for 6
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,239	| IOT101 |	Breeches
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:26,079	| IOT101 |	You're always going to be testing at for resiliency challenges
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,639	| IOT101 |	And this is a very new mindset for a lot of
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,151	| IOT101 |	Companies
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,967	| IOT101 |	And you got to get it right
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,271	| IOT101 |	Otherwise
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:38,111	| IOT101 |	You're going to just stick us right back in in in some people are like
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| IOT101 |	Yeah okay that's fine I don't need it
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| IOT101 |	But it's bigger than that that's
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:47,839	| IOT101 |	The problem so it's you know I might want to put a new camera in my house because I've got to be my security system
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,887	| IOT101 |	But do I want to do that
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,167	| IOT101 |	Considering you know
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,727	| IOT101 |	Somebody might be able to hack in and see
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| IOT101 |	In my house
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,591	| IOT101 |	Speaking of security cameras
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,943	| IOT101 |	Oh I did
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,223	| IOT101 |	I did
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:09,855	| IOT101 |	Really I don't know that I needed any kind of camera but I'm like you know I should have I used to have them
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:14,207	| IOT101 |	That's much smaller house so you know I'm working from home for 5 days a week
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:20,607	| IOT101 |	I got a good discount on it on Amazon site I did my Nest Cam and I set it up on Sunday night in fact
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,143	| IOT101 |	Sunday afternoon
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,167	| IOT101 |	Set up Sunday night
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,727	| IOT101 |	And I don't see it paid for itself
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:30,079	| IOT101 |	In the first 5 minutes of us on Monday but boy did it make for an entertaining video
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:32,639	| IOT101 |	Because I came downstairs at 7:30 in the morning on Monday
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,175	| IOT101 |	I found my dog
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:36,479	| IOT101 |	The kitchen island as I often do
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,503	| IOT101 |	And like you know what
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:41,087	| IOT101 |	I'm going to see how you got up there cuz I don't know and I'm going to see when you went up there
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,623	| IOT101 |	And sure enough
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:45,695	| IOT101 |	I would like 7 in the morning after I went back into the logs
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,279	| IOT101 |	I saw my wife and stepdaughter go out the front door to work and school
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:52,607	| IOT101 |	Answered a few minutes later good old Norm
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:55,935	| IOT101 |	I see how he does it now it turns the Barstool hopped up there and
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,983	| IOT101 |	That's why I found them up there so
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,799	| IOT101 |	It made for an entertaining video
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,335	| IOT101 |	Kim Kardashian
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,663	| IOT101 |	If you don't however
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,479	| IOT101 |	Watch the video is a tiny poodle
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,759	| IOT101 |	He is not a dog that
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,551	| IOT101 |	And he's very agile
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,063	| IOT101 |	Are you smart
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,087	| IOT101 |	.
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,879	| IOT101 |	Insufficient phrase
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:20,000	| IOT101 |	I do not know why
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,792	| IOT101 |	Missouri temperamental
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,840	| IOT101 |	But he is very agile
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,352	| IOT101 |	He is
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| IOT101 |	You're crazy
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,656	| IOT101 |	Crazy agile dog
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:30,240	| IOT101 |	Of course so he's not really in trouble
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,032	| IOT101 |	He made for entertaining video
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,568	| IOT101 |	Yeah don't leave chocolate
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,432	| IOT101 |	We have actually
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,200	| IOT101 |	Some
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:43,296	| IOT101 |	Cool smart home thing you said I wanted to point out because a couple people have been asking me about
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:46,880	| IOT101 |	One is a product this is only available in the UK
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:52,000	| IOT101 |	And it has a camera and it also uses sound
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| IOT101 |	Protect your house so
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:57,888	| IOT101 |	It basically is very powerful microphone to understand
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:00,192	| IOT101 |	Like if doors have been opened
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,728	| IOT101 |	It's kind of like a glass break sensor
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:07,616	| IOT101 |	So I think it's kind of an interesting way to do this and then obviously wants it to text something
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,152	| IOT101 |	Turn the camera on and then
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,688	| IOT101 |	You can check and be like
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,224	| IOT101 |	50
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,784	| IOT101 |	It's 159 pounds
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,064	| IOT101 |	Again
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| IOT101 |	UK
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,392	| IOT101 |	Andrew on the sight word Amazon
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:21,440	| IOT101 |	And I kind of want to try it out
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,208	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:28,864	| IOT101 |	It's an interesting take on security because when you think of home security think I got a table or instrument all these doors and windows
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,704	| IOT101 |	And from what I gather
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,008	| IOT101 |	They're saying no you don't because
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,056	| IOT101 |	It can learn the sounds of your house
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:39,360	| IOT101 |	House doors opening and people
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,896	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,944	| IOT101 |	If it detects sound of something
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,992	| IOT101 |	Different like glass breaking
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:50,880	| IOT101 |	Then it can you know whether to send out a 90 decibel siren
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:54,464	| IOT101 |	Show you you know what's going on based on the camera
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,488	| IOT101 |	So I suspect
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:23:00,352	| IOT101 |	You could use fewer of these as opposed to you know like a good 20 doors and windows
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,376	| IOT101 |	Enable 20
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,400	| IOT101 |	Sensors
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,936	| IOT101 |	Exactly
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,216	| IOT101 |	That's kind of what I wanted to ask
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,240	| IOT101 |	Cuz right now I don't have sensor
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,032	| IOT101 |	I have them they're just now
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,128	| IOT101 |	So that's one for people who are
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT101 |	Excited
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,176	| IOT101 |	I also
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:20,832	| IOT101 |	This is a pre-order kind of situation so I try not to do too much of these just because
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,112	| IOT101 |	You never know
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:26,464	| IOT101 |	I could spend my entire show telling you about the kickstarter
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,216	| IOT101 |	This is a device called brilliant
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,032	| IOT101 |	What is the light switch
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:45,664	| IOT101 |	But it's a light switch with a capacitive touchscreen
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,688	| IOT101 |	It also has these
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:53,344	| IOT101 |	Touch-sensitive sliders so what you do is if you have a 1 single light switch you're going to replace your light switch with
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:58,976	| IOT101 |	You can also it's got two three and four gang switches basic
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,280	| IOT101 |	Which is one screen with like
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,048	| IOT101 |	Four different slider
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:07,680	| IOT101 |	It's got Amazon Echo voice is so Amazon voice Services built in
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:10,752	| IOT101 |	You can talk to it and order it to
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:11,264	| IOT101 |	Things just like you
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,592	| IOT101 |	It's got a motion sensor ambient light sensors
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,152	| IOT101 |	And you can
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:21,504	| IOT101 |	Quote you can do like this swiping up and down to turn things on or off
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| IOT101 |	Hold your finger to Dimmitt
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,880	| IOT101 |	And it's got a mic so you can use it as an intercom
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,648	| IOT101 |	Tom in your home
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:30,208	| IOT101 |	There's a lot to like
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:34,560	| IOT101 |	I would agree with you as I look at it though it's
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,840	| IOT101 |	Whitney reminds me of
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:38,656	| IOT101 |	It reminds me of the wink relay that I have in my bedroom
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:44,544	| IOT101 |	It has a very similar look and feel I do like a sliders as opposed to the two Hardware
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,848	| IOT101 |	Switches that the wink uses
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,896	| IOT101 |	And the week doesn't had a can beat the Winx
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:49,408	| IOT101 |	Canby
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,712	| IOT101 |	Intercoms butt
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:56,576	| IOT101 |	They don't have Amazon voice Services built-in so that's nice
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:59,904	| IOT101 |	This works with Sonos and nest and other stuff
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:00,928	| IOT101 |	I like
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,720	| IOT101 |	The look at this and I just noticed
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:06,816	| IOT101 |	I just noticed that they have it at the Target open house
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:10,144	| IOT101 |	In San Francisco and guess where I'll be next week not on the show
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:16,544	| IOT101 |	I'll be in San Francisco right across the street from the Metreon there in the Target so I may go take a look at this
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,080	| IOT101 |	Don't you get my hopes up
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:22,432	| IOT101 |	I will try to take a look I promise I will try
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,712	| IOT101 |	I really like to look at
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:26,784	| IOT101 |	Extremely similar and it has more functionality
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,392	| IOT101 |	It kind of reminds me that we talked about this but the nucleus
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:38,304	| IOT101 |	It's a I want to say it's like a picture frame kind of device but it's it's a video conference call it's a dedicated video conference call
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,352	| IOT101 |	Or an intercom system for your house
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:41,376	| IOT101 |	So you can
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,704	| IOT101 |	Put one downstairs it also has the
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,008	| IOT101 |	Echo voice services
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,568	| IOT101 |	You put one downstairs one upstairs and you could be like
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT101 |	Hey
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,640	| IOT101 |	Dinner's ready
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:56,480	| IOT101 |	I'm actually just updated the skill there in case you have them
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,016	| IOT101 |	So you can actually
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| IOT101 |	Now just
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,112	| IOT101 |	Hey nucleus call kids bedroom
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,648	| IOT101 |	And it'll do it
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,208	| IOT101 |	Which is nice cuz before he had to touch it to make that
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:13,376	| IOT101 |	Do you know the price on this the pre-orders are already done so I don't know what this went for the pre-orders were too
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:17,216	| IOT101 |	$2 for single switch up to 350 4 for switch
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,496	| IOT101 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,824	| IOT101 |	And I think the pre-orders had
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,360	| IOT101 |	$20 off
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,408	| IOT101 |	Now this won't be available so here comes
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,480	| IOT101 |	The cracks you guys
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,760	| IOT101 |	It is
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:34,112	| IOT101 |	Not going to be available again for sale until late
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| IOT101 |	2017
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:39,744	| IOT101 |	So when we find out that it is for sale again and maybe he'll send a review unit
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,512	| IOT101 |	Who knows
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,024	| IOT101 |	Kevin
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,072	| IOT101 |	I won't make you do any more light switches
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:48,448	| IOT101 |	That is this product so if you're interested in lighting
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:53,824	| IOT101 |	If you're listening to this
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,104	| IOT101 |	Time for some device
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,128	| IOT101 |	Updates
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:00,224	| IOT101 |	I talked last week about the Logitech Harmony which I purchased
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,064	| IOT101 |	And I purchased it
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,344	| IOT101 |	For the stupidest reason
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,880	| IOT101 |	Or the most brilliant
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,160	| IOT101 |	And I'm not
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,720	| IOT101 |	Excited yet basically I wouldn't
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:14,816	| IOT101 |	And you know you know modern TVs if you got a receiver you got you know
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:19,424	| IOT101 |	Afro to wear a DVD player and all the stuff I wanted to turn it on
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,984	| IOT101 |	So now I can say
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,520	| IOT101 |	Shiva shall not be named
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,056	| IOT101 |	Turn on television
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,336	| IOT101 |	End
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,104	| IOT101 |	Everything turns off
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:29,152	| IOT101 |	I can say turn on Netflix and we could all the way
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,224	| IOT101 |	So I had some trouble setting it up
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,248	| IOT101 |	But I don't
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,832	| IOT101 |	I think it was just a glitch
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:41,952	| IOT101 |	But nobody Logitech they were very good on the customer support side night I went through normal customer support
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:48,864	| IOT101 |	And I basically uninstalled everything reset everything from my router all the way down to
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:51,424	| IOT101 |	Turn out the light reflecting and uninstalling the app on my phone
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:53,216	| IOT101 |	And then read it
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:54,240	| IOT101 |	And I will tell you
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,544	| IOT101 |	It has gotten a lot better we actually
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:59,360	| IOT101 |	400th episode I went back and listen to it like
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,896	| IOT101 |	Some of our final episode
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,968	| IOT101 |	Play podcast in
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:07,552	| IOT101 |	Particular episode that I listen to a Logitech Harmony
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,368	| IOT101 |	Oh geez that's funny
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,416	| IOT101 |	A lot has changed so
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:13,696	| IOT101 |	The
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,744	| IOT101 |	Logitech app actually
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:19,072	| IOT101 |	Send a text a lot of the devices on your home network so you don't even have to set
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:23,424	| IOT101 |	You do have to you know like we said on that previous episode
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:26,752	| IOT101 |	The database is key so all I did was insert the model numbers of
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,288	| IOT101 |	My devices
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:33,920	| IOT101 |	And I ran into some trouble because it only allows for 8 connected devices
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,432	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:40,576	| IOT101 |	Have more than that that work with this thing so I had to make a call so I made the call to only have it be my
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,904	| IOT101 |	My television stuff and then a Sonos speaker
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,976	| IOT101 |	Because of my sister my receiver so it's kind
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:53,888	| IOT101 |	But I can't actually tell it to play certain songs on the Sonos I can only tell it to start up and it'll play my
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,424	| IOT101 |	Right
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,520	| IOT101 |	It is still nice to get the receiver
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,104	| IOT101 |	Direction control
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,688	| IOT101 |	That was a lie
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:14,112	| IOT101 |	Is a much better experience is much cleaner they've done a great job in their Echo skill is really phenomenal.
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,136	| IOT101 |	Because you link the skill
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:17,952	| IOT101 |	And you actually get the choice of like
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:23,328	| IOT101 |	It offers you multiple sayings that it thinks will work for what you're trying to do
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,096	| IOT101 |	The call
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:26,656	| IOT101 |	The things you're trying to do activities so it's like
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,192	| IOT101 |	Return on television
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:28,960	| IOT101 |	It's like
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:31,776	| IOT101 |	Turn on television and turn on TV and I'll let you know
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:33,568	| IOT101 |	You can even create
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:34,848	| IOT101 |	Amateur
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,688	| IOT101 |	So that way you don't have anything say multiple ways which is good
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,480	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:40,992	| IOT101 |	All in all
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,016	| IOT101 |	Yay
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:44,832	| IOT101 |	So I got a product update
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:49,440	| IOT101 |	Hitch all right then Stacy has no idea what I'm about to say I didn't tell her
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,208	| IOT101 |	In advance
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:50,976	| IOT101 |	Self
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:55,584	| IOT101 |	I mentioned last week that we got last week or two weeks ago we got a June oven
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,656	| IOT101 |	And I'm bringing this up for a couple reasons why
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:01,728	| IOT101 |	People should know that we put our money where our mouth is we both bought
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:02,752	| IOT101 |	I do not but I mean
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,384	| IOT101 |	When do you know if it's not working
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:13,248	| IOT101 |	Yeah yeah so I wanted to give a quick update and tell you how
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,832	| IOT101 |	This is being troubleshooted and what's being done about it
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,112	| IOT101 |	So basically
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,648	| IOT101 |	2 days ago
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,440	| IOT101 |	You haven't started freezing up like
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,000	| IOT101 |	Not literally cuz it's nothing nice box
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,280	| IOT101 |	But the display widget
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,048	| IOT101 |	Freezer
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:26,560	| IOT101 |	Time
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,864	| IOT101 |	Left to cook would you stop
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:32,448	| IOT101 |	Anime what's going on here don't know I'm so
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,776	| IOT101 |	We couldn't even turn it off
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,056	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:41,664	| IOT101 |	We were able to continue cooking cycles and so on so forth any more and more often
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:46,272	| IOT101 |	In addition to that and this may have been from day one I do not know
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:51,392	| IOT101 |	The one of the four ceramic heating elements at the top of the furthest back one
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,672	| IOT101 |	I noticed wasn't
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:55,488	| IOT101 |	Lighting up even when it should be on it and even when the app
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:58,816	| IOT101 |	Does the app tells you which elements are on which fans are on all that
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,120	| IOT101 |	The Apple showing it was on
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,144	| IOT101 |	But it wasn't
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,704	| IOT101 |	So I'm like that's really interesting
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,776	| IOT101 |	I did what I should do I
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:12,128	| IOT101 |	Reach out to support I just did this yesterday in fact yesterday morning and explained what was going on
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:17,760	| IOT101 |	And the support Folks at June oven I got to be honest I've been fantastic now.
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:23,904	| IOT101 |	I didn't say ideas podcast I didn't say we're working like that to them as far as I know I'm just regular customers
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,696	| IOT101 |	Just wanna put that out there
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:27,744	| IOT101 |	Try and pull anything special
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:35,424	| IOT101 |	They asked me a bunch of questions they also asked me for the serial number so that and my permission to look at the logs
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,704	| IOT101 |	Because the thing runs
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,264	| IOT101 |	Connected with Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:45,920	| IOT101 |	They checked the logs they could really see that the element was not working and I'm not surprised because the
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:52,064	| IOT101 |	What's showing that it was working as well so they asked me to take some pictures of it and I put on broil and take a picture and sound
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,600	| IOT101 |	I did all that no problem
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:54,624	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:55,904	| IOT101 |	They
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:58,720	| IOT101 |	Said seems like a hardware issue
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,256	| IOT101 |	Sears return label
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:04,096	| IOT101 |	Pack it up and original packaging which I still had cuz there was a hundred day no questions asked
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,400	| IOT101 |	Florentine all return policy
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| IOT101 |	And they've already
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,216	| IOT101 |	Shipped out a new one
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:12,800	| IOT101 |	Did not put a hold on my credit card or anything which I'm amazed for
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:13,824	| IOT101 |	$59 Prada
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:17,152	| IOT101 |	Simon and the way back
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,712	| IOT101 |	Wow I'm sorry you had that occur
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,224	| IOT101 |	Experience
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,760	| IOT101 |	I'm glad that they were
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:24,064	| IOT101 |	Careful in nice to you about it but
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:30,208	| IOT101 |	Here's the thing I mean you and I are early adopters and our families have to put up with
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,488	| IOT101 |	Right
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,792	| IOT101 |	I can only speak for my family
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:37,632	| IOT101 |	But my family is often frustrated by my earlier adopter
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,424	| IOT101 |	Product purchases and so on so forth
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,984	| IOT101 |	I would imagine you get a little that as well
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,520	| IOT101 |	You should have seen me the TV wasn't
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,080	| IOT101 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,104	| IOT101 |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,640	| IOT101 |	My wife
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:51,968	| IOT101 |	Is not upset about this at all which I'm shocked
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,760	| IOT101 |	I'm shocked
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,296	| IOT101 |	She said she really likes this
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:33:00,672	| IOT101 |	It's working well when we was working it works fantastic I had some of the best food
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:02,976	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,512	| IOT101 |	She's like okay
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:07,328	| IOT101 |	Alright let's see what happens
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,352	| IOT101 |	At normal she be like
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:12,448	| IOT101 |	Send it back get your money back I told you not to buy that thing or whatever did she say
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:14,496	| IOT101 |	Not this time I'm really surprised
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,544	| IOT101 |	I can only say that
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:22,944	| IOT101 |	I'm sorry this is happening but my husband would be the same way there's only there's very few devices that
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,736	| IOT101 |	She actually loves in our house
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,296	| IOT101 |	The junas win the echo was another
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:29,344	| IOT101 |	MyQ garage door
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,136	| IOT101 |	Everything else
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,928	| IOT101 |	Well he likes me
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,768	| IOT101 |	Really everything else can just
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:44,704	| IOT101 |	We have four Echoes and I'm the only one that uses
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:46,496	| IOT101 |	Everyone hates talking to me
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:47,776	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:53,664	| IOT101 |	They really don't Embrace many of the products so that's
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:56,480	| IOT101 |	Probably why I have a separate office and they just leave me alone with the door shut
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,784	| IOT101 |	But this is an exception
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:00,064	| IOT101 |	So awesome
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,600	| IOT101 |	That is a wonderful note to end
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,880	| IOT101 |	And on Kevin
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:05,184	| IOT101 |	Thanks for spending your morning with me here and
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:09,024	| IOT101 |	Please stay tuned for
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| IOT101 |	Luis Arias kibbutz
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,864	| IOT101 |	Of augury
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:16,960	| IOT101 |	Who's going to talk about what it means when everything becomes a service and how
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:20,544	| IOT101 |	Startups can take advantage of that and what it means for big businesses
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:23,104	| IOT101 |	Before we get to sorry though
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,128	| IOT101 |	We're going to take a
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:24,896	| IOT101 |	Rake
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:28,992	| IOT101 |	Message from our sponsor
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:35,392	| IOT101 |	Hey everyone we're taking a break for the podcast for a moment for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,160	| IOT101 |	Then dance
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,976	| IOT101 |	And I have Brian told her again to talk about
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:41,280	| IOT101 |	Spin dance and first Bryan
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,816	| IOT101 |	Can you remind everyone with
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:43,328	| IOT101 |	You guys do
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,376	| IOT101 |	Yeah spin dance
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:49,472	| IOT101 |	Develops and builds iot software for Fortune 500 organization
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,264	| IOT101 |	Buy Kwikset locks
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:53,056	| IOT101 |	Whirlpool and Ford
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:57,920	| IOT101 |	And we also work with smaller manufacturers and startup we don't just build the software we also host
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:02,528	| IOT101 |	We have a dedicated team that designs and supports infrastructure for iot products
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:07,392	| IOT101 |	So let's talk about this infrastructure what is so unique about designing and hosting a
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,160	| IOT101 |	Infrastructure for
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:13,024	| IOT101 |	It's very familiar to anybody who's done any cloud
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:19,424	| IOT101 |	Posting a lot of the best practices in the principles are the same but the fact is winter starting to deal with physics
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:25,568	| IOT101 |	Google devices that can really drastically change the equation for updates cross embedded cloud and mobile
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:31,968	| IOT101 |	Can be tricky and it's definitely a place where you want expert help debugging IRT problems is another important skill to have
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:38,368	| IOT101 |	We recently Tree hours to prominence fanfiber vendors including multiple cell phone providers it was a really tricky to
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:44,512	| IOT101 |	To get to the bottom of what was going on that's not something you typically see which is cloud-based software
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,328	| IOT101 |	So what are some common mistakes you see organizations
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,376	| IOT101 |	We see a lot of cloud-to-cloud
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,936	| IOT101 |	Free sample six months ago integrated
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:55,264	| IOT101 |	The Nest thermostat with whirlpools Jenn-Air oven
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:57,568	| IOT101 |	Kind of cloud
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,104	| IOT101 |	Occasionally quite challenging
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:04,480	| IOT101 |	Secondly we see a lot of organizations making mistakes estimating their ongoing infrastructure costs
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,784	| IOT101 |	Especially around integration and regression
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:12,672	| IOT101 |	And we see a lot of companies trying to use their internal it team to manage their iot products
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:18,560	| IOT101 |	Which we think is an anti pattern we really think you need a dedicated team focused on iot
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,352	| IOT101 |	Why do companies need that dedicated
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:27,776	| IOT101 |	The organization's we've seen be really successful iot use a product development mindset
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:30,080	| IOT101 |	Connects not typically the mode of operation
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,616	| IOT101 |	Nit group
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:37,504	| IOT101 |	RX station hosting team work side-by-side with our developers in their customers and they kind of have that natural
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:41,088	| IOT101 |	Psychedelic mindset that you really need to make great iot decisions
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:45,184	| IOT101 |	So if people have questions where can they learn more about spin dance
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,464	| IOT101 |	Angular services

EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:03,360	| IOT101 |	Thank you
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:07,968	| IOT101 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,760	| IOT101 |	And today's guest is SAR
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,272	| IOT101 |	Jaskiewicz
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:11,808	| IOT101 |	Who is
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:14,368	| IOT101 |	Founder and CEO of a company called
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,464	| IOT101 |	I'm doing great thank you
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,536	| IOT101 |	Glad to be here I am super excited to have you on the show
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,840	| IOT101 |	What we're going to do
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,120	| IOT101 |	Who is first
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,656	| IOT101 |	I'd love for you to tell everybody
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,424	| IOT101 |	What artery does
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,752	| IOT101 |	Should we listen to machines
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:35,872	| IOT101 |	And based on the noise that they may you can tell if you're working properly used to have them a function
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:39,968	| IOT101 |	And even what type of malfunction they have so we're kind of like Shazam
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:40,480	| IOT101 |	Four machines
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:41,760	| IOT101 |	I like that
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,576	| IOT101 |	How do you guys
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:47,648	| IOT101 |	Listen to stuff is it is it
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,696	| IOT101 |	Put their phone up next to it is there like
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:52,000	| IOT101 |	How does that work
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,560	| IOT101 |	So we actually have two ways of asking to machine
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:38:00,960	| IOT101 |	Our first product was a portable diagnostic tool that connects a vibration sensor to the ticket
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:03,520	| IOT101 |	Ignition iPhone or Android device
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:08,384	| IOT101 |	And he basically walks up to the machine attaches the sensor with a magnet
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,176	| IOT101 |	Wait for a couple of seconds
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:11,200	| IOT101 |	And then he gets
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:12,224	| IOT101 |	The results on the spot
EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:15,552	| IOT101 |	I will also have a continuous monitoring solution
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:18,368	| IOT101 |	Where we leave the sensors on the machine
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:21,184	| IOT101 |	We connect that to the internet and then can give
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:24,000	| IOT101 |	Continuous feedback and alerts if anything goes wrong
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,304	| IOT101 |	Basically what you're doing is listening to
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:30,400	| IOT101 |	And you developed an algorithm that can basically tell
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:32,704	| IOT101 |	Howa malfunctioning
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:33,728	| IOT101 |	Machine sounds
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:38,080	| IOT101 |	Straight correct so he's amassed a huge malfunction dictionary
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:38,592	| IOT101 |	If you will
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:41,408	| IOT101 |	Of how different malfunction sound in
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:43,456	| IOT101 |	The machines across the focusing on
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,992	| IOT101 |	I will check that are pumps fans
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:46,272	| IOT101 |	Compressors
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,064	| IOT101 |	How did you guys get
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:51,392	| IOT101 |	Definition of chicken leg of every machine learning
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:54,464	| IOT101 |	Right I was out
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,256	| IOT101 |	Therefore you don't have any customers
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:58,048	| IOT101 |	Amazon customer service have any data
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:02,400	| IOT101 |	What we initially did is we partnered with the largest maintenance company
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,168	| IOT101 |	In our Market
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,216	| IOT101 |	And had their
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,496	| IOT101 |	Ignition
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,008	| IOT101 |	Start recording
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:09,568	| IOT101 |	And then we manually
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:10,080	| IOT101 |	Analyze
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,128	| IOT101 |	This machine
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,152	| IOT101 |	And built the diction
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:17,248	| IOT101 |	That's awesome so how did you build trust with that part
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,528	| IOT101 |	Because that is
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,808	| IOT101 |	Like you explained
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,624	| IOT101 |	Crux of any sort of startup
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,904	| IOT101 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,184	| IOT101 |	It's a very hard
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:25,952	| IOT101 |	Salt
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:29,280	| IOT101 |	We were lucky to have good partners that are forward-thinking
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:34,656	| IOT101 |	And really wanted to see how technology can improve and and frankly disrupt lyrics
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,168	| IOT101 |	Market
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:36,704	| IOT101 |	You guys are
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:38,240	| IOT101 |	Israeli machine learning
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:41,568	| IOT101 |	So when you reached out to these guys did you have
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,336	| IOT101 |	Is your company
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,128	| IOT101 |	Already did you know what you were going to do
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:46,944	| IOT101 |	We spent the first two years of the company
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,456	| IOT101 |	Bootstrapping
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:52,064	| IOT101 |	And because both of us come from the technology side from engineering backgrounds
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:54,624	| IOT101 |	We built the first prototype by ourselves
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,696	| IOT101 |	So when we approach this customer we already had something
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:58,976	| IOT101 |	Adipose work
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:02,816	| IOT101 |	That connected vibration sensors to an iPhone
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:05,376	| IOT101 |	Send the data to work to the cloud for servers
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:08,448	| IOT101 |	Where we analyzed it and returns a result of the phone
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:13,568	| IOT101 |	Got it and I'm excited about with the internet
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,592	| IOT101 |	Is that it
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,640	| IOT101 |	Basically
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:19,200	| IOT101 |	We got cheap analytics cheap computer
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:23,296	| IOT101 |	So we have this ability to take information in a scale that is
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,600	| IOT101 |	For the impossible
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:27,648	| IOT101 |	And I think that's really going to change the world
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:28,928	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:31,744	| IOT101 |	How did you guys kind of come to this idea
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:32,768	| IOT101 |	Why is now the right
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:34,048	| IOT101 |	To do something
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,608	| IOT101 |	The iPhone changed ever
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:40,192	| IOT101 |	So two major trends that happened over the past
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:40,960	| IOT101 |	5
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,728	| IOT101 |	Years is
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:45,824	| IOT101 |	First every technician now has a supercomputer in
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,848	| IOT101 |	Pocket
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,384	| IOT101 |	Which we can leverage to do
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,944	| IOT101 |	Some of the Computing as well as
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,968	| IOT101 |	User interface
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,504	| IOT101 |	And the second trend is
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:55,040	| IOT101 |	Cloud computing where
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:55,808	| IOT101 |	As you said
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,344	| IOT101 |	Computing became very very cheap
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,904	| IOT101 |	And storing data became very very
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:01,440	| IOT101 |	Cheap as well
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,976	| IOT101 |	These two
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:06,304	| IOT101 |	Abilities or capabilities just didn't exist 5 years ago
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:09,120	| IOT101 |	And now is the time to really connect
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:12,704	| IOT101 |	Everything you can and monitor every Spencer and every
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,472	| IOT101 |	Signal
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:16,032	| IOT101 |	In order to create insights from Alta Strada
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,080	| IOT101 |	What is changing here and what is the end
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:22,176	| IOT101 |	So that the end goal is to provide insights
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:22,944	| IOT101 |	Sinatra.
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:23,968	| IOT101 |	So
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,040	| IOT101 |	For us to be able to tell the user
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,576	| IOT101 |	The technician or the
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:30,624	| IOT101 |	Reliability manager if you do not
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,416	| IOT101 |	Replace this bearing
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,696	| IOT101 |	Over the next quarter
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,488	| IOT101 |	Your machines Nitro breakdown
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:38,048	| IOT101 |	April cost you this much to repair it
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,840	| IOT101 |	Alright
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:40,608	| IOT101 |	Today
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:44,704	| IOT101 |	Some sensors are wired into a building management system
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,984	| IOT101 |	But most of the sensors
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:47,520	| IOT101 |	Uneven wire to that
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,288	| IOT101 |	So you haven't
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:51,360	| IOT101 |	Technician going through the morning and evening crowds
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,895	| IOT101 |	And just looking at all these
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:54,943	| IOT101 |	Data points
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:58,015	| IOT101 |	Temperature pressure and not even walking
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:00,575	| IOT101 |	So you can't create inside if you don't have
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:02,111	| IOT101 |	If you don't have the backlog
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:03,391	| IOT101 |	Behavior
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,159	| IOT101 |	The history of the behavior
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:05,951	| IOT101 |	How do I know
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,487	| IOT101 |	What track
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:07,999	| IOT101 |	Insulting
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,535	| IOT101 |	Heavily industrialized
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:11,839	| IOT101 |	You guys obviously are optimizing
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:15,167	| IOT101 |	Around noise but there's also
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:21,567	| IOT101 |	Or heat sensor anywhere and make meaning from the date overtime and
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:25,151	| IOT101 |	How do you know which one you should choose So today we're focusing on
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,687	| IOT101 |	3 sensor
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,735	| IOT101 |	I want is vibration II
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:32,575	| IOT101 |	Ultrasound we also have a temperature and magnetic and
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:39,231	| IOT101 |	Well we chose these for sensors because they give us the best value for the least expensive
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,511	| IOT101 |	System
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:42,303	| IOT101 |	Right over time
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,607	| IOT101 |	As we gain more and more Exodus
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,887	| IOT101 |	Into the machines
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:48,703	| IOT101 |	They working with the OEM filter manufacturers
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,983	| IOT101 |	We want to use
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,007	| IOT101 |	All the day.
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:54,847	| IOT101 |	We can have existing sensors we want all that data
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,615	| IOT101 |	To give better diagnostic
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:59,711	| IOT101 |	So don't they want to do this themselves why would they come to you
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:02,527	| IOT101 |	Companies are amazing at
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:07,391	| IOT101 |	Designing and building mechanical systems using very traditional tools
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:09,695	| IOT101 |	But they don't know how to connect sensors to the internet
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,743	| IOT101 |	They don't know how to store
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:14,559	| IOT101 |	Petabytes or zettabytes worth of data
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,375	| IOT101 |	I don't have the algorithmic abilities
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,423	| IOT101 |	To design and run the algorithms
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:29,663	| IOT101 |	I feel like there's a huge value-add for you guys that you are a neutral party is supposed to lock it locked inside
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,431	| IOT101 |	1 Bender
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:31,967	| IOT101 |	Correct so if
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:37,087	| IOT101 |	You know if you look at a more complex machine even not even enough time for a fan
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,367	| IOT101 |	You have the motor supplier
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:45,279	| IOT101 |	Right you have the fan supplier you have bearings have a lot of different components and if we are able to work
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,303	| IOT101 |	All of them
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,863	| IOT101 |	We can give a holistic view of the machine
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:50,143	| IOT101 |	And provide the best eggnog
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:51,679	| IOT101 |	Other possible
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:56,031	| IOT101 |	Insights are going to be the huge kind of value-add
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:59,359	| IOT101 |	In the industrial world
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:02,687	| IOT101 |	What happens to companies that have historically
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:04,223	| IOT101 |	Mayday equipment
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:06,527	| IOT101 |	Which singers are interesting Trent now
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:09,087	| IOT101 |	Which is very similar to software-as-a-service
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,111	| IOT101 |	Are we called
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:13,183	| IOT101 |	And it started in the very high-end marker
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,975	| IOT101 |	Queso in jet engines
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,511	| IOT101 |	White Rolls-Royce
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:18,559	| IOT101 |	Stop selling jet engine
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:20,351	| IOT101 |	Start selling flight hours
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:23,167	| IOT101 |	That you have there is that most they can get
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:23,935	| IOT101 |	Better margins
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:28,031	| IOT101 |	On the spare parts and the aftermarket services
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:29,055	| IOT101 |	Then they could
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,079	| IOT101 |	By selling
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:30,591	| IOT101 |	Add equipment
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:33,151	| IOT101 |	And we see the same trend
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:33,919	| IOT101 |	Going down Market
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:35,711	| IOT101 |	I told you they're in
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| IOT101 |	In Chillers which are the more
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:38,783	| IOT101 |	Expensive piece of equipment
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:44,159	| IOT101 |	But we expected to reach all the way to Clemson fans and eventually maybe even two
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:45,439	| IOT101 |	Washing machines and refrigerators
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:47,743	| IOT101 |	So the oems are looking for ways to
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,047	| IOT101 |	Preach
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:51,839	| IOT101 |	And sell more services
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:54,143	| IOT101 |	And they need to rely on technology in order to
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:59,007	| IOT101 |	Biscuits into this idea of everything
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:02,079	| IOT101 |	So how does that change the value chain
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:03,871	| IOT101 |	For providers
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:05,663	| IOT101 |	And even the buyers
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:10,783	| IOT101 |	Paso doble yams should look at the value chain today you have the
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:13,087	| IOT101 |	Original equipment
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,623	| IOT101 |	Tribution chain you have the
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,647	| IOT101 |	Service companies
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:17,695	| IOT101 |	And then you have aftermarket
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,463	| IOT101 |	Parts
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:19,999	| IOT101 |	The OEM One
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,023	| IOT101 |	To own as much as
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:21,535	| IOT101 |	They cancelled
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:25,887	| IOT101 |	And this may mean that independent service companies
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:28,959	| IOT101 |	Will have to consolidate with a larger OEM server
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:31,775	| IOT101 |	As well as the distribution channels
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:35,103	| IOT101 |	Because this is what is the big kind of
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:38,687	| IOT101 |	Conundrums I see as the OEM start
EDL	00:45:38,687	00:45:40,735	| IOT101 |	Hey I want to offer this as a service
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,295	| IOT101 |	And they don't want to piss off their distributors
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,831	| IOT101 |	Too much because they also have
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,599	| IOT101 |	This lovely day
EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:46,111	| IOT101 |	Just that his
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:55,071	| IOT101 |	How did the Distributors and the service companies who are servicing these this equipment
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,119	| IOT101 |	Look at this kid how do they find their own belly
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:00,703	| IOT101 |	It's a great question I think we'll need to see how the market
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,471	| IOT101 |	Lights out
EDL	00:46:01,983	00:46:06,079	| IOT101 |	And innocence it's not that different from what we see in the automotive in the
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:08,895	| IOT101 |	Right eye with autonomous car
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:11,455	| IOT101 |	GM is working on their own fleet of cars
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,479	| IOT101 |	Have together with Lyft
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:16,319	| IOT101 |	Is working on autonomous athletes as well
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:18,879	| IOT101 |	So this notion of
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:19,903	| IOT101 |	Transportation
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:20,415	| IOT101 |	The service
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:23,231	| IOT101 |	Is very similar to coolangatta serve
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:25,023	| IOT101 |	Right on the market
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:27,839	| IOT101 |	Now we're moving forward in this
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:30,399	| IOT101 |	Concept new value chain
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,423	| IOT101 |	Basically
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:34,495	| IOT101 |	Where is a company that provides algorithm
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:38,335	| IOT101 |	Yeah so by being a jerk party that works with
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,103	| IOT101 |	Are all these
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:42,175	| IOT101 |	Manufactured
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:44,479	| IOT101 |	We are impartial
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:47,807	| IOT101 |	And then we can transfer Knowledge from one market
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:48,319	| IOT101 |	The other
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:49,855	| IOT101 |	Boss on the algorithm
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:54,463	| IOT101 |	Night if we see something working
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:56,255	| IOT101 |	Which Sans weekend
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:58,047	| IOT101 |	Shareit with the pump
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,095	| IOT101 |	And
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,119	| IOT101 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:02,143	| IOT101 |	Will be able to
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:03,679	| IOT101 |	Build an open platform
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:05,471	| IOT101 |	That's what moves the whole Market
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:07,519	| IOT101 |	Okay so
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:12,127	| IOT101 |	The future being I am an oem so I actually make
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,199	| IOT101 |	I have another role which is
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:16,991	| IOT101 |	Insight
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:17,503	| IOT101 |	Delivery
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:22,879	| IOT101 |	Which is actually tell customers
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:27,487	| IOT101 |	Useful information but you can also give information back to OEM about how to make
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:27,999	| IOT101 |	Better products
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:29,791	| IOT101 |	And then you have
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,327	| IOT101 |	A customer so it's a little bit more
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:36,959	| IOT101 |	When we look at working with OEM we want to work with him over the
EDL	00:47:36,959	00:47:39,007	| IOT101 |	Stages of the product life cycle
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:41,567	| IOT101 |	ISO initially in the research say
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:42,591	| IOT101 |	Would help them
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:43,871	| IOT101 |	Define
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:45,407	| IOT101 |	The right sensors and
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,455	| IOT101 |	Placements of the sensors
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:50,527	| IOT101 |	We find you the algorithm for this
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:51,551	| IOT101 |	Product
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:55,903	| IOT101 |	Then factoring line will give the much better quality control
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:59,231	| IOT101 |	So if they can run these tests on the manufacturing line
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:01,023	| IOT101 |	They can identify a lot of the malfunction
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,071	| IOT101 |	This would have happened during the war
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:06,143	| IOT101 |	I did then they can save a lot of
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:06,911	| IOT101 |	Operational cost
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:09,727	| IOT101 |	The third step you know once
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:12,031	| IOT101 |	In the Wild on the customer
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:12,543	| IOT101 |	Sites
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:13,823	| IOT101 |	We
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:15,103	| IOT101 |	Keep monitoring this
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:17,151	| IOT101 |	Operating the algorithm
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,943	| IOT101 |	To get better and better Diagnostics
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:20,991	| IOT101 |	But as just said
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:22,527	| IOT101 |	We also track
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,295	| IOT101 |	All of these
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,087	| IOT101 |	Taylor statistics
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,879	| IOT101 |	As well as
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:27,647	| IOT101 |	Usage pattern
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:29,695	| IOT101 |	And then
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,231	| IOT101 |	OEM can take this
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:34,047	| IOT101 |	When designing
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:38,655	| IOT101 |	And this brings us back to the research base
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:40,703	| IOT101 |	It seems like you guys would be a better fit
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:42,239	| IOT101 |	For a service
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:47,615	| IOT101 |	Media service company that provides
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:48,383	| IOT101 |	Services to
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,967	| IOT101 |	What happens if the aftermarket
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:55,039	| IOT101 |	When everything's a service is the OEM one at home
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,063	| IOT101 |	The actor Mark
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:57,087	| IOT101 |	Parts
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:01,183	| IOT101 |	For sure that's where they seem or most of the margins today
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,743	| IOT101 |	And they want to login
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:04,511	| IOT101 |	Customer
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:07,583	| IOT101 |	Longer contract
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,607	| IOT101 |	Swarthmore
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,375	| IOT101 |	Value
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:11,679	| IOT101 |	Okay so in this Brave New World
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:14,239	| IOT101 |	What is that mean for your company
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:18,335	| IOT101 |	You've only been doing this for five years but
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:20,127	| IOT101 |	Everybody's thinking about the
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:20,639	| IOT101 |	Best cell
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:26,271	| IOT101 |	Building a large company that will be sustainable and independent
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:27,807	| IOT101 |	We're starting with
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,855	| IOT101 |	The commercial
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:35,487	| IOT101 |	Air conditioning Market but our goal eventually has to be inside everything that has
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:40,351	| IOT101 |	And this could be your washing machine refrigerator dishwasher
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:42,399	| IOT101 |	Even car right
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:44,959	| IOT101 |	So we're really here to for the long run
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:51,615	| IOT101 |	Insights not me
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:52,639	| IOT101 |	Consumer
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:55,711	| IOT101 |	Because I'm going to be buying my washing machine is a service
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:01,343	| IOT101 |	Correct end up with
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:06,975	| IOT101 |	Bright
EDL	00:50:07,487	00:50:08,511	| IOT101 |	Hundreds of Millions
EDL	00:50:08,511	00:50:09,535	| IOT101 |	Sumer's you just deal with
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:11,327	| IOT101 |	Eight or nine Giant
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:12,351	| IOT101 |	Manufacturer
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:13,631	| IOT101 |	So wonderful
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:19,263	| IOT101 |	Yes and isn't working very well what's next
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:22,335	| IOT101 |	Do we have a couple of Marcus in mind
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:23,871	| IOT101 |	Orc machine types
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:27,199	| IOT101 |	Commercial
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:29,503	| IOT101 |	Or industrial market and we're not going to there
EDL	00:50:29,503	00:50:31,295	| IOT101 |	Consumer residential yet
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:34,879	| IOT101 |	Kobe elevator
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:35,903	| IOT101 |	Example
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:37,439	| IOT101 |	The whole culture
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:39,487	| IOT101 |	Wright Refrigeration in the factory
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,791	| IOT101 |	Drink transportation of it
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:43,327	| IOT101 |	Either
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:44,351	| IOT101 |	Antrax
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:45,631	| IOT101 |	Train tour
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:46,655	| IOT101 |	Overseas
EDL	00:50:46,655	00:50:48,191	| IOT101 |	It also has a very lucrative Market
EDL	00:50:49,215	00:50:55,615	| IOT101 |	Okay elevators is a really interesting because ThyssenKrupp actually has an elevator
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:59,967	| IOT101 |	Risky Business
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:00,479	| IOT101 |	2
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:07,135	| IOT101 |	I'm sure there's another elevator manufacturer
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:14,559	| IOT101 |	In a situation like that
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:15,583	| IOT101 |	Which is kind of a weird
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:18,655	| IOT101 |	Well it's a good point that the elevator Market
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:21,983	| IOT101 |	Switch to the desert service model
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:23,519	| IOT101 |	Because there are more
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,543	| IOT101 |	Expensive
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:25,823	| IOT101 |	Require a lot of maintenance
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:27,871	| IOT101 |	The way that we
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:28,383	| IOT101 |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:31,455	| IOT101 |	Is we want to work with these manufacturer
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:34,527	| IOT101 |	So today they offer a service
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:38,367	| IOT101 |	But if we can decrease their malfunctions by 75
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:38,879	| IOT101 |	Percent
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:40,159	| IOT101 |	Weekend
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:41,183	| IOT101 |	Saving a lot of money
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:48,095	| IOT101 |	So basically you'll be going to
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:49,375	| IOT101 |	Already analyzing the data
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:50,911	| IOT101 |	Salmista
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:55,263	| IOT101 |	Crack of the question is what data are the analyzing
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:58,847	| IOT101 |	How advanced are there Outlet
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:02,687	| IOT101 |	So it's just purely better
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:06,783	| IOT101 |	Magic Machine learning
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:13,439	| IOT101 |	Machine learning understanding machine
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:14,975	| IOT101 |	10/3 m
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:20,095	| IOT101 |	So I can tell you the fact that you're not
EDL	00:52:20,607	00:52:24,447	| IOT101 |	Operational data
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:25,471	| IOT101 |	Look at mechanical
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:29,311	| IOT101 |	I can see that.
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:33,663	| IOT101 |	All right
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:35,711	| IOT101 |	Latisse or anything else you want to tell me
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:37,759	| IOT101 |	Another very interesting trend
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:39,295	| IOT101 |	Is
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:40,575	| IOT101 |	What happens to insurance
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:44,159	| IOT101 |	When everything is continuously monitored and diagnose
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:46,463	| IOT101 |	Yes and
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:48,767	| IOT101 |	In a sense you can say that the OEM
EDL	00:52:48,767	00:52:51,327	| IOT101 |	If they do move to this equipment as a service model
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:52,863	| IOT101 |	They become an insurance
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:55,935	| IOT101 |	Cuz they hold off the risk if anything goes
EDL	00:52:55,935	00:52:56,447	| IOT101 |	Bong
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:53:00,031	| IOT101 |	Not wanting to trade insurance
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:01,567	| IOT101 |	Christine
EDL	00:53:02,847	00:53:07,199	| IOT101 |	Moving from a annual rate and annual flat rate
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:11,807	| IOT101 |	Actions that are based on the actual
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:13,599	| IOT101 |	Dishes
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:20,511	| IOT101 |	So if you're a Progressive auto insurance customer to get the small black box that measures if you're a safe
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:24,095	| IOT101 |	And that just a few name on the side
EDL	00:53:24,607	00:53:26,143	| IOT101 |	Or if you drive after midnight
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:27,167	| IOT101 |	Raining
EDL	00:53:27,679	00:53:28,191	| IOT101 |	You pay higher
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:32,543	| IOT101 |	And very similar in our markets
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:33,823	| IOT101 |	If you take good
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:35,871	| IOT101 |	Care of your machines
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:37,919	| IOT101 |	And they're inaccessible condition
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:39,455	| IOT101 |	There is a lower risk
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:39,967	| IOT101 |	A failure
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:45,599	| IOT101 |	Therefore you will pay in the
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:48,927	| IOT101 |	We want to become the standard
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:50,207	| IOT101 |	Pipe for this data
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:51,231	| IOT101 |	Oxford Insurance
