EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:34,048	| IOT068 |	Some smaller news and
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:38,400	| IOT068 |	WiFi and privacy just because that never gets old
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:43,520	| IOT068 |	In our guest is the CEO of arable which is a company that is
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:44,288	| IOT068 |	Taking
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:45,056	| IOT068 |	Data
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:46,080	| IOT068 |	About farming
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,360	| IOT068 |	To Dura Spanish me

EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:52,736	| IOT068 |	I thought were to have a Pokemon go I guess not
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:53,504	| IOT068 |	No no that was last week
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:55,296	| IOT068 |	Pokemon go is over
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:58,368	| IOT068 |	A lot of people paranoid
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:58,880	| IOT068 |	They are
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:00,416	| IOT068 |	But I walk the dog at play
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:03,744	| IOT068 |	You did start playing
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:08,608	| IOT068 |	I did I did while the kids are playing on Mike let me go see what's what here and
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:10,144	| IOT068 |	Yes I installed it
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:13,728	| IOT068 |	I walk the dog it's the only time I fired up
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:16,800	| IOT068 |	Cuz I got to walk in like 5 6 times a day there's a park across the street
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:19,616	| IOT068 |	We take half mile to mile walks and
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,688	| IOT068 |	I caught Pokemon while he does his business
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:24,736	| IOT068 |	Rate
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:26,528	| IOT068 |	That's probably a good time to end
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,040	| IOT068 |	Agency
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,064	| IOT068 |	For reality
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:31,392	| IOT068 |	Cuz I don't like the actual reality of that time
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,416	| IOT068 |	Yatagan Valley
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:33,952	| IOT068 |	Alright so
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,488	| IOT068 |	What start off with
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,256	| IOT068 |	Arm
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,536	| IOT068 |	Because that's probably
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:39,328	| IOT068 |	Barney anything exciting happening
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,888	| IOT068 |	Couple days the biggest news we're going to see this week
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:42,912	| IOT068 |	I se biggest
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:44,448	| IOT068 |	Ship deals
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,472	| IOT068 |	Maybe
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| IOT068 |	Comment
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,264	| IOT068 |	Trivago
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,544	| IOT068 |	In terms of dollars
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,336	| IOT068 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:53,664	| IOT068 |	I was looking at was even looking at it from a financial standpoint but you're right
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:59,808	| IOT068 |	Pronunciation standpoint I think it's the biggest deal in 10 years since Intel sold office exhale business
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,088	| IOT068 |	Oh wow that's a pretty
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,368	| IOT068 |	And that was that
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,440	| IOT068 |	Exactly
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:07,488	| IOT068 |	Suzhou future in small chip
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,536	| IOT068 |	2006
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:15,168	| IOT068 |	Well for people who like oh God they just went off the deep end here's what happened if you miss it
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,984	| IOT068 |	SoftBank which is a Japanese will call it a
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:21,056	| IOT068 |	Paying a conglomerate
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:22,848	| IOT068 |	Carrier
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,384	| IOT068 |	And Sprint
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,408	| IOT068 |	Here in the US
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| IOT068 |	That
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:29,760	| IOT068 |	It made a buyout offer at 17 pounds per share so that is
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:33,344	| IOT068 |	24.3 billion pounds
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,392	| IOT068 |	432 billion dollars
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:35,904	| IOT068 |	Boom
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,744	| IOT068 |	Which is the company that makes
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,256	| IOT068 |	The
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,304	| IOT068 |	Design for
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,328	| IOT068 |	Mobile chips
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,352	| IOT068 |	And micro
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,632	| IOT068 |	Microprocessor
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,472	| IOT068 |	Actually produce any chips at all
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,776	| IOT068 |	A design
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,056	| IOT068 |	The chips that pretty much
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,128	| IOT068 |	In just about every mobile device these days
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,152	| IOT068 |	For people such as
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:02,016	| IOT068 |	Apple Samsung Qualcomm Rockchip mediatek
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:05,856	| IOT068 |	It does it even includes companies now designing server chips
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,648	| IOT068 |	Amazon actually make
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| IOT068 |	Pixar base chips
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:09,952	| IOT068 |	Which I always thought
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:13,024	| IOT068 |	I did not know they were a licensee of army
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| IOT068 |	They must be
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:16,096	| IOT068 |	Arm does not disclose its licensees
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,912	| IOT068 |	But it's licensees are welcome to say that there
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| IOT068 |	Licensing arm
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,752	| IOT068 |	I'd like to say that
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| IOT068 |	So much
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,616	| IOT068 |	And so basically this steal everyone's like
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,384	| IOT068 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,688	| IOT068 |	This is crazy it did come way out of left
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,224	| IOT068 |	There's a couple things
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| IOT068 |	Think about
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:36,320	| IOT068 |	One topic started talking to arm
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,392	| IOT068 |	About two weeks ago apparently with the steel which puts it about
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,672	| IOT068 |	Two weeks after
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,952	| IOT068 |	Brexit vote
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,000	| IOT068 |	And the pound
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,280	| IOT068 |	When dropping
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,048	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,352	| IOT068 |	There's this idea that this is the first babe
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,656	| IOT068 |	Tech acquisition after the brexit
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,680	| IOT068 |	End
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:53,984	| IOT068 |	Matters
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,520	| IOT068 |	I'm not sure that it really does
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:02,688	| IOT068 |	I'm going to say it might be cuz I think the pound is down
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:06,272	| IOT068 |	I'm going to take a guess here so don't quote me by mass at least 20%
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT068 |	Since
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,320	| IOT068 |	The brexit
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,856	| IOT068 |	But they are paying
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:14,208	| IOT068 |	They are paying 70 times the annual net
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,256	| IOT068 |	Income I believe of arm
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,559	| IOT068 |	It is
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,839	| IOT068 |	It is not
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,911	| IOT068 |	And you know that's
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,423	| IOT068 |	One of the reason
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,751	| IOT068 |	Arm is always been in a weird space
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,263	| IOT068 |	Because
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,079	| IOT068 |	It is I always call it an arms dealer
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:30,847	| IOT068 |	2
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,895	| IOT068 |	Any hardware maker and it is
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,919	| IOT068 |	It's designs
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,735	| IOT068 |	Mean that basically no chip company could ever perch
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,783	| IOT068 |	Because
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,855	| IOT068 |	If your Qualcomm or if your Apple and suddenly
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:45,951	| IOT068 |	Apple purchases arm than qualcomm's going to be like Willow now
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:49,279	| IOT068 |	That's not cool I can't decide my chips using the arm architecture
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,863	| IOT068 |	Regulatory with wood would hold that up I would think
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| IOT068 |	Also regular
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,167	| IOT068 |	I just think the customers
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,471	| IOT068 |	Wyoming living
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:02,335	| IOT068 |	That was always an issue and has are moved into servers and other markets
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,407	| IOT068 |	Companies like Google that may have been acquirers
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,711	| IOT068 |	Suddenly we're kind of left out
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:15,391	| IOT068 |	So don't wouldn't kind of saw this coming arms always been attractive but it's never been like oh I'm going to pay a lot for this because
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,927	| IOT068 |	It was unclear how you can get a lot of value
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,719	| IOT068 |	There's no Center
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,255	| IOT068 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:24,863	| IOT068 |	I have an open question and we're not going to get the answer for quite some time if we ever do it all
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:30,495	| IOT068 |	But my thought is based on the that's 70 x net income
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,007	| IOT068 |	Metric
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:36,127	| IOT068 |	And the amount of money that is SoftBank is coming up with to do this deal
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,919	| IOT068 |	I'm wondering
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,943	| IOT068 |	FB
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,271	| IOT068 |	License fees will slowly creep up a little
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,575	| IOT068 |	Faster so to speak because they
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,623	| IOT068 |	I would imagine it's been going up steadily
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,135	| IOT068 |	4 years
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,183	| IOT068 |	Apus
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,719	| IOT068 |	What I call a
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,743	| IOT068 |	Expected basis
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,511	| IOT068 |	Rape
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:58,655	| IOT068 |	Will bees fees go up higher than expected in the in the coming years I Wonder Pets off and try to make back some of that money
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,703	| IOT068 |	That is one of the question
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,543	| IOT068 |	I'm talking to a couple of Chip companies Slater
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,847	| IOT068 |	Our licensees to figure some of this
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,151	| IOT068 |	1 is
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,711	| IOT068 |	Hey are you worried about price raises
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,735	| IOT068 |	But the other is
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:17,855	| IOT068 |	Owner even if it's someone who's not necessarily competitor
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,391	| IOT068 |	Simply because
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:24,511	| IOT068 |	Well SoftBank has pledged to double the employee headcount in the UK and
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,559	| IOT068 |	Invest in arm
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,119	| IOT068 |	It's an arm could certainly use it
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,959	| IOT068 |	It's really unclear if softbank's really going to go there
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:37,311	| IOT068 |	Because I mean if you look at it Sprint deal it invested quite a bit in Sprint but
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:42,175	| IOT068 |	Do not invest Weller wisely I would say it it felt like that's that's not a great deal
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:45,759	| IOT068 |	Right that's a valid concern because I mean if
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT068 |	The
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:52,671	| IOT068 |	Case of innovation coming from arm suddenly stops so at a company sort of stagnates or just
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,719	| IOT068 |	Goes to hell in a handbasket
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,999	| IOT068 |	What's that do to the mobile industry
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,279	| IOT068 |	I mean
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,815	| IOT068 |	. sexy
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,351	| IOT068 |	Chip industry not just that like
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,655	| IOT068 |	Cannot display
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:09,311	| IOT068 |	Arm has Graphics processors that they're still a relatively small part of the market but
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,847	| IOT068 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,919	| IOT068 |	It's 95% of all smartphones have arm-based
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:14,687	| IOT068 |	Instruction sets
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:16,991	| IOT068 |	Possibly all now
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,647	| IOT068 |	Asus phones out there
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,951	| IOT068 |	You know whenever some Dell
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:29,279	| IOT068 |	Android tablets although Del is getting out of that business
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,839	| IOT068 |	Subway 95% sounds about right but I mean
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,143	| IOT068 |	There's a couple things you got the devices
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:39,263	| IOT068 |	Then you've got what about all the software that runs on these devices if there's a whole new architecture that has to be built because
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:39,775	| IOT068 |	Armies
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| IOT068 |	No not
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,847	| IOT068 |	Cutting it anymore
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,127	| IOT068 |	The implications could be massive
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,151	| IOT068 |	Chester UK
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,431	| IOT068 |	Massive pregnant
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,503	| IOT068 |	There are alternatives out there
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,295	| IOT068 |	And not just mobile there's also
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:56,671	| IOT068 |	Servers because arm is getting in there although that's not widespread by any stretch of the imagination
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,951	| IOT068 |	And then there's
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,815	| IOT068 |	Cellular base station equipment they actually have some quarters that are used in
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,583	| IOT068 |	Cellular network
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,655	| IOT068 |	And there's all the microprocessors
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:07,935	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,263	| IOT068 |	I'll put a lot of power and softbank's pocket
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,543	| IOT068 |	It does
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,407	| IOT068 |	I mean alarm had that power before sex it's no different in that respect but
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,455	| IOT068 |	Arm is a known entity in this face
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,991	| IOT068 |	It would have been around since the 80s
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,159	| IOT068 |	Was it I thought of the acorn computer
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,975	| IOT068 |	So the acorn computer guys and apple got together
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,535	| IOT068 |	Formerly spun off arm
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,303	| IOT068 |	In 1990
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,119	| IOT068 |	Dairy okay so they were talking before him
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,679	| IOT068 |	Yashow market
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,191	| IOT068 |	Picture was great
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,263	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,055	| IOT068 |	Yes we will see because
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,079	| IOT068 |	Again
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,871	| IOT068 |	This is huge
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,175	| IOT068 |	Huge
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:54,015	| IOT068 |	And we've had this like benevolent are
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| IOT068 |	Grace Slick
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,063	| IOT068 |	Climatic
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,599	| IOT068 |	British
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,647	| IOT068 |	Stated company that's like
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,695	| IOT068 |	You know investing in
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,207	| IOT068 |	Putting out
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,743	| IOT068 |	New cores
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,767	| IOT068 |	And working with everybody
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,863	| IOT068 |	You know what the video call, summation Apple
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,399	| IOT068 |	Samsung I mean
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:14,751	| IOT068 |	There's hundreds of companies are using the architecture gear
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,567	| IOT068 |	If I'm not mistaken I'm sure you noticed there's
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,383	| IOT068 |	Two different type of licenses so you can just
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,151	| IOT068 |	License
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| IOT068 |	The Beast
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,199	| IOT068 |	Arm Staffing
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,991	| IOT068 |	Credit chip based on the basics
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,807	| IOT068 |	Where you can customize and pay extra and so on so forth
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,879	| IOT068 |	And that's what Apple does and I think Samsung and some others
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,159	| IOT068 |	Yes those are called
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:35,999	| IOT068 |	That's that's the word I was looking for
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,327	| IOT068 |	Is something wrong with anybody so I'm going back to my
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,863	| IOT068 |	Open question about
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,375	| IOT068 |	Pricing
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:45,727	| IOT068 |	Backwards potentially squeeze out a lot of these smaller chip makers
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:50,591	| IOT068 |	You know and then granted the bigger ones will be happy to take up the slack but
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| IOT068 |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,199	| IOT068 |	More questions than answers than answers in the stomach
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,759	| IOT068 |	It's true it feels like Switzerland just got invaded by a like
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,343	| IOT068 |	Let's just say Japan
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| IOT068 |	What's that mean
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,743	| IOT068 |	I'm sorry but you totally falls apart we should
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| IOT068 |	Just go English just got invaded by Japan
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,303	| IOT068 |	All right
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,071	| IOT068 |	No more
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:11,583	| IOT068 |	Noma
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,887	| IOT068 |	Okay that's the arm news
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:16,191	| IOT068 |	Let's move on to
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,959	| IOT068 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| IOT068 |	You want to talk about privacy
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| IOT068 |	We should talk about
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,079	| IOT068 |	Privacy only because
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:26,431	| IOT068 |	It came up it just before the show you and I were chatting out what to talk about this weekend
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,735	| IOT068 |	We had a pretty Full Slate but then we noticed
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,039	| IOT068 |	That a new startup
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,575	| IOT068 |	A Wi-Fi * called is in reach
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,415	| IOT068 |	Just emerged from stealth with 15 million dollars
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:41,023	| IOT068 |	And apparently and I'm just quoting from the Ford Store that covered this
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,375	| IOT068 |	One third of the city of San Francisco has log into
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,191	| IOT068 |	Zenreach without ever realizing it
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,775	| IOT068 |	Which got us thinking about privacy so we start digging around
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:57,919	| IOT068 |	Within Reach one of you tell them what it is I'm going to let the Privacy is a company that advertises itself
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:03,039	| IOT068 |	It provides free Wifi for restaurants cafes
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:04,575	| IOT068 |	Other places
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,367	| IOT068 |	And it's basically
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,183	| IOT068 |	It's a little different from the sponsor y5 Market
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,951	| IOT068 |	Because
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:15,071	| IOT068 |	They provided you tell login to give them your email address they give that to the
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,863	| IOT068 |	Business owner they make miniature
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,655	| IOT068 |	Event list for the business owner Etc
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,983	| IOT068 |	Your Mac address
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,775	| IOT068 |	Send your email associated with that
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,055	| IOT068 |	Get sent as in reach
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,615	| IOT068 |	When you sign up for that
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| IOT068 |	Free Wi-Fi access
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,663	| IOT068 |	End
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,943	| IOT068 |	Then when you walk in
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:31,967	| IOT068 |	Later
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,783	| IOT068 |	Anytime even if you don't log into their Network
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:37,343	| IOT068 |	They'll know it's you because they got your Mac address
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,439	| IOT068 |	Right which is a very unique identifier of the hardware in your phone or tablet
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,207	| IOT068 |	What so
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:46,047	| IOT068 |	That's kind of interesting and doing things because there's
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:49,631	| IOT068 |	Euclid actually does this
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,423	| IOT068 |	It's the same thing actually they they track
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,959	| IOT068 |	People's Mac addresses
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| IOT068 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:59,103	| IOT068 |	Packers have used this in the past on both Wi-Fi on your phone and even on Bluetooth devices
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,151	| IOT068 |	Because when your phone doesn't
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,967	| IOT068 |	The place in your Wi-Fi network is on
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,503	| IOT068 |	It basically tries
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,319	| IOT068 |	It runs through all its Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| IOT068 |	Works looking for one that it's been on
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| IOT068 |	Data is
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,159	| IOT068 |	Captured
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,231	| IOT068 |	And by analyzing at they can figure out
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,279	| IOT068 |	Random things like
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,607	| IOT068 |	Attach most often to a Wi-Fi network in this part of the city
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,119	| IOT068 |	Or
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,399	| IOT068 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,959	| IOT068 |	The difference here is Centereach gets all of that data
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,471	| IOT068 |	Plus
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,495	| IOT068 |	Your
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,823	| IOT068 |	Yeah and that whole quote about
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,639	| IOT068 |	In 1/3 of the city San Francisco
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:35,455	| IOT068 |	Login is invalid even knowing it that's what kind of thinking
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:42,111	| IOT068 |	Will the sky be Travis implications there so we took a quick look realtor.com privacy
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,159	| IOT068 |	If you're in California you're kind of
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,927	| IOT068 |	Up the creek
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:50,047	| IOT068 |	Because right at the bathroom saying we don't even recognize and respond to the do not track signals in California cuz
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:53,631	| IOT068 |	Bethel still in flux so you can print it trying to block it that way
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,167	| IOT068 |	You can opt out
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:13:01,311	| IOT068 |	But you pretty much and can't use the Wi-Fi networks of the retail establishments at all as I read it
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,591	| IOT068 |	Right
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,615	| IOT068 |	Topped out
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:08,223	| IOT068 |	You would have to go to the network advertising initiative or there is a formal
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,247	| IOT068 |	Do not track
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:09,759	| IOT068 |	Effort
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:12,831	| IOT068 |	California California
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,111	| IOT068 |	Macarena
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,951	| IOT068 |	Turn your Wi-Fi off a side which is very nice of them to suggest
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:18,975	| IOT068 |	Oh
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,535	| IOT068 |	You can use the digital advertising Alliance
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:22,815	| IOT068 |	Consumer opt-out
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,375	| IOT068 |	Or the network advertising
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,471	| IOT068 |	So both of those places but
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,543	| IOT068 |	None of those places actually guarantee and if you
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,335	| IOT068 |	Anything like clear cookies
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:37,663	| IOT068 |	All of that actually can go away cuz they put a cookie on your phone saying
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,943	| IOT068 |	Participating advertisers.
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,015	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,039	| IOT068 |	I
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,063	| IOT068 |	Because
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,367	| IOT068 |	In the master of is this than that
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,951	| IOT068 |	Actually wanted to let you guys know I know on my phone I use
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,023	| IOT068 |	A simple is this and that recipe
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:56,351	| IOT068 |	For when my phone goes out of my home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:59,167	| IOT068 |	Automatically turns the Wifi off on my handset
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,215	| IOT068 |	So this has to
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,263	| IOT068 |	Nice things it saves battery life marginal
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| IOT068 |	And it also
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,591	| IOT068 |	Helps cut down on tracking
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,895	| IOT068 |	I want my network Sia
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,967	| IOT068 |	That's an option
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| IOT068 |	If you're like
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,807	| IOT068 |	Forgetful and don't wanna manually turn off your network that's
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,855	| IOT068 |	Double and then you can always turn it back on
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,135	| IOT068 |	If you're like oh I need Wi-Fi
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,975	| IOT068 |	If not it's a good thing that's a good trick
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:25,279	| IOT068 |	I imagine you can do it on iOS to cuz
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,559	| IOT068 |	But I've no
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,583	| IOT068 |	I sent I don't have an iOS
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:33,215	| IOT068 |	That's a good question if I was a little more finicky about
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,799	| IOT068 |	External control of phone settings and such
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:39,871	| IOT068 |	Supreme
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:40,895	| IOT068 |	Detailed iOS
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| IOT068 |	Yasso
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,223	| IOT068 |	I don't know
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:46,783	| IOT068 |	That Maybe not maybe so that's the
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,807	| IOT068 |	Messy stuff
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,855	| IOT068 |	I don't know what to tell you
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,879	| IOT068 |	Your privacy is basically a force
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,207	| IOT068 |	Other things happening
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,255	| IOT068 |	The FTC
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,815	| IOT068 |	Speaking of privacy is looking out for us
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,119	| IOT068 |	They put out an advisory last week
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,143	| IOT068 |	On
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,447	| IOT068 |	Basically talking about
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,727	| IOT068 |	After the nest revolve
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,263	| IOT068 |	Tissue
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,079	| IOT068 |	Asking people who manufacture devices
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,615	| IOT068 |	To consider
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,919	| IOT068 |	Not sun setting them in such a
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,431	| IOT068 |	Terrible
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,759	| IOT068 |	Careful way
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT068 |	This is like the most
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,575	| IOT068 |	Toothless Pig
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,343	| IOT068 |	But it is like
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,231	| IOT068 |	The FTC to look into the hole
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,815	| IOT068 |	Nest reball shut down between I know we talked about
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,351	| IOT068 |	Several days ago
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:36,959	| IOT068 |	And decided not to further investigate into it based on several reasons one was he
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,519	| IOT068 |	The actual users of the product
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,055	| IOT068 |	I guess they felt it was
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| IOT068 |	Not
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:46,687	| IOT068 |	Large enough to make that big of a deal obviously if you are one of those affected you will feel otherwise and
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,711	| IOT068 |	I totally appreciate that but
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:51,039	| IOT068 |	Yes so they they did come up with is your right it's a toothless
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:55,647	| IOT068 |	Blog post essentially saying what happens when the sun sets on a smart product
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| IOT068 |	You know they mentioned
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,743	| IOT068 |	Meme nesting revolver
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,023	| IOT068 |	But they did say
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:05,119	| IOT068 |	Yeah of a recent investigation into one company's decision kind of prompt it us.
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,143	| IOT068 |	Take a look at this and
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:11,775	| IOT068 |	So that they're giving some guidelines to companies who make iot devices to deal better with
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| IOT068 |	Consumers
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| IOT068 |	And then be more transparent
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,103	| IOT068 |	And I would like to
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,127	| IOT068 |	To say that these are actually
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:21,247	| IOT068 |	I said guidelines so the first is are you selling a device a service or both
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,807	| IOT068 |	What are you telling consumers
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,319	| IOT068 |	That you're selling
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| IOT068 |	Cuz a lot of
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:31,487	| IOT068 |	Will tell you something in the value is in the software and services
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,791	| IOT068 |	But they're telling you
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,631	| IOT068 |	I'm not paying $250 for a nest thermostat because it looks pretty
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:39,167	| IOT068 |	I know some people do but
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:41,215	| IOT068 |	If it suddenly broke on my wallet
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,007	| IOT068 |	Because I know
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:43,775	| IOT068 |	Think of it as Justice
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:50,943	| IOT068 |	Are consumers getting a fixed term rental or subscription are they getting something they will own and can rely on for the life their device
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,223	| IOT068 |	Most companies
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,551	| IOT068 |	Choose to do a one-time purchase because
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:17:00,159	| IOT068 |	Consumers hate paying for subscriptions but if the FTC wants to really start asking
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,719	| IOT068 |	Questions about that that could really change that business model
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,279	| IOT068 |	I like the very last one actually
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:09,375	| IOT068 |	What did you tell consumers at the outset or what would
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| IOT068 |	They otherwise expect
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,983	| IOT068 |	About the security would provide for the life of the device
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:19,103	| IOT068 |	Credit as a vendor with sunsetting devices well because there's residual data afterwards but
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,431	| IOT068 |	I like the security aspect like that they're asking that question
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,479	| IOT068 |	An unrelated note very related note
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:30,623	| IOT068 |	Since I moved recently I left my nest in the old house and I put the ecobee3 in here as we talked about last week
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:34,207	| IOT068 |	When I deactivated my Nest I got a nice confirmation email
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| IOT068 |	So you want to close your account
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| IOT068 |	I did that
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,583	| IOT068 |	I sent me a confirmation email after that saying
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:43,167	| IOT068 |	We removed all of your information from our servers and so on so forth so that
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:46,495	| IOT068 |	That was a great way to handle that not so much on the revolve side but
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,799	| IOT068 |	I'm a mess I with my data that was great
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,567	| IOT068 |	Got it
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:53,919	| IOT068 |	Show me
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,735	| IOT068 |	As a consumer also
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,783	| IOT068 |	As a recent picture
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:03,391	| IOT068 |	Isn't just telling you this because they think it'll be nice they're telling you this is a warning
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,975	| IOT068 |	Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your point of view
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,999	| IOT068 |	Agency
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,279	| IOT068 |	Is
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,559	| IOT068 |	Not going to Lake
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,839	| IOT068 |	Right off of the big steak
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,863	| IOT068 |	Start beating people with it
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,911	| IOT068 |	They are specific
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,191	| IOT068 |	Stop showing their stick
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,751	| IOT068 |	Look what we have
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,775	| IOT068 |	This is what we care about
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,055	| IOT068 |	We have a stick
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,335	| IOT068 |	They're not afraid to use it
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,127	| IOT068 |	Not at least so far
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,151	| IOT068 |	Post presidential alert
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,455	| IOT068 |	Everything
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,759	| IOT068 |	Alright what else do we have
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,599	| IOT068 |	Forget the docket I'm going to interject
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,135	| IOT068 |	I must
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,415	| IOT068 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:39,231	| IOT068 |	Because you assign me homework about a year ago and I finally completed it
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,047	| IOT068 |	Insteon homework
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:46,911	| IOT068 |	Now when I thought I thought I was going to be
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:53,055	| IOT068 |	My dog ate that I got it no the quick
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,591	| IOT068 |	Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,663	| IOT068 |	I forgotten
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,735	| IOT068 |	I know it's been awhile
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,783	| IOT068 |	O'Jays
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,367	| IOT068 |	Well I it just made sense to put it in because
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:12,767	| IOT068 |	When we got to the townhouse I figured I have to rekey the locks and change all the locks that's in all the way to 2nd station
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,303	| IOT068 |	Kwikset Z-Wave lock
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,655	| IOT068 |	Maybe a year ago it's got to keypad that connects to my wink
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,191	| IOT068 |	Install it over the weekend
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,983	| IOT068 |	It's working super super well
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:26,079	| IOT068 |	I get concerned that there's four batteries inside you you supply the batteries I have
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:28,639	| IOT068 |	How many Loops in there for
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:31,711	| IOT068 |	Double-a any loops and I don't know how long they last
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:37,343	| IOT068 |	Is right now nobody's carrying keys or I'll just use the keypad to get in and get out where using phone unlock the door with
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:40,671	| IOT068 |	No batteries means no exit and no entry
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,439	| IOT068 |	If it's locked
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:43,231	| IOT068 |	So I will say so
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,511	| IOT068 |	Since we had ours up for
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| IOT068 |	Probably a little over two years
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,863	| IOT068 |	They've lasted between 6 and 8 months
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:52,447	| IOT068 |	Stay last less login
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,495	| IOT068 |	But recently
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,079	| IOT068 |	If we actually had a bachelorette because bad batteries fit
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,383	| IOT068 |	They stopped working after like a week it was crazy
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:01,663	| IOT068 |	I will say though
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,479	| IOT068 |	The manufacturer says that if you put batteries in
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| IOT068 |	And you don't
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,527	| IOT068 |	Connected to anything
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,855	| IOT068 |	It's going to rain a lot faster cuz it's constantly
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:16,255	| IOT068 |	Painting to look for a Z-Wave device if you're not going to have it hooked up to something for a while
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,279	| IOT068 |	The radio chip out
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:21,119	| IOT068 |	Well yeah I'll leave it in because it's it's
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:24,447	| IOT068 |	Connected to the wink Hub which obviously I put in prior to the
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,495	| IOT068 |	The quixotic setup on my lights and everything else and
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,311	| IOT068 |	I'm back to the way I was in the old house
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,847	| IOT068 |	On my lights and such so
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:33,919	| IOT068 |	That's good to know but I'm going to leave those better than cuz if it's working great
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,199	| IOT068 |	I love having to be honest
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,479	| IOT068 |	Awesome
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,271	| IOT068 |	I see we got a visit from Norm here
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| IOT068 |	Yeah

EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,975	| IOT068 |	He's adorable if you're not following Kevin on
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:52,863	| IOT068 |	On Instagram I should just get him his own darn account but yeah
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,655	| IOT068 |	Play I put on warm
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,679	| IOT068 |	After all the pictures
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,239	| IOT068 |	Is going nuts
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| IOT068 |	Okay so some quick news to round out the show
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,151	| IOT068 |	Is wechat skybell
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,199	| IOT068 |	My favorite HD doorbell
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:09,759	| IOT068 |	Out there right now although I haven't tried the ring Pro so
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,087	| IOT068 |	Skybell is connected with SmartThings
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,672	| IOT068 |	Yay so if you have those two devices you cannot make them work
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:22,560	| IOT068 |	Work together this is also a good time to say that I'm a little disappointed in August right now because I have the August
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,608	| IOT068 |	Connected doorbells and things
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:29,216	| IOT068 |	Promise that 90 days after the product launch they would have motion sensing
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,728	| IOT068 |	And
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,776	| IOT068 |	The ability to save your
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| IOT068 |	Videos
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| IOT068 |	And so far they don't yet
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,872	| IOT068 |	We are now past
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,920	| IOT068 |	30 days it was supposed to be about the end of June
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:38,944	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:41,504	| IOT068 |	I felt like I'd wait a little while and
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,064	| IOT068 |	Before saying anything because you know things do take time
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,576	| IOT068 |	But
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,416	| IOT068 |	Clocks ticking clock is ticking
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,696	| IOT068 |	I have two of those and I
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:54,048	| IOT068 |	I'm kind of a little miffed that I bought these on this promise that so far hasn't been delivered
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,072	| IOT068 |	Maybe I should get a prorated
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,120	| IOT068 |	So there's something else the FTC
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,400	| IOT068 |	You can look at
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,448	| IOT068 |	And finally the White House
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,472	| IOT068 |	As part of the
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:01,984	| IOT068 |	Kind of
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,544	| IOT068 |	White standing bunch of investment
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,056	| IOT068 |	They have
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,640	| IOT068 |	Said they're investing in four hundred million dollars in
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,736	| IOT068 |	What does this mean exactly
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:19,648	| IOT068 |	It basically means that they're doing a bunch of initiatives through the advanced Wireless research initiative is part of the Nationals
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,672	| IOT068 |	Science Foundation
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,696	| IOT068 |	In 5G Network
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,232	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:25,792	| IOT068 |	It's not actually iot it's more than networks
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,816	| IOT068 |	Iot
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT068 |	But it's a lot of money
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,912	| IOT068 |	Question about or noting
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,704	| IOT068 |	Its and it's
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:37,056	| IOT068 |	Early days for five DMV that's becoming the buzzword I remember when the whole 4G thing hit
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:39,872	| IOT068 |	You know two years before we actually saw an implementation but
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,152	| IOT068 |	This exciting stuff
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:43,456	| IOT068 |	You know too much speed of a network
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,016	| IOT068 |	Interesting
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:52,160	| IOT068 |	The FCC last week said that they were going to give basically 1100 gigahertz of spectrum over to 5G
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:55,744	| IOT068 |	And when the FCC
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,280	| IOT068 |	All frequencies
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:01,632	| IOT068 |	A range of frequencies above 24 gigahertz
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:04,704	| IOT068 |	That's on the Spectrum chart that's going to way up there
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,472	| IOT068 |	That spectrum is
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:08,544	| IOT068 |	You know that's not going through walls very well
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:13,152	| IOT068 |	It's not great Spectrum but we've got a bunch of new technologies that make it a lot easier to use
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,688	| IOT068 |	Ardmore economic ice
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,248	| IOT068 |	So that's what the FCC
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:21,600	| IOT068 |	What do you Telecom guys talk about when they talk about 5G is actually
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,392	| IOT068 |	3gpp standard
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,928	| IOT068 |	Which is kind of like LTE
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,488	| IOT068 |	And what's interesting here is
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,024	| IOT068 |	5G isn't just about
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:31,328	| IOT068 |	Mobile broadband like LTE was
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,144	| IOT068 |	Angie is going to be about interfacing
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:39,008	| IOT068 |	Networks in the cloud together to deliver specific type of apps
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,312	| IOT068 |	So like there might be standards or
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,616	| IOT068 |	Protocols for connected cars
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:47,456	| IOT068 |	And then there might be a slice of the 5G Spectrum allocated to
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,480	| IOT068 |	Hospital
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,016	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,320	| IOT068 |	There's going to be a lot of interesting stuff here but
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,856	| IOT068 |	Until it gets a little bit
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| IOT068 |	More clear we're just going to have to wait
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:01,536	| IOT068 |	Before they close since you mentioned frequencies can I just make note of one
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,816	| IOT068 |	Interesting tidbit
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:05,120	| IOT068 |	O spectral stuff
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,424	| IOT068 |	Well not for long story
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,192	| IOT068 |	Do it
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:11,776	| IOT068 |	So I came across a very interesting article from Marco
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,848	| IOT068 |	Armand to is a iOS Developer pretty print iOS Developer
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,176	| IOT068 |	He was having problem with his cars Homelink transmitter
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:23,040	| IOT068 |	You would open the garage door but more often than not it would not close the garage door which is like
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:26,368	| IOT068 |	You pulling out of the driveway hit the button and why is the garage door
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,136	| IOT068 |	Closing
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,696	| IOT068 |	Well he did some digging and
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:31,488	| IOT068 |	Found out that
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| IOT068 |	Pierce
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:36,352	| IOT068 |	Issue had to do with a no-name LED light bulb in his garage door opener
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:43,264	| IOT068 |	The reason he found his Nabi saw an article that says government guidelines for Led manufacturers require these control circuit
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,800	| IOT068 |	Semi LEDs to operate
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:47,360	| IOT068 |	A frequencies between 30 and 300 megahertz
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,152	| IOT068 |	By coincidence
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,296	| IOT068 |	You know it's most rush or opener remotes have been assigned frequencies between 288 and 360 megahertz so
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:58,368	| IOT068 |	There may have been some crosstalk overlap there
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,952	| IOT068 |	Sure enough he took the No Name LED bulb output in an old incandescent
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,488	| IOT068 |	Problem solved
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:08,608	| IOT068 |	Which was kind of interested in condesa actually burned out later the same day but that's just a very funny site
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,168	| IOT068 |	Okay tell is it the No Name
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:14,240	| IOT068 |	LED bulbs like what a named LED bulb work better
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:20,128	| IOT068 |	Depends on yeah I guess it depends on testing what frequencies are using I don't I couldn't say for sure I mean
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,640	| IOT068 |	I would
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:24,992	| IOT068 |	It would be nice if he had put in some different brands of bulbs to find out
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:28,832	| IOT068 |	But he just said I want to sell my garage door problems original bulb
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,624	| IOT068 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| IOT068 |	Alright well I think
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:32,928	| IOT068 |	That's it for
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:33,952	| IOT068 |	Today Show
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,720	| IOT068 |	Please
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,536	| IOT068 |	Stay tuned for Adam Wolf the CEO of arable
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:40,608	| IOT068 |	As we talked about Precision farming and The Internet of Things
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:47,008	| IOT068 |	Hey this is Stacey Higginbotham breaking into the iot podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:51,616	| IOT068 |	Exactly which is a iot platform as a service
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,640	| IOT068 |	And we have
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,408	| IOT068 |	Patty
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,176	| IOT068 |	Sweetheart
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,736	| IOT068 |	Who is the GM exactly who to talk to
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:01,856	| IOT068 |	In the connected home space we're seeing a lot faster.
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,368	| IOT068 |	What's the Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,392	| IOT068 |	Why is that
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,184	| IOT068 |	Thank you Jay Z
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:11,584	| IOT068 |	I think the primary reason is that the users and the connected home segments are more willing than
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:14,144	| IOT068 |	Others to push the envelope and take risks
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:17,728	| IOT068 |	In order to get much better immersive experience
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:21,568	| IOT068 |	This typically leads to faster refresh Cycles in a connected home
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:25,152	| IOT068 |	Space where product Williams or manufacturers are
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:30,016	| IOT068 |	Innovating very rapidly even if they have to subsidize the hardware acquisition cost
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,296	| IOT068 |	2klab adoption
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:37,184	| IOT068 |	Think about it most of the products in the connected home space are still operating independently
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,720	| IOT068 |	So as much
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:41,024	| IOT068 |	Traction as we have already seen the space
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,048	| IOT068 |	Just getting started
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:44,352	| IOT068 |	What are some insights for the early adoption in the
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,960	| IOT068 |	Vacations from users have evolved very rapidly
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:51,264	| IOT068 |	Onboarding app experience
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,800	| IOT068 |	Service expectations
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:56,384	| IOT068 |	From users have dramatically changed over the last several years
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:00,736	| IOT068 |	The more successful connected-home members are the ones that fully Embrace this
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:05,088	| IOT068 |	And we strive to deliver delightful experiences and first class
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,368	| IOT068 |	Support for these
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,648	| IOT068 |	Connected Home Products
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:11,232	| IOT068 |	What is a Fast & Furious the time-to-market and time in Market
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:16,864	| IOT068 |	The best companies in the connected home and and even have the larger scope of the Enterprise segment
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,656	| IOT068 |	Don't waste their time
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,936	| IOT068 |	In the lab
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:22,752	| IOT068 |	Trying to build infrastructure and plumbing Technologies
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:27,616	| IOT068 |	But they tried to get to Market as quickly as possible so that they can learn from
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,664	| IOT068 |	Their products getting adopted
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,224	| IOT068 |	Rather than spending time building infrastructure
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,272	| IOT068 |	We tend to think about this as connect
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:36,064	| IOT068 |	The product management are the
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:40,416	| IOT068 |	Suite of applications that really enable East product Williams to get to Market
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,952	| IOT068 |	In the quickest possible time
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:45,280	| IOT068 |	All right how do you see the iot market transforming over the next
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:52,192	| IOT068 |	I strongly believe that in the next few years we will stop thinking about iot as a stand-alone phenomenon connectivity in physical
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:56,032	| IOT068 |	Products will soon become an expected part or
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,336	| IOT068 |	Unexpected feature of
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:04,736	| IOT068 |	Everyday products and customers will begin to expect iot functionality on anything and everything that has a scent
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:08,832	| IOT068 |	On off switch with this changing expectations from consumers
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:12,416	| IOT068 |	Connacht williamsville soon be able to deliver products
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,952	| IOT068 |	That allowed them to get
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:16,000	| IOT068 |	Much closer with their end customers
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| IOT068 |	I'll also give them
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:19,584	| IOT068 |	Valuable insights into how their products
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,888	| IOT068 |	Are being used and consumed
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,960	| IOT068 |	So that they can create and deploy new features
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:27,264	| IOT068 |	Instagram to their Hardware products
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:30,592	| IOT068 |	What should I call we deliver software over the internet today
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:35,456	| IOT068 |	Century all of this guy's back to product Williams having the capability to
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,504	| IOT068 |	Create new business models using their physic
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,808	| IOT068 |	Awesome and Patty
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,088	| IOT068 |	How can we find you

EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:26,144	| IOT068 |	Can you talk about kind of arable in that context
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,728	| IOT068 |	You're not as we
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,008	| IOT068 |	Started the
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,056	| IOT068 |	Company
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,592	| IOT068 |	From a lot of different
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,360	| IOT068 |	People
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,128	| IOT068 |	Drum
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,920	| IOT068 |	Crop insurance
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,456	| IOT068 |	People developing
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,504	| IOT068 |	Watermark at 2
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,784	| IOT068 |	People managing
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:45,600	| IOT068 |	Giftster and bonding and rely
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,648	| IOT068 |	What do all these people have
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:52,512	| IOT068 |	Is the day you need to know what's the difference between
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,560	| IOT068 |	What they thinking
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,352	| IOT068 |	True and what's actually true
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:58,144	| IOT068 |	What are the facts on the ground
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,704	| IOT068 |	Collecting data that
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,496	| IOT068 |	Really
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,288	| IOT068 |	The story of what's Happening
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,568	| IOT068 |	Plants
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,592	| IOT068 |	Prospective
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,616	| IOT068 |	And the weather
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,432	| IOT068 |	That is the key right here is part of your strategy
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:13,248	| IOT068 |	Not just data delivering
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:15,040	| IOT068 |	Inside let's talk about
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:19,136	| IOT068 |	Your sensor because you guys are launching a physical sensor
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,928	| IOT068 |	Why go physical Hardware
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,440	| IOT068 |	You're really real
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,768	| IOT068 |	Interesting
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,536	| IOT068 |	I got my
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,560	| IOT068 |	PhD
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:30,144	| IOT068 |	Stanford sponsored by NASA
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,168	| IOT068 |	Satellite data
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,448	| IOT068 |	Which means
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,776	| IOT068 |	I got complicated model of how plants work
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,824	| IOT068 |	And just like a weather forecast.
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,616	| IOT068 |	Constantly checking the
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:43,456	| IOT068 |	State the system again these observations in this case from saddle
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:44,736	| IOT068 |	So
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:48,064	| IOT068 |	I got to the end of that and I realized
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:48,832	| IOT068 |	The band
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:52,672	| IOT068 |	There's a lot of other stuff that you really want to know
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,952	| IOT068 |	Like what was the weather
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,744	| IOT068 |	What did the person plant
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,280	| IOT068 |	It also
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:57,792	| IOT068 |	Discerning
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,328	| IOT068 |	Coincidence
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,864	| IOT068 |	Set of data
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,888	| IOT068 |	Not just
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,168	| IOT068 |	State of the plant
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:04,960	| IOT068 |	Sound like
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| IOT068 |	The shape
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:13,664	| IOT068 |	Why is this plant growing faster here than this same plant over there
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,968	| IOT068 |	Not really required
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,736	| IOT068 |	Merging
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,784	| IOT068 |	Microclimate
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,296	| IOT068 |	And
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:20,576	| IOT068 |	Plants
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,344	| IOT068 |	Probation
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:22,880	| IOT068 |	Which is black
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:27,232	| IOT068 |	Okay it in our conversations before this you would talked about
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:29,792	| IOT068 |	Your business model and it is to
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:31,072	| IOT068 |	License
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,608	| IOT068 |	These pods two companies
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,656	| IOT068 |	And then you also have kind of a
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:40,800	| IOT068 |	Data analytics service I guess it's the best way to put it I'm not sure
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,104	| IOT068 |	And is
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:43,616	| IOT068 |	Really
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:47,712	| IOT068 |	Are North Stars around empowering people
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,480	| IOT068 |	To make
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,016	| IOT068 |	Decisions around
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,296	| IOT068 |	Natural res
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,368	| IOT068 |	Listen to company is not
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:55,904	| IOT068 |	Bounce
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,184	| IOT068 |	To this device
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,464	| IOT068 |	And yet
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,744	| IOT068 |	We knew
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,024	| IOT068 |	Because of
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:04,352	| IOT068 |	All of our prior work that this is a pinch point for us
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:11,008	| IOT068 |	They also discovered there's a pinch point for a lot of people that actual grounds
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,544	| IOT068 |	Focusing
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:15,104	| IOT068 |	On making a device
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,384	| IOT068 |	That is
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,920	| IOT068 |	Globally
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,432	| IOT068 |	Scalable
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,224	| IOT068 |	Pick one device
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,016	| IOT068 |	And it becomes mass-produced
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,576	| IOT068 |	Costco
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,880	| IOT068 |	Because
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,904	| IOT068 |	Vanishingly small
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:34,048	| IOT068 |	You know we have to look back at how we understand
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:39,168	| IOT068 |	In a really fairly marginal small holders
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,728	| IOT068 |	Outlander parts of the
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,008	| IOT068 |	Developing world
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,032	| IOT068 |	All the way up
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,824	| IOT068 |	Into the most Elites
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,360	| IOT068 |	Tulip farm
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,664	| IOT068 |	And raspberry producers
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,224	| IOT068 |	Well over $100,000
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,528	| IOT068 |	Break all of these rely
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,064	| IOT068 |	You can use data
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,344	| IOT068 |	Gods
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,624	| IOT068 |	The value-add
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,416	| IOT068 |	Crothall beans
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:02,208	| IOT068 |	Parts of agriculture
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,280	| IOT068 |	So how would it
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,304	| IOT068 |	BBA
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,608	| IOT068 |	Giant soybean
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:13,472	| IOT068 |	Grower use your stop which I'm assuming is kind of a lower value crop
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:16,288	| IOT068 |	Versus someone who's making raspberries
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,592	| IOT068 |	The challenge
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:20,640	| IOT068 |	Or start up like orange
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,944	| IOT068 |	Is really to recognize the
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,760	| IOT068 |	Midwest is bad
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,552	| IOT068 |	The Ukraine is Basque
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:30,624	| IOT068 |	All the places where they grow commodity
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:31,648	| IOT068 |	Crocs
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,464	| IOT068 |	Are extremely expensive
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:40,096	| IOT068 |	You know I'll send it has to be said that when commodity prices are depressed
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,168	| IOT068 |	Money into
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,960	| IOT068 |	Uncertain value
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:48,544	| IOT068 |	Is the investment in this piece of Hardware really going to
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,312	| IOT068 |	Unlock
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:52,384	| IOT068 |	What they need to be unlocking until
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:54,432	| IOT068 |	Really the path to Market is
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,200	| IOT068 |	The work
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,224	| IOT068 |	West the
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:34:02,880	| IOT068 |	Agricultural service providers that are already in those fields working with left they profit by
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,464	| IOT068 |	Where the crop advisors
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:08,256	| IOT068 |	They are
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,560	| IOT068 |	Like the tech support in many ways
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT068 |	That's the person
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:14,912	| IOT068 |	Who can really look at the data
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,192	| IOT068 |	Say okay
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:18,752	| IOT068 |	We're going to change our plans we're not going to be
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:19,520	| IOT068 |	Here today
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:22,848	| IOT068 |	We're going to have to put off till next week after this Halestorm
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:26,176	| IOT068 |	So in that case you don't tell directly to the farmers you're going to sell
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,736	| IOT068 |	Agricultural service
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,040	| IOT068 |	Yes exactly
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:34,368	| IOT068 |	And it's time to do a couple things that I think other businesses can
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,392	| IOT068 |	Take something away from
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:36,672	| IOT068 |	Which is
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:40,256	| IOT068 |	You guys have recognized that the data that you're Gathering
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,048	| IOT068 |	It's not the be-all end-all
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:44,864	| IOT068 |	Is the insights in the ability to help a company
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,376	| IOT068 |	Kind of offer
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,912	| IOT068 |	Risk management
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:51,776	| IOT068 |	And you also realize that the people you benefit may not be your actual End customer
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| IOT068 |	Because
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,080	| IOT068 |	They may not have
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,360	| IOT068 |	Either the income
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:58,176	| IOT068 |	The sophistication
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,968	| IOT068 |	So kind of what you guys are trying to offer
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:03,552	| IOT068 |	So I'd love to kind of understand how you
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:06,368	| IOT068 |	Figured this out because it's a hard thing for
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| IOT068 |	Businesses were like
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,672	| IOT068 |	Hey
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:09,952	| IOT068 |	We should totally connect
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:11,488	| IOT068 |	You know and get data from
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:13,536	| IOT068 |	This particular aspect of our world and then
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,072	| IOT068 |	Try to sell that
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:16,864	| IOT068 |	So how did you kind of
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,632	| IOT068 |	Get to this point
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,192	| IOT068 |	It starts with a lot of list
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:22,496	| IOT068 |	And it's
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| IOT068 |	Somebody
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,544	| IOT068 |	I don't pop out
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,080	| IOT068 |	You're talking about something
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,872	| IOT068 |	Then
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:28,896	| IOT068 |	You're not solving
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,712	| IOT068 |	Often times
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,736	| IOT068 |	Let's say
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,504	| IOT068 |	California
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:35,552	| IOT068 |	That would be the widespread for
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,064	| IOT068 |	Perception
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,112	| IOT068 |	Farmers
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:38,624	| IOT068 |	AR
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:42,464	| IOT068 |	Experiencing a pain Point around irrigation management
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:48,096	| IOT068 |	And you might take a technology about this is measuring
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:51,936	| IOT068 |	Wishing you would want to measure
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:57,056	| IOT068 |	And yeah if you talk to the farmer's day like I've got
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:36:00,384	| IOT068 |	A magic sensor that will tell you when to water
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,664	| IOT068 |	They roll their eyes
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:06,784	| IOT068 |	Now that's a I'll call you might be the 10th person through my door that does that
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:09,344	| IOT068 |	To be honest we've got a guy who does that
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,880	| IOT068 |	China weekly schedule
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,160	| IOT068 |	It's not
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,440	| IOT068 |	Like a plan
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:18,560	| IOT068 |	But if you go to that same person
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,400	| IOT068 |	Yul destination crop forecasting
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,192	| IOT068 |	Or
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:26,240	| IOT068 |	Decisions about marketing
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,520	| IOT068 |	Their eyes pop out
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:30,592	| IOT068 |	So what does that mean to like somebody who is not a friend
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:32,384	| IOT068 |	It's like how many berries are in the field
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,432	| IOT068 |	Whataburger
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:39,552	| IOT068 |	Absolutely how many berries in the field or another customers how many
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,576	| IOT068 |	All right with you
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:44,928	| IOT068 |	Isn't interested the used taste around lettuce production in the UK
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:48,512	| IOT068 |	Just a couple days different in the face
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:53,120	| IOT068 |	Makes a big difference on where we saw
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,632	| IOT068 |	But what
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:56,704	| IOT068 |	So you could tell me if I were a UK lettuce farmer
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,472	| IOT068 |	Are you can say
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,240	| IOT068 |	Hey
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:03,104	| IOT068 |	It's going to rain tomorrow so you should Harvest today or do you instead tell me
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:08,992	| IOT068 |	Hey this field got rained on so if you can hold it for two more days it'll dry out and then it'll have a longer shelf life
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:10,784	| IOT068 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,320	| IOT068 |	Both of those or
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:15,136	| IOT068 |	You know we control remotely
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:20,256	| IOT068 |	Because we are measuring a particular set of set of parameters
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:24,096	| IOT068 |	Elephants have condensation
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,144	| IOT068 |	It's a. Might say okay
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,424	| IOT068 |	This you have to sell
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:31,008	| IOT068 |	At your local market but this you can not ship to Spain
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:33,568	| IOT068 |	Okay that's useful
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,360	| IOT068 |	So who are your customers
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:38,944	| IOT068 |	Challenge
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,224	| IOT068 |	The demand
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:43,040	| IOT068 |	The expressions of Interest ranging from
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,088	| IOT068 |	Very large
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,624	| IOT068 |	Midwestern
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:48,928	| IOT068 |	Companies serving commodity agriculture
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,976	| IOT068 |	Two especially
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,000	| IOT068 |	Specialty crops
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,536	| IOT068 |	Producers
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:57,120	| IOT068 |	These folks that often. Grower-shipper said they grow it but they also
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:57,632	| IOT068 |	Marketing
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:58,912	| IOT068 |	Insurance
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,448	| IOT068 |	Is a
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,728	| IOT068 |	As a gigantic interest
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:04,544	| IOT068 |	Especially in the developing world
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:09,664	| IOT068 |	There's this obstacle to ensuring it which is valid a claim
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,456	| IOT068 |	Even price risk
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,504	| IOT068 |	So we have to look at
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,040	| IOT068 |	Global Entry
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,320	| IOT068 |	And right now we're just
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,856	| IOT068 |	Very carefully
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,880	| IOT068 |	Choosing
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,672	| IOT068 |	People that we want to go eat with
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:25,536	| IOT068 |	Sure so in the case of an insurance firm would they compel the farmers
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:27,584	| IOT068 |	How to put the sensors in the field
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:31,424	| IOT068 |	And they would be your customer and by the hardware from you
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:35,776	| IOT068 |	And then also the kind of data analytics that come from that Hardware
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:38,080	| IOT068 |	The exact business model is not in
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,360	| IOT068 |	Byerly worked out
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:45,504	| IOT068 |	You're not a participation by the lights of a ID or the World Bank
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:46,528	| IOT068 |	Temple
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:50,624	| IOT068 |	Is East African or even Central African
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,416	| IOT068 |	Maize production
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,184	| IOT068 |	Farmers
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:55,232	| IOT068 |	Can achieve much better deal
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,792	| IOT068 |	If they use improved seeds
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,584	| IOT068 |	In fertilizer
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,632	| IOT068 |	Insurance
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:02,912	| IOT068 |	What place
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,704	| IOT068 |	That bag of grain
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,008	| IOT068 |	Farmers afraid that if he buys it
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:10,336	| IOT068 |	And put that out and loses the crop to some of them
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:11,616	| IOT068 |	That
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:12,896	| IOT068 |	They're not just
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:15,456	| IOT068 |	You know hungry but they also lost
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,808	| IOT068 |	Will replace that bag of seeds
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,624	| IOT068 |	But in order to do this we need
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,416	| IOT068 |	To be able to validate
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:24,928	| IOT068 |	Claims
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:29,024	| IOT068 |	A1 device / Village
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:32,352	| IOT068 |	Okay see you get a bag of seeds from your insurance
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,912	| IOT068 |	What's this device and then
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,704	| IOT068 |	They ensure that
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:40,032	| IOT068 |	Crop because they've got a way to kind of
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,336	| IOT068 |	Control in as much as one can
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:44,128	| IOT068 |	Against the loss of
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,176	| IOT068 |	Ensure
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:51,552	| IOT068 |	Take the last time you did auto insurance or life insurance
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:56,160	| IOT068 |	Current history may be William to school
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:57,184	| IOT068 |	Your mortgage on time

EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:04,352	| IOT068 |	So what's interesting now is that once we have devices in
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:08,192	| IOT068 |	Waze
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,240	| IOT068 |	To reach out
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:11,264	| IOT068 |	Apartments with advice
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,312	| IOT068 |	Make sure
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,848	| IOT068 |	Good day at Sea the best out
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:15,872	| IOT068 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,152	| IOT068 |	In what
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,688	| IOT068 |	Look ahead 3 years
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,456	| IOT068 |	Into
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:20,224	| IOT068 |	Farming
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,248	| IOT068 |	As you guys
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:22,784	| IOT068 |	Expand
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:23,552	| IOT068 |	Totally
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:26,368	| IOT068 |	And as Precision agriculture becomes more
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:28,928	| IOT068 |	Accepted how does that change the way we
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,488	| IOT068 |	Really
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,792	| IOT068 |	Interesting question we
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:35,584	| IOT068 |	Started tracing
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,352	| IOT068 |	Really
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:37,632	| IOT068 |	Measurements
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:40,960	| IOT068 |	From Farm to Table my wife is a is a chef
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,008	| IOT068 |	You know she said she worked at
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:45,824	| IOT068 |	Some famous restaurants in California where
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:47,360	| IOT068 |	The ideal
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,640	| IOT068 |	Was really having a row
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,688	| IOT068 |	Ship with the farmer
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,968	| IOT068 |	And dessert
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,736	| IOT068 |	Thirty-One perfect
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:55,552	| IOT068 |	God let's look at
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,320	| IOT068 |	The date
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,672	| IOT068 |	There's many opportunities when this came to us on Friday
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,696	| IOT068 |	Where
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:03,744	| IOT068 |	Chastity excited to look at the
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:04,512	| IOT068 |	Brix level
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:08,352	| IOT068 |	Sherpa measure of the flavor and quality of produce
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:13,472	| IOT068 |	Where farmers are able to provide information
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,496	| IOT068 |	That lets them
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:17,312	| IOT068 |	Claim additional Revenue
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,080	| IOT068 |	About
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,896	| IOT068 |	Having more sustainable practices are higher quality
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:23,968	| IOT068 |	Potentially reaching
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,504	| IOT068 |	More local markets
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:26,784	| IOT068 |	And so there's a
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:29,600	| IOT068 |	Platinum value around
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:33,184	| IOT068 |	Deeper connectivity between
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,720	| IOT068 |	The plate in the field
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,488	| IOT068 |	Dieting

EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:51,616	| IOT068 |	And it would be wonderful to be able to recreate that kind
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:53,407	| IOT068 |	And make it come
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,967	| IOT068 |	I mean I have memories that are
