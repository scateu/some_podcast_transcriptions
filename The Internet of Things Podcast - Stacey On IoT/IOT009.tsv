EDL	00:00:07,680	00:00:09,984	| IOT009 |	Hey everybody welcome back
EDL	00:00:09,984	00:00:12,544	| IOT009 |	This is the Internet of Things podcast did I am your host
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:13,568	| IOT009 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,568	00:00:14,848	| IOT009 |	And here is your
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:15,872	| IOT009 |	Excellent co-host
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:17,408	| IOT009 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:18,432	| IOT009 |	And this week
EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:21,248	| IOT009 |	We are getting a started with some big news for
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:23,040	| IOT009 |	Google IO
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:25,856	| IOT009 |	Which is Google's big developers Conference held in California
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:27,136	| IOT009 |	Kevin
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:28,672	| IOT009 |	What do we have
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:29,696	| IOT009 |	Google sleeve this week
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:37,120	| IOT009 |	A whole lot of stuff Google typically unveils its latest and greatest version of Android which I'm sure it will do
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:39,680	| IOT009 |	I don't think I'll actually launch it that usually
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:41,216	| IOT009 |	Show it off and then watch in the fall
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:44,800	| IOT009 |	More important to the show though is Tok
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:46,080	| IOT009 |	Google
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:48,384	| IOT009 |	Connecting all the things with
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:49,152	| IOT009 |	Brillo
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:53,248	| IOT009 |	This is an android-based platform for the internet of things so
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:58,112	| IOT009 |	I would anticipate this to be a keynote announcement the keynote is on Thursday this week
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:05,024	| IOT009 |	Curious to see what they're doing seems to be a light version of Android my guess is like the communications and
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:06,304	| IOT009 |	Notification stack
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:09,120	| IOT009 |	And it would run on really light Hardware
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:10,400	| IOT009 |	So
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:11,424	| IOT009 |	We'll have to see
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:12,448	| IOT009 |	The funny thing is
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:14,240	| IOT009 |	Do you remember Stacy that
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:17,824	| IOT009 |	Google did something similar back in 2011 call Android at home
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:19,104	| IOT009 |	I do and
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:20,896	| IOT009 |	It looks like of the people
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:21,920	| IOT009 |	Who are still at
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:25,760	| IOT009 |	Google who used to work on Android at home I think some of those guys are still working on this
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,064	| IOT009 |	That could be because Andrea at home
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:31,648	| IOT009 |	In my opinion is generally a flop nothing really came of that and I
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:35,744	| IOT009 |	That was more of the timing you know I don't think IRT was
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:41,888	| IOT009 |	Getting to be close to mainstream then we talked about on the last show is only just now really starting to go mainstream and
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,168	| IOT009 |	I just think was ahead of its
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:46,496	| IOT009 |	Time even I mean even devices like Fitbit weren't even
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:47,776	| IOT009 |	Coming out
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:51,616	| IOT009 |	Until like 2012 I think is when we first started
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,664	| IOT009 |	I first started writing about
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:55,456	| IOT009 |	Connected devices in
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,760	| IOT009 |	CES 2012 I want to say
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,064	| IOT009 |	I was probably pretty early
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,368	| IOT009 |	I mean there were still connected devices
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:03,392	| IOT009 |	But people weren't like
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,184	| IOT009 |	Let's connect all the things
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:10,048	| IOT009 |	I believe in October of 2013 or maybe
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:12,096	| IOT009 |	Yeah I think it was like that's about right
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,120	| IOT009 |	20
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:21,056	| IOT009 |	Indeed it for years makes a big difference I mean just in terms of mainstream awareness of connected things
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,896	| IOT009 |	The fact that we've got much better Hardware that's low power and looks
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:27,456	| IOT009 |	Kind of getting some consolidation and
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,272	| IOT009 |	New agreement and what radios and protocols to use it
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,320	| IOT009 |	So I guess I think it was ahead of its time but
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,112	| IOT009 |	It doesn't matter now mean that that's
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| IOT009 |	The Meandering home as a daughter
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,416	| IOT009 |	It's now
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| IOT009 |	Going to be a presumably Brillo
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,000	| IOT009 |	You know
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:44,096	| IOT009 |	Scratch yes this is going to battle Apple's homekit platform in Samsung tizen
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,376	| IOT009 |	Well
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,912	| IOT009 |	So there's some things to know about
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT009 |	1 is
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,728	| IOT009 |	Michaels
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,032	| IOT009 |	Who is a smart home analyst
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,104	| IOT009 |	Has talked to people in the know it
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,920	| IOT009 |	Google and he says that the guy in charge of all this
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,456	| IOT009 |	Is Venom Craig Barrett
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,528	| IOT009 |	Who is Intel's Craig Barrett but
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,808	| IOT009 |	Craig Barrett who is
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:06,624	| IOT009 |	It's the former CEO of atheros which was a Wi-Fi chip
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,416	| IOT009 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,208	| IOT009 |	And so
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,744	| IOT009 |	He's been at Google since 2013
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,072	| IOT009 |	Apparently Google has been talking to
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,864	| IOT009 |	Router makers to try to
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| IOT009 |	Get
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| IOT009 |	Grillo
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:19,936	| IOT009 |	Installed into kind of
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,240	| IOT009 |	Routers and what they're looking for is
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,032	| IOT009 |	What's called a real time operating
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,544	| IOT009 |	System
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,104	| IOT009 |	And it looks like this wouldn't be like a super
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:28,896	| IOT009 |	Blowing
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,944	| IOT009 |	Artist butt
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,712	| IOT009 |	Something
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| IOT009 |	That would run
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:33,760	| IOT009 |	On a router
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,296	| IOT009 |	Andon device
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,576	| IOT009 |	Surround the home so they
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,112	| IOT009 |	That you wouldn't need a Smart Hub
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,624	| IOT009 |	Basically
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,672	| IOT009 |	We talked about the
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,976	| IOT009 |	Listen to past but the idea of getting rid of the
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:43,744	| IOT009 |	Hub is just
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| IOT009 |	Crate
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,816	| IOT009 |	I would love not to have an extra
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,584	| IOT009 |	Device plugged in
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| IOT009 |	Is my router
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,656	| IOT009 |	Or devices if you need multiple hubs
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,168	| IOT009 |	Exactly
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,960	| IOT009 |	The other important thing
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,008	| IOT009 |	Cure that we should note is
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,568	| IOT009 |	Google is getting behind
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:03:59,872	| IOT009 |	Craig
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,176	| IOT009 |	Possible that Google is getting behind Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,224	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,760	| IOT009 |	Read Because nest
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,784	| IOT009 |	Which is owned by Coke
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,576	| IOT009 |	Is a big proponent
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,088	| IOT009 |	Of
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,136	| IOT009 |	Red
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,696	| IOT009 |	Which is a wireless protocol based on
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,232	| IOT009 |	B
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| IOT009 |	802.
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,047	| IOT009 |	14
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:19,839	| IOT009 |	Turn it off
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,423	| IOT009 |	Which we're getting all radio wonky but basically it's the same
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:26,495	| IOT009 |	Radio that also power is zigbee
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,799	| IOT009 |	Sydney's just a different type of software that's running on top of
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:30,847	| IOT009 |	So
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:38,015	| IOT009 |	What we can take from this is like things like Z-Wave and zigbee are kind of getting left out of the newer generation of
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,343	| IOT009 |	Kind of connected Home Products because if you look at it
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,391	| IOT009 |	Google stream with Brillo
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| IOT009 |	Ask Abby wifi-based
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| IOT009 |	Probably
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,487	| IOT009 |	Probably Wi-Fi baby Bluetooth
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,023	| IOT009 |	Or Wi-Fi and thread
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:54,399	| IOT009 |	And then you got Apple which is doing homekit around Wi-Fi and probably
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:54,911	| IOT009 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:05:01,055	| IOT009 |	So nosy be nosy wave I'm not going to say I told you so
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,359	| IOT009 |	Wait a second.
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,151	| IOT009 |	Okay well
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:05,663	| IOT009 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,527	| IOT009 |	I don't I don't think these are going to go away
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,063	| IOT009 |	I agree
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,343	| IOT009 |	Yes there
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,671	| IOT009 |	Is somebody I think was Alex Hawkinson the president
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:20,255	| IOT009 |	SmartThings the CEO of SmartThings this was bought by Samsung
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,047	| IOT009 |	He called those he's
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,327	| IOT009 |	Psych gathers Our Kind of legacy
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,607	| IOT009 |	Protocols
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,911	| IOT009 |	They're at their old school dinosaur
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,775	| IOT009 |	The problem is now that we're getting too mainstream awareness of this Market
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,311	| IOT009 |	Those are not
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:37,151	| IOT009 |	Mainstream known protocols and radios Wi-Fi that's ubiquitous
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,199	| IOT009 |	Best Bluetooth most people even get that
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,991	| IOT009 |	I think that had a lot to do with this
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,319	| IOT009 |	I agree now threads going to be a tough sell
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,111	| IOT009 |	Totally new
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,159	| IOT009 |	And to make matters worse
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,207	| IOT009 |	Or maybe it'll make it better
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:53,023	| IOT009 |	Zigbee and thread have done this kind of co-marketing agreement
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,815	| IOT009 |	Barcode software
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,839	| IOT009 |	Agreement where they're going to
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,631	| IOT009 |	You're going to be able to develop
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,215	| IOT009 |	Red stuff will work on certain zigbee flat
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:06,847	| IOT009 |	That'll be kind of interesting going forward so maybe it's only a Z-Wave that gets left on
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT009 |	Kohl's
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,431	| IOT009 |	Yeah it's it's hard to say that
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:14,015	| IOT009 |	Give me know we're seeing consolidation here and then the approaches
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:18,367	| IOT009 |	I think it's also worth noting in in Michaels piece that according to what he's found out
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:22,207	| IOT009 |	Brillo is not part of 20 Fidel's Group which is the nest group
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| IOT009 |	Over at
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,743	| IOT009 |	Google
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,535	| IOT009 |	And that's actually something that I
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| IOT009 |	Had talked to my sources about
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,399	| IOT009 |	In in discovering what Google is doing
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,679	| IOT009 |	Along with
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,727	| IOT009 |	Mike I have actually heard the same thing
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,287	| IOT009 |	But not part of nest
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,847	| IOT009 |	That's a little surprising to me
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,407	| IOT009 |	I don't think so because
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:47,807	| IOT009 |	Google has made it very clear rather than S guys have made it very clear that they're not part of Google and I think that's probably a
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT009 |	Wise move because
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,903	| IOT009 |	Google is known for vacuuming up tons of data
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| IOT009 |	Nest guys
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:58,047	| IOT009 |	Have the potential to vacuum a lot of data
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,583	| IOT009 |	And it's from your home and so
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:03,167	| IOT009 |	I can see the the need to keep those two kind of entity separate
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,215	| IOT009 |	I will also say though
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,495	| IOT009 |	That
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,311	| IOT009 |	Google fi pushing Wi-Fi and pushing the
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,591	| IOT009 |	Kind of
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,895	| IOT009 |	Operating system on devices
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,223	| IOT009 |	Especially if it's an IPv6 or like
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,783	| IOT009 |	Thread based in wifi-based
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,063	| IOT009 |	That's straight to the cloud
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,903	| IOT009 |	It doesn't have to go through any other device
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,951	| IOT009 |	That's a very Google Centric
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:29,023	| IOT009 |	Approach because it will send data from the device straight to the cloud
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:31,583	| IOT009 |	And they're huge fans of that
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,375	| IOT009 |	That because that gives them the ability to get
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:33,887	| IOT009 |	Get as much data
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,727	| IOT009 |	And that is their standard operating procedure I mean that's
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:41,567	| IOT009 |	Their whole Revenue stream is pretty much built upon that taking that data
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| IOT009 |	And then delivering contextual ads
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,943	| IOT009 |	I don't think we're going to see ads on her door lock
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:49,247	| IOT009 |	But I do know no but
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,319	| IOT009 |	But it's all tied to your Google account.
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:56,927	| IOT009 |	The tie that binds everything together so my while you won't see ads on your door locked
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,743	| IOT009 |	If another could be information gathered by the door lock that
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,583	| IOT009 |	Put an ad relevant ad on your phone the next time you do a Google search
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,863	| IOT009 |	I think
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,423	| IOT009 |	More likely what we're going to see is
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,495	| IOT009 |	Google selling more context about you
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,079	| IOT009 |	Or Google providing services that you'll eventually
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,591	| IOT009 |	Pay for
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,639	| IOT009 |	Based on the data they have
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,151	| IOT009 |	About you
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,991	| IOT009 |	I don't think that it's going to be as simple as
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,015	| IOT009 |	Ads based on
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:25,087	| IOT009 |	Oru home during these hours of the day here some demographic
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,599	| IOT009 |	High-profile
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,135	| IOT009 |	Yeah that's a fair point
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| IOT009 |	I think it'll be a little bit more in
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,207	| IOT009 |	God I hope
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:35,839	| IOT009 |	Otherwise you know cuz this gets into things like
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,863	| IOT009 |	You know how you can't
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,655	| IOT009 |	There's there's laws in Play Store
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,935	| IOT009 |	Protect children on the internet
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| IOT009 |	Right
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| IOT009 |	Advertising
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,519	| IOT009 |	So if your 13
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,567	| IOT009 |	You can't collect certain data about children
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,871	| IOT009 |	When the home there's a
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,943	| IOT009 |	There's no guarantees that you know you're not collecting data
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| IOT009 |	About a child
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,247	| IOT009 |	Who's coming into the house
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| IOT009 |	Right
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,319	| IOT009 |	You can't use that data for Mark
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:04,255	| IOT009 |	You mean you really don't want to walk up to your front door forget your keypad number and all that and instead just watch a 30 second video app
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| IOT009 |	Add to get in your house tonight
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:10,399	| IOT009 |	You know yesterday it was yesterday that they were tornadoes so I guess they know
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,167	| IOT009 |	Okay now
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| IOT009 |	No
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| IOT009 |	Please Google no
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,519	| IOT009 |	New doorbell app
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,079	| IOT009 |	The Wizard of Oz it's on
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| IOT009 |	Tonight at 8
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,431	| IOT009 |	Google well that's contextual it is context
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,735	| IOT009 |	All right
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:32,927	| IOT009 |	Let's go to the next piece of news that I thought was actually really good for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:38,303	| IOT009 |	And that is alarm.com on Friday filed to go public
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:41,375	| IOT009 |	I filed a raised 75 million through an initial public offering
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,655	| IOT009 |	Which
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,007	| IOT009 |	Significant for the smart home space because alarm.com
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,055	| IOT009 |	Says that it is the largest
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,823	| IOT009 |	Company
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,591	| IOT009 |	In this space
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,407	| IOT009 |	I don't know if I believe that
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:53,919	| IOT009 |	But
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,831	| IOT009 |	I mean I don't know either but you know I'm looking at the peace that you wrote and
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:04,415	| IOT009 |	They're saying or telling you that they've got 2.3 million subscribers
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| IOT009 |	You're telling me a sec.
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| IOT009 |	I think they can lie to me but
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:10,815	| IOT009 |	TCU getting
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:14,143	| IOT009 |	So alarm.com for those of you guys who don't know
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,935	| IOT009 |	Started out in 2000's
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| IOT009 |	Security
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:21,567	| IOT009 |	And they could Abridged into the selling home automation just like all the other
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,127	| IOT009 |	But many of the other companies
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,455	| IOT009 |	And what I found most interesting in there
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| IOT009 |	Their s-1 filing
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,295	| IOT009 |	Was a that they're profitable
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,599	| IOT009 |	They're actually doing
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,439	| IOT009 |	Pretty well for themselves they've grown significantly they reported 167
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| IOT009 |	1.3 million in Revenue last year
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:43,071	| IOT009 |	The net income of 563000
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,095	| IOT009 |	And they're growing
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,399	| IOT009 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,215	| IOT009 |	Not sure how long that growth is going to last
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,287	| IOT009 |	They have this amazing churn rate
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:52,799	| IOT009 |	Which is
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| IOT009 |	The amount of
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| IOT009 |	Customers that
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,383	| IOT009 |	Renew
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,663	| IOT009 |	Service
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:02,527	| IOT009 |	Edit set the 93 to 94% of their customers renew each year
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,855	| IOT009 |	Their customer service provider
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,927	| IOT009 |	Oh not end-users
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:13,023	| IOT009 |	State the 2.3 million subscribers that they say they have are the end users
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,351	| IOT009 |	And those end users are locked into
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| IOT009 |	The three to five-year contracts
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:18,911	| IOT009 |	Service provider
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:25,567	| IOT009 |	And that makes sense because typically they will subsidize the equipment for the house and installation with the long-term country
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,615	| IOT009 |	So yes
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,431	| IOT009 |	But what actually happens at alarm.com cases
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| IOT009 |	Buy the equipment
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:38,367	| IOT009 |	They sell to the service provider the monitoring software
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| IOT009 |	On an annual basis
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:43,231	| IOT009 |	So what I would be looking for is
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,303	| IOT009 |	Maybe next year and the year after that is for that
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,351	| IOT009 |	Keep an eye on their turn figures
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,375	| IOT009 |	Because I suspect
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,935	| IOT009 |	SOS three to five-year contracts
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:55,007	| IOT009 |	Come up the end customers are going to probably look
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| IOT009 |	Like
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:59,615	| IOT009 |	Maybe alternative Solutions out there maybe DIY do-it-yourself do-it-yourself
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,127	| IOT009 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,455	| IOT009 |	Even like ADT just
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| IOT009 |	Launch they haven't
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,759	| IOT009 |	Stay there now
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,319	| IOT009 |	They haven't actually launched a new all-in-one
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| IOT009 |	Kind of security box
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:10,879	| IOT009 |	Camera
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:11,903	| IOT009 |	Sensor
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,695	| IOT009 |	Package thing but
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| IOT009 |	I think that's kind of a
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,255	| IOT009 |	Wave of the future
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,071	| IOT009 |	We'll see
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:23,935	| IOT009 |	Yeah I think you're spot on Watch the watch to see who renews after those three
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,727	| IOT009 |	Three to five-year contracts are up
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:29,055	| IOT009 |	Because they're just going to so many more choices everything will be cheaper
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:34,687	| IOT009 |	And you probably be confident enough and the device will be simple enough that you can do it yourself
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:39,039	| IOT009 |	Sure especially depending on what Google and apple lunch this summer
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,831	| IOT009 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,599	| IOT009 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,391	| IOT009 |	And let's see we've got some cool
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:47,231	| IOT009 |	How to say we got some cool back to school things for you
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,535	| IOT009 |	Kevin you saw a fun project
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| IOT009 |	Kickstarter did you want to talk.
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:55,679	| IOT009 |	Now I think this is perfect for a back-to-school little gift for your ear
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,471	| IOT009 |	Curious child
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:02,335	| IOT009 |	I mean kickstarter's got tons of stuff that mean you could sit there all day and look at their projects with this particular one
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,871	| IOT009 |	Caught my eye
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,175	| IOT009 |	It's the microduino mcookie
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,991	| IOT009 |	They are small electronic modules that are
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,527	| IOT009 |	Compatible with the Legos of all things
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,831	| IOT009 |	So think of Arduino
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:16,671	| IOT009 |	But being in a smaller package and Metcalf
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| IOT009 |	Be connected to Legos you can like
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:22,303	| IOT009 |	Make stacks of different devices you can link build your a little devices with Legos
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,583	| IOT009 |	And get them smarts
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,607	| IOT009 |	With the microduino
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:27,423	| IOT009 |	Income just double check with the
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:30,239	| IOT009 |	Delivery time is July so that's why I said back to
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:30,751	| IOT009 |	School
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:37,407	| IOT009 |	The initial early birds are all gone but here's what you would have gotten them you can still get it you're going to cost a little more
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:43,295	| IOT009 |	For $68 you got the mcookie 101 basic kit which was 4 modules and six sensors
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,087	| IOT009 |	Along with a bunch of instructions in the
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:49,183	| IOT009 |	LED microphone that lights up a Bluetooth Bluetooth controlled LED
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:54,815	| IOT009 |	Turn the little projects you can make with us I just love the idea for this for
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,607	| IOT009 |	You know again inquisitive kids
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:59,423	| IOT009 |	And it's it's actually so if you didn't catch
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:13:59,935	| IOT009 |	What's the
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| IOT009 |	The $68 it's only 70
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,031	| IOT009 |	That's reasonable
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,591	| IOT009 |	I mean
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,103	| IOT009 |	I paid
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:12,991	| IOT009 |	I think 35 for my Arduino and I can't play with Legos and my dunno at the same time so right there that's a bonus
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,295	| IOT009 |	There you go in the fatter kits
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,111	| IOT009 |	There's there's one for $150
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| IOT009 |	It's at 1:40
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:23,743	| IOT009 |	But that's the advanced kit and that gives you 8 modules 13 sensors
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,535	| IOT009 |	And a whole bunch of other accessories
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:28,351	| IOT009 |	And you can make things like a music box
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,119	| IOT009 |	Situation
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,399	| IOT009 |	Electronic puppy
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:31,935	| IOT009 |	That would be so cool
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| IOT009 |	Yeah they have to go outside no that's good
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,079	| IOT009 |	Exactly
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,431	| IOT009 |	And you know the who the $258 kit
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,711	| IOT009 |	Get you a weather station
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:45,759	| IOT009 |	You can make a weather station or time lapse
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,271	| IOT009 |	Photography
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,343	| IOT009 |	Okay for that cause I'm thinking that's a Christmas gift
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:53,183	| IOT009 |	Well okay or you know it's science
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,207	| IOT009 |	I know I know
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,767	| IOT009 |	So that the closest analogue to this I would say
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:58,815	| IOT009 |	Choke there
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,095	| IOT009 |	Is little bit
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:03,935	| IOT009 |	It is very much reminded me of little bits but I don't think my little bits are compatible
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,703	| IOT009 |	I was like I was in
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:09,567	| IOT009 |	So if you're if you're missing your little bits and you really want to stick them with Legos
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,335	| IOT009 |	This is
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,359	| IOT009 |	A great kind of fun
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:18,015	| IOT009 |	Little cookies little stackable Lego cookies for everything there's an NFC thing or zigbee
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,807	| IOT009 |	You can have Wi-Fi you can add
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,135	| IOT009 |	GSM cellular capabilities
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:25,695	| IOT009 |	For crying out loud there's tons of different modules here
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:32,095	| IOT009 |	Oh yeah and you don't we actually of use the little bits in the cloud bit sensor to make like iot devices for a house and we tie
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,887	| IOT009 |	Tie them together through is this and that
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,655	| IOT009 |	Weather like
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT009 |	Will make like a
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,727	| IOT009 |	Pressure sensor or something else
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,311	| IOT009 |	This sort of thing is a really fun way if you have a
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,359	| IOT009 |	Kid or maybe you're just
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| IOT009 |	Not
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,407	| IOT009 |	Totally comfortable
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:52,575	| IOT009 |	Building on your own like with sensors you can get something like this and you can make your own light connected doorbell or you
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,087	| IOT009 |	You can make your own
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,135	| IOT009 |	Motion sensor in
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:16:01,279	| IOT009 |	You can kind of start to have fun building exactly what you need for the scenario you're envisioning for
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:01,791	| IOT009 |	Are your Smart House
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:07,679	| IOT009 |	That's the key you got all the different building blocks with the sensors modules and everything else you need
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| IOT009 |	Annies
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,751	| IOT009 |	Chet's obviously you pay more to get more modules and such
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:16,639	| IOT009 |	I look at the two or $300 LEGO Mindstorms robotics kit that I bought a couple years back
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,175	| IOT009 |	It's really cool as well
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,199	| IOT009 |	And it's Legos
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,711	| IOT009 |	But
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,783	| IOT009 |	The very few sensors that it really comes with
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,111	| IOT009 |	Universe has a wide range for Whiting Ranch
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,159	| IOT009 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,183	| IOT009 |	260
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| IOT009 |	Dollar tip has like
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,999	| IOT009 |	21 sensors
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,047	| IOT009 |	I'm looking at these sound like
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,351	| IOT009 |	We can really have some fun with this
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:38,399	| IOT009 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,727	| IOT009 |	So I am
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,287	| IOT009 |	I'm game I I find these things a lot of fun
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:47,359	| IOT009 |	I will say with my daughter who is
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,383	| IOT009 |	She's 8 years old
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:54,015	| IOT009 |	Doing this sort of thing in the house is a lot of fun for her because she can see
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,087	| IOT009 |	Right in front of her when we build it and we hook it up
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:01,951	| IOT009 |	She sees the action right away and she's affecting something in her real life
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,743	| IOT009 |	Which makes her really
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:08,351	| IOT009 |	Like the sort of like it really gets here until like programming and building the stuff
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| IOT009 |	In a way that
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:12,191	| IOT009 |	You don't maybe a more abstract thing doesn't
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:17,055	| IOT009 |	Yes sitting in front of a terminal and coding something again and again and again till you get it just right and they work
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,591	| IOT009 |	What's is one thing but here
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:22,687	| IOT009 |	It's a Mann's on one side Plug and Play because it's not quite that easy but it's pretty darn close
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,503	| IOT009 |	Yeah and she doesn't she doesn't equate it with like
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:29,087	| IOT009 |	It's play cuz we shan't
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:32,415	| IOT009 |	The other thing is if you're doing something like a haunted house or
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,463	| IOT009 |	You know any sort of project
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:34,975	| IOT009 |	Like that
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,767	| IOT009 |	We we do like little
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,303	| IOT009 |	Plays and sketches
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,095	| IOT009 |	This is also great for building
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,863	| IOT009 |	Props and that's hard
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:44,447	| IOT009 |	Throwing that out there for all the parents
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:48,543	| IOT009 |	Or just creative people in the room who really want to build an awesome haunted house next year
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,591	| IOT009 |	And because Legos
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,103	| IOT009 |	And because
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,407	| IOT009 |	Also like
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,711	| IOT009 |	And other news for this week
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,247	| IOT009 |	Let's just go into
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,271	| IOT009 |	Shall we do it
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,551	| IOT009 |	It's time for the
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,855	| IOT009 |	5-minute review
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,671	| IOT009 |	Ice Kevin
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,695	| IOT009 |	All right
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,975	| IOT009 |	Kevin's going to do the review this year
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:12,351	| IOT009 |	Okay this is my one review for the year that's it you heard it here
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,911	| IOT009 |	Yo no so what it what is it is it Cortana
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,215	| IOT009 |	It is Cortana because
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| IOT009 |	This week
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| IOT009 |	This week actually
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,079	| IOT009 |	Today is Tuesday
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| IOT009 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:28,479	| IOT009 |	Announce Cortana it was going to be available on both IOS and Android in
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:31,807	| IOT009 |	I thought this was huge because I've actually never used Cortana
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,599	| IOT009 |	And I love you
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,415	| IOT009 |	And I was like Kevin you got to tell us what it's like
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,695	| IOT009 |	Because she downloaded
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,207	| IOT009 |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:40,767	| IOT009 |	Well I would say yes you should
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:46,655	| IOT009 |	Here's the thing you said you you never use Cortana I'm betting most people haven't use Cortana because
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:52,287	| IOT009 |	Unfortunately for Microsoft Windows Phone share is literally around 3.7% worldwide right now so
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:55,615	| IOT009 |	A very small percentage of the population of use Cortana
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:59,711	| IOT009 |	I have used it I do have a couple Windows phones here that I play with from time to time
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:04,319	| IOT009 |	Here's the best summary I can give of Cortana and we put it in terms the people may be familiar with
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,391	| IOT009 |	It's very similar to Apple Siri
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:11,743	| IOT009 |	It's also similar to The Voice Control actions of Google Now for Android
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:16,351	| IOT009 |	The thing is it kind of takes the Best of Both Worlds I find it far better than Siri
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:19,167	| IOT009 |	Because Cortana has a lot of contextual
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| IOT009 |	Things that I can do
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,471	| IOT009 |	But you could
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| IOT009 |	Say
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:26,591	| IOT009 |	Cortana remind me to wish my mother-in-law happy birthday the next time she calls
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,127	| IOT009 |	Now that's like
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,431	| IOT009 |	You can have location-based service type
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,991	| IOT009 |	Reminders on Siri but you can't do
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,271	| IOT009 |	What I just said I'm serious person
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,063	| IOT009 |	The flipside is
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:39,135	| IOT009 |	Do I Google now it does have contextual smart Square
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:43,999	| IOT009 |	Cortana will be able to surface information that's important to you at the right place and the right time
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:46,047	| IOT009 |	Even if I just gave it up a surprisingly perfect
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:51,935	| IOT009 |	So it's kind of a blend of Both Worlds I like it very much I think it's worth downloading
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:58,335	| IOT009 |	Installing on your iPhone or Android device when you can the thing is I don't believe and I could be wrong but I don't
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:00,895	| IOT009 |	Hopefully you can actually just go to an App Store and download it
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,479	| IOT009 |	It seems to be that Microsoft is putting out
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:07,295	| IOT009 |	An app called the phone companion app for Windows
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,063	| IOT009 |	10
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:13,439	| IOT009 |	And if you hook your Android phone or your iOS device to your Windows machine with this app
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| IOT009 |	You can then use that app
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| IOT009 |	To push Cortana
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,535	| IOT009 |	To your
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,815	| IOT009 |	Android or iPhone
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:22,911	| IOT009 |	I like it I find Cortana to be very useful bar more useful than Siri
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,191	| IOT009 |	I will leave it at that
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:28,031	| IOT009 |	Awesome but also a little disappointing
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,823	| IOT009 |	Because I don't have a Windows
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,591	| IOT009 |	Anyting
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,103	| IOT009 |	In my life
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:36,991	| IOT009 |	Well that's going to make it tough at least for now I mean bear in mind this is all part of the whole big Windows 10 push
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,783	| IOT009 |	So Cortana is actually going to be
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| IOT009 |	Part of Windows 10
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,623	| IOT009 |	Sui voice activation there and such
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:47,999	| IOT009 |	It's early days for Windows 10 is not officially launched it's all inside her bills and so on so it may be
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:50,303	| IOT009 |	That Microsoft I would expect him to change this
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:53,887	| IOT009 |	I think they're just trying to get Cortana out there for people who are interested want to test it
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,679	| IOT009 |	On Android and iOS
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:58,751	| IOT009 |	When push comes to shove them Windows 10 largest later this year
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,311	| IOT009 |	They have to put it out there and in the app stores
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,383	| IOT009 |	Alright well I'm going to hope because
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,151	| IOT009 |	You know there
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,199	| IOT009 |	I love voice
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,711	| IOT009 |	Send
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:11,039	| IOT009 |	I I find the right now my favorite is still
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,063	| IOT009 |	Alexa
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,367	| IOT009 |	Who's on the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,952	| IOT009 |	Contextually she is she's not all that
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| IOT009 |	And Google
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,256	| IOT009 |	Yet
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,048	| IOT009 |	And Google's is
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,816	| IOT009 |	Decent
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:25,632	| IOT009 |	A lot of we'll just say personality
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:29,472	| IOT009 |	Yep Siri has far more personality than
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,264	| IOT009 |	Google now and that's why I again I say
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,848	| IOT009 |	Cortana is probably the best of both worlds cuz Cortana has a pretty good personality
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,896	| IOT009 |	It's actually fun to use
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| IOT009 |	Yeah yeah Google
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,736	| IOT009 |	Know their utilitarian
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,832	| IOT009 |	We will table
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:48,928	| IOT009 |	You know someone who is very utilitarian and pragmatic I can get behind that
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,256	| IOT009 |	So I'd rather my robot Overlord be pragmatic
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,792	| IOT009 |	Pretend to like
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,840	| IOT009 |	It's less confusing that way
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,888	| IOT009 |	All right
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,424	| IOT009 |	Well let's see I think that
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,704	| IOT009 |	I think that's it for this
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,216	| IOT009 |	Sweet show
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,008	| IOT009 |	Stay tuned for John Mann
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,288	| IOT009 |	He has a
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,824	| IOT009 |	Principal at
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT009 |	The artifact
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,360	| IOT009 |	Group
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:09,152	| IOT009 |	And it is a design consultancy
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:14,528	| IOT009 |	We're actually going to talk to you about brillo and homekit and kind of Designing for the Smart Home
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,320	| IOT009 |	User experience roster
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:16,832	| IOT009 |	Talking about
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:24,256	| IOT009 |	What we can expect from hotels in airplanes as users and how that can kind of help us adopt new technologies
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:30,400	| IOT009 |	Send to the smartphone and it should be a really good show
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,240	| IOT009 |	Hey everybody
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| IOT009 |	Welcome back
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,336	| IOT009 |	2B Internet of Things podcast and we have is Our Guest
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:41,152	| IOT009 |	Today John man who is the design director at artifact
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,688	| IOT009 |	Hello John thanks for joining us
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| IOT009 |	ICC
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,736	| IOT009 |	Thanks for having me
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,784	| IOT009 |	I am really excited to have you
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:50,624	| IOT009 |	You today because we have a lot of really cool things to talk about that I think
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,904	| IOT009 |	You're probably
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,440	| IOT009 |	Really going to be good at talking
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:55,744	| IOT009 |	We'll start with
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,304	| IOT009 |	A lot of news has come out
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT009 |	About
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:05,216	| IOT009 |	These are actually weeks they're not actual news yet I should clarify but it looks like the summer is going to be a big one for
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:08,032	| IOT009 |	The smart home in kind of how we're going to control it with
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,080	| IOT009 |	Apple's homekit
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:16,480	| IOT009 |	We're not a hundred percent sure how much we're going to see but there is going to be something at the worldwide developer conference
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:18,016	| IOT009 |	June 1st
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,344	| IOT009 |	Our second week in June apples going to announce something related to homekit
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,648	| IOT009 |	Possibly not the full range of device
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,184	| IOT009 |	But something
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,976	| IOT009 |	So exciting news there
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,000	| IOT009 |	And then it just came out
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,536	| IOT009 |	This last week
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,072	| IOT009 |	That Google
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,096	| IOT009 |	Is building
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,632	| IOT009 |	What looks to be a
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:37,216	| IOT009 |	Operating system for the internet of things that it is going to call
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,728	| IOT009 |	Brillo
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,008	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,544	| IOT009 |	The way that that is looking
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,848	| IOT009 |	And again this is all
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,408	| IOT009 |	Based on sources this is not from Google
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,456	| IOT009 |	Variety of news reports including
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:51,808	| IOT009 |	My sources including the information and in some from Mike Wolfe who is an analyst
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,600	| IOT009 |	Up in Seattle
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,928	| IOT009 |	Basically Google has Craig Barrett who
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,720	| IOT009 |	You guys may be familiar with as a former
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,304	| IOT009 |	CEO of atheros which is a Wi-Fi chip company
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,328	| IOT009 |	Is building out
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,864	| IOT009 |	Operating
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,144	| IOT009 |	System that looks like
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,168	| IOT009 |	It's going to be
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:07,936	| IOT009 |	Inside router
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| IOT009 |	Edible
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,264	| IOT009 |	You won't have like a Smart Hub but it
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,032	| IOT009 |	Control a bunch of
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,056	| IOT009 |	The devices in the house
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:14,592	| IOT009 |	So
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:17,152	| IOT009 |	With all of that Exposition out of the way
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,176	| IOT009 |	John
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,456	| IOT009 |	Tell us
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:20,992	| IOT009 |	What do you think
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:24,064	| IOT009 |	About kind of all of this news and is this the way
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| IOT009 |	Did the smart home should kind of evolve
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,136	| IOT009 |	As you said
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:33,024	| IOT009 |	This has been a long time coming Apple first announced homekit at WWDC last year
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:36,608	| IOT009 |	And everyone's really been waiting with bated breath ever since
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:39,680	| IOT009 |	And obviously eater does the flip side of that with
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:41,728	| IOT009 |	Android umbrella getting to the game
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:47,872	| IOT009 |	Hopefully this is where we start of cross that Chasm get out of the trip current crop of disillusionment
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,896	| IOT009 |	And hopefully start
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:50,432	| IOT009 |	To see some things that work
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| IOT009 |	And really work together
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:56,320	| IOT009 |	And work it in this notion where we're not diving in and out of
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,088	| IOT009 |	Multiple app
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:00,416	| IOT009 |	Jamaica are smart home dreams come true
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,208	| IOT009 |	But it feels like a single solution
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,280	| IOT009 |	That's really the missing elements
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,048	| IOT009 |	Today
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,608	| IOT009 |	Let's go to take the smart home and make it feels sort of after
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,400	| IOT009 |	I think today's
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:14,752	| IOT009 |	Elements within the smart home and felt a little bit like multiple Islands
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:16,288	| IOT009 |	Either of icons
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| IOT009 |	Floating around
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| IOT009 |	Or at the very least
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,128	| IOT009 |	Stinks like SmartThings
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,152	| IOT009 |	Peking wings
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:25,760	| IOT009 |	A single app to rule them all but still an app that I have to get into and doesn't quite get
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,272	| IOT009 |	Take me to the start
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,576	| IOT009 |	A high-level access that
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:32,416	| IOT009 |	Apple's IOS or or the Google Android
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,952	| IOT009 |	Operating system can
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,000	| IOT009 |	Can do it only a swipe or a
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,816	| IOT009 |	Talking point away
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:41,376	| IOT009 |	I was all of that intelligent agents so
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,168	| IOT009 |	This is really something to do
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:44,704	| IOT009 |	Start looking pretty closely at
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:47,264	| IOT009 |	And hopefully we won't continue to be disappointed
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:48,288	| IOT009 |	But today is your day
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:52,384	| IOT009 |	Smart home islands are are not quite pulling their weight
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:55,712	| IOT009 |	And certainly not mainstream ready yet
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:00,320	| IOT009 |	So I'm going to sort of disagree with you because I feel like while these are
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:03,904	| IOT009 |	Islands because they're bigger they're more like continent
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:06,720	| IOT009 |	They are still separate continents and
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,280	| IOT009 |	You know my husband actually carries an iPhone
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,560	| IOT009 |	Icarian Android
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:13,120	| IOT009 |	And I look at this and I kind of like oh
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,632	| IOT009 |	Nuts
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,168	| IOT009 |	This could be today
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:20,032	| IOT009 |	Difficult think that's a great point in one of the things that we often forget
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:23,360	| IOT009 |	Is when we deal with multiple users in a home is
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,384	| IOT009 |	It's it's
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,152	| IOT009 |	More
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,456	| IOT009 |	It's certainly more personal
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:30,272	| IOT009 |	And it's our Sanctuary but at the same time at the sanctuary of us
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:34,368	| IOT009 |	Typically more said in the sanctuary of me so that multi-user components
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,440	| IOT009 |	And knowing that they could be on multiple platforms
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,976	| IOT009 |	Definitely an interesting point
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:41,792	| IOT009 |	The other point I'd like to bring up about this
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,560	| IOT009 |	Future
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:49,216	| IOT009 |	With all of these devices they still revolver on my smartphone even if there's like a Hubbard the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,288	| IOT009 |	Router is the brains of the operation or maybe it's like an apple
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,568	| IOT009 |	TV boxer
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,080	| IOT009 |	Whatever
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,128	| IOT009 |	But I still think
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:59,968	| IOT009 |	At the end goal should be a much more contextually aware
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,784	| IOT009 |	Home kind of like what Tony fadell from desk talks about
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,320	| IOT009 |	Which is
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:08,928	| IOT009 |	My house responds to me as opposed to meet ordering my house to do things
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,232	| IOT009 |	And I don't know from your first
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,280	| IOT009 |	How far are we actually away from some
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| IOT009 |	Like that
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:17,120	| IOT009 |	Yeah I don't think we're too far away from
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:19,680	| IOT009 |	That's an excellent point and in many ways
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,704	| IOT009 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:23,776	| IOT009 |	What having these larger platform players involved
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,592	| IOT009 |	That will get us closer to
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,128	| IOT009 |	To make a great point
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:30,688	| IOT009 |	Context is important in 10th is important
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,480	| IOT009 |	And it shouldn't have to be
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,784	| IOT009 |	Expressed intent of pushing a button
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:37,088	| IOT009 |	What is that button is on my wall
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,112	| IOT009 |	Pocket door online read
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,904	| IOT009 |	Or even a voice
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| IOT009 |	Command
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:43,488	| IOT009 |	There are things that the system can start to know
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:45,536	| IOT009 |	As they learn about us
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,608	| IOT009 |	Where it doesn't become a requirement
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| IOT009 |	That we are interacting
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,168	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:55,008	| IOT009 |	The really interesting opponent that is how do you get that set up
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:28:01,152	| IOT009 |	How do you how does the user understand what those opportunities are or we would examine their own in 10 *
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,920	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,456	| IOT009 |	Anyways the role of
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,248	| IOT009 |	The system is in helping to
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,552	| IOT009 |	To discover those and present the offer
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,880	| IOT009 |	Because today with most many of these
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,904	| IOT009 |	Smart home systems
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| IOT009 |	Weather
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:15,744	| IOT009 |	What we think we'll see from homekit or even Brillo
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,536	| IOT009 |	It's so much about the sea
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,816	| IOT009 |	Expression of
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,120	| IOT009 |	What do I want to do before I've done it
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| IOT009 |	Understanding I like this current context
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,216	| IOT009 |	When we call this
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,752	| IOT009 |	This is dinner
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,520	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:31,360	| IOT009 |	Like to write the music and everything in that's what dinners going to be
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,896	| IOT009 |	Inside when dinner happens this
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| IOT009 |	Should be what happened
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:38,528	| IOT009 |	In some ways Harmony did that a long time ago with certain that having things that are activity-based
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,856	| IOT009 |	Although we still have to kind of pull out a remote and head
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,136	| IOT009 |	Watch TV
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:45,952	| IOT009 |	But the sooner that we can understand those contacts
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,720	| IOT009 |	And
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,768	| IOT009 |	Do things on behalf of the user
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,816	| IOT009 |	In the beginning with their permission
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:53,632	| IOT009 |	Could it odd if you do something and it was unexpected
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:56,704	| IOT009 |	But after it becomes a pattern and repetition
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,008	| IOT009 |	And we can do those things and take something off the users plate
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:01,312	| IOT009 |	And I think that's where things started
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,080	| IOT009 |	To become mad
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,944	| IOT009 |	And I think on the way to that magic we're going to get a lot of these kind of
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,224	| IOT009 |	Autocorrect
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,504	| IOT009 |	Type feelings wear
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,552	| IOT009 |	Your house is going to be like oh
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:16,416	| IOT009 |	I think it's dinner time and it's going to dim the lights and you're going to be suddenly in the middle of trying to
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:19,232	| IOT009 |	Turn of work on a project late at night and you're like
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,280	| IOT009 |	No house no it's not dinner
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,816	| IOT009 |	Prince lights up
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,608	| IOT009 |	And house is going to be like
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,376	| IOT009 |	Sorry my bad
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:27,936	| IOT009 |	I do think we'll get there a very Optimus
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,264	| IOT009 |	Absolutely and it's one of those places where
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,568	| IOT009 |	Nemours data points
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:36,384	| IOT009 |	We have more information and awareness that the system has
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:39,456	| IOT009 |	The Laura can be a bit more accurate with those
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:42,016	| IOT009 |	Understanding those patterns in the nuance
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:45,088	| IOT009 |	In that part of having these systems at work
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:47,136	| IOT009 |	Together in unison
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,160	| IOT009 |	Rather than
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,976	| IOT009 |	Being their own islands of sensors
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:51,744	| IOT009 |	Input
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,768	| IOT009 |	And and output
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:57,632	| IOT009 |	That's the kind of thing where we need more cooperation across devices
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,704	| IOT009 |	I just interoperability
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,472	| IOT009 |	Data
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,264	| IOT009 |	Itself but the meaning
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,800	| IOT009 |	Behind that data
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:05,824	| IOT009 |	And that
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:06,592	| IOT009 |	Swear
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,432	| IOT009 |	It's going to be I think that the really interesting Innovations are going to come from
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:10,944	| IOT009 |	Is
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,248	| IOT009 |	That the company is trying to make
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,528	| IOT009 |	Expensive patterns
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:16,064	| IOT009 |	Machine learning is going to be
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,112	| IOT009 |	Exact what's going to take the
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:19,136	| IOT009 |	Smart home India
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,976	| IOT009 |	Smart not just a remote control that happens to be on the adult
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,792	| IOT009 |	Alright well let's think about
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,352	| IOT009 |	Bringing the smart home to the masses
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,144	| IOT009 |	How is it that we're going to
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:34,240	| IOT009 |	Can I bring this to the mainstream and you mentioned earlier before the show
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:41,408	| IOT009 |	Places like Disney and experiences in other business locales is being a good way to go
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,200	| IOT009 |	Get people introduced to this
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,224	| IOT009 |	Beyond just like
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,016	| IOT009 |	Blog posts
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,784	| IOT009 |	Marketing campaign
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:53,440	| IOT009 |	I'd love to hear your thoughts about Disney's Fastpass which is kind of right now the gold standard in the internet if they
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| IOT009 |	Venetian Bay
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:58,816	| IOT009 |	Automation delivering an awesome experienced
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:03,424	| IOT009 |	I think one of the things at Disney's always done and done so well
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,960	| IOT009 |	Is they put us into the future
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:07,776	| IOT009 |	Epcot Center way back when I was a kid
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:11,872	| IOT009 |	Tomorrowland and everything they've been doing it is a full experience
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:16,992	| IOT009 |	And it's a great exercise and Industry of end-to-end service design
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,784	| IOT009 |	Is it a Magic Band
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:23,904	| IOT009 |	Is pretty remarkable in that in that sense because it starts from the point of
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:26,208	| IOT009 |	Before you even gone to Disney
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:32,352	| IOT009 |	You should have got this band in the mail you on talking it's already should have got your information and is personalizing you can do something
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:35,936	| IOT009 |	And the moment you walk into Disney
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:37,472	| IOT009 |	They know your name
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:42,848	| IOT009 |	And they can create some really interesting magical experiences when you make you just comes up to you and says
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,384	| IOT009 |	Hi Stacy
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:47,200	| IOT009 |	To understand where you are and how they can
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,760	| IOT009 |	Help improve your experience while you're there
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| IOT009 |	Getting getting past lines or
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:55,392	| IOT009 |	Letting you know where there is another
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:32:00,512	| IOT009 |	A video of a ride you want to do that that is not as crowded right now and beyond all that so
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,048	| IOT009 |	And that's what
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,840	| IOT009 |	We want our smartphone to be in
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:07,680	| IOT009 |	When you see these magical experiences in this this world of Disney
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:11,776	| IOT009 |	You start to understand are you get exposed to what happens when
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,080	| IOT009 |	All of this intelligence comes together
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,616	| IOT009 |	And so
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,152	| IOT009 |	Their opportunities
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,920	| IOT009 |	In
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,200	| IOT009 |	Hotels
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:22,272	| IOT009 |	In the airline experience do you sort of really end-to-end
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,576	| IOT009 |	Service design Industries
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:26,880	| IOT009 |	Start exposing the consumer
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,648	| IOT009 |	To what
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,672	| IOT009 |	What's the value of
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:32,768	| IOT009 |	And integration of technology and and
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,560	| IOT009 |	That intention in the
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,096	| IOT009 |	Career your person
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| IOT009 |	Personalization in York
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,400	| IOT009 |	EXO
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,168	| IOT009 |	If we think about
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:42,752	| IOT009 |	Hotels just starting to do this a little today I can
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:46,848	| IOT009 |	Go to a Starwood Hotel walk up to the door and in my my
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,640	| IOT009 |	Phone or my Apple watch
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:55,552	| IOT009 |	I will unlock the door and that's kind of a magical experience and there's opportunity beyond that as you start to integrate
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,856	| IOT009 |	Your content traveling with you your likes
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:01,952	| IOT009 |	And media and leaving your alarm clock automatically being set
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:06,304	| IOT009 |	Within the room based on what you might do on on your phone or your watching soap
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,352	| IOT009 |	When you think about an end-to-end Xperia
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,632	| IOT009 |	Airlines
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,912	| IOT009 |	Again this is sort of 4
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:15,008	| IOT009 |	For 2 hours for 6 hours work were captive
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:19,104	| IOT009 |	You know how do we engage the user from that moment they purchase their tickets even if it's
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:20,640	| IOT009 |	A day a week a month
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,712	| IOT009 |	Having that information on you
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:25,504	| IOT009 |	Smoothing to the checking experience
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,320	| IOT009 |	Sitting in your seat and having your favorite music
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,344	| IOT009 |	Your content
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,416	| IOT009 |	Got your drink type kind of all there
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:37,792	| IOT009 |	And it becomes an expected so hyper-personal to you and deeply integrated with technology
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:40,608	| IOT009 |	Into that swim start understand we'll look at my home do
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,680	| IOT009 |	Oh sure now what I think about getting on a plane
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,984	| IOT009 |	Especially for like a
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,288	| IOT009 |	An overnight kind of Trooper Redeye
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:51,104	| IOT009 |	Flying across the ocean to a different time zone especially
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,640	| IOT009 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:55,200	| IOT009 |	Doing some of these circadian rhythm
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:55,968	| IOT009 |	Light cycles
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,016	| IOT009 |	That would be amazing
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:01,088	| IOT009 |	And all you have to do is replace the LEDs on the plane with
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:03,648	| IOT009 |	I was slightly smarter LED and then you could run like a
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:06,208	| IOT009 |	You know I'm going from
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:08,512	| IOT009 |	Dallas Texas to Sydney Australia
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,536	| IOT009 |	Can you run a
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:11,328	| IOT009 |	A circadian rhythm cycle that puts
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,376	| IOT009 |	At the right time zone when I land
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,424	| IOT009 |	I look at stuff like that and I
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,192	| IOT009 |	I'm really excited
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:20,288	| IOT009 |	Absolutely I mean if you take that to that sort of
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,080	| IOT009 |	The full Disney contacts
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,616	| IOT009 |	If you had a smart home
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:29,504	| IOT009 |	When I bought that plane tickets and we understand the calculation that you're going to Sydney Australia and here's the time difference
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:32,064	| IOT009 |	Did circadian rhythms
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:35,392	| IOT009 |	Affecting that bealite can actually happen automatically in your home
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:37,696	| IOT009 |	Starting a week before the trip
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,208	| IOT009 |	End

EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:29,408	| IOT009 |	You know there's a big component of trust
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,944	| IOT009 |	End
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:33,504	| IOT009 |	What's important when we do talk with clients is
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:34,784	| IOT009 |	Kid
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:37,856	| IOT009 |	Presents realities about where trusted currently exist
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| IOT009 |	What are brands
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,440	| IOT009 |	Who do I trust with some of this information in
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:43,744	| IOT009 |	In N even there's an ocean of time limit
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:46,048	| IOT009 |	Which we don't really see too much today
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,072	| IOT009 |	It's sort of an all-or-nothing
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,376	| IOT009 |	Never or forever
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:55,264	| IOT009 |	How do I set a time limit on something United for this flight to get me to Australia and then make that a pleasant experience
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:58,848	| IOT009 |	For the next week and a half or starting now and
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,152	| IOT009 |	When does my flight land
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,944	| IOT009 |	I'm going to give them Trust
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:04,992	| IOT009 |	That within the boundary of what
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:05,760	| IOT009 |	What can they ask
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,832	| IOT009 |	Presenting that clear value proposition
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,112	| IOT009 |	What is a user get
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:15,232	| IOT009 |	From disclosing some level of privacy are giving some level of access
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:17,280	| IOT009 |	To their technology and their lives
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:19,840	| IOT009 |	It was in the things that brand have to get right first
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:22,400	| IOT009 |	User experience aside
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:25,984	| IOT009 |	It all comes down to is this worth the trade-off is it exciting
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,752	| IOT009 |	From me
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,800	| IOT009 |	We can't get overly excited just by the Techno
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,360	| IOT009 |	And that's the biggest challenge that
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,384	| IOT009 |	Technology companies have
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,432	| IOT009 |	Those are the things you have to focus on
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,248	| IOT009 |	Because that's what's going to drive the adoption
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,040	| IOT009 |	Anime boys
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:40,576	| IOT009 |	About in our industry
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:43,648	| IOT009 |	The killer app what's it saying where you're like oh my God I need that to happen
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:47,488	| IOT009 |	And that in many ways is the Serta missing
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,256	| IOT009 |	Proposition
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:51,328	| IOT009 |	For some of the smartphone I think we're getting smarter about it now
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:54,144	| IOT009 |	Yeah I think the challenge with presenting the Smart Home
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:57,216	| IOT009 |	And selling the smart time to people is that
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:59,264	| IOT009 |	Can you mentioned it before this the home is
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:06,176	| IOT009 |	Both shared but it's also very personal and so everybody wants different things and different people in the home
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,712	| IOT009 |	Want different things
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,736	| IOT009 |	Side of it so
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:10,528	| IOT009 |	It's very hard to Market this stuff
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:11,552	| IOT009 |	Alright
