EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,696	| IOT180 |	I would really enjoy it if
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,976	| IOT180 |	Companies actually work
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:08,000	| IOT180 |	Harder to find errors
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| IOT180 |	What about you
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:13,632	| IOT180 |	Aqi tester
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,936	| IOT180 |	It's always cheaper to find errors earlier
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:21,056	| IOT180 |	Okay so let's get started with
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,592	| IOT180 |	Lenovo news
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,992	| IOT180 |	And now we have the details
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:35,904	| IOT180 |	Right we knew about this because of the FCC filing that we found I don't know maybe six weeks ago but it wasn't until last
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,720	| IOT180 |	Last week at the equator show that
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:45,120	| IOT180 |	Lenovo actually outages some new Smart Home Products and they are because they
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:45,888	| IOT180 |	Which runs
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,936	| IOT180 |	Google home Google Assistant settings
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:53,056	| IOT180 |	So this is not totally new expansion of smart home
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,848	| IOT180 |	And now have a dedicated smartphone
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,296	| IOT180 |	Spark plug
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,576	| IOT180 |	Eleanor smart
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,344	| IOT180 |	Camera
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,392	| IOT180 |	Last week with very little information
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,928	| IOT180 |	This week we have more
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| IOT180 |	Sitting availability price
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:13,280	| IOT180 |	You should know these are all Wi-Fi
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,560	| IOT180 |	Capable devices
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:20,960	| IOT180 |	They are all 2.4 gigahertz with some smart home devices running solely on
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,752	| IOT180 |	Frequency but it is what it is
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,544	| IOT180 |	They're not available
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,568	| IOT180 |	But they will
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,616	| IOT180 |	Available
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| IOT180 |	November exactly
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,480	| IOT180 |	Plug will be 2999
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,088	| IOT180 |	Camera v99
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| IOT180 |	99
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,904	| IOT180 |	Availability
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:44,512	| IOT180 |	Willie was wondering what they were trying to do but now I sort of get it
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:46,048	| IOT180 |	Because if you think about it
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,608	| IOT180 |	There a competitor to Samsung
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,400	| IOT180 |	Between laptops
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,960	| IOT180 |	What laptops in particular I would say
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,728	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,776	| IOT180 |	They want to Augustine
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:02,688	| IOT180 |	Devices that lower selling prices
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,480	| IOT180 |	Send the stuff was happening
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,296	| IOT180 |	Everybody's going to multiple
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:19,583	| IOT180 |	This will work with the Google Assistant will work with Madam as well there are two versions of their app
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:23,679	| IOT180 |	Called Lenovo and Lync link app will be available soon
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,959	| IOT180 |	For IOS and Android
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,519	| IOT180 |	Who is this I would say
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| IOT180 |	You can sing
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,079	| IOT180 |	People think is important
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,383	| IOT180 |	Smart light bulbs
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,431	| IOT180 |	They check everybody wants it
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,967	| IOT180 |	Even
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,735	| IOT180 |	Renters
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,015	| IOT180 |	But also a smart plug
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,551	| IOT180 |	Camera
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,087	| IOT180 |	This ties into
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,623	| IOT180 |	Very first devices
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,183	| IOT180 |	Buy I don't
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,719	| IOT180 |	Web cameras
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:51,071	| IOT180 |	So I don't recommend people by that but definitely a light bulb or a smart outlet to like
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,351	| IOT180 |	Remotely controlled
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,143	| IOT180 |	What is a great first step so
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,471	| IOT180 |	What's the bare minimum you need to
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:03,871	| IOT180 |	Yeah speaking of bare minimums I also noticed just now on the Smart Home
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,407	| IOT180 |	Website that they have
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,431	| IOT180 |	They have a smart
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,503	| IOT180 |	Speaker stand on speaker that works with Madam
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:15,903	| IOT180 |	This may have been out before but I think it's going under our radar unless you seen this before it it looks like an echo essentially
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:18,719	| IOT180 |	Can Intel Atom Processor inside it's got all the
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,511	| IOT180 |	Yeah right
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,607	| IOT180 |	I want trouble 10 watt woofer
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,143	| IOT180 |	99 bucks
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:36,895	| IOT180 |	Everyone who sends us the questions asking to the heck is what we call Amazon
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,711	| IOT180 |	Digital assistant so we don't set everyone's
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,063	| IOT180 |	Just so you know
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,575	| IOT180 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| IOT180 |	We did last week
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:53,791	| IOT180 |	I don't know how I missed this but Amazon has added motion sensors
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,559	| IOT180 |	As a category
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,583	| IOT180 |	4
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:59,167	| IOT180 |	And that means that device
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| IOT180 |	Owners
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,727	| IOT180 |	Start integrating
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,751	| IOT180 |	Their sensors
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,799	| IOT180 |	Which makes
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,591	| IOT180 |	Automation Way
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,359	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,639	| IOT180 |	You're going to be able to stay if
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,175	| IOT180 |	UC motion
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,711	| IOT180 |	Camera
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,223	| IOT180 |	Turn on my porch
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,783	| IOT180 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:16,063	| IOT180 |	Something that the
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,599	| IOT180 |	Device manufacturers
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,927	| IOT180 |	First so smart things as one of the early adopter
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,279	| IOT180 |	They're doing it around their multi-purpose sensor and their motion sensor
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| IOT180 |	Today
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,327	| IOT180 |	Any how to use
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,863	| IOT180 |	14 function
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:32,959	| IOT180 |	Write this is a new API essential
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:40,383	| IOT180 |	Biggie at something that the as you said that app makers and developers and
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,663	| IOT180 |	So I have to integrate
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:46,015	| IOT180 |	Oh my gosh this please you that I want to start playing with this the other device that uses this
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,807	| IOT180 |	Surprisingly is the Echo Plus
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,623	| IOT180 |	That is a few things so that if you have
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| IOT180 |	Centralite sensors
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,951	| IOT180 |	Or Sylvania and
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| IOT180 |	Birthing Centers Portland
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,815	| IOT180 |	If you have centralized Sylvania sensor
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,351	| IOT180 |	And an Echo Plus
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,631	| IOT180 |	You actually
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,399	| IOT180 |	Start using this
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,983	| IOT180 |	And others again
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,751	| IOT180 |	Center companies
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,543	| IOT180 |	Oh this is all
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,359	| IOT180 |	So others ABS sensor base
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,895	| IOT180 |	You'll have to certify
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,223	| IOT180 |	And why do you think that is
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:16,735	| IOT180 |	Answer this
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,295	| IOT180 |	Because what
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,111	| IOT180 |	Radio is missing from the Amazon hub
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:22,623	| IOT180 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:28,511	| IOT180 |	Do you have a scandalous story about a
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,583	| IOT180 |	Tell me more
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,863	| IOT180 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,423	| IOT180 |	Yes the Echo Plus which is their hub
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,471	| IOT180 |	And we should explain for people who don't know what these
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,543	| IOT180 |	Zigbee and Z-Wave R2 networking
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,847	| IOT180 |	Analogies have been used in the home
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| IOT180 |	Really long
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,175	| IOT180 |	And they're low power
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| IOT180 |	Networking
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| IOT180 |	Wireless protocols
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,575	| IOT180 |	It's great for your battery powered sensors and things like that
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| IOT180 |	Even door locks
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,439	| IOT180 |	But with things like Home Care
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,743	| IOT180 |	A lot of the new functionality
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:04,607	| IOT180 |	It's unclear exactly and Z-Wave are going to still be like
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:06,399	| IOT180 |	The masters of Hawaiian nation that they used
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,471	| IOT180 |	That's why we're devoting so much time
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,495	| IOT180 |	To that aspect
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| IOT180 |	Okay so
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,591	| IOT180 |	I would say hey everybody
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,615	| IOT180 |	Please
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:16,895	| IOT180 |	Do this
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,407	| IOT180 |	It will be awesome
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,967	| IOT180 |	Because I really love
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,015	| IOT180 |	Having things automated based on
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,319	| IOT180 |	Although it can be kind of a pain to fingers
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,135	| IOT180 |	I was drinking and spent like
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,719	| IOT180 |	Six months trying to figure out how to create like a automated go to bed
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,743	| IOT180 |	Routine for my house
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,255	| IOT180 |	I never said
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:33,535	| IOT180 |	It was terrible
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:39,167	| IOT180 |	Not slept in 6 months no I just I didn't want to say like goodnight
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| IOT180 |	I just wanted like
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| IOT180 |	Oh
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,751	| IOT180 |	Haven't walked in the following
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| IOT180 |	Hallway and these lights are out
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,567	| IOT180 |	And this person
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,847	| IOT180 |	Basically
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| IOT180 |	It just would all go to hell
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:48,895	| IOT180 |	Whenever
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,503	| IOT180 |	There's so many variables that's the tricky part
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,015	| IOT180 |	Exactly
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,319	| IOT180 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,087	| IOT180 |	Also
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| IOT180 |	We got news that the
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| IOT180 |	Amazon
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| IOT180 |	Digital
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:03,999	| IOT180 |	Assistant that works with over 20000 devices
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:09,631	| IOT180 |	This is why you often say that first
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,447	| IOT180 |	Platform that smart home devices
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| IOT180 |	Amazon
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,799	| IOT180 |	It's true they start with Amazon first
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:21,151	| IOT180 |	They've now started with Amazon first to move to Google and then they follow with it
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,663	| IOT180 |	Usually
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,943	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:28,831	| IOT180 |	I'll be curious with homekit with apple lightning up some of their requirements will see a bigger chunk.
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,415	| IOT180 |	Just to put this number in contacts
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| IOT180 |	The beginning of the year
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,487	| IOT180 |	4000 devices
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,559	| IOT180 |	20005
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,839	| IOT180 |	The number of brands
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:43,935	| IOT180 |	Went from 1200 at the beginning of this year to 3500
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,215	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| IOT180 |	They are making big strides
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,079	| IOT180 |	There's also 50000 Madam a skills
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| IOT180 |	Inside actually start with
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:56,223	| IOT180 |	If you are trying to predict what's happening and how the Smart Home
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,503	| IOT180 |	I was going to get easier over time
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,039	| IOT180 |	Look at
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,319	| IOT180 |	The API integration
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,599	| IOT180 |	Alexa motion sensor
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,391	| IOT180 |	About or
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,415	| IOT180 |	Last week
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| IOT180 |	GE announced
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,999	| IOT180 |	You no longer have to talk to G-Eazy
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,279	| IOT180 |	Assistant
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,047	| IOT180 |	Control the oven
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,607	| IOT180 |	And other Home Appliances
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,887	| IOT180 |	And that's because
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| IOT180 |	They now have
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:19,519	| IOT180 |	Native support for ovens and microwaves and things like that inside
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,615	| IOT180 |	So this is a big deal because what is going in able to
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,431	| IOT180 |	Interoperability
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,199	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| IOT180 |	Geez ovens work
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| IOT180 |	Pretty much the same way that
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,039	| IOT180 |	Oh
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,855	| IOT180 |	Ashes of an acre
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,951	| IOT180 |	On off
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,767	| IOT180 |	So once you have that you can just say
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,583	| IOT180 |	Your particular device
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,399	| IOT180 |	To say hey
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,703	| IOT180 |	Turn the oven to 350
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| IOT180 |	The echo figures all that
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:57,407	| IOT180 |	One other thought in case we have some enterprising individuals that listen to the show
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,199	| IOT180 |	I thought it was interesting
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,967	| IOT180 |	That
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,735	| IOT180 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:04,063	| IOT180 |	Mentioned a 22 year old college student
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,879	| IOT180 |	Is making $10,000 a month
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,647	| IOT180 |	With his
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| IOT180 |	Word of the day skill
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,207	| IOT180 |	That
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,559	| IOT180 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,351	| IOT180 |	Yes people up there
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:17,887	| IOT180 |	You probably should come
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| IOT180 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,943	| IOT180 |	Speaking of apis this is rather interesting as well
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,247	| IOT180 |	Samsung
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,319	| IOT180 |	Third-party developers to build apps for Bixby
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:40,671	| IOT180 |	And I don't think we're going to call Bixby Mister because I don't really know anybody using Bixby
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,463	| IOT180 |	50 States but that is
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,999	| IOT180 |	Good news for
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| IOT180 |	Developers
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,047	| IOT180 |	I want you
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:49,119	| IOT180 |	Target another platform
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:53,727	| IOT180 |	I don't know I am a little too late a minutes expected to happen
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,751	| IOT180 |	Samsung to do list
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,519	| IOT180 |	But
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| IOT180 |	I just I don't see a baby
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,127	| IOT180 |	Push for Bixby these days
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,175	| IOT180 |	Maybe in other parts of the world
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,711	| IOT180 |	Is Bixby begin
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:06,783	| IOT180 |	The thing about Bixby
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,087	| IOT180 |	Is just not a good implementation
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:13,951	| IOT180 |	Perfect example Galaxy Note 9 just came out Us phone out right now
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,255	| IOT180 |	Every single review I read
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:22,399	| IOT180 |	Bixby is half-baked Bixby doesn't respond Expedia spins for 30 seconds and then says I don't know
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:26,495	| IOT180 |	I know they put on a good show with Bixby at there
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,591	| IOT180 |	Home speaker for example
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:33,919	| IOT180 |	Developer on Samsung
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,831	| IOT180 |	Not it's not nearly as bad
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,111	| IOT180 |	Having use both but yes
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,159	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,975	| IOT180 |	We should mention this week kind of bypass these standards
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,487	| IOT180 |	Part of this
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,559	| IOT180 |	Last week
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,095	| IOT180 |	Also on Thursday
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:01,311	| IOT180 |	Earliest version 2 of the io tivity Sanders
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,591	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:07,455	| IOT180 |	For all of you guys have been following us for years we've talked about this because this was supposed to be like
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,759	| IOT180 |	A unifying standard for the internet
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| IOT180 |	Especially in the smart
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,415	| IOT180 |	It might be but no one else's
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,487	| IOT180 |	So LG Samsung
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,303	| IOT180 |	Higher are all going to
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,631	| IOT180 |	Tivity certified devices
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,423	| IOT180 |	Coming to Market
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,447	| IOT180 |	2019
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| IOT180 |	That is next year
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:31,775	| IOT180 |	I'm really
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| IOT180 |	I mean I wrote about this
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:36,127	| IOT180 |	When I go to be the first version launch there were
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| IOT180 |	It only ran on
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,199	| IOT180 |	Giant machines like hugs and
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| IOT180 |	Things running Atom Processor
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,551	| IOT180 |	It just was not great for the internet
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,111	| IOT180 |	Right way too much memory all that
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,135	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| IOT180 |	They took a really long time
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,463	| IOT180 |	Security spy
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,279	| IOT180 |	I've been worried about the OCS
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:53,791	| IOT180 |	Quite some time
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,583	| IOT180 |	I feel like this is
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,351	| IOT180 |	Too little too late
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,911	| IOT180 |	I've been watching this particular effort
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,191	| IOT180 |	Oh
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:00,703	| IOT180 |	3 years
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,519	| IOT180 |	Maybe for years now and then
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,055	| IOT180 |	Prior to that I was watching
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,567	| IOT180 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,103	| IOT180 |	All join
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:10,175	| IOT180 |	Choose another effort to like have these Universal data C
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,247	| IOT180 |	So what it looks like we're getting a
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,015	| IOT180 |	We're going to have
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,319	| IOT180 |	Amazon Echo take over
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:19,135	| IOT180 |	This I guess and maybe Google home
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,415	| IOT180 |	That's what I was going to say
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:26,815	| IOT180 |	If you take too long to come out with a standard and somebody else develops to censor their own standards
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,911	| IOT180 |	That generally come for the universal or standard coming in late
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,959	| IOT180 |	Biscuit is not adding a standard at all
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,519	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,287	| IOT180 |	This is
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:41,151	| IOT180 |	This morning but there are I still actually need lots of people who want to use the open
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,687	| IOT180 |	Connectivity Foundation standards
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,223	| IOT180 |	You know maybe I'll be surprised
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,319	| IOT180 |	Will keep it up there
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:48,831	| IOT180 |	See what happens
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,135	| IOT180 |	All right
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,439	| IOT180 |	Lot of little products in things
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,999	| IOT180 |	Talk about so let's talk about or via voice
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,047	| IOT180 |	You been waiting for this
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,839	| IOT180 |	Not this particular
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:07,007	| IOT180 |	Well maybe not particular this device but yes I am looking for expect the next
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:14,687	| IOT180 |	Has to be a consolidation and by that I mean we don't need a box of bridge at HUB etcetera for everything we do
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:21,599	| IOT180 |	Why not put them all in integration where you can and that's what Netgear is doing with her or be voice
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,879	| IOT180 |	So what it is
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:23,647	| IOT180 |	It is
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,439	| IOT180 |	Part of their orbi
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,719	| IOT180 |	Mesh wi-fi system
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,791	| IOT180 |	Also is a smart speaker
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:34,399	| IOT180 |	So you get decent sound assistant and you extend your network
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,167	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT180 |	That's
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,495	| IOT180 |	This type of process exactly what I've been working
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,031	| IOT180 |	I mean I get this product
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,335	| IOT180 |	Yes I forsee many
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:44,127	| IOT180 |	Similar products from various vendors now
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:47,199	| IOT180 |	Yay
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,479	| IOT180 |	All right
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,015	| IOT180 |	Tattoos
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,527	| IOT180 |	Target
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,599	| IOT180 |	They are products
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,903	| IOT180 |	Vinyl Products
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,463	| IOT180 |	Couple times
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,743	| IOT180 |	But
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,023	| IOT180 |	And he was in the newsletter
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:06,911	| IOT180 |	Amazon Dash except they built
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| IOT180 |	Connection
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,215	| IOT180 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,287	| IOT180 |	And when it was almost empty it would reordered
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,311	| IOT180 |	Yourself
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,335	| IOT180 |	Kind of cool
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:17,663	| IOT180 |	People did not support it if they launched as a crowdfunding
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,967	| IOT180 |	Nobody decided to
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,015	| IOT180 |	And I think it's probably a couple things
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,575	| IOT180 |	Actually talked about
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| IOT180 |	That's not the best way to do it
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,975	| IOT180 |	The den 2
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,887	| IOT180 |	Many many many
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,447	| IOT180 |	We talked about
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:40,959	| IOT180 |	Dogs
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,263	| IOT180 |	Dog food scoop
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:48,383	| IOT180 |	Order more dog food as you scoop it out basically
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| IOT180 |	Anyway
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:54,271	| IOT180 |	It was really hard because when you were trying to assess value is at
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| IOT180 |	You're like
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,855	| IOT180 |	Changes the equation
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| IOT180 |	You like his convenience worth
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,671	| IOT180 |	The little prince premium
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:01,951	| IOT180 |	I don't know
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| IOT180 |	And most people probably said
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,047	| IOT180 |	And I think it's because they hadn't experienced that
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,143	| IOT180 |	Didn't make sense I mean
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:12,703	| IOT180 |	We're getting bombarded with a shift
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,751	| IOT180 |	Two subscription-based things
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,775	| IOT180 |	Celebree ordering
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,591	| IOT180 |	When you're low on something smartly
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:24,991	| IOT180 |	Makes sense but it's also like to I want another kind of things I think you were struggling
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,319	| IOT180 |	All right if he doesn't talk about this kind of thing
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| IOT180 |	You want to use it
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,135	| IOT180 |	I don't know
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,415	| IOT180 |	All right
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,439	| IOT180 |	What's up
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,975	| IOT180 |	We got a
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,791	| IOT180 |	OK Google employee hacking the Google door
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:39,839	| IOT180 |	I was like
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,655	| IOT180 |	Yeah I know it's actually very good
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,679	| IOT180 |	Google
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:46,751	| IOT180 |	Sunnyvale offices were hacked by one of his own employees
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,775	| IOT180 |	You're somebody else
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,615	| IOT180 |	Because I couldn't really bad but one of these employees on Sunnyvale
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:54,175	| IOT180 |	Found out to get into the
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,991	| IOT180 |	Uses I think was NFC
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:57,503	| IOT180 |	RFID
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,295	| IOT180 |	Is RFID there we go
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,599	| IOT180 |	Software House
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:07,999	| IOT180 |	Software House exactly will suffer house needs to take a look at it software because encrypted messages
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:10,815	| IOT180 |	Sending across the network
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| IOT180 |	And this
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:17,983	| IOT180 |	Employee discovered a hard-coded encryption key Software House devices
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:24,383	| IOT180 |	So he replicated the key commands and was able to lock
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| IOT180 |	Fellow employees out of the building
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,967	| IOT180 |	So the good news is
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,247	| IOT180 |	He reported at 10
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| IOT180 |	Is being address
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,063	| IOT180 |	Google's probably very happy that
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,951	| IOT180 |	This raises an interesting challenge that I worry about
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:42,047	| IOT180 |	In our future for as a consumer for example because the locks
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:45,631	| IOT180 |	Didn't have enough memory to be upgraded with the fix
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,935	| IOT180 |	So literally you had to
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:50,495	| IOT180 |	Not you will have to physically have those locks
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,103	| IOT180 |	And that's like gr device makers considering
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:55,871	| IOT180 |	You know
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:57,407	| IOT180 |	Memory constraints and such
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:03,807	| IOT180 |	For something like that she got to have some overhead in case something drastic goes wrong so that way they're not sending new devices
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,575	| IOT180 |	Not everybody
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,391	| IOT180 |	So that's actually
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,951	| IOT180 |	Even around
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,231	| IOT180 |	Basic functionality
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:15,327	| IOT180 |	So having enough overhead in your
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:17,887	| IOT180 |	Teal
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,655	| IOT180 |	People
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,959	| IOT180 |	You're going to bump up against especially because
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,007	| IOT180 |	My gosh we just keep making software bigger
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,847	| IOT180 |	Historically a lot of like
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,359	| IOT180 |	Locks
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,895	| IOT180 |	Appliance makers
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,431	| IOT180 |	What do you like that
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:33,247	| IOT180 |	You don't remember it was like an extra building materials
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,319	| IOT180 |	Straight hair like no just play it to the Bone you need to
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,111	| IOT180 |	Nothing until they're actually haven't
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,623	| IOT180 |	To do
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,439	| IOT180 |	And how they think about
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,207	| IOT180 |	Building there
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,719	| IOT180 |	Products
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,511	| IOT180 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,535	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,583	| IOT180 |	But it is
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,375	| IOT180 |	It is definitely
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,423	| IOT180 |	Something that I don't think
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,191	| IOT180 |	4 years ago
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:56,543	| IOT180 |	They were thinking about and now they are and they're having to start designing this kind of
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,079	| IOT180 |	Extra overhead in
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,127	| IOT180 |	And you know it will run out so
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:01,919	| IOT180 |	Fisher Hawaii
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:04,735	| IOT180 |	Modular
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,039	| IOT180 |	Yeah the good thing is we
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:13,439	| IOT180 |	Come along way with remotely managing updating industrial and elsewhere
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:16,255	| IOT180 |	And if the device itself doesn't have enough
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:21,375	| IOT180 |	Memory to handle that that's an issue it's so it has to be part of the design process that think ahead
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,007	| IOT180 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| IOT180 |	Caillou
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:35,967	| IOT180 |	Yes a new iot botnet
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:42,367	| IOT180 |	As you mentioned
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:44,671	| IOT180 |	D-Link Huawei and Realtek
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,207	| IOT180 |	Routers so
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:51,583	| IOT180 |	Is the Japanese word for according to
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:57,983	| IOT180 |	Yeah this is just your typical I'm going to get on your router and I have donut services and I'm going to pin
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:01,311	| IOT180 |	Report I can see what's on your network
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,591	| IOT180 |	The password or what has
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,127	| IOT180 |	Hard coded
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,919	| IOT180 |	You know from the device maker pastor
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,967	| IOT180 |	Have you didn't change it so you could access
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,527	| IOT180 |	Wi-Fi cameras on your network
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,551	| IOT180 |	Consumer Reports
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:12,831	| IOT180 |	Yeah that's not good
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:15,135	| IOT180 |	I believe
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,208	| IOT180 |	There's no
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,744	| IOT180 |	Fix for this yet I have not
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,768	| IOT180 |	Scene record of one
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:25,376	| IOT180 |	Okay we're optimistic news relare
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,400	| IOT180 |	Which is a
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:27,936	| IOT180 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,960	| IOT180 |	An industrial iot
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,288	| IOT180 |	Acquired by insurance
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,080	| IOT180 |	Munich re
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,872	| IOT180 |	This is a deal that valuable are
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,152	| IOT180 |	300
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:38,176	| IOT180 |	Million-dollar
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,480	| IOT180 |	This is about this is
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:45,088	| IOT180 |	Blair's been doing this for a while. They help companies tie a lot of their
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,112	| IOT180 |	Next products
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,904	| IOT180 |	Together using
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:50,976	| IOT180 |	Customers
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,512	| IOT180 |	They also offer Analytics
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,304	| IOT180 |	And this makes a lot of sense because
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,840	| IOT180 |	I believe there is a
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,144	| IOT180 |	Promising understanding
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,192	| IOT180 |	And things
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,752	| IOT180 |	Maintenance schedules all of this
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,592	| IOT180 |	Actuarial world of Ensure
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:07,872	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,664	| IOT180 |	Getting that kind of data
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,944	| IOT180 |	Pulling it
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,968	| IOT180 |	Being able to
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,248	| IOT180 |	Actually see it
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,272	| IOT180 |	Is going to be important
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,320	| IOT180 |	Going forward
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,368	| IOT180 |	I don't know if the
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,440	| IOT180 |	Companies working with relay or going to be excited about sharing
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,976	| IOT180 |	Christina with insurance
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,512	| IOT180 |	Companies so we'll see how that

EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,816	| IOT180 |	But
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,352	| IOT180 |	I do think this is a highly strategic
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:31,680	| IOT180 |	And one
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:35,520	| IOT180 |	Interesting one of the investors in
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,056	| IOT180 |	One of the later rounds of funding
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,336	| IOT180 |	For this company
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,384	| IOT180 |	Got to get in early on
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,432	| IOT180 |	Indy industrial internet
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,016	| IOT180 |	Corporate and strategic investors are wonderful Sunday
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:46,784	| IOT180 |	Industrial
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| IOT180 |	I will say
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,576	| IOT180 |	Also
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,880	| IOT180 |	In this kind of industrial world
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,416	| IOT180 |	Google the company that makes
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,720	| IOT180 |	All kinds of things this contract
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:58,304	| IOT180 |	Manufacture they are working with Cisco which I associate with
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,072	| IOT180 |	Analytics software
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,096	| IOT180 |	To make a
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,680	| IOT180 |	So if you don't want to design your own board
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,216	| IOT180 |	With it up Memories by the way
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,752	| IOT180 |	In handle all the
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:10,080	| IOT180 |	Analytics aspects and getting all that data to the cloud
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,872	| IOT180 |	Offering out there that
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,432	| IOT180 |	So while we're building your
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:17,248	| IOT180 |	Washing machine we can also have this word in
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:20,576	| IOT180 |	You can start pulling data off of it very easily
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,160	| IOT180 |	For companies that don't want to have to
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,000	| IOT180 |	Some tiny little product
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,816	| IOT180 |	We don't talk too much about these but lucky
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,608	| IOT180 |	Is a crowd-sourced thing
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,632	| IOT180 |	On Kickstarter
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,424	| IOT180 |	Crowdsourcing is like a Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,032	| IOT180 |	Teething
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,568	| IOT180 |	You know where it is
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,384	| IOT180 |	Weider Home
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:49,248	| IOT180 |	Without your key and it also has a sensor in at the tracks when the key was
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,552	| IOT180 |	Turn so you actually know if you lock your door
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,088	| IOT180 |	You can't change anything
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,696	| IOT180 |	You can't remotely fix it
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:04,608	| IOT180 |	He makes Yorkie sort of smart but not so much Sherlock
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT180 |	Exactly
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,656	| IOT180 |	Yes also
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,704	| IOT180 |	At least it's temperature sensors
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,240	| IOT180 |	Rainbow colors
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,032	| IOT180 |	I think this is fine but
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| IOT180 |	Are some negative reviews out there
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,616	| IOT180 |	Yeah there's a review just
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,640	| IOT180 |	Earlier this week
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,712	| IOT180 |	By the Virgin the basically the biggest upgrade
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| IOT180 |	Disappointment
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,528	| IOT180 |	Goodness hasn't changed that much
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,064	| IOT180 |	This is an upgrade
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:26,880	| IOT180 |	And they say does the bare minimum which is
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,208	| IOT180 |	Is the temperature sensor doesn't have presents for example so you can't
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:37,120	| IOT180 |	He's in a room is very limited as programmability because you only have certain blocks of time where you can
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,400	| IOT180 |	Set the temperature
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| IOT180 |	Sensor 2
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,704	| IOT180 |	A certain temperature
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,472	| IOT180 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:47,616	| IOT180 |	Even early riser you want to have somebody new I have a cooler room or warm room at 5 a.m. while you really can't do that with this
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,712	| IOT180 |	What is a temperature sensor
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:55,552	| IOT180 |	Doesn't you know she's not going to do much more I don't think
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,856	| IOT180 |	Yeah you sure that I feel like
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:04,000	| IOT180 |	It should be way smarter so yeah
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,024	| IOT180 |	Is it temperature
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,560	| IOT180 |	We might think that
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,840	| IOT180 |	It would be better to have a temper
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,120	| IOT180 |	Your presence and air quality
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,008	| IOT180 |	Deciding
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:22,944	| IOT180 |	Right that's the key so if you wanted to have all these extra things what would you expect the price to pay if you expect
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,504	| IOT180 |	Pack 499 sensors
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,296	| IOT180 |	No. Like right now at this time
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,624	| IOT180 |	Alright skip ahead

EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,312	| IOT180 |	Should we just
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,360	| IOT180 |	Have them installed the Catholics
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:02,176	| IOT180 |	Cable and audio and go your own way
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,712	| IOT180 |	Do you have another pinion
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:09,344	| IOT180 |	Oh okay this is a good question because I bet a lot of people deal with it
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:13,440	| IOT180 |	Yeah this is the system we put in take it or leave it
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:15,232	| IOT180 |	In this case I'm going to tell you that
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,512	| IOT180 |	Britney actually no longer
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:20,096	| IOT180 |	Intralogic
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:20,864	| IOT180 |	Bye
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,704	| IOT180 |	So you don't have to worry about these troubles there
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,472	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,496	| IOT180 |	I think for us
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,568	| IOT180 |	The big question in this is going to be for you
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,616	| IOT180 |	Rather not
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| IOT180 |	Is
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,688	| IOT180 |	Do you want to put this in your house
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:37,504	| IOT180 |	And just ignore it which is a possibility
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:41,856	| IOT180 |	Do you want to not have it in your house at all which I don't know what that's possibility
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,648	| IOT180 |	Or do you want to try to use it
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,928	| IOT180 |	If you try to use it
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:47,232	| IOT180 |	You're going to be there are some limitations
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,536	| IOT180 |	You will be stuck buying
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,816	| IOT180 |	Interlogix products
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:54,400	| IOT180 |	You can however integrate those with things like that
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:55,936	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:58,496	| IOT180 |	So as far as like crazy Smart Home
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,312	| IOT180 |	Integrating it
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:03,104	| IOT180 |	Necessarily with things like
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,128	| IOT180 |	Or
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:07,456	| IOT180 |	But you could use the voice control of matter made of
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,224	| IOT180 |	Turn things on and off
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,272	| IOT180 |	That's one
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,808	| IOT180 |	And then Kevin
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:14,112	| IOT180 |	Yeah my thought was
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:18,720	| IOT180 |	Ucenter already using like a DIY system you have wink Frozen after he said
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:21,792	| IOT180 |	As do I you not paying any monthly fees
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,560	| IOT180 |	Right now
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,328	| IOT180 |	Obviously
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:26,400	| IOT180 |	I would check in the building should be able to tell you if
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,960	| IOT180 |	The interlogix system has a monthly
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:33,824	| IOT180 |	I personally would not want that which is why I have went and I assume
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,128	| IOT180 |	You feel the same way but
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,920	| IOT180 |	You can change your mind
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,224	| IOT180 |	Maybe there isn't a fee maybe they discount it
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,016	| IOT180 |	I only say this because interlogix
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:45,344	| IOT180 |	Products are sold install through dealers
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:48,160	| IOT180 |	It's not an off-the-shelf anything or you just install it yourself
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,464	| IOT180 |	As a DIY person so I'm assuming
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:52,512	| IOT180 |	There may be a monthly fee involved
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,280	| IOT180 |	Yes if you want to
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:55,840	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:58,400	| IOT180 |	What we have to tell you
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:01,216	| IOT180 |	I'm not 100% sure what you're actually
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,520	| IOT180 |	Like so hopefully this helps
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,080	| IOT180 |	You don't at least have to worry about the bees.
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:06,848	| IOT180 |	And
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,360	| IOT180 |	If you
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:09,408	| IOT180 |	Want to it might be kind of nice
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,944	| IOT180 |	To just be like
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,736	| IOT180 |	Justine Smith anime app
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,016	| IOT180 |	It really depends on how you
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:15,808	| IOT180 |	In how much time
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,624	| IOT180 |	Bat

EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:40,960	| IOT180 |	Improve my
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:44,800	| IOT180 |	You see the capability to reduce the latency and the decisioning
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,104	| IOT180 |	The origin of data
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,128	| IOT180 |	Closer to the origin
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,896	| IOT180 |	Of the problem
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:51,456	| IOT180 |	And on the customer engagement it really
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:54,784	| IOT180 |	Provides the ability for a unique message to a customer
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,552	| IOT180 |	In a unique position

EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,464	| IOT180 |	A couple of categories that
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,256	| IOT180 |	Do you skate
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:04,768	| IOT180 |	Leverage
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,608	| IOT180 |	So openness is a big deal in the internet
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,912	| IOT180 |	How is SAS handling
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:11,424	| IOT180 |	That
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,240	| IOT180 |	Yes so certainly UC wide mark

EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:31,040	| IOT180 |	Location today
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,808	| IOT180 |	Neighborly
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,344	| IOT180 |	What you can do with
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:35,136	| IOT180 |	Highly granular location
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:37,440	| IOT180 |	In the iot and why it matters
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,208	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,768	| IOT180 |	You guys just launched your company
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:43,584	| IOT180 |	But this is something you guys have been working on for
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,864	| IOT180 |	5 years almost
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| IOT180 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:51,776	| IOT180 |	The Genesis of the accompanying idea founding the company really started Nelly for 5 years ago
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:52,800	| IOT180 |	Okay so
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:53,568	| IOT180 |	Let's Orient
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,104	| IOT180 |	People kiss people may not be
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:56,128	| IOT180 |	Really like
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:59,200	| IOT180 |	Why do I need such awesomely granular location
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,736	| IOT180 |	People may not even realize we don't
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,760	| IOT180 |	Have greater
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:02,528	| IOT180 |	Location for Io
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,576	| IOT180 |	So let's talk about the problem
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,624	| IOT180 |	A little bit what is difficult about
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,136	| IOT180 |	Finding thing
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,720	| IOT180 |	Yes I think we already familiar with using
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,000	| IOT180 |	GPS driven
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:12,768	| IOT180 |	Babson
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:15,072	| IOT180 |	Location Technologies in the outdoor
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:15,584	| IOT180 |	Environment
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:21,216	| IOT180 |	I can imagine people navigating without Google Maps or Apple Maps today in the Outdoor World
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:25,056	| IOT180 |	But once we comes to an indoor environment which includes all the way from
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:27,104	| IOT180 |	You know what your commercial buildings off
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,664	| IOT180 |	Retail to factory
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,688	| IOT180 |	Warehouse and Logistics
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,736	| IOT180 |	Facilities and also your home
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:37,600	| IOT180 |	Wiki Lac today Stacy is a very precise way of localization
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:40,672	| IOT180 |	Indoors by precise indoor localization
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:43,232	| IOT180 |	So important is because in terms of
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:48,864	| IOT180 |	Warehouse logistics for example if you want to be able to accurately locate assets
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,424	| IOT180 |	Which includes a patient they cook Mayan people
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,984	| IOT180 |	And ability to locate and then
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:57,824	| IOT180 |	Track them as they moved to these Logistics centers allow or custom
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,896	| IOT180 |	Smurfs to be more efficient increase productivity
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:02,944	| IOT180 |	And get a lot of visibility on what's Happening
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,968	| IOT180 |	Inside their operations
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:10,368	| IOT180 |	On The Other Extreme for example you can imagine having precise localization indoors in your home and buy
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:16,768	| IOT180 |	Understanding where all these devices are that are connecting to each other and you can create a contextually Aver
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,560	| IOT180 |	Environment where consumers can
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:24,960	| IOT180 |	Use these to automate a lot of their in our daily chores that otherwise take a lot of effort to initialize
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:27,264	| IOT180 |	And then in between you have
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,288	| IOT180 |	Different
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,056	| IOT180 |	Application
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:30,080	| IOT180 |	Schleich locating
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,616	| IOT180 |	A certain hospitals
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,152	| IOT180 |	Assets in factories
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,456	| IOT180 |	And cilantro for indoor localization
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:40,320	| IOT180 |	And the position of diet really enables people to be more efficient or productive
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:43,648	| IOT180 |	Can get more visibility on the how things are happening inside their environment
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:49,536	| IOT180 |	And this is also a challenge just when you think about it once I've put a bunch of sensor someplace
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,072	| IOT180 |	Sometimes they move sometimes
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,352	| IOT180 |	Happen
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,144	| IOT180 |	And you want to be able to
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:55,424	| IOT180 |	Know where they are for maintenance
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,216	| IOT180 |	Battery changing
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,800	| IOT180 |	Absolutely and you'll be amazed as to how
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:05,664	| IOT180 |	You know you take the context of just operation and maintenance rate in a commercial building
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,944	| IOT180 |	Pick up large
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:12,320	| IOT180 |	Skyscraper in you have seen on thousands of HP AC units are going to have light bulbs or
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:18,208	| IOT180 |	Lamps all of these overtime in the course of a building life of a building can be 25-30 years
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,488	| IOT180 |	You have no idea where these
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:21,280	| IOT180 |	What was it stored where and what happened
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:24,096	| IOT180 |	And so you know even something as simple as
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| IOT180 |	Smoke detectors
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:29,728	| IOT180 |	And understanding for example knowing the location of these detectors you can
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:33,056	| IOT180 |	Visualize where exactly the fire started wedding has
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:34,592	| IOT180 |	Initiate advice propagating
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,872	| IOT180 |	On The Other Extreme
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:39,200	| IOT180 |	My lamp is not operating in Bronson semaphore
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,480	| IOT180 |	And I can send that right
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,248	| IOT180 |	Technician
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:44,320	| IOT180 |	The 6-8 even before the customer complains about it
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:47,904	| IOT180 |	Idea of location is really really important to an operation in Renton
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:54,560	| IOT180 |	And it goes all the way from commercial buildings you know including a home for example today when you install your smart home devices you have
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:59,936	| IOT180 |	Physically going in log into location for example I have all these Alexa devices
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,704	| IOT180 |	Tooth in my home
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,984	| IOT180 |	That's exactly going
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:04,288	| IOT180 |	And locate right and so I've no contextually
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,104	| IOT180 |	No spatial awareness of a desert
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,384	| IOT180 |	Putting in
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:12,736	| IOT180 |	User representation for that so I descale in Osprey large buildings
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,272	| IOT180 |	That issue gets magnified even more
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,576	| IOT180 |	I can't even imagine I hate having to deal with
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,368	| IOT180 |	So
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,392	| IOT180 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:21,184	| IOT180 |	We've needed this for a while
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,208	| IOT180 |	But we don't have it yet
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,744	| IOT180 |	About the challenges of
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:26,304	| IOT180 |	Joking this inside different in fire
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:32,960	| IOT180 |	The three major challenges that have plagued indoor localization one of them is that the environment that we are trying to
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,008	| IOT180 |	Track and locate things is a dynamic
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,032	| IOT180 |	Imagine a
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:42,432	| IOT180 |	I Logistics facility today where things are moving constantly when we are living in the world of e-commerce where this summer
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,480	| IOT180 |	Which Automation and velocity has increased
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,296	| IOT180 |	So dramatically over the last spinner 510
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:53,696	| IOT180 |	15 years so the dynamic nature makes it very difficult for us to use traditional Technologies every fingerprint
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:57,280	| IOT180 |	And then try to assess if things are actually right they were supposed to be
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:39:01,888	| IOT180 |	The second one is that it or buildings indoor environments have a lot of obstruction
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:08,288	| IOT180 |	You don't have traditional line of sight Technologies like Optical or what even are asking actually
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,104	| IOT180 |	See you at the king or the person that you're trying to locate
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:17,504	| IOT180 |	So this non-line-of-sight is it a significant Challenge and even beyond that once you get past these do you have
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:18,528	| IOT180 |	Have what you call it
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:21,344	| IOT180 |	Multipass like a selection severe physically you can have
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:27,232	| IOT180 |	You know 16 deflections of a given signal and then which one was the real one and which one weather reflection
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:33,632	| IOT180 |	So this idea of eliminating multipath has really played the industry for God's for the longest time so
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:37,216	| IOT180 |	Three main challenges and of course it has to be affordable and
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,752	| IOT180 |	Scalable and cost-effective
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:45,152	| IOT180 |	And you don't want to be deploying something which is not based on a standard those are the main challenges that doesn't look like this
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:46,432	| IOT180 |	It has faced over the last 4 years
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:48,224	| IOT180 |	Man you went for like 3 to 6
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:49,760	| IOT180 |	R7
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,064	| IOT180 |	Lots of companies
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:56,672	| IOT180 |	I have tried to do this and I'm just going to run people through a brief history of indoor location
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,440	| IOT180 |	Nothing
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:02,816	| IOT180 |	GPS GPS and GPS didn't work well with GPS + Wi-Fi so we had
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,352	| IOT180 |	Departure companies like Skyhook
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,656	| IOT180 |	Companies trying to do this
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:10,496	| IOT180 |	And now we're trying to add other radio so there's efforts
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:13,824	| IOT180 |	Laura Bluetooth location efforts
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,360	| IOT180 |	So let's talk about
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,384	| IOT180 |	Why you guys went
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,408	| IOT180 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:18,688	| IOT180 |	Also subject
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:22,528	| IOT180 |	Yes it is 5 V bucks was driven by a
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,808	| IOT180 |	Tina recognition.
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:28,160	| IOT180 |	Two things were happening when is that you know his wife I now become as important as water
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:34,304	| IOT180 |	I mean every building in the world now has Wi-Fi and consumers customers all depend
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:38,656	| IOT180 |	Don by 5 for data communication talk to you in for voice so Wi-Fi
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:40,448	| IOT180 |	Really are the most ubiquitous
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,752	| IOT180 |	Infrastructure that is already present
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,800	| IOT180 |	And will continue to be present
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:47,360	| IOT180 |	That was one very important reason for going with Wi-Fi
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:49,152	| IOT180 |	That reduces the cost and
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:52,224	| IOT180 |	The scale issues that you have it other newer technology
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,784	| IOT180 |	Do you like you and Bluetooth are ultra-wideband
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:41:01,184	| IOT180 |	The second part that we recognize many years ago was that there's an effort to increase the bandwidth in Wi-Fi
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:05,024	| IOT180 |	By that allows Wi-Fi to be even more interesting from a localization
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:10,400	| IOT180 |	Ocean Point of View and that's what really started a few years ago and we were able to understand that
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,448	| IOT180 |	And leverage that a lot in our solution
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:15,776	| IOT180 |	Today so we use our global standard call 11ac
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,568	| IOT180 |	Are witches high bandwidth
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:23,968	| IOT180 |	And which allows us to take advantage of the advances in Wi-Fi kind of combines the two is that
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,504	| IOT180 |	What Vidal ice was that
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,040	| IOT180 |	It's a lot of it has to do with the algorithm
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:33,952	| IOT180 |	And the ability to to do machine learning once you have captured the data that's the reason why by Begin video
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:34,720	| IOT180 |	Attractive
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:37,536	| IOT180 |	Beyond. Just so you know Global standardization
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:41,632	| IOT180 |	Baby looney that Wi-Fi device working in Japan would work in the US or in
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,424	| IOT180 |	Germany or China
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:49,824	| IOT180 |	Produces a lot of concerns with our customers and the ability to use mobile phones is very important as well.
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,640	| IOT180 |	Something that newer Technologies would find difficult to do
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:54,175	| IOT180 |	And then the sub gigahertz
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:56,223	| IOT180 |	Component be used mainly for communication
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:42:02,623	| IOT180 |	Cam site is 2 reduced by 5-day power intensive protocol to the ability to use sub
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,159	| IOT180 |	Gigahertz allows us to den
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:10,047	| IOT180 |	Communicate and maintain the network without leveraging the high-power and Smith and receive functions of Wi-Fi
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:12,607	| IOT180 |	So you guys use radio
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:15,679	| IOT180 |	ORF to understand location but you also have something called a visual sensor
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:16,959	| IOT180 |	About why you're doing
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:20,031	| IOT180 |	When we started looking at this challenge of
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:22,335	| IOT180 |	Uniqa capture and really visualizing
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:26,431	| IOT180 |	The physical space Wikipedia lies was that a lot of the algorithms.
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:30,271	| IOT180 |	People have developed especially on Dai side leverage ratio data
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,831	| IOT180 |	And we are very good at image and video Analytics
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:38,207	| IOT180 |	But the challenge then is that most of the devices that people use in commercial buildings or invade houses
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:40,767	| IOT180 |	6 personalities
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:43,327	| IOT180 |	Security you tend to use a lot of buy a camera
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,631	| IOT180 |	And these are expensive very difficult to win
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:50,751	| IOT180 |	Install into fuel have a million-square-foot facility in a warehouse distribution center
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:54,335	| IOT180 |	You can't deploy these Violet sensors if I have cameras all over these
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:54,847	| IOT180 |	Large building
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:43:01,759	| IOT180 |	Most of the cost is not in the hardware but in the insulation the maintenance the reconfiguration and if you take the lifetime cost
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:06,111	| IOT180 |	Cost-effective becomes really high invented is a visual sensor what you do is
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,391	| IOT180 |	How to use standard
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:08,415	| IOT180 |	Image sensing
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:10,207	| IOT180 |	Components we have not did nothing
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:16,607	| IOT180 |	You know anything exciting about those but then we have modified the protocol of use out on wireless sensor Network in total
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:19,423	| IOT180 |	Call that allows us to transmit image data
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,215	| IOT180 |	And video clips that they look Park
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:24,287	| IOT180 |	Consumption by doing that now if you can do is you can deploy these
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,055	| IOT180 |	These cameras
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:31,455	| IOT180 |	Battery operated cameras all over your facility and if you take an image and video streaming devices
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:37,855	| IOT180 |	For that device cameras do really well with a lots of times you want to take images once a minute once an hour and some cases
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:39,647	| IOT180 |	Customers even take images
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:46,047	| IOT180 |	Once a day so that kind of operation original sensor product is really good so now you can take images from Hyundai
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:48,095	| IOT180 |	Different locations within your facility
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,655	| IOT180 |	And use Ai and advanced Analytics
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,447	| IOT180 |	To get actionable insights and take the
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:56,031	| IOT180 |	Decisions make decisions that you know otherwise would not have been possible
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:57,567	| IOT180 |	Example UK
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:02,175	| IOT180 |	If you have an implementation in a bat house baby use up wireless cameras for tracking
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:04,735	| IOT180 |	What you call a smart truck doc application
EDL	00:44:04,735	00:44:11,135	| IOT180 |	She just literally walking to her house to tease wireless cameras and start monitoring the docks in the warehouse and
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:14,719	| IOT180 |	You got visual data every few minutes or every 5 minutes
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:21,119	| IOT180 |	Vision. You can analyze truck birth utilisation you can take the license plate of the truck you can make it
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:24,959	| IOT180 |	Intelligent Decisions on who the truck driver was with a truck owner was
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,239	| IOT180 |	What was the grill time
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:30,079	| IOT180 |	You can essentially come up with a really intelligent kpi now
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:34,175	| IOT180 |	And monitor the operational efficiency of how your dogs are cooperating
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:36,735	| IOT180 |	Inside the red house just an example or you can
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,015	| IOT180 |	Beautiful security
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,575	| IOT180 |	Can you get four understanding space utilisation
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:43,135	| IOT180 |	In complex areas within your facility
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:45,951	| IOT180 |	I know you could always use it for security and for surveillance as well
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,487	| IOT180 |	So why would I use that
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,583	| IOT180 |	The differences.
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:53,887	| IOT180 |	Bayit camera or the video camera
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,655	| IOT180 |	Essentially
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:55,935	| IOT180 |	Everett have to major in
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:45:01,823	| IOT180 |	This one is that it has to be fired because you're in or trying to take data and streaming across a high bandwidth
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:04,127	| IOT180 |	Vire
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:05,919	| IOT180 |	Insulation cost goes up
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:08,735	| IOT180 |	The maintenance Costco's are because you and also operating cost
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:12,831	| IOT180 |	Because now you're taking large band with files and trying to store them or pasta
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:13,599	| IOT180 |	System in the cloud
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:15,391	| IOT180 |	So what happens then they refused.
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:19,487	| IOT180 |	If you're taking data from just one location or maybe five or six locations
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:22,047	| IOT180 |	That's fine because you can easily afford to do that
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:24,863	| IOT180 |	What if I want to take data from thousands of location
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:26,655	| IOT180 |	Within a million-square-foot
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:31,263	| IOT180 |	Facility or a $54 building you know the cost of both of data capture
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,031	| IOT180 |	Analytics
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,055	| IOT180 |	And storage becomes
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,823	| IOT180 |	Really high
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,591	| IOT180 |	Best Buy
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:40,735	| IOT180 |	Our situation allows you to cost-effectively capture the data across very large spaces and then you can visualize and digit
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:45,087	| IOT180 |	What's the outdoor right sofa example you can literally walk up
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:47,391	| IOT180 |	Low.sex visual sensor devices
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:49,695	| IOT180 |	Hook them up on two different things outdoors
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:50,463	| IOT180 |	And start collecting
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,231	| IOT180 |	Data from them
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:57,631	| IOT180 |	And you don't need any fires you don't need an electrician that could easily move them across from one part of the outdoor location
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:46:01,983	| IOT180 |	That's what makes this so different from anything else that's out there in the market
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:03,519	| IOT180 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:05,567	| IOT180 |	Developing the
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,871	| IOT180 |	While how are people using
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:14,015	| IOT180 |	This two areas have you seen the most significant interest one is from the warehouse and Logistics Market
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:16,831	| IOT180 |	And the second one is from commercial building operation and maintenance
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:21,183	| IOT180 |	Steve Matson Logistics the interest level is very high on understanding
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:22,975	| IOT180 |	Space and acid realization
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:26,303	| IOT180 |	And then enabling his capture to operate
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:29,887	| IOT180 |	Increase efficiency increase productivity gain more visibility and their operation
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,935	| IOT180 |	Inside these Logistics centers
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:35,519	| IOT180 |	A lot of it states has been given by e-commerce there's a strong
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:40,639	| IOT180 |	Organization of their houses real estate costs are going up for these facilities as
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:42,175	| IOT180 |	Consumers are demanding product
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:43,711	| IOT180 |	Closer to their homes
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:50,111	| IOT180 |	Which happens to be no burn areas so in the past you have had a distribution center in Tracy but now it's coming right into your into South
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:52,927	| IOT180 |	San Francisco going all the way into downtown Sanford
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:58,047	| IOT180 |	Just go and see if you take more complex cities like Tokyo and New York the cost of organized spaces
EDL	00:46:58,047	00:46:58,815	| IOT180 |	Is really high
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:02,399	| IOT180 |	So understanding space utilization is one of the most interesting
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:08,799	| IOT180 |	Use cases that you have seen to the ability to use both the visual sensor and our location local positioning system
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:12,895	| IOT180 |	Our customers can understand how space is being utilized and there's a part of that then
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,967	| IOT180 |	Becomes an expert know how much
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:21,343	| IOT180 |	Forklift people resources at the right resources available at the right time at the right space
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:28,255	| IOT180 |	What did I place those are actionable insights that customers really are interested in pain. Commercial side there's a lot of interest on
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:32,863	| IOT180 |	Commercial buildings lot of interest also by the way in specialization as you know Laura
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:33,631	| IOT180 |	Usra
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:35,679	| IOT180 |	Inside Global buildings are underutilized
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:42,079	| IOT180 |	And so using our visual sensor and location devices people will become more efficient in how they
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:47,967	| IOT180 |	Do you space within commercial offices in using our products for operation maintenance
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:50,527	| IOT180 |	People are using a cameras for examples for
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:52,063	| IOT180 |	American rooftops in
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:54,111	| IOT180 |	In other parts of the building
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:56,927	| IOT180 |	Security and surveillance reading a much larger
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:48:03,327	| IOT180 |	Scope of security within larger complexes which are traditional camera Solutions cannot cover some of the interesting
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:05,119	| IOT180 |	Can you say seductive come across so far
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:08,447	| IOT180 |	You like many companies are building a platform
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:09,983	| IOT180 |	That could really
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,775	| IOT180 |	Go in any number of Industry
EDL	00:48:11,775	00:48:15,359	| IOT180 |	But it's also so far been very easy to see that
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:16,895	| IOT180 |	Many of the most successful
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:21,503	| IOT180 |	Iot in the Enterprise in industrial space focus on just a few areas
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:23,295	| IOT180 |	Sino Logistics is
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:23,807	| IOT180 |	Big deal for you
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:26,111	| IOT180 |	Are there other areas where you
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:26,879	| IOT180 |	You guys are going to
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:27,391	| IOT180 |	Try to be high
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:32,767	| IOT180 |	You think Logistics is definitely the the primary focus of the company
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:34,303	| IOT180 |	But then once you go beyond
EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:36,095	| IOT180 |	Logistics commercial buildings
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:41,983	| IOT180 |	Because again as you know a lot of iot solutions have not been very successful with commercial buildings
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:44,031	| IOT180 |	Security and surveillance dance
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:46,591	| IOT180 |	To be the one that people look at but if you
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:47,871	| IOT180 |	Take a step back in
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:50,175	| IOT180 |	Once you have better indoor location
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:54,783	| IOT180 |	What can I do with that if I can improve office occupancy space utilization
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:49:00,159	| IOT180 |	Then can I be more efficient with not only space but also work operations
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:00,927	| IOT180 |	Tobacco
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,207	| IOT180 |	You know kind of look at
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:06,559	| IOT180 |	Our Technologies as applicable to smart home it's just like that's a slightly different Market
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:10,911	| IOT180 |	Not our main focus directly right now but in a partnering with some of the
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,447	| IOT180 |	Larger companies were
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:18,847	| IOT180 |	Sinnoh focused on Smart Home Technology to build in location into the home which is has you no sodium
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:19,359	| IOT180 |	Missing at this point
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:21,151	| IOT180 |	Yes or if not missing
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:22,687	| IOT180 |	Manually inputted
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:23,199	| IOT180 |	Anything that
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:29,599	| IOT180 |	PSD to set up a smart home today
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:34,207	| IOT180 |	This is also kind of nice because it can auto update
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:35,999	| IOT180 |	Correct if I move something around
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,535	| IOT180 |	It's like
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,071	| IOT180 |	Now it's different
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:41,119	| IOT180 |	Inertial sensors in all devices
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:47,519	| IOT180 |	Tuesday similar to your phone so if you move to example interview are using them already in our warehouse application example
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:50,335	| IOT180 |	I know that now it's on the move and so now we can start tracking
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:54,687	| IOT180 |	That makes the device lot more efficient in terms of power consumption and
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:55,455	| IOT180 |	The New York
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:56,479	| IOT180 |	Cinnamon tanning everyday
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:57,759	| IOT180 |	A meaningful strike
