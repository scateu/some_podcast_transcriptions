EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,248	| IOT079 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,528	| IOT079 |	Let's start off with
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:28,320	| IOT079 |	Your disclaimer since we're going to
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:28,832	| IOT079 |	Shake It Off with goo
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:36,000	| IOT079 |	Oh that's right I do have to say that so I do work for Google I do not work in their smart home area which is obvious
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:39,840	| IOT079 |	Talk about and all opinions are my own not my employers
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:42,912	| IOT079 |	And I know that they're sending you some dollars under the
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:44,704	| IOT079 |	Atlantic Avenue
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:50,592	| IOT079 |	Well they're probably been paying me too because I'm really excited about what we saw it
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,360	| IOT079 |	So Google
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,896	| IOT079 |	Announce the whole slew
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,944	| IOT079 |	New pixel phones
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:58,272	| IOT079 |	Those look lovely but we're not going to talk much about those cuz we're not a phone show
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,112	| IOT079 |	They also announced a new router called Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,392	| IOT079 |	And
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:08,768	| IOT079 |	Google home the much-talked-about competitor to the Amazon Echo so it is a personal assistant
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:09,792	| IOT079 |	And speaker
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:16,704	| IOT079 |	Yeah the end Google home actually was introduced at Google IO back in May of this year so now that Prada
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,728	| IOT079 |	What is actually
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,800	| IOT079 |	Available yet they can pre-order I believe
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:26,944	| IOT079 |	You can pre-order it it's $129 it comes with these like swappable bases so it's a it's an air freshener
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:29,760	| IOT079 |	Color coded base for
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT079 |	The Hive speaker
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,856	| IOT079 |	If the smell of iot in the morning
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:39,744	| IOT079 |	Mine I ordered it yesterday mine is estimated to arrive
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:40,768	| IOT079 |	November 8th
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:48,960	| IOT079 |	What do you what do you think of the pricing and the reason I asked is because obviously the Echo goes for $180.
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,984	| IOT079 |	This is 130
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,800	| IOT079 |	But of course Amazon recently
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:55,616	| IOT079 |	Did the dot 2.0 for $49
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:03:00,224	| IOT079 |	So I will have to wait and see how the speaker sounds
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,040	| IOT079 |	But I feel like the echo is now to expand
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,624	| IOT079 |	Just like if you're if you know nothing about the products
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,928	| IOT079 |	And again I still haven't lived with
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,440	| IOT079 |	The product I think
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:13,024	| IOT079 |	Really important to say yes
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| IOT079 |	The echo
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,304	| IOT079 |	Could be
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,584	| IOT079 |	Price too high
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,888	| IOT079 |	And but what I imagine is
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,168	| IOT079 |	We're going to see some amazing black
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,984	| IOT079 |	Videos were Cyber Monday on Amazon
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| IOT079 |	Tuesday
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| IOT079 |	Whatever
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| IOT079 |	Captain's coming into the holiday
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:32,736	| IOT079 |	And folks can always find referral to recertify decos probably for like 1:40 to 1:15 to save a few bucks anyway at any
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,016	| IOT079 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:37,344	| IOT079 |	So let's dig into some of the things that I was like
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:40,160	| IOT079 |	Oh this is cool and then some of the things that I was like
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,440	| IOT079 |	This is missing
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,816	| IOT079 |	Talk about the missing because you ordered one of these and I did not
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,120	| IOT079 |	Yok we should ask why do
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,400	| IOT079 |	Fort Irwin
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,704	| IOT079 |	Well the main reason is that
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:57,056	| IOT079 |	I've been a huge proponent and fan and user of the Google
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,128	| IOT079 |	OK Google services I'm sorry I just turned everybody's feeling on it
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,152	| IOT079 |	I apologize
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:06,016	| IOT079 |	We should okay before you get into this we need and create a code word like she who shall not be named
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,320	| IOT079 |	Bi-Rite cuz I'm getting a lot of complaints
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,904	| IOT079 |	So what should we do this
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,928	| IOT079 |	The G-Man
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,720	| IOT079 |	No cuz it's a woman 2
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,512	| IOT079 |	Assistant can we just call it
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| IOT079 |	We'll just we'll just call you Google Assistant
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,911	| IOT079 |	China
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,727	| IOT079 |	Google assistant is really
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,495	| IOT079 |	You could say the
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,799	| IOT079 |	The maturity and
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:32,383	| IOT079 |	Combination of the old Google Now and Google on tap
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:38,015	| IOT079 |	And it's now built into home and you can speak into it just like Alexa and
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| IOT079 |	I did that too
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,111	| IOT079 |	And you can speak
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,719	| IOT079 |	And you can speak to it like you can with an Amazon Echo and it will respond
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:52,607	| IOT079 |	I'm so it has a lot of similar capabilities and ecosystem which for Android folks
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| IOT079 |	That's a good thing I think
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:05:00,031	| IOT079 |	But what it doesn't have at least at launch is enough partners for me to actually purchase it
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:02,591	| IOT079 |	And that's because it's limited
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:05,919	| IOT079 |	Two working with Samsung SmartThings
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,711	| IOT079 |	If this then that
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,271	| IOT079 |	Nest obviously and Philips Hue
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,855	| IOT079 |	So what's missing for me personally is Winx
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| IOT079 |	You love your wink
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:21,535	| IOT079 |	Now I feel and in this is something I haven't had a chance to report out cuz I was on a plane
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,863	| IOT079 |	I feel that in the next couple of weeks
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| IOT079 |	6
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,423	| IOT079 |	We're going to see a lot of
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:27,935	| IOT079 |	New partners com
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:32,031	| IOT079 |	That's that is my hunch
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,847	| IOT079 |	Because I know that I talk to people in the smartphone
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,383	| IOT079 |	Community and they are
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,455	| IOT079 |	Eager to get involved here so I think this might be kind of a
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,015	| IOT079 |	I don't know if it was a rushed kind of lunch
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,807	| IOT079 |	But I do think
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,415	| IOT079 |	Keeping things under wrap and also
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,463	| IOT079 |	Which they did not do
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:58,655	| IOT079 |	Clearly this was not ready for a launch in May when it was introduced and that's
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,191	| IOT079 |	Obviously it didn't watch
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,215	| IOT079 |	It happened now
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| IOT079 |	You would think that
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:08,383	| IOT079 |	The product team behind you go home with working to integrate partners and
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,919	| IOT079 |	Those potential Partners had it
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,455	| IOT079 |	Information to make that happen
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:16,319	| IOT079 |	Maybe there was some early lunch deals like a would mean you can be our top three
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,855	| IOT079 |	First Partners in Seoul
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,367	| IOT079 |	I don't know
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,159	| IOT079 |	I think you're right I think
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,743	| IOT079 |	Google lies heavily on partnership in an open platform
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,815	| IOT079 |	It says here you're the product go do with it what you will
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:30,655	| IOT079 |	So you're right I would think within the next few months we should see
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,935	| IOT079 |	More announcements from partners
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| IOT079 |	My Hope
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,239	| IOT079 |	No
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,775	| IOT079 |	There was some discussion
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| IOT079 |	About if you worked with Amazon Echo that you
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:38,591	| IOT079 |	You wouldn't be worth
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,871	| IOT079 |	With Google
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,943	| IOT079 |	There were reports of that some exclusivity stuff
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:49,343	| IOT079 |	But I haven't read anything official on that I haven't seen any Partners comment on that
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,903	| IOT079 |	It doesn't make SmartThings works with the echo
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,975	| IOT079 |	Philips Hue works with Echo and homekit
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,535	| IOT079 |	I'm trying to think
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,839	| IOT079 |	If this then that works with that buddy
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:03,167	| IOT079 |	Yeah so that kind of proves the fact that it's probably not exclusivity thing
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,471	| IOT079 |	So so that's good
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:05,983	| IOT079 |	Now
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| IOT079 |	Now
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,031	| IOT079 |	So you're not buying
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,567	| IOT079 |	Cuz you want wink support
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,127	| IOT079 |	Yet yet
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,895	| IOT079 |	Sorry
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,175	| IOT079 |	And I would say so
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,967	| IOT079 |	Wait we mention the partners
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:19,295	| IOT079 |	I would like to see and I think the smart home Community would like to see
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,831	| IOT079 |	Wink support
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:27,231	| IOT079 |	I know that I talk to the CEO of August Jason Johnson and he's looking at supporting this because any voice activation
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,999	| IOT079 |	That's really key
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,791	| IOT079 |	For their products
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:34,399	| IOT079 |	And then I'd also like to see the Logitech Harmony home hub because a lot of people seem to have that in like
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,471	| IOT079 |	That is actually really
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,775	| IOT079 |	Good thing to integrate with us because you can be like
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,383	| IOT079 |	Google Assistant turn on my Netflix
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,431	| IOT079 |	Why not
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:53,087	| IOT079 |	Although that I was just going to say that actually can be done with the Chromecast
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:56,415	| IOT079 |	Because Google home does speak to Chromecast if you have one in the house
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,999	| IOT079 |	And Googled it announced a new 4k Chromecast yesterday as well
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,791	| IOT079 |	Apps that you can say
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,839	| IOT079 |	At least at launch
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,911	| IOT079 |	You can say play this video on Youtube it'll
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,727	| IOT079 |	Put on your TV voice control the TV
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:13,311	| IOT079 |	Netflix was announced as a early first partner's well it's not
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,359	| IOT079 |	There yet but they did demonstrate
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,431	| IOT079 |	Hey show me whatever movie on Netflix and Hulu
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| IOT079 |	Thanks
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,759	| IOT079 |	Stranger things which is very good by the way
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:26,111	| IOT079 |	You do get voice control of a TV and it's one of the things that I've always felt as lacking width
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,415	| IOT079 |	My echo and Fire TV box
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,463	| IOT079 |	Guess they don't talk to each other
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,487	| IOT079 |	And that that is silly
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,791	| IOT079 |	I'm not sure Amazon's getting on the
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,303	| IOT079 |	I'm at right now
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,607	| IOT079 |	The other thing
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,399	| IOT079 |	Because
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,679	| IOT079 |	Google watch this
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,751	| IOT079 |	Nuding is
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| IOT079 |	That you can actually Chromecast
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,591	| IOT079 |	To other speakers
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:50,175	| IOT079 |	With auxiliary power so if you have a Chromecast audio
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,783	| IOT079 |	And I think those are like $35 for a Chromecast audio
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,599	| IOT079 |	If you plug that into like the back of one of your Sonos
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,367	| IOT079 |	Place or something
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,647	| IOT079 |	Like that then you can
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,671	| IOT079 |	Can Chromecast
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| IOT079 |	To that Sonos
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,487	| IOT079 |	Talking to it via app
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,303	| IOT079 |	Sorry talking to it via
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| IOT079 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:14,495	| IOT079 |	Right so that gets really interesting and I should also know that the Google home also comes with support for tuna in pan
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,775	| IOT079 |	Pandora Spotify
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,311	| IOT079 |	In a couple other
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,687	| IOT079 |	Services very similar services and it also let you set a default most likely
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| IOT079 |	Rail
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:28,319	| IOT079 |	For the music folks this could be a really exciting
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:31,647	| IOT079 |	Dang if you have like a bunch of Sonos is lying around and you don't want to wait
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,415	| IOT079 |	2017
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,951	| IOT079 |	With the Echoes go
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,463	| IOT079 |	Look at that support
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,279	| IOT079 |	Yep make sense
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:37,791	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,071	| IOT079 |	That is all that
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| IOT079 |	That is all there I bought mine
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| IOT079 |	Until you guys
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,447	| IOT079 |	At the second I would wrap that thing
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,287	| IOT079 |	We're getting on the show and recording something
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,567	| IOT079 |	Maybe we'll do a back and forth in
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,151	| IOT079 |	I will owe the other thing I was going to say is
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,175	| IOT079 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,735	| IOT079 |	They have different voices
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,759	| IOT079 |	Great Lake
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,807	| IOT079 |	These must have been recorded demos because
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,855	| IOT079 |	The voice quality did not sound
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,367	| IOT079 |	Great
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| IOT079 |	The Google Device
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:08,255	| IOT079 |	And I was a little saddened by that because it sounded kind of like
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,583	| IOT079 |	The Google voice thing was at the bottom of a well
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:18,495	| IOT079 |	Yeah I don't know when they put together the demo videos and and whatnot I do know that
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,055	| IOT079 |	Sundar pichai a talk about how Google does
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:25,663	| IOT079 |	Natural language processing and Records tons and tons and tons of phrases inside chin
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:32,831	| IOT079 |	I didn't get the demo anything I actually had my hands on a pixel phone and in New York City yesterday but I did not try Google assistant on
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,111	| IOT079 |	I didn't have a chance to us
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,135	| IOT079 |	I can't really
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,207	| IOT079 |	Can't say either way I guess we have to wait and see you for the final product
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:41,535	| IOT079 |	Yeah and I'm outside looking forward to a couple things I'm looking forward
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| IOT079 |	2
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,351	| IOT079 |	A better Interactive
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,119	| IOT079 |	Back and forth
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,911	| IOT079 |	Things to Google Assistant
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,679	| IOT079 |	I'm also looking
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:51,775	| IOT079 |	Poor Dad in the power of Google search on the device as opposed to Bing
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,335	| IOT079 |	Is there times when I'm like
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,895	| IOT079 |	I just want to say you know she who shall not be named
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,455	| IOT079 |	What's a spice that goes well with asparagus
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,991	| IOT079 |	And if I ask
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,295	| IOT079 |	I get an answer
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,831	| IOT079 |	If I asked
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,647	| IOT079 |	And then that speaks again to
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| IOT079 |	Sunrise presentation were
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,231	| IOT079 |	Pretty sure a December he said something like
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| IOT079 |	Dundee
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:16,095	| IOT079 |	Machine learning aspect heading out of the knowledge graph now has
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,375	| IOT079 |	70s
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,423	| IOT079 |	Billion + 70 billion
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:23,263	| IOT079 |	It knows 70 billion people places things cutting out
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:28,127	| IOT079 |	Especially saying Hey Google we have all the information and we're making it available to you in a
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,431	| IOT079 |	Easy way to access
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,991	| IOT079 |	Ed and you actually mention something
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,271	| IOT079 |	Else I don't know if we
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,295	| IOT079 |	Specifically said
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,319	| IOT079 |	You said you were
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:39,391	| IOT079 |	Jersey or you were looking forward to interacting with it
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,207	| IOT079 |	Because it's contextual
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,023	| IOT079 |	You can can carry on a conversation
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,863	| IOT079 |	And you don't need to repeat certain keywords so to speak so
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| IOT079 |	You say who is the
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,703	| IOT079 |	Who wrote stranger things
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,263	| IOT079 |	And then you later say what is his birthday
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:59,103	| IOT079 |	You don't have to mention him by name so there's that aspect which I think some of the
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,687	| IOT079 |	AI bits like an Siri and the echo kind of fall short
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,319	| IOT079 |	I knew you were going to know that isn't that crazy
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,111	| IOT079 |	Example
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,391	| IOT079 |	See you just handed me the ball
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,231	| IOT079 |	I know it's not on the show notes folk she recalled that from memory
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| IOT079 |	From Henry
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,791	| IOT079 |	Useless things I know
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| IOT079 |	Oh that useless
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,863	| IOT079 |	Okay so
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,399	| IOT079 |	We should also talk about Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,215	| IOT079 |	Because in addition to home
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| IOT079 |	And
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,055	| IOT079 |	Some people were hoping that Google home and the wife I would be like
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,151	| IOT079 |	But you know I was when I was one of those people
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,247	| IOT079 |	I hoped that it would be you know kind of a
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,271	| IOT079 |	Voice assistant
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,319	| IOT079 |	And Mesh networking router thing but it's
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,087	| IOT079 |	Just a mess
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,391	| IOT079 |	Networking router thing just a mesh Network
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:49,279	| IOT079 |	Jobs that make you go we would be like
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,631	| IOT079 |	You know I want one of these
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,191	| IOT079 |	Very badly because I have an onhub and
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:01,567	| IOT079 |	There are a few areas in my house where my wife is not that great we could really use a mesh Network
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,639	| IOT079 |	But I don't know even though I tested the Euros
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,175	| IOT079 |	Which were great
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:09,503	| IOT079 |	I don't know that I want to spend like $5 for a set of euros
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| IOT079 |	Now
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,599	| IOT079 |	And not all you can spend
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:22,047	| IOT079 |	It's 129 for a single pack of Google Wi-Fi so one edition
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,071	| IOT079 |	And it's
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,351	| IOT079 |	299 free
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:24,863	| IOT079 |	3 pack
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:28,191	| IOT079 |	So that's a big price difference
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,239	| IOT079 |	They will be available for pre-order
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,263	| IOT079 |	In the US in November
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,079	| IOT079 |	And they will also be sold at
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,127	| IOT079 |	Amazon Best Buy
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:36,895	| IOT079 |	Walmart
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,943	| IOT079 |	That's weird cuz Amazon doesn't sell
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,759	| IOT079 |	Amazon doesn't sell Chromecast but
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,551	| IOT079 |	That's different
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,879	| IOT079 |	That's so here's a question for you and see if you know the answer to this one
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,647	| IOT079 |	Smarty pants
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,951	| IOT079 |	Why are they selling a
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,463	| IOT079 |	Single pack
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,023	| IOT079 |	Network extender
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,559	| IOT079 |	What would it work with
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:57,119	| IOT079 |	Well it's not just a network extender you can
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,143	| IOT079 |	Habitat is your router
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,471	| IOT079 |	I believe so
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,751	| IOT079 |	It can messaging wasn't
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,055	| IOT079 |	Next to your land
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:10,687	| IOT079 |	I believe it maybe they're selling a single pack if it's not an actual router
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,711	| IOT079 |	To work with you
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,807	| IOT079 |	Bingo
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,831	| IOT079 |	It was something I had hoped
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,879	| IOT079 |	That I would hear about
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,951	| IOT079 |	On stage with the product they didn't mention it however
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,511	| IOT079 |	Being happy on HUB owner
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:29,375	| IOT079 |	I went and checked the onhub support Pages which were updated to show that
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,191	| IOT079 |	You can add a Google wifi device
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,215	| IOT079 |	To an onhub
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:38,847	| IOT079 |	Why that wasn't discussed I don't know why cuz it was like they killed the onhub that's I mean I saw
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,895	| IOT079 |	25 comments immediately
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| IOT079 |	Nope
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,199	| IOT079 |	If this is an in addition to
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,759	| IOT079 |	They also other the on HUB has it
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,599	| IOT079 |	This device for smart home people you're going to like this it has a Bluetooth radio
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:55,999	| IOT079 |	So you got Wi-Fi + Bluetooth radio which means all of those tiny little doorbell chimes or
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,559	| IOT079 |	Lock Bridges or anything
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,863	| IOT079 |	That has a Bluetooth radio in it
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,679	| IOT079 |	Will eventually be able to be supported by the
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,191	| IOT079 |	Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:08,543	| IOT079 |	So that's exciting for people who don't want
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,055	| IOT079 |	How to plug in a bunch of
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,615	| IOT079 |	Yay
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,175	| IOT079 |	And we're going to see that in a lot of routers that's not
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,967	| IOT079 |	Going to be specific to this but like
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:20,063	| IOT079 |	If you're buying a new router anytime in the near future in your vested in the Smart Home
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,623	| IOT079 |	I would look at like securifi
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:25,951	| IOT079 |	This one I think the Netflix orbi might be Bluetooth ready to
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,511	| IOT079 |	I'm so start looking for
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,559	| IOT079 |	Bluetooth is part of your router
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,375	| IOT079 |	I'm a double check on the orbi because you
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,167	| IOT079 |	It's always worthwhile to say
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,959	| IOT079 |	Hello
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT079 |	I'm not seeing
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,287	| IOT079 |	Not simply
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,615	| IOT079 |	Dyson
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:50,015	| IOT079 |	Putting Bluetooth in router doesn't make sense in the morning get rid of hubs so to speak and I'm all for it number one and I shall sacrifice
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,551	| IOT079 |	You are absolutely right this is a router by itself
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,111	| IOT079 |	It is so cute you were right
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,439	| IOT079 |	I love it
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| IOT079 |	This happens so rarely
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| IOT079 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:00,511	| IOT079 |	EXO
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,791	| IOT079 |	That is
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,071	| IOT079 |	The Riders Inn
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:06,911	| IOT079 |	Guys I'm going to tell you so I am actually reporting out a story on
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,727	| IOT079 |	The right router for your smart home
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,263	| IOT079 |	Which could be like
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,567	| IOT079 |	Holy Grail Quest because
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,847	| IOT079 |	It may never be complete
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,639	| IOT079 |	I don't know if that's really
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:18,943	| IOT079 |	Who's there
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,503	| IOT079 |	But I'm hearing a lot of mixed reports from
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,271	| IOT079 |	People about
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,135	| IOT079 |	You know if there's too many devices in a lot of these mesh networks it becomes
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,159	| IOT079 |	Really congested
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:33,535	| IOT079 |	I know that there are things about like how Apple sends data around a home network that is
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,815	| IOT079 |	Makes it really hard for
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,351	| IOT079 |	People with mesh Networks
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,375	| IOT079 |	An Apple devices
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:41,471	| IOT079 |	This is not me saying that mesh networks are bad it's just
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,263	| IOT079 |	There seems to be
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,335	| IOT079 |	3 by 4 kitted user experience
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:49,919	| IOT079 |	And it seems to be related to the number of Gadgets in the types of gadgets you haven't
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:53,247	| IOT079 |	So in my quest to help our listeners
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| IOT079 |	I'm looking into all this for
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,087	| IOT079 |	I'll let you know what I find
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,647	| IOT079 |	It does require me to purchase a crazy expensive
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,695	| IOT079 |	Spectrum analyzer so I'm hoping the
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,463	| IOT079 |	That I can just get that
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:04,511	| IOT079 |	Borrowed for a little while
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:10,911	| IOT079 |	Yes it would be the texas-based to FCC Testing Lab
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:17,567	| IOT079 |	Let's see next story are we done with Google do we feel like we have sufficiently discuss Google
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:23,455	| IOT079 |	I think we have like I said when I can talk about the phones those were the two those are the two i o t a
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,759	| IOT079 |	Types of things to talk about the end
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:30,367	| IOT079 |	It's all we can do is talk about them now since we can't actually get the products in hand just yet so I think so
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:34,463	| IOT079 |	There we go anything Google can do to expedite my shipment I am all on it
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| IOT079 |	Ready to test
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,279	| IOT079 |	We'll see what happens
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,839	| IOT079 |	Alright so the next big story
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,887	| IOT079 |	Actually let's do a quick update
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,655	| IOT079 |	Because last week
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,703	| IOT079 |	Talk about your Apple to Hawaii
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:49,823	| IOT079 |	Watch all the Apple watch 3 that's right I did real quick say I was going to run a half marathon and test the battery life so
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:53,151	| IOT079 |	I ran an hour 50 and I had Bluetooth
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,175	| IOT079 |	Free music
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,479	| IOT079 |	Heart rate monitor and GPS
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:18:02,879	| IOT079 |	Battery went down 43% so with all the radios and sensors on I'm thinking it's at least a four hour
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,927	| IOT079 |	Device for you exercise feedings
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,951	| IOT079 |	Everybody else
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,231	| IOT079 |	Exercising
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| IOT079 |	Get up and move number one
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:13,887	| IOT079 |	Your wash it easily last a day mine always last more than a day so
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:18,495	| IOT079 |	Got it you know a Dancing with the Stars they practice they do for our practices isn't that insane
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,287	| IOT079 |	Like exercise
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,639	| IOT079 |	Sorry I I learned this fact and I was like
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,151	| IOT079 |	Holy Jim
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:29,247	| IOT079 |	Calories being burned
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,271	| IOT079 |	Yeah. One of those people I lose
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:32,319	| IOT079 |	Okay so
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,367	| IOT079 |	Let's move right along to iot botnet
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:41,023	| IOT079 |	We can talk about this attack last
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,071	| IOT079 |	But now there's more information
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:46,143	| IOT079 |	There is and it's worth saying because I didn't
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,191	| IOT079 |	But when we recorded last week.
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| IOT079 |	Yet to do
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,287	| IOT079 |	My interviews that are structured at the
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:57,407	| IOT079 |	I have yet to do the interviews at the structure security conference with a bunch of people about iot and security
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,735	| IOT079 |	So I learned a lot of new things that I thought was worth sharing
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,015	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,831	| IOT079 |	To refresh
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,623	| IOT079 |	Deer are too big
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| IOT079 |	Botnets
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,159	| IOT079 |	It were
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,951	| IOT079 |	Unleashed upon the world
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:14,047	| IOT079 |	That relieves it that got up to about 6 between 600 in
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:18,399	| IOT079 |	Whatever they sent they they measured it like 1.5 terabits per second
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,959	| IOT079 |	Which is a lot
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,727	| IOT079 |	Atrophic
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,519	| IOT079 |	So what was happening is
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:28,127	| IOT079 |	Originally Brian Krebs was forced offline Brian Krebs as a security researcher
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:32,479	| IOT079 |	Because of this botnet attack that reached between 600 and 700
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,527	| IOT079 |	Gigabits
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| IOT079 |	Per second
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,063	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,623	| IOT079 |	Massive Attack one of the largest we've ever seen
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,135	| IOT079 |	And
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:42,719	| IOT079 |	There was another against it is pee called ovh
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,511	| IOT079 |	And that was
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,023	| IOT079 |	Bigger
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,047	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,095	| IOT079 |	These were made of
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:51,679	| IOT079 |	Iot devices so I was like oh my God this is
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,703	| IOT079 |	Terrible
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:57,823	| IOT079 |	And they were actually made of networked DVRs which is not a tradition this isn't like your refrig
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,871	| IOT079 |	Auto Repair happened fridges that are par
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,383	| IOT079 |	Certified Nets
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,919	| IOT079 |	This is
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,223	| IOT079 |	These closed-circuit video cameras that
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:06,015	| IOT079 |	Small businesses deploy
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:11,647	| IOT079 |	And then they later connect them to the Internet so they can be like I can watch someone robbed my store
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,415	| IOT079 |	For the comfort of my own
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,487	| IOT079 |	Orlo the Fire HD
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,255	| IOT079 |	In HD
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:21,887	| IOT079 |	So what's happening is people are taking over these devices because people don't update them
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,935	| IOT079 |	They're not really designed to be always connect
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:24,959	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:27,263	| IOT079 |	People are concerned
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:34,431	| IOT079 |	The flipside to our privacy worries and security where is on the internet of things that we always talk about white people hacking into your baby
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,199	| IOT079 |	Monitors
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,967	| IOT079 |	Is
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,503	| IOT079 |	The people are actually
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:41,855	| IOT079 |	Turning all of these devices into botnets and using your home's bandwidth
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,135	| IOT079 |	2
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:47,999	| IOT079 |	Watch these crazy massive attacks it because there's so many devices and their into many homes
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:53,119	| IOT079 |	It's less a function of so many it's more a function of their spread out and that they're not updated
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:55,935	| IOT079 |	They can be used for
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,727	| IOT079 |	4 years on these crazy attack
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,751	| IOT079 |	Because nobody's like
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:02,335	| IOT079 |	I'm like a computer slowing down you don't notice when your DVR is like
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,871	| IOT079 |	Siphoning off bandwidth
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:09,759	| IOT079 |	Their there they're not devices that you would be paying this kind of attention to and then she said they're very distributed
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,039	| IOT079 |	Now what
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,599	| IOT079 |	Really interesting what I learned at the structure security
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,879	| IOT079 |	Conference is there's like
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,184	| IOT079 |	Two to three groups that are actually
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:21,024	| IOT079 |	Organizing and controlling these botnets and what's happening is
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,328	| IOT079 |	As they fight each other
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,120	| IOT079 |	They're going out
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:25,632	| IOT079 |	And patching
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| IOT079 |	The devices for
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,216	| IOT079 |	Are people so their enemies can't use it
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,520	| IOT079 |	I like you
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,056	| IOT079 |	Thanks but also
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,384	| IOT079 |	This feels
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,152	| IOT079 |	This feels scary
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| IOT079 |	Little out of control
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,712	| IOT079 |	Light outage
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,992	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,016	| IOT079 |	And that brings us to our
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| IOT079 |	Next story
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,600	| IOT079 |	Segway
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,368	| IOT079 |	Be way more effective
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:52,512	| IOT079 |	The Segway has released this week Shirley Tuesday
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:53,792	| IOT079 |	A
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| IOT079 |	Checklist
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,656	| IOT079 |	On enhancing the security privacy and safety of
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,936	| IOT079 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,776	| IOT079 |	This is a great tracklist and this is brought To Us by the same group
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:07,360	| IOT079 |	That they had last year worked with the
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:09,152	| IOT079 |	National Association of Realtors
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,688	| IOT079 |	To do a smart home
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,736	| IOT079 |	Like decommissioning checklist that was
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,248	| IOT079 |	Really helpful
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:22,208	| IOT079 |	New checklist which I will link to in the show note so you all can download it
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| IOT079 |	A lot of its common sense
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,048	| IOT079 |	It has things like you don't
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:29,632	| IOT079 |	Know all the devices with your home and workplace that are connected to the internet
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,496	| IOT079 |	I'm just able to unload it on use devices
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,776	| IOT079 |	I have a pet peeve here though
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:37,824	| IOT079 |	This is a great thing to do I try to do it
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,384	| IOT079 |	But even things like my Eero
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,944	| IOT079 |	Or even when I had software that measured my devices
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,480	| IOT079 |	Imagine that based on
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,576	| IOT079 |	You're all those aren't always
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,112	| IOT079 |	Telling you what they are
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,672	| IOT079 |	Yeah that's that's tricky
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:56,768	| IOT079 |	You're not trying to plug the product because if I work for it's just a product that I used
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,792	| IOT079 |	With the onhub
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:04,192	| IOT079 |	You can actually name devices and you have a better sense of what they are like like to suck hell out of them self identify which
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:07,776	| IOT079 |	I do see some mac addresses in the list of devices but
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:09,312	| IOT079 |	They are far and few between
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,592	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:16,224	| IOT079 |	So yeah my time I'm looking at my Eros right now to see what I can see on the network
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,760	| IOT079 |	Take a minute
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,296	| IOT079 |	When I
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,344	| IOT079 |	Like some of them are great
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,392	| IOT079 |	But then a lot of them are named after like
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,672	| IOT079 |	Bishop's like summer like
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,952	| IOT079 |	Crazy number Nest Labs Inc
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,768	| IOT079 |	Sound like okay I only have one Nest devices
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,792	| IOT079 |	My house
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,352	| IOT079 |	I have brother Industries
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,448	| IOT079 |	Amazon actually did add their name to sir
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| IOT079 |	So used to be
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,776	| IOT079 |	Medeco had just a random
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,336	| IOT079 |	Mac address but now it says Amazon Tech
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:42,848	| IOT079 |	Technologies Inc
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:48,224	| IOT079 |	My Fire TV is all have a specific name and whatnot yeah
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:48,736	| IOT079 |	But like
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,296	| IOT079 |	I got it so the ring doorbell is good
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,576	| IOT079 |	My Sonos has are all good
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,880	| IOT079 |	But I have all these ampact
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,392	| IOT079 |	Technology
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,440	| IOT079 |	I don't know what impact
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:57,952	| IOT079 |	Technology Inc
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,096	| IOT079 |	What
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:06,144	| IOT079 |	Craig's iPhone is on mine
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,728	| IOT079 |	That's my father-in-law who the heck is Greg
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,544	| IOT079 |	That actually isn't that the other thing here
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| IOT079 |	A lot of these
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:17,408	| IOT079 |	You know easily viewable router table so to speak
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,432	| IOT079 |	Are showing
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,224	| IOT079 |	Previously connected devices
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,040	| IOT079 |	Just wish me no longer be in the house
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,344	| IOT079 |	You know mine's divided up on currently connected
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,440	| IOT079 |	So I feel better about that but
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:31,488	| IOT079 |	Yes just for a minute there I was like
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| IOT079 |	Craigslist
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,048	| IOT079 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,328	| IOT079 |	We've only got through the first
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,144	| IOT079 |	The next piece of advice
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:42,496	| IOT079 |	It's to contact your ISP to update routers and modems to the latest security stand
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:47,104	| IOT079 |	Change your router service I didn't know that's what is SSID stand for
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,152	| IOT079 |	Router service set identifier
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,712	| IOT079 |	I mean I know what my SSID is I just did
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:55,808	| IOT079 |	I said change it to something that does not identify you your family or the device
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,112	| IOT079 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:02,464	| IOT079 |	Check out contact information for all of your devices and make sure they're up to date with
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,232	| IOT079 |	With your current email
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:03,744	| IOT079 |	Melidress
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:08,608	| IOT079 |	Confirm that all of your devices are able set for automatic updating
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,936	| IOT079 |	And make sure you're getting the latest firmware patches
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,496	| IOT079 |	You can do all your passwords
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,776	| IOT079 |	And where possible
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,568	| IOT079 |	Implement multi-factor Authentication
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,616	| IOT079 |	I
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| IOT079 |	I'm not going to do that
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,664	| IOT079 |	That problem
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,712	| IOT079 |	It's a lot of work
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,272	| IOT079 |	That's tough but a lot of these
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,296	| IOT079 |	Stats are the thing is
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,344	| IOT079 |	We need to be doing a better job at
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:33,184	| IOT079 |	Yeso in this is a smart one although exhausting in a possible
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:36,000	| IOT079 |	Review the Privacy policies and practices of your
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:40,352	| IOT079 |	Your devices because it is your settings can be inadvertently change during update
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,144	| IOT079 |	Spotify
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT079 |	Drove me nuts
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,216	| IOT079 |	Reverting everything to publican
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,520	| IOT079 |	Because my daughter listens to all this stuff
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:51,872	| IOT079 |	I really need everybody to know that I am listening to Katy Perry Non-Stop
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,920	| IOT079 |	Can we do now
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,200	| IOT079 |	Yes well it's my daughter
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,784	| IOT079 |	But yes that
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,064	| IOT079 |	Sure
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| IOT079 |	And then
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,672	| IOT079 |	Yuan clearing data off if you return it or sell it
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,208	| IOT079 |	That actually got people in trouble with
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,000	| IOT079 |	Security camera
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,280	| IOT079 |	The Arlo's actually
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,632	| IOT079 |	Review your location tracking
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,144	| IOT079 |	In the back of your phone
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,472	| IOT079 |	So these are pretty obvious
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,008	| IOT079 |	What agency on here
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:21,312	| IOT079 |	Was change your router passwords
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:24,384	| IOT079 |	And make sure you got a password on your router
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:27,200	| IOT079 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:30,272	| IOT079 |	We might they may think that's a given but no added a lot of people just
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:35,136	| IOT079 |	Just take the default if you know a my network name is Linksys password
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,440	| IOT079 |	Alright let's go where am I
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,000	| IOT079 |	And that's not good
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,024	| IOT079 |	Work that's not going to lie
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:42,048	| IOT079 |	No
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,120	| IOT079 |	That's that's kind of not my house that doesn't fly
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,448	| IOT079 |	Presidents
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:49,728	| IOT079 |	All right
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,520	| IOT079 |	So let's see
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:53,056	| IOT079 |	Kabul news briefs
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:56,896	| IOT079 |	That's so that's the OT a survey that's how you secure your smart home a little bit
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,664	| IOT079 |	I mean again
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:00,224	| IOT079 |	Some of these devices just are not
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| IOT079 |	Really securable in that is sad
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,296	| IOT079 |	That is sad
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:07,904	| IOT079 |	We're getting there though I do feel that the industry is at least much more aware of this and is like
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:10,720	| IOT079 |	Oh crikey we really got to support this
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,512	| IOT079 |	I also would say
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,816	| IOT079 |	You know if you're going to invest in a lot of devices
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,608	| IOT079 |	I should tell you guys that
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:20,960	| IOT079 |	I want to do this in a couple weeks when I find the time and my husband lets me shut down our Network
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,056	| IOT079 |	But I'm actually going to go super extreme and create a separate Network
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,104	| IOT079 |	For my iot devices
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:30,176	| IOT079 |	And I'm going to try to set up a firewall
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,200	| IOT079 |	Behind them
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:35,552	| IOT079 |	And I got this idea from Andy Ellis who is the CTO of a Takamine
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,600	| IOT079 |	We're talking about security stuff
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| IOT079 |	And so he and I are actually he's like this is why
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| IOT079 |	What you should do as I like to you
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,512	| IOT079 |	So we're going to figure out we're going to figure it out
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,024	| IOT079 |	Together
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:49,632	| IOT079 |	So it's possible we won't have a podcast for a couple of weeks cuz I will look
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,400	| IOT079 |	Totally broken my neck
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,192	| IOT079 |	Ono.
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:54,752	| IOT079 |	Hopefully that does
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,032	| IOT079 |	I mean I might totally
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:28:03,712	| IOT079 |	So this is my grand plan when I implement it I plan on writing like a detailed how to pose for anyone who's crazy enough
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,224	| IOT079 |	What you want to do this
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:07,296	| IOT079 |	And you know guys feel free to send me stuff
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,832	| IOT079 |	Set questions at iot
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,368	| IOT079 |	Podcast.com
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,136	| IOT079 |	If you have suggestions
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,184	| IOT079 |	I know it's not a question
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,696	| IOT079 |	But send it anyway
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,232	| IOT079 |	All right
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,256	| IOT079 |	News briefs
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,072	| IOT079 |	Some real fast stuff is happening that you might buy to be aware of
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,864	| IOT079 |	Let's start with
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,192	| IOT079 |	I do not okay
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,472	| IOT079 |	I feel like I've been talking a lot
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,264	| IOT079 |	Let's start with
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,544	| IOT079 |	Let Echo
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,056	| IOT079 |	Flacco
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:34,944	| IOT079 |	These guys made actually think the first phone using the Qualcomm 8
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,712	| IOT079 |	20 chip
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,504	| IOT079 |	Nothing 21 that's in the pixel
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,808	| IOT079 |	But and they also bought Vizio
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:43,136	| IOT079 |	They are launching an iot division here in the United States
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:45,184	| IOT079 |	And they hired rachna.
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:47,232	| IOT079 |	Who used to be at Qualcomm and
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,024	| IOT079 |	Doing all the All Join stuff
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:52,352	| IOT079 |	And then moved over to a start-up called helium
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,728	| IOT079 |	He's in charge of this so I'm really interested in like another brand
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,496	| IOT079 |	Coming over with some
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:04,640	| IOT079 |	He is an exceptionally smart guy and a good could hire Facebook's I love Rob
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,152	| IOT079 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:06,944	| IOT079 |	Good endorsement
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,504	| IOT079 |	Other news looks like
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,272	| IOT079 |	And those are the
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,040	| IOT079 |	The only
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:17,440	| IOT079 |	Maker sometimes it feels that way and Intel are doing smart glasses smart
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,024	| IOT079 |	Eyeglasses that you know will check your stats track all kinds of crazy stuff
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,328	| IOT079 |	I feel like step trackers again
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,632	| IOT079 |	They are there already
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,424	| IOT079 |	They already are
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,984	| IOT079 |	Blink which makes these tiny $100
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:35,104	| IOT079 |	HD Wi-Fi cameras they integrated with the Amazon Echo so now you can tell
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,128	| IOT079 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,968	| IOT079 |	To arm or disarm your blink security system
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,040	| IOT079 |	Yeah that's that's very handy
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:47,904	| IOT079 |	These guys that you can buy like a pack of five of these for like
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,696	| IOT079 |	330 bucks which is
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,208	| IOT079 |	Crazy Cheap
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:53,792	| IOT079 |	On their battery power just they look like motion sensors basically
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,584	| IOT079 |	Set them up on a wall
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,352	| IOT079 |	They're real fun
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:30:00,192	| IOT079 |	I know somebody someone emailed me saying they used it as they like
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:04,288	| IOT079 |	Camera in their refrigerator so they could see like when the door opened it
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,056	| IOT079 |	Detect motion
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:05,824	| IOT079 |	Take picture
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,872	| IOT079 |	They can see what's in the fridge
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:11,200	| IOT079 |	Because it's battery powered you can do that yes
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:11,712	| IOT079 |	It's not going to
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,248	| IOT079 |	I don't know if it actually
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,296	| IOT079 |	There's two things there there's
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:17,856	| IOT079 |	Cold and the Faraday cage
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,880	| IOT079 |	They're happy with it
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:19,392	| IOT079 |	It's relative
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:20,928	| IOT079 |	That's cool
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,464	| IOT079 |	All right
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:22,976	| IOT079 |	So
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:26,048	| IOT079 |	That is it for this week show
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,072	| IOT079 |	Jetpack cell phone
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,144	| IOT079 |	And stay tuned for our guest
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:34,752	| IOT079 |	Who is a realtor in Miami Beach who's going to tell us what devices we should stock our smart home with
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,288	| IOT079 |	It's for the best resale value
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:48,320	| IOT079 |	And now for a word from our sponsor
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:50,368	| IOT079 |	This week sponsor is hpe
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,928	| IOT079 |	And talk about HPV
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:58,560	| IOT079 |	Dr. Tom bradach who is VP and general manager for servers in iot system
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:03,424	| IOT079 |	So we're here talking about the ability to deliver hybrid iot
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,448	| IOT079 |	And you mentioned to me that
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:06,496	| IOT079 |	With the Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,824	| IOT079 |	There are three physical places that you have to deal with it
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| IOT079 |	Can you elaborate on that for me please
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,920	| IOT079 |	I like to refer to him as a trihybrid
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:14,944	| IOT079 |	Ikea
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:17,248	| IOT079 |	Because there are three places
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,552	| IOT079 |	The first two rather obvious it's either the
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,368	| IOT079 |	On-prem Data Center
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| IOT079 |	Cloud and then the other off Graham that's emerge
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,744	| IOT079 |	And the edge has many dimension
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:31,072	| IOT079 |	Like with respect to this all your teeth as they are
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,144	| IOT079 |	As you know what I ain't asking for a
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:34,912	| IOT079 |	City tram
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:38,240	| IOT079 |	A smart building the wind farm in or regular
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,520	| IOT079 |	Energy grid
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,312	| IOT079 |	Dimension of the edge
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:44,896	| IOT079 |	That is not the iot is also very important for the other off crown
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,480	| IOT079 |	Domains of Telecom media CDN
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,272	| IOT079 |	Campuses in Branch offices
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| IOT079 |	Are there free places now where I T
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:55,136	| IOT079 |	Is going to be a dominant technology
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,416	| IOT079 |	Xen support
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,512	| IOT079 |	Improvements as well as scientific discovery
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,792	| IOT079 |	Civil engineering games
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,864	| IOT079 |	Into the things that are out there
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,144	| IOT079 |	NY does
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:10,496	| IOT079 |	The notion of it emerging at the edges extremely important
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:11,776	| IOT079 |	Realized because
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:17,152	| IOT079 |	And in subsequent podcast
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:19,712	| IOT079 |	What's happening at the edge NYIT is so important there
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:21,248	| IOT079 |	Another reason
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:23,296	| IOT079 |	To keep the trihybrid approach
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:27,392	| IOT079 |	Someone does not want to be confined restricted
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,952	| IOT079 |	Sherlock you know that on Prime data center North
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:34,560	| IOT079 |	Child lock in door being forced to keep things remote when indeed it would be better
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,840	| IOT079 |	Managing better drops
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:38,144	| IOT079 |	Local and give you more control
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:41,216	| IOT079 |	So what is Hewlett-Packard Enterprise
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:41,728	| IOT079 |	Have to offer
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:45,312	| IOT079 |	How many people know that hpe excels in
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:51,456	| IOT079 |	In the production of it equipment in the deployment of IHG

EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:56,832	| IOT079 |	And the edge that's emerging the Third
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,880	| IOT079 |	Of the trihybrid
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,928	| IOT079 |	Applications of it
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:05,536	| IOT079 |	I work literally shifting out
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,304	| IOT079 |	In many areas
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:07,840	| IOT079 |	Altoona
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,120	| IOT079 |	So what we offer is

EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:19,104	| IOT079 |	The trihydrate locations in this hybrid

EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:51,616	| IOT079 |	Man I am so excited to have you
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:54,688	| IOT079 |	Both for selfish reasons and because I think this is going to be a fun show
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:58,016	| IOT079 |	You are here this week to talk about how to sell the smart
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:34:00,064	| IOT079 |	And since I have eight
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:01,088	| IOT079 |	Leicester
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:03,392	| IOT079 |	Devices in my house I have corset like who
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,440	| IOT079 |	What should I put in there was a goodbye
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,976	| IOT079 |	What was it
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:09,280	| IOT079 |	Let's just get started with a sense of
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:11,072	| IOT079 |	How do you when your
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:13,120	| IOT079 |	Putting a house on the market are looking at a listing
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,680	| IOT079 |	How do you define it a smart
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,192	| IOT079 |	House
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:17,728	| IOT079 |	Defining a smart home
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:20,032	| IOT079 |	It's a new you know a new term
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:24,384	| IOT079 |	And what we want to talk about typically is the connectivity of devices
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,664	| IOT079 |	The ease-of-use
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:29,504	| IOT079 |	A lot of consumers lot of the buyers they respond to brand names
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:32,320	| IOT079 |	So instead of saying you know we have
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,880	| IOT079 |	Smart AC system we might say
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:36,928	| IOT079 |	Property is controlled by nest
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:43,072	| IOT079 |	And we instead of talking about smart locks we might say an actual brand name of August locks because
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:46,912	| IOT079 |	That's something that resonates with buyers and when they're looking at
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:50,496	| IOT079 |	Hundreds of homes and descriptions on Zillow Trulia realtor.com
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,520	| IOT079 |	Brand names
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,544	| IOT079 |	Smart technology
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,592	| IOT079 |	She stands out to them because they're looking at
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,128	| IOT079 |	You know the whole experience of the property
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:35:03,040	| IOT079 |	And if it's something that's going to benefit them in their daily lives it's going to track them to that property and maybe make that home Stand Out verses
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,808	| IOT079 |	The house down the street
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,088	| IOT079 |	Got it
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,880	| IOT079 |	So if I'm considering
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:09,440	| IOT079 |	Selling my house what brands are worth investing
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:10,720	| IOT079 |	Sure
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,768	| IOT079 |	So I work with a lot of investor
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,536	| IOT079 |	Developers
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:17,120	| IOT079 |	And there are looking to maximize every dollar now that they put into the properties
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,424	| IOT079 |	So what if we tell them is
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:22,496	| IOT079 |	Yeah they have to be smart technology that
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,800	| IOT079 |	Benefits of experience in the daily lives
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:27,616	| IOT079 |	So the buyers because when I'm showing it it's one thing describing it
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,920	| IOT079 |	When I walk into a property with the buyers
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,968	| IOT079 |	They have to get excited about something
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:33,248	| IOT079 |	So one of the
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:36,576	| IOT079 |	Products that really stands out that tires are used
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,344	| IOT079 |	To sing in
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:40,928	| IOT079 |	You know high-end Homes apartments they're staying at it at
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,952	| IOT079 |	In office space
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,720	| IOT079 |	This is nest
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:46,304	| IOT079 |	It's known across most of the consumers they respond to it
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,096	| IOT079 |	Very simple to use and has a sexy
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:48,864	| IOT079 |	She look
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,912	| IOT079 |	So that's a brand that I think stands out lot of
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:55,264	| IOT079 |	They coming to the property it's very easy to show them to
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:35:57,824	| IOT079 |	Explain the benefits of that some of them don't understand
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,128	| IOT079 |	All the Smart Home Technology
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:04,736	| IOT079 |	But they surely can understand that in some homes you have to go up in every room and turn off the lights
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:08,576	| IOT079 |	And other homes you're going to press one button and all the lights are off when you leave
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,600	| IOT079 |	Not something that we
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,112	| IOT079 |	Stick out
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,160	| IOT079 |	From home to home and I think
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:14,464	| IOT079 |	Things like lighting HVAC
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:14,976	| IOT079 |	Smart Lock
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:17,536	| IOT079 |	That goes above and beyond the value of the
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,304	| IOT079 |	The investment
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,352	| IOT079 |	Okay so Nest smart lighting
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:23,680	| IOT079 |	Yeah like Lutron August locks
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:25,216	| IOT079 |	I mean those are those are kind of
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,752	| IOT079 |	Big names
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:29,056	| IOT079 |	In the in a smart space released from
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:29,824	| IOT079 |	Higher perspective
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:32,384	| IOT079 |	Okay do you get a lot of
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:35,456	| IOT079 |	Questions about how these things will work I'm just thinking
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:39,296	| IOT079 |	Not necessarily in a new house but if I were to sell my house for example
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,368	| IOT079 |	Conveying some of the stuff to the new buyer would be
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:45,696	| IOT079 |	Kind of complicated I don't know if it's a turnoff or not
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,720	| IOT079 |	Yeah I think it's
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:49,024	| IOT079 |	It is complicated but I think it's it's
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,048	| IOT079 |	It's important that
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:54,912	| IOT079 |	Whoever selling the property whether it's the owner themselves or likely real estate agent that agent
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:56,704	| IOT079 |	Understand Ted Hughes
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:59,008	| IOT079 |	The system and understands how to explain the benefits of the
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:01,056	| IOT079 |	So that's a big
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:02,080	| IOT079 |	Component of it
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,104	| IOT079 |	After walking
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,152	| IOT079 |	Through I mean I've been on showings where
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,176	| IOT079 |	The other agent
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:08,224	| IOT079 |	The property has a very complex system
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,272	| IOT079 |	Where how to use it
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,808	| IOT079 |	And they're not it's not working
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:15,648	| IOT079 |	And it doesn't you know they can't turn the lights on they can't turn the music on they candy
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,160	| IOT079 |	He's a Smart Lock
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:18,208	| IOT079 |	Versus another experience
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,256	| IOT079 |	Or somebody's walking them through showing them how to use
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:23,328	| IOT079 |	Components why they like it while they have it in their own home
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:25,888	| IOT079 |	Tell me the story of daily life like once
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:26,656	| IOT079 |	To be nicer
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:30,752	| IOT079 |	It's so great that I don't have to carry cheese anymore and they open up a lock
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,264	| IOT079 |	Phone
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:32,288	| IOT079 |	That resonates
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:37,920	| IOT079 |	And that really makes a difference in most markets across the country their competitive markets
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,944	| IOT079 |	And how do you stand out
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:44,320	| IOT079 |	Some homes are in a brand new kitchens and bathrooms but if all the homes are doing bad
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,600	| IOT079 |	This is the next step
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,880	| IOT079 |	The only thing that's interesting is
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,184	| IOT079 |	Byers at this point
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:51,488	| IOT079 |	If a home is brand new or fully renovated
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:55,840	| IOT079 |	And somebody didn't put in a smart system they look at it as almost as you cut corners
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,400	| IOT079 |	Okay and do you have a sense of
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:37:59,936	| IOT079 |	What that can add to the
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:01,984	| IOT079 |	The price of the house in terms of
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,776	| IOT079 |	Sales price or how quickly it moves
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:11,456	| IOT079 |	It's very hard to tell because you don't know two homes are like right and even if we had two identical properties they would be they were
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,480	| IOT079 |	I want to be on the same parcel
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,016	| IOT079 |	What's the location to driver
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:16,832	| IOT079 |	But I do get the sense over all that
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:19,392	| IOT079 |	Similar price point similar square footage
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:20,416	| IOT079 |	It's a standout
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,184	| IOT079 |	Feature
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:26,560	| IOT079 |	It's also standout feature if the home had you know a brand new kitchen or standout feature if it had
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,352	| IOT079 |	Brand new pool at those kind of things
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:31,168	| IOT079 |	It's right off of you it's it's an aspect selling aspect
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,984	| IOT079 |	I think Home2Home I've seen buyers
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,008	| IOT079 |	Lean towards one proper
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,336	| IOT079 |	There's a perceived value above
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,872	| IOT079 |	With it installed system
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,408	| IOT079 |	Above and beyond the cost
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,432	| IOT079 |	If you think about it
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,200	| IOT079 |	If a buyer
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,224	| IOT079 |	What's a home on the market
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:44,992	| IOT079 |	Is a million dollars
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:45,504	| IOT079 |	They realize
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,040	| IOT079 |	Pools going to cost
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:47,552	| IOT079 |	50000
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:50,880	| IOT079 |	It would probably pay above and beyond the cost of the pool because
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,440	| IOT079 |	Pulling permits if I knew the contract
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:56,768	| IOT079 |	The same is true with the Smart Home Technology buyers want to come in
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:59,328	| IOT079 |	And have a turnkey home bring your toothbrush
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:00,352	| IOT079 |	That really related
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,632	| IOT079 |	Smart Home Technology also
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,424	| IOT079 |	Got it what happens
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:08,032	| IOT079 |	If I'm listing my house and I've got a crust on or insteon system in there
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,568	| IOT079 |	Are you going to tell me
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:10,592	| IOT079 |	Stacy
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,640	| IOT079 |	Back office
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:15,200	| IOT079 |	Try some of these other things or is that still cool
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:20,832	| IOT079 |	It's so cool I mean people still appreciate the control for the Crestron
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,624	| IOT079 |	They like them
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:24,672	| IOT079 |	I don't know if you'll get the full value
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,464	| IOT079 |	So if you already had it
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,744	| IOT079 |	Greatest benefit
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,792	| IOT079 |	But it's okay if somebody came to me
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:32,096	| IOT079 |	Unless it's at their very very very high-end
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,912	| IOT079 |	You define with different you know
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:35,936	| IOT079 |	Components smart
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:38,240	| IOT079 |	Components of a work with each other and maybe
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:42,848	| IOT079 |	The home has an Amazon Echo and there you know that's kind of the Hub rather than have York restaurants
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:43,616	| IOT079 |	System hop
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,664	| IOT079 |	You cannot take my Amazon Echo Dot
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,176	| IOT079 |	Does not convey
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:48,480	| IOT079 |	I have taken that guy with me
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:51,552	| IOT079 |	It stays
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:55,392	| IOT079 |	Redcoats
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:58,464	| IOT079 |	Yeah I think that I think that you'll see
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,280	| IOT079 |	Maybe at a very very high empress
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:04,352	| IOT079 |	Price point you'll still see some of that the Crestron savant
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,376	| IOT079 |	Metro Ford
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,168	| IOT079 |	The pretty much across
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,960	| IOT079 |	The Country Inn condos single family
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,544	| IOT079 |	You're going to see how the different components because the price point like
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:18,944	| IOT079 |	I can't justify to a client building a million-dollar to million reason $3000000 spec home
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:21,248	| IOT079 |	To put in a 30 or $40,000
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,528	| IOT079 |	I can justify putting in
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:25,344	| IOT079 |	1520 $500
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,392	| IOT079 |	System that pretty much for most
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:27,904	| IOT079 |	Consumers
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:30,208	| IOT079 |	Accomplishes the same thing
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:30,720	| IOT079 |	It's true
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:32,256	| IOT079 |	I
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:35,072	| IOT079 |	And now I actually ripping and replacing old Smart Home Technology
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,096	| IOT079 |	New stuff
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,888	| IOT079 |	Which
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:39,168	| IOT079 |	I feel really hard
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:41,472	| IOT079 |	But I'm going to get over it
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:42,752	| IOT079 |	Eventually
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,264	| IOT079 |	Evolving
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:47,104	| IOT079 |	What price point does this become like a must have
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:50,688	| IOT079 |	And I know this differs based on different markets but
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:51,968	| IOT079 |	Can I get a sensor
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:53,504	| IOT079 |	What do I need to have this
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:56,832	| IOT079 |	I think the science is whatever the market is
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,112	| IOT079 |	Wherever the perception
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:40:59,648	| IOT079 |	The luxury price
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,696	| IOT079 |	So in a lot of markets
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:03,232	| IOT079 |	You know what's a million.
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:05,536	| IOT079 |	And some and some markets 500000
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:06,560	| IOT079 |	Luxury price point
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,072	| IOT079 |	Yashow market
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:10,912	| IOT079 |	Miami Beach might be 2 to 3 million price point
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:12,192	| IOT079 |	Or LA or New York
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,520	| IOT079 |	So I think it's out entry-luxury price point
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:17,056	| IOT079 |	But there's a huge benefit
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:18,336	| IOT079 |	To even at you know
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:19,872	| IOT079 |	300000
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,408	| IOT079 |	$200,000
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:26,016	| IOT079 |	Property mean you're seeing at the home builders that are building tract homes all over the country
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:27,296	| IOT079 |	They're putting in
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,064	| IOT079 |	Lot of bass
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:29,344	| IOT079 |	Smart Home Technology because
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,392	| IOT079 |	People appreciate it they can
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,416	| IOT079 |	Buy it
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:33,440	| IOT079 |	Probably put in fist
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,488	| IOT079 |	It's $4,000 a house and
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,280	| IOT079 |	It sells faster and
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:40,608	| IOT079 |	It goes above and beyond the value of the investment that ski
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:42,656	| IOT079 |	You don't see that in a lot of other things in a home where
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:45,984	| IOT079 |	You know I can say you know it's hard to show
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,264	| IOT079 |	It's just
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:48,800	| IOT079 |	Experience-based evidence
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:52,640	| IOT079 |	But I think most builders that do it once they continue to do and that says a lot
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:58,783	| IOT079 |	It'll most of my clients are a little bit like hesitant maybe when they're like what's the point of the smart locked I really need smart HVAC
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,599	| IOT079 |	And I get them to do it one time
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:05,439	| IOT079 |	They do it every single their project after that cuz they see how people respond to it
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,207	| IOT079 |	Awesome
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,743	| IOT079 |	Does it has this change your job
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:09,791	| IOT079 |	I think the changes
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:12,095	| IOT079 |	Is there's a lot of educating but I've been doing
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,399	| IOT079 |	Educating my sellers wife
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,167	| IOT079 |	Important it's
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:19,519	| IOT079 |	Educating the developers investors why they should do it and a lot of its educating the
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:23,359	| IOT079 |	The consumers so the buyers come in and they don't always understand
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,383	| IOT079 |	The system what's
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,663	| IOT079 |	The benefit so I've got to
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:29,503	| IOT079 |	Explain it to them in a way that impacts that
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:31,551	| IOT079 |	Somebody might not care about the fact that
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:33,855	| IOT079 |	You know you have a smart HVAC it means nothing to them
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,415	| IOT079 |	Am I really respond to this morning
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:36,927	| IOT079 |	Entertainment System
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:41,535	| IOT079 |	That's Chase my job a lot I mean we're always educating about the marking about the home but
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:45,119	| IOT079 |	The technology education and you know
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,423	| IOT079 |	34 in my industry and relatively Young
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,703	| IOT079 |	So I'm
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,519	| IOT079 |	And educating a lot of agents that work with that are in the 50s
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:53,567	| IOT079 |	67 days and it's not always engaged
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,359	| IOT079 |	Are some very tech-savvy agents
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:57,919	| IOT079 |	On the older the higher end of the A train
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:43:00,223	| IOT079 |	But once they try it
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:02,271	| IOT079 |	And they they feel in the touching the user
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:04,831	| IOT079 |	Yeah that they're hooked on and they loved it as well
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:07,903	| IOT079 |	I'm very curious about
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,927	| IOT079 |	The issue of longevity
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:12,767	| IOT079 |	And driving standards because some of the stuff it feels like
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:15,583	| IOT079 |	Like actually a good examples homekit
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:20,191	| IOT079 |	Kind of has been hovering at the edges and now seems to be really entering the market
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,471	| IOT079 |	Bright
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:23,007	| IOT079 |	Or the drama over at nest
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:29,919	| IOT079 |	What are you tell clients when they're like weight does this work with that do I want to invest in this forces
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:36,319	| IOT079 |	The other yeah it's hard I mean I can only share like my own personal experience with people what I would have used it
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:38,367	| IOT079 |	Different clients homes everyday
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:41,439	| IOT079 |	In the system's I'm using their what I've use personally
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,719	| IOT079 |	You know
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,767	| IOT079 |	There's different tribes with different things
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:45,791	| IOT079 |	It's very hard
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:49,375	| IOT079 |	It's hard to tell people what's good and also their price point also their budget
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:52,959	| IOT079 |	So you know I'm not in the business of selling
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:54,751	| IOT079 |	Smart home technology or the products
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,823	| IOT079 |	But I am in the business of selling homes
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,359	| IOT079 |	And I think that just like
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:04,479	| IOT079 |	You a lot of real estate agents understand different types of wood flooring and they know about
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:08,063	| IOT079 |	Different types of fixtures and they understand
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:11,647	| IOT079 |	No types of construction this is one of those components that
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:16,511	| IOT079 |	I think it's here to stay I don't I don't think it's a trend I think it's going to continue to grow
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:17,791	| IOT079 |	All right
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:20,095	| IOT079 |	And then what would you say to the industry
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:24,447	| IOT079 |	Like you're trying to sell and talk to people who may not know about this stuff
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,215	| IOT079 |	Everyday
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:27,263	| IOT079 |	Whitewright what can you tell them
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,311	| IOT079 |	The ease-of-use is critical
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:31,615	| IOT079 |	One thing that frustrates me about
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:33,663	| IOT079 |	Even some of the Smart Home Products I love
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:34,943	| IOT079 |	That
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,479	| IOT079 |	Although everybody
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:39,807	| IOT079 |	You know they're smart company so they want everything to be kind of
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,599	| IOT079 |	Digital app
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:42,879	| IOT079 |	Yo
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:45,183	| IOT079 |	Q&A but they still need to have
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,487	| IOT079 |	Some of the old school personal touches Witcher
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,279	| IOT079 |	If somebody has a major problem
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:50,303	| IOT079 |	Tele telephone number
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,095	| IOT079 |	And try to find
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:53,887	| IOT079 |	Contact number on the most
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,655	| IOT079 |	The smart products
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,471	| IOT079 |	They Don't Really typically want to speak with
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:44:59,263	| IOT079 |	You said that's something I could tell the industry that
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:03,871	| IOT079 |	You know it's somebody's frustrated trying to get into their home cuz they're locked.
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:06,687	| IOT079 |	They're not using their Smart Lock correctly
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,223	| IOT079 |	Are you having trouble with
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:10,015	| IOT079 |	You know they're nasty whatever product it is that
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:12,063	| IOT079 |	Luckily they don't come up often
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:14,623	| IOT079 |	Is there one way products but when they do I think that
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,647	| IOT079 |	Personal component
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:19,231	| IOT079 |	Even though they're not direct sales direct-to-consumer
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:25,631	| IOT079 |	You have to have that aspect for a lot of people because it goes a long way and end and I I do commend in the street though because
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:26,143	| IOT079 |	Does it seem
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:29,471	| IOT079 |	With a lot of products I think I just saw with Nest that
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:32,031	| IOT079 |	They have like if you don't feel like you can
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:32,799	| IOT079 |	Put in the product
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,847	| IOT079 |	Yourself here's a designated Personnel coming

EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:38,943	| IOT079 |	I think that's a really nice easy way to transition to
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,479	| IOT079 |	Yourself
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:43,551	| IOT079 |	Some people don't have the time or they don't have that
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,319	| IOT079 |	You know
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:48,671	| IOT079 |	Way that they're able to do that even if it's simple screwing in changing wires
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:52,511	| IOT079 |	It's nice to make it easy and approachable for everybody so it's
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:56,607	| IOT079 |	Keeping the email to human touch with helping people get onto the smart products
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:00,447	| IOT079 |	Yeah well the stakes can be incredibly High when you're installing a new thermostat
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:05,823	| IOT079 |	Absolutely I only take the hottest or coldest days of the year
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,639	| IOT079 |	Just because I like the extra
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:10,943	| IOT079 |	Okay and you

EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,791	| IOT079 |	I use August locks
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:28,095	| IOT079 |	Smart locks that do not carry Keys anymore

EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,959	| IOT079 |	And just not having to
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:08,543	| IOT079 |	Reach for your phone and open the app just to be able to speak commands
