EDL	00:00:17,664	00:00:20,480	| IOT098 |	So Grant is joining us in place of Kevin
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:21,760	| IOT098 |	Because Kevin is
EDL	00:00:22,272	00:00:22,784	| IOT098 |	Traveling
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:25,344	| IOT098 |	But do not think that this
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:27,392	| IOT098 |	Because Grant
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:29,952	| IOT098 |	Is the Smart Home editor at The Wirecutter
EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:33,536	| IOT098 |	So we have an opportunity to talk to someone who is not just like

EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:41,792	| IOT098 |	This week's guest is Bruce Sterling who is the famous science-fiction author and
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:47,680	| IOT098 |	Futurist he is also building a smart home lab in Italy and we're going to talk about all of those things
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| IOT098 |	So
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| IOT098 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:51,776	| IOT098 |	Grant
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,080	| IOT098 |	All that out of the way
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:56,128	| IOT098 |	Thank you for doing this let's get started
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,408	| IOT098 |	With
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,688	| IOT098 |	The if this then that channel
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,712	| IOT098 |	Louisville
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:00,736	| IOT098 |	Chucky
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,344	| IOT098 |	I think this is awesome so Louisville
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,648	| IOT098 |	You guys maybe like more familiar with it
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,696	| IOT098 |	And you realize because that's where CNET smart
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:13,280	| IOT098 |	Was that actually put it on the market now they've got a smart apartment
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,560	| IOT098 |	Building and
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:19,424	| IOT098 |	What's happening in Louisville Kentucky is connecting be created and if this then that
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:26,592	| IOT098 |	And so one of the things you can do is take your Philips Hue smart light bulbs and when the city of seas bad air quality
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,360	| IOT098 |	City data
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| IOT098 |	They can turn your hue light bulbs red
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:31,712	| IOT098 |	How big of a problem is this in Louisville
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,528	| IOT098 |	I don't know I've never been to Louisville I kind of feeling bad about it
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,856	| IOT098 |	Maybe the barbecue Smoke Gets in there and
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,160	| IOT098 |	That would be
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,928	| IOT098 |	That would be
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,768	| IOT098 |	I would rather have the lights change color when the barbecue is ready
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,072	| IOT098 |	That is totally doable
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| IOT098 |	I think Char-Broil Char-Broil has a
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,632	| IOT098 |	Make it smoke right now
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:58,592	| IOT098 |	I better be pretty easy to do this yourself with an in-home air quality sensor of some sort
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,640	| IOT098 |	You could or you could
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,152	| IOT098 |	Probably
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:06,016	| IOT098 |	Because they've got an interest in that channel they probably have an API which means
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,064	| IOT098 |	If you could access it you
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,088	| IOT098 |	You could do it with
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,904	| IOT098 |	If you didn't want to do your lights for example
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,440	| IOT098 |	You can do it too
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| IOT098 |	I know what a little alarm that teens
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,791	| IOT098 |	Send a text message
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,071	| IOT098 |	Since you're something to alert you to
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,607	| IOT098 |	Put on the gas mask
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,399	| IOT098 |	Three. But that's a little harder
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,935	| IOT098 |	Also
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| IOT098 |	If this then that
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,727	| IOT098 |	Sounds good
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,031	| IOT098 |	I know that we had a woman on the podcast
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:31,359	| IOT098 |	Weeks ago she actually did a connected
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,175	| IOT098 |	She took Transit data for the city of London buses
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:38,527	| IOT098 |	And she built something that basically told people when the bus was 5 minutes away
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| IOT098 |	The light returned
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,855	| IOT098 |	Orange
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,623	| IOT098 |	Yellow
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,207	| IOT098 |	When it was 2 minutes away it would
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,975	| IOT098 |	Red
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| IOT098 |	So you got a chance to
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,791	| IOT098 |	Like the bus is coming quick
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,143	| IOT098 |	So I think those kind of things would be great although again
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,167	| IOT098 |	I don't know how many people take public
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,519	| IOT098 |	Well the other problem is it is known as
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:02,335	| IOT098 |	Quick so well the bus could be gone by the time
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:05,919	| IOT098 |	What's the message goes back and forth to the Cloud Server and turns you like color
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| IOT098 |	That is true
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,479	| IOT098 |	Alright so
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT098 |	Transit stuff
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,783	| IOT098 |	That's a
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,807	| IOT098 |	Good question about
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,319	| IOT098 |	At the light bulb
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,343	| IOT098 |	Grecian
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,879	| IOT098 |	Like how long does it
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,463	| IOT098 |	With air quality to guess
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,791	| IOT098 |	If it was a 30 second delay it's not going to be a big deal because
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,607	| IOT098 |	Then you wouldn't have choked to death by then but
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,679	| IOT098 |	Something that's really time-sensitive
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:31,007	| IOT098 |	I think it'd be a better way to to better public alert system
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,799	| IOT098 |	There you go so
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,847	| IOT098 |	But I also think it's nice that
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,639	| IOT098 |	You know Louisville is actually expire
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,407	| IOT098 |	Flooring something
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,175	| IOT098 |	Like this
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,479	| IOT098 |	Because it is it brings that kind of data to
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,527	| IOT098 |	Are citizen levels
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,807	| IOT098 |	If you can actually you know
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:46,879	| IOT098 |	He's at this and that to pull data streams into a spreadsheet
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,439	| IOT098 |	Could be something as mundane as I
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,207	| IOT098 |	Charting it
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,255	| IOT098 |	What also makes it interesting is that
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,071	| IOT098 |	Create new stories like this and help
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:59,167	| IOT098 |	Spread awareness of the types of features that the things that you can do with
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:03,007	| IOT098 |	With smart home devices that I talked to a lot of people who
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:09,151	| IOT098 |	Who wanders in why would I want a light bulb that changes color or this and that and
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:14,015	| IOT098 |	Looking into some more interesting applications of this technology I think it is always a good thing
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,831	| IOT098 |	Speaking of what people are doing with
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,647	| IOT098 |	Let's talk about Vizio
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,927	| IOT098 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,487	| IOT098 |	Grant do you want to share with Vizio
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:29,375	| IOT098 |	Well what does you're doing right now is just paying a fine for things that they did a while ago
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:32,703	| IOT098 |	It was revealed that their TVs were
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:36,031	| IOT098 |	Tracking and sharing information of the other internet connection
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:41,919	| IOT098 |	And they kind of got caught and now the total pay a big fine for that we cover this when it first came out
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| IOT098 |	The models that
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,735	| IOT098 |	Did this
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,295	| IOT098 |	Who does is they had a
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,063	| IOT098 |	An opt-out map
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,135	| IOT098 |	You didn't opt in to allow your data.
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,439	| IOT098 |	Opted out of it and they made it
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| IOT098 |	It's hard to
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,767	| IOT098 |	To find out where you can opt out this exchanged
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:00,095	| IOT098 |	But I think the bigger story is that it's not just Vizio it's
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,911	| IOT098 |	Almost anything that plugs into the internet is doing this kind of thing
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:03,679	| IOT098 |	Sangria
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:06,751	| IOT098 |	We did a privacy blog about this last year
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,031	| IOT098 |	And
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| IOT098 |	We looked at the privacy
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| IOT098 |	And data collection
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,895	| IOT098 |	Processes or policies
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| IOT098 |	Standard
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:20,831	| IOT098 |	Internet-connected devices from your streaming media services to just standard web browsers
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| IOT098 |	And it's
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,207	| IOT098 |	Some people may be other people
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,511	| IOT098 |	Program but a lot of people be shocked at
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,791	| IOT098 |	How much information
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:34,143	| IOT098 |	Manufacturers rubber companies have about you just based on
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,447	| IOT098 |	What's plugged into your house in
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,519	| IOT098 |	And what you're watching on TV and what you're doing online
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,799	| IOT098 |	Agree with you there is like
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| IOT098 |	Any connected product
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,359	| IOT098 |	Is also
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,383	| IOT098 |	Giving your data
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:46,943	| IOT098 |	Sharing.
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,503	| IOT098 |	But what I did find
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| IOT098 |	Upsetting
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| IOT098 |	About the Vizio
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,343	| IOT098 |	Details
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,623	| IOT098 |	What was that it was
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,647	| IOT098 |	Hidden
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,671	| IOT098 |	Very well
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| IOT098 |	Activity
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| IOT098 |	And basically they were like
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:04,351	| IOT098 |	This enables program offers and suggestions
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,655	| IOT098 |	Which is kind of what Netflix does
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,935	| IOT098 |	Netflix also
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| IOT098 |	Watch
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,239	| IOT098 |	What
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,263	| IOT098 |	What's does it do
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| IOT098 |	Who is track
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,055	| IOT098 |	Other services
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:13,567	| IOT098 |	Just going over there
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,615	| IOT098 |	I can't
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:20,479	| IOT098 |	So did the other thing is it provided customers IP
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,527	| IOT098 |	The address yeah that's a sneaky Park
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:25,855	| IOT098 |	This is where I feel with the smart home and
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,135	| IOT098 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,439	| IOT098 |	Our idea of personally identifiable
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| IOT098 |	Call information
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,279	| IOT098 |	Is going to have so what's known in the trade is pii
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,327	| IOT098 |	Is isn't sufficient
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,863	| IOT098 |	Basically
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:39,167	| IOT098 |	Where we've got so much data that can be
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:43,263	| IOT098 |	Triggered back to us like I'm probably the only one in my
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,847	| IOT098 |	Austin Texas which feels like
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,639	| IOT098 |	There's a woman in Austin Texas
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,663	| IOT098 |	You know
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,479	| IOT098 |	Who has these characteristics
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| IOT098 |	You actually probably could identify me
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| IOT098 |	From Lake
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:59,135	| IOT098 |	My IP address yes you could identify
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:02,975	| IOT098 |	From a cluster of different devices that are in my house
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,255	| IOT098 |	What turns everything into pee
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,071	| IOT098 |	What will somewhere
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,399	| IOT098 |	Yes or lots of places probably there's a profile of Stacy
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,215	| IOT098 |	Of what she owns what she does in her house
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,519	| IOT098 |	Know what her her standard
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,335	| IOT098 |	Temperature is how often she
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,615	| IOT098 |	Opens and closes your door
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| IOT098 |	I thought it was
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| IOT098 |	Because I was like
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,015	| IOT098 |	My husband
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,599	| IOT098 |	He's like yeah I know I could
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,111	| IOT098 |	Cooking
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| IOT098 |	That's weird
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| IOT098 |	Potato ad
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,095	| IOT098 |	No coming in a year
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,423	| IOT098 |	Coming up next showing up on
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,471	| IOT098 |	Yeah your browser what's on
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,495	| IOT098 |	Pandora
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,519	| IOT098 |	I would like to see if
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,311	| IOT098 |	Buy potatoes
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:49,823	| IOT098 |	They're delicious
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:54,943	| IOT098 |	The Other Woman I thought was disconcerting about this was
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,479	| IOT098 |	And you mentioned it is the opt-out
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,039	| IOT098 |	You're automatically opted-in to Olive
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| IOT098 |	And that's actually the way
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,599	| IOT098 |	List my devices
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,647	| IOT098 |	Standard
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,415	| IOT098 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,183	| IOT098 |	End
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:09,791	| IOT098 |	I don't know if you guys notice others are covered it but there was a lawsuit actually a couple
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,375	| IOT098 |	A couple months ago about a connected vibrator in the
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,399	| IOT098 |	The people who purchased it
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,679	| IOT098 |	Didn't realize it
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,959	| IOT098 |	There
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| IOT098 |	Sessions
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,263	| IOT098 |	A toy would be
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,311	| IOT098 |	Sent to the manufacturer
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| IOT098 |	With the settings
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:26,175	| IOT098 |	And that and the standard
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,991	| IOT098 |	Responsible manufacturers is
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| IOT098 |	So we can improve the product
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:31,807	| IOT098 |	Witches of
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,599	| IOT098 |	Open the door
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:37,183	| IOT098 |	I mean there are good things with this like if you
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,951	| IOT098 |	You can approve
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| IOT098 |	The product
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:44,607	| IOT098 |	You can actually do really interesting like it if my TV gave data about like what it was on and what I like to watch
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:47,423	| IOT098 |	You might be able to do some Energy Efficiency
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,191	| IOT098 |	Things you know
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,007	| IOT098 |	Like the show that she loves is about to come on
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,591	| IOT098 |	Add Sesame I watch TV in real-time which most people don't
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:59,455	| IOT098 |	You know you can you can start to plan for things around that in the TV could be turned off
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,735	| IOT098 |	Completely off
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,503	| IOT098 |	And then try to
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,527	| IOT098 |	Fire up
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:03,807	| IOT098 |	But that's not what they were
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,671	| IOT098 |	You're just selling your data and I think that's that's a model that
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,999	| IOT098 |	If we don't fix that it's going to engender a lot of distrust and
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| IOT098 |	People are not going to want some
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,607	| IOT098 |	And probably one of the reasons that model has
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,887	| IOT098 |	Has grown
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| IOT098 |	Cuz it could but
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,703	| IOT098 |	To the pressure to keep
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,775	| IOT098 |	Prices on the hardware constantly going down
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:26,847	| IOT098 |	It's got to come up with some of the revenue stream so
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,383	| IOT098 |	The customer becomes the product
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,711	| IOT098 |	I think that's going to go to Wayside actually
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,015	| IOT098 |	I think we're going to see
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,527	| IOT098 |	See a lot of ships
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:39,391	| IOT098 |	We'll see I'll have to come back on next time next time Kevin's traveling
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,415	| IOT098 |	In February I'll be like
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,463	| IOT098 |	Did it come to pass I don't know
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| IOT098 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,047	| IOT098 |	Attention. Because I love kitchentek
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,559	| IOT098 |	How do you feel about that
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| IOT098 |	I'm on the fence
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,143	| IOT098 |	Smart Home in the kitchen
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,007	| IOT098 |	If it's something that I need to be in front of
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:57,055	| IOT098 |	To experience to appreciate
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| IOT098 |	I don't need to get
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| IOT098 |	Alerts to my phone
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,663	| IOT098 |	Front door Decor that's hurting
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| IOT098 |	Maybe when I buy some
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,271	| IOT098 |	Smart kitchen
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,831	| IOT098 |	Crock-Pot or something else change my mind but at the moment
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| IOT098 |	I don't have a smart coffee maker I mean the
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,231	| IOT098 |	Echo in the kitchen that has the timer button
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,791	| IOT098 |	Grant if you were standing in front of
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,959	| IOT098 |	I work at home so I don't leave the house
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| IOT098 |	I have the same
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,799	| IOT098 |	So here is the news
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,079	| IOT098 |	Electrolux
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,639	| IOT098 |	Consumer Appliance
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,711	| IOT098 |	Bought a company called Innova
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,503	| IOT098 |	Ana Nova
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:41,087	| IOT098 |	You guys may be familiar with it because they make a sous vide circulator
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,367	| IOT098 |	I have a connected one
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,695	| IOT098 |	I've really basically all this is is something that
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,999	| IOT098 |	Bluest water around
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,791	| IOT098 |	I'm keeps it at a certain temperature so you can
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,815	| IOT098 |	Can cook your eggs at like
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,887	| IOT098 |	120 degrees
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,679	| IOT098 |	In a little plastic bag
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,471	| IOT098 |	To the perfectly done
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| IOT098 |	Or your meat
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,799	| IOT098 |	I I don't know what like do you sous-vide
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,615	| IOT098 |	I know I know I know there a lot of
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,663	| IOT098 |	At Wirecutter
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,687	| IOT098 |	And in fact
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:12,319	| IOT098 |	The Anova Precision cooker is is our choice in in the guy that we
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,343	| IOT098 |	Mapreduce
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:16,671	| IOT098 |	Our tribe
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,463	| IOT098 |	Just haven't gotten around to it
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:20,511	| IOT098 |	It makes me think of boil in a bag food
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,535	| IOT098 |	But I know it's not that
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,583	| IOT098 |	It's supposedly
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:27,423	| IOT098 |	Way better like I've had I've I played with it a while back in
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,447	| IOT098 |	Can gear Wirecutter
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,775	| IOT098 |	People they're so good because that is a really awesome product
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,335	| IOT098 |	Electrolux plant brand
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| IOT098 |	As they entered in this
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,639	| IOT098 |	Market in
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,943	| IOT098 |	And nobody actually said that they plan to
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:43,807	| IOT098 |	To do some additional Hardware around the smart home possibly even a Smart Oven
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT098 |	At 8
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,367	| IOT098 |	Connected kitchen show that I was at
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,391	| IOT098 |	In October
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,671	| IOT098 |	So
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,207	| IOT098 |	It could be that you know
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:56,095	| IOT098 |	We'll see a smart connected oven which means that the wire cutters totally get on that
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,631	| IOT098 |	Beat in like a year or so
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:02,495	| IOT098 |	We were looking at a lot of smart appliances at CES this year
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| IOT098 |	We tend to think that
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:10,431	| IOT098 |	Or not internet-connected kitchen appliances is it going to be the default
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,967	| IOT098 |	No sooner than later
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:18,111	| IOT098 |	For some applications I think it makes great sense that I haven't used them really myself just sort of
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:20,671	| IOT098 |	Cinema at trade shows and whatnot.
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,463	| IOT098 |	I think there's a
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:25,279	| IOT098 |	Everything is is getting chips in it's going to happen
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,351	| IOT098 |	What's your ideal refrigerator
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,375	| IOT098 |	If you're going to have connectivity there
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:35,775	| IOT098 |	I don't know I want a refrigerator that doesn't leak cuz that's what I've got right now
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:36,799	| IOT098 |	It's okay
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,359	| IOT098 |	That's terrible I'm going to suggest you
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| IOT098 |	You get there
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,271	| IOT098 |	I got nothing else
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:46,783	| IOT098 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,831	| IOT098 |	So there is this
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,367	| IOT098 |	Crazy rumor going around
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| IOT098 |	The hue
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,183	| IOT098 |	Actually you tweeted this this is about
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,743	| IOT098 |	Possible upgrades to the echo
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| IOT098 |	And I'd love to hear your take
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,607	| IOT098 |	Okay what are on a on a Facebook
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,143	| IOT098 |	Group for Echo users
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:05,471	| IOT098 |	Is someone posted a picture of their app
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,495	| IOT098 |	The settings
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,055	| IOT098 |	Part of her app that showed that
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,895	| IOT098 |	Their app had a new feature called synchronized audio
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,223	| IOT098 |	And the short description on there was it it was too
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:20,831	| IOT098 |	Synchronize audio among different Echo devices you remain after your. And what not
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,391	| IOT098 |	Which would give it a similar ability to
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:28,511	| IOT098 |	Twitter Sonos has system has or what the Google home can do and that you can play
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:33,375	| IOT098 |	The same music all over the house and it's synchronized and people watching this
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| IOT098 |	This Thread we're going nuts
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:39,007	| IOT098 |	I've tried to verify this the screenshot look legitimate
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:42,079	| IOT098 |	But I've contacted all my Amazon contact
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,871	| IOT098 |	And they won't say anything
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:48,479	| IOT098 |	And I'm getting ignored so I'm wondering if this is
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:54,111	| IOT098 |	Somebody just playing around with Photoshop or it's a real thing I hope it's a real thing because
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,135	| IOT098 |	It'd be an excellent feature
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,695	| IOT098 |	You would have play your
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:01,023	| IOT098 |	Your Amazon music or what not all over the house and be a lot cheaper than
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,303	| IOT098 |	Like a Sonos system
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:06,143	| IOT098 |	Multi-room audio is basically like I play things on one Echo
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,983	| IOT098 |	I actually so we kind of jerry-rigged
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:14,079	| IOT098 |	Spotify
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,847	| IOT098 |	Connection
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,943	| IOT098 |	So this is a common question we actually get a lot on the show
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,735	| IOT098 |	Echo versus
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,319	| IOT098 |	And so since you guys have this amazing
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,111	| IOT098 |	Review product reviews
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,415	| IOT098 |	What are you guys
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,183	| IOT098 |	Recommending to
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,231	| IOT098 |	What features do you have
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:35,583	| IOT098 |	What overall reviews
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:39,167	| IOT098 |	I think of the two Echo versus home the echo is
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,703	| IOT098 |	Is better and most of the
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:41,983	| IOT098 |	We did
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:46,079	| IOT098 |	Very detailed sound measurements and blind listening test
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,871	| IOT098 |	An echo
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,919	| IOT098 |	Came out over home a little bit not much
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:54,527	| IOT098 |	And it also tested better as a listener in most situations
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| IOT098 |	But not all
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:58,367	| IOT098 |	I'm actually Google home is better hearing you
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:00,927	| IOT098 |	While it's playing music then than Echo is
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:03,487	| IOT098 |	An echo dot has more smart home Integrations
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:07,327	| IOT098 |	Google homes is better at searches if you ask a question
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,631	| IOT098 |	And as we were talking earlier it's
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,935	| IOT098 |	Understands language more naturally than
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,727	| IOT098 |	Then I go does sometimes you got to
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,519	| IOT098 |	Twist yourself into knots ticket
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,055	| IOT098 |	Exactly the right phrasing
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:19,103	| IOT098 |	To turn your lights off or something
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,383	| IOT098 |	Anal with with Echo so
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,455	| IOT098 |	Both of them recommend
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:26,783	| IOT098 |	People who don't have a lot of smart home experience
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,087	| IOT098 |	Tempered expectations a little bit
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:32,927	| IOT098 |	It's not going to completely change the world you got to learn how to use a prop
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,463	| IOT098 |	Khalifa
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,255	| IOT098 |	They're almost the same
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,047	| IOT098 |	We tend to think that
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:42,655	| IOT098 |	More people be satisfied with with a Coleman home but it's not a dramatic difference
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:44,959	| IOT098 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,007	| IOT098 |	And now we're going to get to the
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,287	| IOT098 |	Professional
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,847	| IOT098 |	Slash old school smart home stuff
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,127	| IOT098 |	The show because
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,687	| IOT098 |	Great you were actually an old
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,479	| IOT098 |	We are home installation
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:03,903	| IOT098 |	I'm certified to design control for systems of I haven't done it in my
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,463	| IOT098 |	My knowledge of their programming up-to-date lately
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:12,095	| IOT098 |	And for many years I was the online editor for electronic house and we covered the
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,375	| IOT098 |	The professional smart Hallmark
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,935	| IOT098 |	I've been in a lot of homes
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,471	| IOT098 |	With high interest
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,543	| IOT098 |	Okay
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,823	| IOT098 |	Old school
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,383	| IOT098 |	I know they never do
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:27,711	| IOT098 |	So what's happening right now is a show called Integrated Systems
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| IOT098 |	That's over in Amsterdam in
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,575	| IOT098 |	Ayad mentally call it the city of your
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:35,647	| IOT098 |	This is for professional installers you see a lot of
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,415	| IOT098 |	Really cool
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:39,487	| IOT098 |	Light bulbs some news is coming out
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,535	| IOT098 |	So two bits a newsletter
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,303	| IOT098 |	Someone interesting
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:43,583	| IOT098 |	Is
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,375	| IOT098 |	One control for
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:48,959	| IOT098 |	Has integrated with the Amazon Echo in the UK they had had a
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,263	| IOT098 |	They did it actually last years CD
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,543	| IOT098 |	Here forth
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,311	| IOT098 |	You asked
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,847	| IOT098 |	And then also Crestron
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| IOT098 |	Which
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,895	| IOT098 |	Has a
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,943	| IOT098 |	Professional commercial install
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,455	| IOT098 |	Club Mercury
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| IOT098 |	They actually
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,295	| IOT098 |	Are announcing that that they have
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,575	| IOT098 |	Crestron Mercury
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:08,159	| IOT098 |	For in-room meeting so it's an all-in-one meeting room
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,439	| IOT098 |	Product
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,207	| IOT098 |	From them
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,719	| IOT098 |	Did they announce the
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,023	| IOT098 |	And they're working with polycom and Microsoft
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:17,887	| IOT098 |	This is interesting because a couple other companies like Citrix is using it
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,935	| IOT098 |	Tableau platform to do this
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:24,543	| IOT098 |	Some people are hobbling leasing cobbling machines together with Amazon Echo
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:25,823	| IOT098 |	So
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,359	| IOT098 |	There's definitely demand for Stuff
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,919	| IOT098 |	And now here's what we get grants
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,527	| IOT098 |	Let's talk about what would you advise
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:38,623	| IOT098 |	I get a lot of people that like Stacy how come you never talk about insteon
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,415	| IOT098 |	Crestron or
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,183	| IOT098 |	Or Supply.
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,719	| IOT098 |	And I talked about him a little
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:46,815	| IOT098 |	The professionally installed systems
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,631	| IOT098 |	Pictures of on Crestron control for Elan
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,167	| IOT098 |	Yeah there's a couple more
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| IOT098 |	It's a whole different
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:54,495	| IOT098 |	Experience than what you can
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,519	| IOT098 |	To do with Saya
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:58,335	| IOT098 |	A wink or SmartThings
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,895	| IOT098 |	The relation is going to
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,711	| IOT098 |	No clean and basically invisible
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:08,063	| IOT098 |	You want to have snow Blinky sensors all over the place
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| IOT098 |	Telling people who
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:11,647	| IOT098 |	Who come over and visit the home gadgets everywhere
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,439	| IOT098 |	The experiences
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,231	| IOT098 |	Once again installer will do when they
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,791	| IOT098 |	When they're setting up your system is so come on sit down with you
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,327	| IOT098 |	And just talk about
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,655	| IOT098 |	What you do in the house talk about your lifestyle
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,471	| IOT098 |	And then design the functionality of the system really around that
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,823	| IOT098 |	That's a lot of money a beginning one-room system
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,359	| IOT098 |	Might be
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,895	| IOT098 |	5 grand
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:36,223	| IOT098 |	Just run the DAV in the temperature in one room
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:39,551	| IOT098 |	The level of function that you can get with love you do it yourself
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,831	| IOT098 |	Is getting much better
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,391	| IOT098 |	But the reliability doesn't match that of the
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,415	| IOT098 |	Prosystems
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,183	| IOT098 |	And I agree with
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,207	| IOT098 |	If you I would also
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:49,279	| IOT098 |	Say that anytime your circumstances change on the
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,815	| IOT098 |	The prosystems you have to call them
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,327	| IOT098 |	Back out again
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,119	| IOT098 |	Well you have to
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:57,983	| IOT098 |	Call to call him back out anymore because they're they're getting much better with
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,287	| IOT098 |	Cloud access to your system if there isn't something
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| IOT098 |	Physically
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,103	| IOT098 |	You know wrong if it's some
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,895	| IOT098 |	Switch that they can do
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,687	| IOT098 |	No freezer on computers
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| IOT098 |	Google web
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:10,527	| IOT098 |	Most can do that but
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,551	| IOT098 |	I should say you buy a new Blu-ray
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:15,391	| IOT098 |	And you want to hook it up to your home theater can't really do that yourself
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,672	| IOT098 |	She got to call his daughter to come back
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:22,560	| IOT098 |	Look up right things and then do a little programming magic into your system so yeah it's um
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT098 |	This car sticker
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,960	| IOT098 |	That's what they all say
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,288	| IOT098 |	What do you think
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,080	| IOT098 |	I have no evidence
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,128	| IOT098 |	EXO
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:39,456	| IOT098 |	Everyone should always have a little bit of paranoia but not too much
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:41,248	| IOT098 |	But that's just that just you know
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,040	| IOT098 |	Goes without saying in most of life
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:49,184	| IOT098 |	All right and I brought this up because I have neglected to tell you guys about this for a while and I actually think it's pretty cool
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,720	| IOT098 |	The almonds
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,488	| IOT098 |	3
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,256	| IOT098 |	Router
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:55,072	| IOT098 |	Which I talked about the past because it's not just a mess
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,608	| IOT098 |	Wi-Fi network it's also
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:59,168	| IOT098 |	A smart home control system
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,960	| IOT098 |	Has a signature
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,472	| IOT098 |	Chip in there and
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,264	| IOT098 |	Very nice Caesar
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:03,776	| IOT098 |	Interface
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:08,384	| IOT098 |	And I think it's TSA actually announced an alarm so now it also doubles as like
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,176	| IOT098 |	Oh crap button
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,200	| IOT098 |	Which
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,320	| IOT098 |	They've added iot security to their device
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,368	| IOT098 |	So basically it knows
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,648	| IOT098 |	Because it knows what's on your network
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,952	| IOT098 |	It will check your
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,488	| IOT098 |	Network for vulnerabilities on
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| IOT098 |	Play spices everyday
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,560	| IOT098 |	And when it
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:30,656	| IOT098 |	She's devices that are going out to sites that look suspicious it will block
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,448	| IOT098 |	So
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:36,800	| IOT098 |	That's that's actually really cool and you can also see the data usage which
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:39,104	| IOT098 |	If like you were infected by the Mirai botnet
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,384	| IOT098 |	On one of your cameras
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:43,712	| IOT098 |	You would notice that because your cameras would be consuming a lot of
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,016	| IOT098 |	You probably wouldn't notice it
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,296	| IOT098 |	Any other way unless you lie
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:49,344	| IOT098 |	Like physically went up to feel them and they were super hot
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,112	| IOT098 |	Cuz they were just
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:50,880	| IOT098 |	Running
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,392	| IOT098 |	Cuz he's our
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| IOT098 |	It's not like a computer
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:57,024	| IOT098 |	Sonic's we got this was really good and then Grant told me that
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:59,072	| IOT098 |	You guys are actually working on something right now.
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,096	| IOT098 |	Wirecutter
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:06,752	| IOT098 |	Yeah because it's a security for your smart home devices has has become such a question would we get
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,800	| IOT098 |	About it all the time
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,872	| IOT098 |	That we're going to be a developing a guidon
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:13,152	| IOT098 |	Devices like this
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:17,504	| IOT098 |	I saw the Almond at CES and I think that's a pretty interesting one
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:20,576	| IOT098 |	That I was intrigued by Izzy
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,112	| IOT098 |	They keep a profile
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:26,208	| IOT098 |	Of some of the top smart home devices I think right now they've got about 20
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:29,280	| IOT098 |	Which one has the Hue bulbs and nest
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,560	| IOT098 |	And that profile
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:34,912	| IOT098 |	Is of the sort of the standard operating parameters of that device
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,448	| IOT098 |	And if it notices that
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,472	| IOT098 |	Your
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:41,056	| IOT098 |	Nestor baldwood not goes out of those parameters it tells you it says
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:41,824	| IOT098 |	Something's not right
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,128	| IOT098 |	It could be suspicious and could not
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:47,456	| IOT098 |	I will also tell you what ports are open and what ports are in
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,016	| IOT098 |	I think the challenges is translating
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,552	| IOT098 |	That information
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,064	| IOT098 |	Into
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,112	| IOT098 |	In a sort of actionable
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,416	| IOT098 |	Languages that the average consumer knows what to do with
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:00,000	| IOT098 |	And that is the hard part Del Alma.
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:02,304	| IOT098 |	A pretty nice job it gives you these alerts and then
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,608	| IOT098 |	You know it it gives you a little bit of like
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| IOT098 |	What you can do
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,936	| IOT098 |	I don't know if that one of the options
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,704	| IOT098 |	Is Burnet at this
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,824	| IOT098 |	Look if he's got the infected
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:17,920	| IOT098 |	You know if you got cameras that are affected by the Mirai botnet but the hard-coded password
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,944	| IOT098 |	It just dump that
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,224	| IOT098 |	It's no good to you
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:23,552	| IOT098 |	So we'll see most of the devices
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:25,088	| IOT098 |	We talked about on this show
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:29,440	| IOT098 |	Are over-the-air upgradeable in so you should expect actually to see
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,208	| IOT098 |	Patches come
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,000	| IOT098 |	Pretenders and then yes you should Def
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:38,144	| IOT098 |	All right we'll print thanks so much for coming on the show this week I think you were an amazing
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,936	| IOT098 |	In an even better Grant

EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:09,696	| IOT098 |	I prefer to call it okay I was a little confused about that I was like
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,720	| IOT098 |	Shroud of
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| IOT098 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:16,608	| IOT098 |	So you're in Turin Italy and you are building Casa Jasmina
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,632	| IOT098 |	Can you tell me why
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:22,752	| IOT098 |	Are we came to turn my wife yasmina and I
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,288	| IOT098 |	Some years back because
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:30,688	| IOT098 |	Curators of a local electronic art fair which is called share Festival
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:37,088	| IOT098 |	Journalist but I also like to write about design and especially keen on electronic card
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,904	| IOT098 |	Signs of Life or send high technology art set
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,464	| IOT098 |	We were hanging out with
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:45,536	| IOT098 |	Serenity Electronics
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:49,888	| IOT098 |	Some of them were makers and some of them where I go you know guys and some of us just you know
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,680	| IOT098 |	Weird weekend hippie
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,216	| IOT098 |	Aren't people
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,520	| IOT098 |	But we befriended
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,800	| IOT098 |	I became quite close to them
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| IOT098 |	Build a house
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,664	| IOT098 |	The house
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:05,504	| IOT098 |	Where were you been carrying out some of these electronic activities
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,296	| IOT098 |	So the house is
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,856	| IOT098 |	It looks like from the pictures that you guys
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,368	| IOT098 |	Took out
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,672	| IOT098 |	An older house and you
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,440	| IOT098 |	You're basically
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:13,952	| IOT098 |	You retrofit
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,280	| IOT098 |	Well what it is is an old Fiat founder
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,584	| IOT098 |	Car company here in
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:22,400	| IOT098 |	They're building
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:27,776	| IOT098 |	This particular building is
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,312	| IOT098 |	Fablab in it
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,616	| IOT098 |	It had the Arduino offices
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:34,432	| IOT098 |	Design coworker
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,200	| IOT098 |	Space
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:35,968	| IOT098 |	Moscato
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,760	| IOT098 |	Print shop
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:47,232	| IOT098 |	A combination of light and a place to piss domestic tools
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:52,096	| IOT098 |	I know they'll a little show class at a place where we have cultural events
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,632	| IOT098 |	Okay and
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,424	| IOT098 |	This is a house for me curso
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,704	| IOT098 |	What does that
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:57,472	| IOT098 |	Mean to you
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:00,800	| IOT098 |	Kwik King on Internet of Things
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,568	| IOT098 |	Issues
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,616	| IOT098 |	Cuz that I've been I've been writing about

EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:32,800	| IOT098 |	And besides it's just plain doable
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:37,664	| IOT098 |	Wrote about hacker crying
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,432	| IOT098 |	Walkabout
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:41,504	| IOT098 |	Packer crime actually cash
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,832	| IOT098 |	That's involved electronic crime and also the political
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:45,600	| IOT098 |	Power of it
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:51,232	| IOT098 |	Are so motivated that we really died of a massive International class or full-time criminals
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,280	| IOT098 |	Which never existed in the past
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,072	| IOT098 |	And I think this is one of the major
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,864	| IOT098 |	Differences between
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,656	| IOT098 |	Shooting world
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:03,776	| IOT098 |	Old school internet of the 90s

EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:10,432	| IOT098 |	War friendly Internet of Things
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:14,016	| IOT098 |	So what should we do about that or how should be
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,552	| IOT098 |	Think about that
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,856	| IOT098 |	Because if we think about domestic techno
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:19,392	| IOT098 |	She's so like in the home
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,184	| IOT098 |	That's actually not
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:22,976	| IOT098 |	Terry Bradley widely adopted
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:23,488	| IOT098 |	Fatso
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:26,048	| IOT098 |	We could be like just just don't buy into
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:26,816	| IOT098 |	This is not a good
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:32,448	| IOT098 |	For the rest of Industry which is already adopted this because there are real benefits
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:33,984	| IOT098 |	What do we tell them
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:37,568	| IOT098 |	The point of view of somebody
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,080	| IOT098 |	Italy
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:43,712	| IOT098 |	What can we do about this
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:47,296	| IOT098 |	Because they're on the receiving end of this almost all the time
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:50,112	| IOT098 |	Mini military G7 industrial Nations
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,392	| IOT098 |	Equality
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:56,256	| IOT098 |	Google Apple Facebook Amazon Microsoft and NSA
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:58,304	| IOT098 |	They're not where you buy or not at all
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:02,400	| IOT098 |	Huawei timeout Samsung Gear not the Russian Anthem at the Chinese
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,936	| IOT098 |	Intelligence units
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,960	| IOT098 |	Certo bottle
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,288	| IOT098 |	Santa Monica is home automation
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:09,568	| IOT098 |	And Italy
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,360	| IOT098 |	And it's been around since flight
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,432	| IOT098 |	Animes like dinner with thermostats and whatever
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,712	| IOT098 |	And sometime
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:22,112	| IOT098 |	Kitchens that like
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:24,160	| IOT098 |	Kitchen equipment
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,696	| IOT098 |	Rakhine enough it just give us
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:26,720	| IOT098 |	Stop
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:31,840	| IOT098 |	Which we use in which yolk usually oppresses are Italian
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,144	| IOT098 |	A really good kitchen
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:35,424	| IOT098 |	Okay I think
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:37,216	| IOT098 |	The European response to this
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,752	| IOT098 |	Initiative
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,032	| IOT098 |	Well eventually the
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:43,872	| IOT098 |	Some kind of Lifestyle packaged alternative
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,176	| IOT098 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:49,248	| IOT098 |	And I'll probably say things like well we don't spy on you
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:51,808	| IOT098 |	We're not Facebook or not.
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:52,576	| IOT098 |	Prop
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:55,648	| IOT098 |	You know you can have some really nice chocolate
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:40:00,768	| IOT098 |	Is your guitar really nice espresso will keep can tabs if you're really nice clothing
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:03,584	| IOT098 |	I'm all deliberately do less
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:05,376	| IOT098 |	And Silicon Valley does
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,424	| IOT098 |	When perhaps they can do it in some
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:11,008	| IOT098 |	Safer and more regulated way because that would be
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,800	| IOT098 |	The classic European response
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:15,616	| IOT098 |	The pretty much any American technological initiative
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:19,456	| IOT098 |	But okay you guys do it and we'll do like the cute version
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:23,296	| IOT098 |	I will do the beautiful version that's elegant and private and
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:24,576	| IOT098 |	Possibly.
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:30,208	| IOT098 |	Well as the Japanese say that all of Europe is a boutique and America is a farm
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:33,024	| IOT098 |	I would predict some kind of European
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,560	| IOT098 |	30 corresponds eventually
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:38,656	| IOT098 |	Okay and as a user as a plain person
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:41,472	| IOT098 |	Makes money thinking about alternative scenarios
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,264	| IOT098 |	Where do you think we're headed
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,336	| IOT098 |	And ask that question
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,896	| IOT098 |	And I don't really think we have the words for
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,944	| IOT098 |	Barham
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:53,248	| IOT098 |	I was listening to it on one of your interviews
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:56,832	| IOT098 |	Reason why we were talking about augmentation a kind of everywhere
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:41:00,672	| IOT098 |	That's where we're going
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:03,744	| IOT098 |	Icon Vintage Ubiquiti
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:07,840	| IOT098 |	Cuz I've been very keen on ubiquitous Computing and augmented reality
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:11,936	| IOT098 |	I thought many years ago that if you're going to have time to tationil processes
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:16,544	| IOT098 |	Going on you were going to have to have some kind of display wherever they were happen
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,384	| IOT098 |	Is one of the biggest problems
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:21,664	| IOT098 |	You can't see it's working
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:23,200	| IOT098 |	That's not visible right
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:28,320	| IOT098 |	Disconnected like little things are little prickles of disorder
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:29,856	| IOT098 |	Life
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,368	| IOT098 |	Particular
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:32,160	| IOT098 |	Beloved of mine
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:39,584	| IOT098 |	Science fiction
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,864	| IOT098 |	Intelligent light
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:43,168	| IOT098 |	Are like JustFab cast
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,192	| IOT098 |	Literally
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:46,752	| IOT098 |	But I don't I don't
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:51,104	| IOT098 |	Mother's Day that I can go and only one way I think we're going to see various breeds
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:52,640	| IOT098 |	Augmented Ubiquiti
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:56,479	| IOT098 |	I think we're going to get a balkanized internet we're in for an era of
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,527	| IOT098 |	A massive breakdown
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,807	| IOT098 |	We're not going to see
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,855	| IOT098 |	The kind of
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,135	| IOT098 |	Handshake
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:06,463	| IOT098 |	One-size-fits-all tcpi world
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:10,047	| IOT098 |	Not because it doesn't see the institutional interests of the major players
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:13,119	| IOT098 |	We're going to see silos
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,399	| IOT098 |	I'm going to be like
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:16,703	| IOT098 |	A protective kind of situation
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:20,799	| IOT098 |	Market segmentation
EDL	00:42:21,823	00:42:23,615	| IOT098 |	I really don't want this in my bath
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:28,735	| IOT098 |	And I want somebody to prove that it's not turned on
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:32,575	| IOT098 |	I don't know what the reaction is going to be it's not going to be one
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:34,879	| IOT098 |	The American way since that is always say
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,695	| IOT098 |	Consumer and I just won't go and buy that down at home
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,207	| IOT098 |	Home Depot
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,023	| IOT098 |	But then I got to be offered that chance
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:45,631	| IOT098 |	This is going to be epic struggle on a very high geopolitical
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:50,239	| IOT098 |	And it's not really about you choosing between an 800 PC and a Mac
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:54,591	| IOT098 |	It's true I mean you have to have a phone now to do just about anything
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:56,383	| IOT098 |	And those things are
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:58,431	| IOT098 |	Fantastic tracking
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:00,223	| IOT098 |	Information gathering
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:04,319	| IOT098 |	What should we do about the FSB
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:07,135	| IOT098 |	For like the Russian intelligence services
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:10,975	| IOT098 |	And the response is not a whole lot I mean you can be aware that there around
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:15,327	| IOT098 |	But it's not like you get down to go there and vote with your pocket
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:19,679	| IOT098 |	I'm going to go someplace for the FSB
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,703	| IOT098 |	Nowhere now
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:23,519	| IOT098 |	You just compared iot to the FSB
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:24,543	| IOT098 |	The Russian state
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:29,919	| IOT098 |	They infiltrate the internet and everybody knows but they not
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:34,015	| IOT098 |	Exactly
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:35,295	| IOT098 |	So
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,831	| IOT098 |	This feels very
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:40,415	| IOT098 |	Dystopian we can't do anything
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,951	| IOT098 |	But it's also a real life
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:42,975	| IOT098 |	So
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:44,255	| IOT098 |	I feel like it's a
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:46,303	| IOT098 |	The person I have to be able to do something
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,583	| IOT098 |	Cuz I can't
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,143	| IOT098 |	American
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,911	| IOT098 |	Response
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:54,239	| IOT098 |	Kind of like that I'm an individual and I have to do something
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:54,751	| IOT098 |	Pragmatic
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:59,103	| IOT098 |	I know people think that way
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:05,503	| IOT098 |	Everything will I have to go to the plaza or you know I have to like join a different political party or I have to find a
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,271	| IOT098 |	Patron tequila
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:07,551	| IOT098 |	Protect me from desk
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:08,831	| IOT098 |	So it's not like their health was
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,879	| IOT098 |	I just don't think that the individual
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:12,159	| IOT098 |	Very much
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:16,255	| IOT098 |	I've got to like work to my city council
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:21,375	| IOT098 |	Born some kind of clique I got to get my community or my political party to help me out here
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,143	| IOT098 |	It's not that different
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:23,679	| IOT098 |	Different way of life
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:25,727	| IOT098 |	I know I don't like to
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:29,055	| IOT098 |	A determinist about this and kind of like
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,871	| IOT098 |	Make people Despair and feel like how they can't really do anything
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:34,431	| IOT098 |	Only country I kind of do like a lot of stuff
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:37,247	| IOT098 |	I just don't have an illusion that it's super effect
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,575	| IOT098 |	Like just having a house where people can stay
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:43,647	| IOT098 |	I think it's been very helpful
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:51,071	| IOT098 |	Does a lot of people who are very active on the internet and have all kinds of friends and social media
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:53,375	| IOT098 |	Who does Matt have dinner with
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:55,423	| IOT098 |	Because it's like trouble
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:45:01,055	| IOT098 |	But yeah we can set us a why don't you fly over here and stay for a week and turn in our house
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:04,127	| IOT098 |	Interesting place
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:05,663	| IOT098 |	You don't have to pay
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:08,735	| IOT098 |	When it's a little weird you might get a few plywood splinters
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:12,319	| IOT098 |	A very nice kind of social intervention
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:16,159	| IOT098 |	We have people show up
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,207	| IOT098 |	Weather not Industrial
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:21,791	| IOT098 |	People like that
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,327	| IOT098 |	Antonella
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:26,911	| IOT098 |	Curator of design Museum of Modern Art
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:33,055	| IOT098 |	We had Palace drop by a cousin
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:34,591	| IOT098 |	Okay I like I like this
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:36,895	| IOT098 |	Fatality ID
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:43,551	| IOT098 |	What would you do with your house okay we have an Internet of Things house but it's a house forest and kind of a

EDL	00:45:45,599	00:45:48,927	| IOT098 |	I can be really like push the domestic aspect of it
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:52,511	| IOT098 |	And I think that's actually very useful thing
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:56,607	| IOT098 |	Anybody could build a castle yasmina
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,399	| IOT098 |	All right
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,959	| IOT098 |	Question here which may not end up being a question
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:02,239	| IOT098 |	We'll see what happens
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:07,615	| IOT098 |	Novelist just a storyteller
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:10,943	| IOT098 |	On the show because I think stories are so important
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:13,759	| IOT098 |	Play to something as abstract as technology
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:19,135	| IOT098 |	Do you feel that are storytellers are
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:20,927	| IOT098 |	I sort of feel like they might be
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:22,207	| IOT098 |	Failing us a little bit
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:24,511	| IOT098 |	Not providing a new visions
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:25,279	| IOT098 |	MP
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:28,095	| IOT098 |	Maybe less positive Visions I don't know
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:33,471	| IOT098 |	Our storytellers are shaping the future in
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,495	| IOT098 |	Have we reached like a
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:36,031	| IOT098 |	The point where they're in the future
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:36,543	| IOT098 |	I don't know
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,823	| IOT098 |	Bright
