EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:32,832	| IOT094 |	Stacy
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,112	| IOT094 |	This year
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:35,904	| IOT094 |	Was the star
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:42,816	| IOT094 |	Well obviously because I wasn't there I'm going by third-party reports since I read a ton of coverage
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:49,984	| IOT094 |	And it seems to be I'm not going to name her name but the woman Inside the Amazon Echo with star of the show and
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,776	| IOT094 |	She really wasn't even there
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| IOT094 |	It's not like Amazon has a booth
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:02,016	| IOT094 |	They didn't write but they did have a truck that dispensed Gadget
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,856	| IOT094 |	Oh I want one
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| IOT094 |	Can I order one
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:12,000	| IOT094 |	Would love a truck filled with treasures and trinkets and gadgets
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,280	| IOT094 |	I am sure
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| IOT094 |	Prime now
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,424	| IOT094 |	What's
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:25,568	| IOT094 |	Usually I have seen Amazon products in the past but it's usually from like the people who put the chips inside and so on
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,384	| IOT094 |	You know the fire tablets and things like that
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,920	| IOT094 |	But yeah so
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| IOT094 |	It seems like
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:34,528	| IOT094 |	They were tons of gadgets that were incorporating
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:39,904	| IOT094 |	The Voice services are inside the Echo and I strategically didn't mention your name I thought I did a good job.
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,744	| IOT094 |	Now again I wasn't there so I was reading 3rd
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:44,768	| IOT094 |	Stories
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,352	| IOT094 |	Did you see some of these gadgets that
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:53,984	| IOT094 |	Came out like I know LG has one where was Algeria Lenovo has the
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| IOT094 |	Eraser
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:56,800	| IOT094 |	Prettier version
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:04,480	| IOT094 |	Right right it's a Sydney two-cylinder just like the regular Echo apparently has a much better speaker in
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:10,368	| IOT094 |	Which I don't think the speaker in that activates all that bad to begin with but hey more sound more bass that's good
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:16,000	| IOT094 |	It's interesting to me that they just basically created a what I think is a clone of the echo
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:19,583	| IOT094 |	Which anybody could really do because of the voice services are
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,631	| IOT094 |	Available for developers so you can
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:25,983	| IOT094 |	You know if you got some Hardware smarts and some developers March you could create one of these things
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,799	| IOT094 |	But they weren't the only one it just seemed like there were so many products
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,847	| IOT094 |	It's my companies that said hey
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:35,199	| IOT094 |	This is already working so well for so many people let's not develop our own
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,223	| IOT094 |	Cloud-based
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:41,855	| IOT094 |	Voice recognition system let's just use one that's available and that's of course I win for Amazon as well
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,183	| IOT094 |	So basically what Amazon has created here is
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,463	| IOT094 |	Incredible platform
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,999	| IOT094 |	And they did it by being open
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,327	| IOT094 |	So when someone came to them and said
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,911	| IOT094 |	Into the Trilby guys I was like hey you guys are actually doing
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,447	| IOT094 |	It was a speaker for the kitchen
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:56,959	| IOT094 |	Using
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,263	| IOT094 |	We kind of have to say it the
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,055	| IOT094 |	Abs
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| IOT094 |	Cicatrix
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| IOT094 |	So using AVS
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,151	| IOT094 |	Which is a voice service
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,711	| IOT094 |	They built basically
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,783	| IOT094 |	It had a few modifications but it was essentially an echo
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,111	| IOT094 |	And I talked to them and they were like yeah it was I was cool with
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,671	| IOT094 |	They wanted this out there so yeah
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:22,815	| IOT094 |	That is the mark of an excellent platform and that What's Happening Here is Amazon wants to be the os4
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| IOT094 |	For The Internet of Things
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,911	| IOT094 |	Or maybe it's the OS for the boys plaits
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,679	| IOT094 |	It's
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,983	| IOT094 |	I think those are two separate things that we shouldn't get them
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:34,847	| IOT094 |	I think you're right I would I would classify as they want to be the interface
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,871	| IOT094 |	For your smartphone
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,407	| IOT094 |	Just like apple brought.
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,967	| IOT094 |	Capacitive touch
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,479	| IOT094 |	Right
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:47,135	| IOT094 |	Baby had resistance before that resistance touch before the capacitive touch was a ground changing
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:50,207	| IOT094 |	And they define the features hinchan Zoom swiping
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,231	| IOT094 |	What's happening is it
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| IOT094 |	Amazon with the echo is
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,119	| IOT094 |	Or with AVS more specifically is defining the interface for
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,167	| IOT094 |	End
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,703	| IOT094 |	Actually we could see this
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,239	| IOT094 |	Coming because
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,031	| IOT094 |	Companies like a rant
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| IOT094 |	In ALA
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,847	| IOT094 |	Those two guys are helping
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,151	| IOT094 |	Product manufacturer
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| IOT094 |	Basically create
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,991	| IOT094 |	Cloud services for
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,527	| IOT094 |	Connect two things so there the brains
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,087	| IOT094 |	Are the brains in the muscle that are actually make
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,623	| IOT094 |	You're like washing machine
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,647	| IOT094 |	Your smoke detectors
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,439	| IOT094 |	Connected
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| IOT094 |	And those guys
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:27,327	| IOT094 |	Have integrated and made it super easy for the manufacturers to add
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,351	| IOT094 |	Avs2 there
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,119	| IOT094 |	Air Products
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,423	| IOT094 |	And in talking to those companies they're like yeah
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:37,055	| IOT094 |	Every single manufacturer is come to us in the last 6 months and said we have to be on the echo
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,359	| IOT094 |	That is number one feature
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,127	| IOT094 |	That we need for
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,151	| IOT094 |	For consumers
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,663	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,711	| IOT094 |	We saw this coming
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| IOT094 |	It's actually out
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,271	| IOT094 |	Google
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,807	| IOT094 |	Where are you
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,599	| IOT094 |	I've got to say that like
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,903	| IOT094 |	I know that Google has the apis for
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,415	| IOT094 |	For their voice but
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,439	| IOT094 |	Antarctica
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:07:01,631	| IOT094 |	So I think it was a really good point I'm also just real quick going to disclose that I am a full-time consultant for Google I do now
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:05,215	| IOT094 |	At work with the Google Home Products or anything like that I work with Android and chrome stuff
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,311	| IOT094 |	I agree with you though first-mover status here has been huge for Amazon
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:14,431	| IOT094 |	Like making the platform open by being developer-friendly
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,479	| IOT094 |	This is why I mean
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,295	| IOT094 |	I work for Google and I don't have a Google why not
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,319	| IOT094 |	I have 4 echos In the House
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,855	| IOT094 |	Why do I for icons
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:25,183	| IOT094 |	Because it open enough and came out sooner
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,255	| IOT094 |	So that the products that I want to use work with it
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,559	| IOT094 |	I can't say the same about Google home or other
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,351	| IOT094 |	Similar devices so
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:36,191	| IOT094 |	Yeah first-mover Status here has been huge in my opinion
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:41,567	| IOT094 |	So I did run into wink at the show and they said that we should see them on Google home
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,847	| IOT094 |	So those of you with the wink
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| IOT094 |	He said in a matter of
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,383	| IOT094 |	Weeks
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:49,247	| IOT094 |	I've no doubt it will happen
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,807	| IOT094 |	I mean yeah wink is I think a
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,623	| IOT094 |	A solid player in this in the space for smart home hubs
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,671	| IOT094 |	And there's many others that we
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,951	| IOT094 |	We talked about
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| IOT094 |	Them in the past
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,767	| IOT094 |	So I'm sure it will come to Google home
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:07,167	| IOT094 |	But you know again then will people like me say I've already invested in X number of Echoes
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:11,007	| IOT094 |	What's better with home or whatever other competing product and
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,519	| IOT094 |	I do think
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,311	| IOT094 |	For information
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:17,151	| IOT094 |	When you're requesting information I think maybe home has an advantage there
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:20,223	| IOT094 |	But I have my phone and other devices for that so I don't
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,503	| IOT094 |	Nebat personalized
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:24,831	| IOT094 |	I mean I switch quite honestly even one wink support comes
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:28,159	| IOT094 |	You know Google home is better at more than just information
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:31,231	| IOT094 |	Because when you talk to it as much more conversation
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| IOT094 |	Also
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,559	| IOT094 |	When I tell the echo to set an alarm
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,071	| IOT094 |	For 6
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,399	| IOT094 |	Is it always ass a.m. or p.m.
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,215	| IOT094 |	So I have to remember am now if I tell Google home
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,007	| IOT094 |	To set an alert for 6
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| IOT094 |	The clock it's like
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,823	| IOT094 |	Done Saturday
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| IOT094 |	I set an alarm for 6 a.m.
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,895	| IOT094 |	Yeah I think it's
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,527	| IOT094 |	Yeah I think that gets into the context that Google Now is brought
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,319	| IOT094 |	Go to Google home
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,343	| IOT094 |	Which is very good
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,135	| IOT094 |	I also wonder if
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:02,207	| IOT094 |	What would happen if you set that alarm at 4 in the afternoon
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:06,815	| IOT094 |	Because I'm wondering if it just sets the alarm for the next instance of 6
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| IOT094 |	It might
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,095	| IOT094 |	And that makes a lot
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:15,519	| IOT094 |	I'm just taking a guess I don't know cuz I can't I can't text on my phone I suppose with Google Assistant but I do think
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,287	| IOT094 |	Text or standpoint
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,847	| IOT094 |	Google services do have an advantage
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,431	| IOT094 |	We'll get into this at another show cuz I'm actually writing an essay on
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| IOT094 |	Context
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,783	| IOT094 |	It was the
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:29,087	| IOT094 |	Context was the undercurrent of CES
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,391	| IOT094 |	That's too many to get into now
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| IOT094 |	And I want to write it before I talk about it
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,487	| IOT094 |	It's at all a morphis in my mind
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:36,511	| IOT094 |	But it's
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:41,631	| IOT094 |	I hope your reference my 2012 or 2013 article that I wrote for you on
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,911	| IOT094 |	Is the title was
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,703	| IOT094 |	Why won't Google Now my wrist
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,727	| IOT094 |	Context is King
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:46,751	| IOT094 |	Call Kev
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,615	| IOT094 |	Alright so let's move on
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,127	| IOT094 |	Yuan to
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,151	| IOT094 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,943	| IOT094 |	App Store
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,015	| IOT094 |	We will take their plans to
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:01,855	| IOT094 |	I want an app store this year so they don't have an app store yet
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| IOT094 |	But they're going to do one
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:09,791	| IOT094 |	Okay cool what time am I just do it cuz everybody else has an app store Napster the big thing the big try
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,887	| IOT094 |	I'm not sure I want to see if Fitbit app store in the reason why
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,679	| IOT094 |	One of the things
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:20,287	| IOT094 |	I think my Fitbit so successful is it's really good at a few core features
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,847	| IOT094 |	And it's simple
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:28,223	| IOT094 |	Bring an app store and you start adding complexity and such that I don't know that
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,015	| IOT094 |	Would help this product I mean
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,295	| IOT094 |	I love Fitbit of had
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,879	| IOT094 |	2-3 maybe even for fitbit's and they worked great for me
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:41,791	| IOT094 |	I don't know if there's even talk into the Verge had talked to the founder of the co-founder and CEO James
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:51,007	| IOT094 |	And so the purchasing well there's it's undoubtedly meaning that fitbit's going to also a launch create a smartwatch
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| IOT094 |	Unlike
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,335	| IOT094 |	Why not just have the Fitbit app
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:58,431	| IOT094 |	That works well on an Apple Watch and Android Wear why do you need to do that
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,223	| IOT094 |	Come scratch my head on this
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,247	| IOT094 |	What you think
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| IOT094 |	So this is everyone has to have a plateau
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,855	| IOT094 |	And you know Fitbit is in a hard spot
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,623	| IOT094 |	With the financial markets
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,159	| IOT094 |	Member is public
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:13,023	| IOT094 |	They've got to do more than sell devices because devices are come out
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:19,167	| IOT094 |	Quality business in this is the truth of everyone who is going to get into the consumer Internet of Things
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,983	| IOT094 |	This'll be a good segue into a later segment
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,287	| IOT094 |	What we got here
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,311	| IOT094 |	Where is all of
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:25,823	| IOT094 |	These company
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,359	| IOT094 |	Are like
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,175	| IOT094 |	I need another source of Revenue
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,687	| IOT094 |	I need to
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:38,623	| IOT094 |	And so it's not enough to have Fitbit you know extend its API to all of these other devices out though
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,135	| IOT094 |	Thayer witch
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,951	| IOT094 |	Honestly it's the best interface for iot
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,487	| IOT094 |	They got to have an app store
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:47,839	| IOT094 |	And it got to have a revenue model that gets them a chunk of change so
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,911	| IOT094 |	I don't like it I don't think it's the best way to go but
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,703	| IOT094 |	I see why they're do
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:58,335	| IOT094 |	I asked you why I think you you laid out a very good case for it I just wonder I mean
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:02,431	| IOT094 |	They don't just need a nap store they need a successful App Store and
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:09,599	| IOT094 |	By investing resources development in SM mean it's got a payoff otherwise they could be in worse shape
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:13,439	| IOT094 |	Goodnight I just worried that the being worshipped but I don't want to see what happened obviously
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,535	| IOT094 |	Will you know they acquired Pebble now I don't know how it didn't acquire
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,559	| IOT094 |	All of the
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,887	| IOT094 |	In Pebble had an app store and they did
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,935	| IOT094 |	Well wish
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,447	| IOT094 |	With it
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:28,543	| IOT094 |	I don't know where there any apps on the pebble App Store that were actually purchasable
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,615	| IOT094 |	I believe you could purchase apps
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:38,527	| IOT094 |	I haven't had a pebble in quite a while and that's another example of a device that actually works really well it didn't do that much at
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,319	| IOT094 |	First what it did it did really well
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,903	| IOT094 |	That was no smartphone notifications and such
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,719	| IOT094 |	And then they started adding complexity
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:53,119	| IOT094 |	Out of the same thing it was already existing popular SmartWatches and it didn't work out
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| IOT094 |	So that's my fear
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:58,239	| IOT094 |	Alright so
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,519	| IOT094 |	We're a little worried about Fitbit
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,335	| IOT094 |	Let's move to the high seas
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,407	| IOT094 |	Carnival Cruise ships
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:13,087	| IOT094 |	So this is a really interesting story out of Cs and it I think it shows what you can do when you have a closed ecosystem
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,671	| IOT094 |	So moving from open platforms let's talk about
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:20,511	| IOT094 |	And this is Carnival is basically creating
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,303	| IOT094 |	Iot device
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,631	| IOT094 |	The ocean medallion
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:29,727	| IOT094 |	Have you can wear it on your wrist you can clip it on your thing it's waterproof so you can swim
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,263	| IOT094 |	Baby fall into the ocean eyes
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,799	| IOT094 |	So what's happening here
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| IOT094 |	Where is this becomes
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,663	| IOT094 |	The digital representation of
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| IOT094 |	Cruise ships
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,271	| IOT094 |	And it was created by man named John Padgett
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,319	| IOT094 |	Cool also
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,855	| IOT094 |	What's the guy who helped create Disney
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:52,767	| IOT094 |	I love the fast fast so what's happening
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:53,791	| IOT094 |	Is
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,839	| IOT094 |	This allows Carnival
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:00,959	| IOT094 |	To personalize your experience so when you're walking past like a connected
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:01,471	| IOT094 |	Touch screen
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:05,567	| IOT094 |	It's going to read who you are and it's going to be like oh
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:08,383	| IOT094 |	Here's your itinerary for the day or here's the things you're interested
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:09,919	| IOT094 |	You're going to get
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,711	| IOT094 |	Directions around the cruise ship
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,479	| IOT094 |	From this
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:16,319	| IOT094 |	You're going to actually have all that you had the chance to on the web fill out your
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:21,183	| IOT094 |	Court papers so there's a lot of paperwork before you go on a cruise and usually you do it right before you get on
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,975	| IOT094 |	Now you can do it on the web
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,767	| IOT094 |	It transfers to your medallion
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,327	| IOT094 |	And then you can just walk on the ship
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,607	| IOT094 |	I think this is really interests
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,703	| IOT094 |	So this is all theoretical this is CES
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| IOT094 |	Is there really working on it
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,799	| IOT094 |	But it's going to be out November on
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,567	| IOT094 |	The top-of-the-line
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,591	| IOT094 |	Cruise ships
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:47,295	| IOT094 |	There's a lot to learn here so I'm going to keep an eye on this project mostly because I think there's some cool stuff that can be applied to Smart City
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,343	| IOT094 |	I think they thought
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,391	| IOT094 |	You know what the advantage and the fact that it's
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,671	| IOT094 |	It's a commercial endeavor
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,487	| IOT094 |	You don't get much more closed environment
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,511	| IOT094 |	Cruise ship
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:03,679	| IOT094 |	Yeah and it gets back to that theme of contacts I mean if you're walking past a restaurant
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,471	| IOT094 |	On the cruise ship
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:09,055	| IOT094 |	Then maybe you had look for a reservation and you didn't find any
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,335	| IOT094 |	OpenTable
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,407	| IOT094 |	Look and say hey if someone says walking past guess what let's ping them
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:17,247	| IOT094 |	Hate you had you one of the spot we got a spot now just opened up come on in
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,271	| IOT094 |	Exactly
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:22,111	| IOT094 |	And they're interesting things that kind of make me a little nervous but like
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:25,951	| IOT094 |	If you like gambling for example it can actually give you directions
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,999	| IOT094 |	Route you pass casinos on the ship
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:33,375	| IOT094 |	Well isn't that convenient
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:36,703	| IOT094 |	This is the sky's the limit stuff we're iotb
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,239	| IOT094 |	Becomes really interesting
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:43,103	| IOT094 |	And I think we're going to see these cases develop first in these places like Disneyland
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| IOT094 |	Disney World
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,431	| IOT094 |	On the cruise ships because
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,479	| IOT094 |	They can control everything they have all the
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,015	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:55,135	| IOT094 |	What's also interesting is the aspect of

EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,207	| IOT094 |	In that
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,511	| IOT094 |	You're going to be letting the ships
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:04,863	| IOT094 |	System know where you are at all times more than likely which is not necessarily A Bad Thing
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| IOT094 |	From a safety perspective that could be very useful obviously
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:14,079	| IOT094 |	But I wonder if people will say I just want to go on a cruise and I don't want them to be no one worm
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:15,871	| IOT094 |	Vuclip
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,687	| IOT094 |	I know they they do anyway but this is just a
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:24,319	| IOT094 |	Another this is a little different because this is something you're wearing to allow that to happen
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,135	| IOT094 |	As opposed to say Tamara's and what not you know
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,927	| IOT094 |	Very passive things this is an active thing
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,463	| IOT094 |	Will you have to wear
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,743	| IOT094 |	So when I said you can't
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,791	| IOT094 |	It means like if you want to go on these
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,559	| IOT094 |	Medallion chips
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| IOT094 |	Ditmore
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,423	| IOT094 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:42,239	| IOT094 |	You must wear The Medallion
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:42,751	| IOT094 |	Habitat
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,799	| IOT094 |	It's the same as your room key
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,871	| IOT094 |	Like that let you in and out of
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,711	| IOT094 |	TCU have to have it now you don't have to interact with
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,247	| IOT094 |	You don't have to fill out all the personal prep
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,319	| IOT094 |	But I do want it on you
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,367	| IOT094 |	Because it's your room.
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:00,159	| IOT094 |	Key because they need to track p
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,439	| IOT094 |	People around the ship
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| IOT094 |	Center for safety
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,279	| IOT094 |	Actually like in a situation like in Apache
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,559	| IOT094 |	Situation or even if
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,095	| IOT094 |	Norovirus
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,119	| IOT094 |	Comes out all the time
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,679	| IOT094 |	Cruise ships want to track who was on certain
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,447	| IOT094 |	Dax photography
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,215	| IOT094 |	Affected by
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| IOT094 |	The virus
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,007	| IOT094 |	That's actually really
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,567	| IOT094 |	Useful for both the ship and the passengers
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:21,919	| IOT094 |	No doubt no doubt I I mean I do see positive things too as well I just
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,735	| IOT094 |	Just asking a question allowed here like
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:29,087	| IOT094 |	And I mean that you're not wearing it and you must watch everything MP3 overboard I don't know
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,487	| IOT094 |	It's not so extreme is all that
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:35,999	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:42,911	| IOT094 |	This ties into industrial being the hot iot of the future I wouldn't classify Carnival as industrial bi-weekly
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,191	| IOT094 |	Classifiers Enterprise
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| IOT094 |	Is a business case
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| IOT094 |	Again going back to
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:51,359	| IOT094 |	Fitbit consumer was everywhere obviously the Consumer Electronics Show
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,919	| IOT094 |	But the big money making opportunities
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,015	| IOT094 |	Really seem to be an industrial because there was a big sense of the show that
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:04,159	| IOT094 |	Consumers hard and we're going to get people to pay for ongoing revenue streams and
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,719	| IOT094 |	I don't know if this is really going to work
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,767	| IOT094 |	So tied to
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,559	| IOT094 |	All of the mini smart home platform
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,327	| IOT094 |	Forms I saw there
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,119	| IOT094 |	Silver Lake over a dozen
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,655	| IOT094 |	Some of them were from
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,447	| IOT094 |	Carriers like in
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,215	| IOT094 |	In your opinion
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,775	| IOT094 |	Asia and all that and some of them were actually just
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:24,639	| IOT094 |	Chinese companies that have actually stepped up in their design and like Zmodo
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,687	| IOT094 |	Is a Chinese company in
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:32,063	| IOT094 |	They're showing off some really compelling products I actually am going to try to get some and review them
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:36,415	| IOT094 |	And they have a whole smart home sweet and there were dozens of these maybe not.
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,951	| IOT094 |	There were at least a dozen
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,511	| IOT094 |	Ensue
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,839	| IOT094 |	It feels like the smart home stuff in
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| IOT094 |	Consumer-oriented
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,911	| IOT094 |	I was going to get come out of ties so fast
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:50,239	| IOT094 |	You're going to need new revenue streams if you really want to be a player here
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| IOT094 |	Probably going to have to be big
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| IOT094 |	So then
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:57,151	| IOT094 |	All of the activity should be turning to Industrial
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,687	| IOT094 |	In Enterprise
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:01,247	| IOT094 |	Because I think that's where we're going to see people actually spend
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,831	| IOT094 |	And it's a lot easier you make one
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,647	| IOT094 |	Sale for example and they could be worth
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:11,487	| IOT094 |	Millions or even billions of dollars you know as opposed to trying to piece mail
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:17,375	| IOT094 |	A million consumers all around the world to purchase your products so I definitely see that a lot of bang for buck there
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,935	| IOT094 |	What I didn't see a lot of with smarts
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:24,543	| IOT094 |	I saw some use cases but I didn't see I didn't get the sense there's a lot of spending
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,079	| IOT094 |	They're so
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,871	| IOT094 |	I mean I saw so many LED can I
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| IOT094 |	Nexus street lights
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,687	| IOT094 |	We should put LEDs in
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| IOT094 |	I don't think
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:37,343	| IOT094 |	And again I haven't been to see us in two years so I could have changed I don't think you're going to see like the
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:42,463	| IOT094 |	Municipalities showing up to see what technology is out there I think that's probably a different show
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:44,511	| IOT094 |	So that's probably why you didn't see that
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,535	| IOT094 |	Probably
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,095	| IOT094 |	Okay you're right
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:50,399	| IOT094 |	Expected EPS I'll give you that
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,191	| IOT094 |	Can your 10 years of CEO
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,263	| IOT094 |	So that's and colds too.
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,543	| IOT094 |	Ten codes 10 years
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,079	| IOT094 |	All right
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:00,127	| IOT094 |	Okay let's talk really fast about
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,407	| IOT094 |	Comcast
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,943	| IOT094 |	Because
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:06,527	| IOT094 |	Last time we checked which was about a year ago it's at 500000
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:10,111	| IOT094 |	Connected homes like people using a smart home and home automation
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,647	| IOT094 |	Call Xfinity home
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,231	| IOT094 |	And I saw them at the show this was their first CES
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,255	| IOT094 |	And they were showing off
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,047	| IOT094 |	Two things worth mentioning
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,375	| IOT094 |	One is they did a deal with a company called sierant
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,167	| IOT094 |	To help with
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,679	| IOT094 |	Provisioning
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,495	| IOT094 |	In provisioning is the act of getting devices on
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,823	| IOT094 |	Weight gain and connected to the cloud getting them on
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,103	| IOT094 |	Night so that takes a
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:33,663	| IOT094 |	Cloud side but it also takes the consumer going
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,711	| IOT094 |	Like downloading the app
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,503	| IOT094 |	And doing whatever
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,271	| IOT094 |	They need to do
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,039	| IOT094 |	There so many ways
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,807	| IOT094 |	Supervision
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,575	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:42,111	| IOT094 |	What Comcast showed off
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,135	| IOT094 |	Was
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:45,695	| IOT094 |	That it did this deal with. And
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:49,535	| IOT094 |	Now any device that has secret software and there could be more
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:52,863	| IOT094 |	Are already online with Comcast public Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,447	| IOT094 |	So what happens is you bring it into your home
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:59,519	| IOT094 |	You download the app in the app searches for
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,055	| IOT094 |	The most recently connected
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,079	| IOT094 |	Device to your net
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,383	| IOT094 |	Redis trying to connect to your network
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| IOT094 |	Is Caesar
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,455	| IOT094 |	And it says hey do you want to
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,735	| IOT094 |	Activate this
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,783	| IOT094 |	And you hit the button and it does
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:15,135	| IOT094 |	If it's in a Comcast home and you have a Comcast router in this is important
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,928	| IOT094 |	You're not using a Comcast router
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,208	| IOT094 |	Get this
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,768	| IOT094 |	It will actually give you two options one is activated
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,048	| IOT094 |	Like the manual way
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,096	| IOT094 |	The other is activated on
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,376	| IOT094 |	Comcast Xfinity home
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| IOT094 |	You press that button
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,984	| IOT094 |	Literally everything is automated gives you your SSID
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,544	| IOT094 |	It does all of that and suddenly your device pops up on
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:34,848	| IOT094 |	Which is pretty cool
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:37,664	| IOT094 |	Yeah we'll set up Simplicity is a big thing
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:42,272	| IOT094 |	Smart home mix one of the reasons people don't want to get things like I don't have to mess with us
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:47,136	| IOT094 |	So they definitely made it easier that got a new Gateway that I think they're coming out with this year
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,952	| IOT094 |	5:30
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:55,840	| IOT094 |	Gabby's going to say what they got the new Gateway and then all of the software features that you're talking about I think we'll actually be
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,656	| IOT094 |	Apply to the old gateways as well so you don't
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:01,216	| IOT094 |	Necessarily have to get the new gateway to get all these features but
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:01,984	| IOT094 |	I could be wrong
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT094 |	No you are right
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,568	| IOT094 |	I'm two for two
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,616	| IOT094 |	No wonder I have you with
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,688	| IOT094 |	I'm so glad I cannot wait to see you spell weight
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,528	| IOT094 |	Your nuts
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,624	| IOT094 |	Okay so the other aspect of Comcast that's worth
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,160	| IOT094 |	Doting is I actually
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:24,000	| IOT094 |	I don't have strong lovey-dovey feelings for Comcast because I've
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,536	| IOT094 |	Cover net neutrality in the past
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,072	| IOT094 |	End data caps
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,888	| IOT094 |	Which Comcast every time I say the word data caps they're going to argue with me
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,912	| IOT094 |	It's a data cap
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,448	| IOT094 |	What is a terabyte
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,472	| IOT094 |	What they done now
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,032	| IOT094 |	It's actually really nice they've created
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:38,080	| IOT094 |	Three or four years ago.
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:43,968	| IOT094 |	Bought a company called Power. Which made a really cool wi-fi system so way before everyone else was like
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,296	| IOT094 |	Hey wife I should have better software it be easier for Consumers power. Was doing
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,112	| IOT094 |	So when Comcast bought them I was excited to see you
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,160	| IOT094 |	Finally it has happened
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,720	| IOT094 |	The acquisition of power dog
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,024	| IOT094 |	Plus all the time automation stuff and
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,560	| IOT094 |	Good routers coming out
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,656	| IOT094 |	Put Comcast into making software on this new Gateway
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,680	| IOT094 |	It is
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,984	| IOT094 |	So user
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,752	| IOT094 |	Friendly
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:07,776	| IOT094 |	And it's even cute
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,056	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,640	| IOT094 |	They let you create profiles for people they let like
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,944	| IOT094 |	Many of the things you would expect
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,712	| IOT094 |	From a modern router
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,248	| IOT094 |	Such as you know
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| IOT094 |	Being able to see
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,064	| IOT094 |	All of the devices on your
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,880	| IOT094 |	Being able to see who's associated with
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:27,232	| IOT094 |	Being able to see how much they're using and when they're using it
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:29,024	| IOT094 |	All of that is now available
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| IOT094 |	And I love it
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,632	| IOT094 |	And they'd have cute little designs
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,144	| IOT094 |	State to have like
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,680	| IOT094 |	Profile animal
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| IOT094 |	Like your spirit animal
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| IOT094 |	Xboxes and Rec
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:42,080	| IOT094 |	The design was done in part by a guy who used to do
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,360	| IOT094 |	Nike's fuelband se
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:48,224	| IOT094 |	So that's all great and it offers up to nine gigabytes of Wi-Fi
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,760	| IOT094 |	You know if you have a massive
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,040	| IOT094 |	Connection
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:54,880	| IOT094 |	It looks nice and simple and I can't get back to you
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:24:00,512	| IOT094 |	Bring Simplicity but allowing for control which is what you want to do with the steady want to go to control who has access
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:01,792	| IOT094 |	I maybe
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:05,632	| IOT094 |	Certain time you want to flip internet off for certain people or certain devices that's great
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,936	| IOT094 |	So it's not going to work was she who shall not
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,776	| IOT094 |	I was like what about voice there like we have the Xfinity X1
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:15,616	| IOT094 |	Yeah they got their own boys play their side I'm not surprised by that
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,152	| IOT094 |	But you know you do have to find her
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:22,528	| IOT094 |	Voices the invisible interface
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:23,808	| IOT094 |	Visible if you have to pay
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:25,856	| IOT094 |	I agree
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,928	| IOT094 |	News and finally
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,720	| IOT094 |	2 weeks ago
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,000	| IOT094 |	Her name is a week and a half ago
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,768	| IOT094 |	I don't remember
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:35,072	| IOT094 |	I purchased the GE Z-Wave
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,120	| IOT094 |	Wireless smart door sensor
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,656	| IOT094 |	Hinge pin
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,192	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,240	| IOT094 |	If you guys are like what the what
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,264	| IOT094 |	This is
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:50,176	| IOT094 |	That is supposed to be an invisible open close sensor for your door you basically stick it on the
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| IOT094 |	Hinge pin
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,456	| IOT094 |	Of your door
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:52,992	| IOT094 |	In
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,552	| IOT094 |	It has a little thing that sticks out and hits the door
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:58,368	| IOT094 |	So it's kind of shaped like a
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:24:58,880	| IOT094 |	A number seven
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,440	| IOT094 |	Little arm basically
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| IOT094 |	A little arm
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,280	| IOT094 |	It hits the door and when it goes past a certain
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,840	| IOT094 |	Point is supposed to trigger it to say hey the door is open
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,376	| IOT094 |	In
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:11,424	| IOT094 |	I looked at this and I was like oh my God I have to
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:14,240	| IOT094 |	The Habit is awesome so I plop down the 40 bucks on Amazon
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT094 |	It arrived
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,056	| IOT094 |	And I went to install
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,592	| IOT094 |	And that is when
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,456	| IOT094 |	I cannot recommend this product
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:27,040	| IOT094 |	I'm actually I printed out the return label and I'm sending it back
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:28,320	| IOT094 |	Probably tomorrow
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,600	| IOT094 |	Because
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,928	| IOT094 |	Set up was easy I hooked it up with my wink hub
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,512	| IOT094 |	And that was great I also hooked it up with my SmartThings Hub
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:39,584	| IOT094 |	And that was just a just to try it out for both platform
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,352	| IOT094 |	And
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,656	| IOT094 |	Installing it on the door was okay
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,984	| IOT094 |	I mean I just had that my hinge pins were a little rusty
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:52,384	| IOT094 |	So I had to let Billy Wacom out there basically you just have to take a hinge pin out put this thing on the hinge and then put the
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,408	| IOT094 |	Pinback I'm guessing
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,224	| IOT094 |	Next
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,504	| IOT094 |	But
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,296	| IOT094 |	It does not fit tight
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,088	| IOT094 |	To the hinge pin
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,112	| IOT094 |	Or the wall
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,136	| IOT094 |	Which means
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,440	| IOT094 |	When the door opens
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,488	| IOT094 |	The bass moves
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,768	| IOT094 |	Because the clique
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,328	| IOT094 |	To trigger it from open to close
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,376	| IOT094 |	Who's fairly sensitive
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:18,496	| IOT094 |	When you open and close the door the whole apparatus moves in does it messes with the
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,520	| IOT094 |	Operation
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| IOT094 |	Does happen
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:28,736	| IOT094 |	That's that's a shame because I'm paper this sounded so good because it is essentially invisible right it's it's not like a box
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,504	| IOT094 |	Aksara
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,528	| IOT094 |	Something that you can
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,832	| IOT094 |	Easily see if I can fix you
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,600	| IOT094 |	Emacs
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,416	| IOT094 |	You can actually buy paintable version
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:41,792	| IOT094 |	Yeah so they're there it's made to be hidden but smart and informative
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:44,608	| IOT094 |	And I'm just going to ask this question I think I know the answer
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,632	| IOT094 |	You don't have any
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:50,496	| IOT094 |	Unique or special hindered or that you're applying is to unassuming
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,264	| IOT094 |	No this was
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| IOT094 |	Regular
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,056	| IOT094 |	This was an outsider
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:57,152	| IOT094 |	So it was a little girl front door
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,176	| IOT094 |	It was the door to my room
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:01,248	| IOT094 |	Cuz I was like if that I would love to know when that soap
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:04,832	| IOT094 |	Right right so for an exterior door using it on
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:08,672	| IOT094 |	But it would have the same problems on an interior door
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,720	| IOT094 |	Even though they're not as heavy
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:15,584	| IOT094 |	I think the the big flies that it just doesn't fit tight so it
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,656	| IOT094 |	It moves when you open and close the door which means
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:21,472	| IOT094 |	So you can't accurately measure that point
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,824	| IOT094 |	Yes we spent 40 is so my husband and I spent 45 minutes calibrating this thing
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:27,616	| IOT094 |	In
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:30,176	| IOT094 |	We never got it to actually work
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:32,736	| IOT094 |	So we never actually got it
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:33,760	| IOT094 |	Close
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:34,784	| IOT094 |	At the right time
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:37,600	| IOT094 |	If you held it maybe if I duct-taped it down
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:40,928	| IOT094 |	Well there goes the invisible Factor
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,488	| IOT094 |	These were these were the
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| IOT094 |	Whitney
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,816	| IOT094 |	But yes it at that point it was like
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,096	| IOT094 |	Nope
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,120	| IOT094 |	Traditional open
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,680	| IOT094 |	And I am going to try the census
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:54,240	| IOT094 |	Strips sensitive strips at sensitive
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,264	| IOT094 |	Two A's
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:28:00,896	| IOT094 |	Right those are the three three mm thick strips I think that you just put inside a door framing
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:04,736	| IOT094 |	It's a simple open close sensor that you really can't see easily
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,528	| IOT094 |	Yes but I have heard the
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,808	| IOT094 |	They have a similar problem
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,088	| IOT094 |	Their hearts
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,648	| IOT094 |	I don't know why those are hard to kill
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:13,696	| IOT094 |	But you know
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,208	| IOT094 |	We might discuss
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:19,072	| IOT094 |	I guess the point here is probably don't want to buy this sensor
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:22,144	| IOT094 |	Maybe if you have really maybe my hinge pins weren't fat butt
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:25,984	| IOT094 |	I really don't think this was something that was actually a parent in the
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:26,496	| IOT094 |	Reviews
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,032	| IOT094 |	So I just want to
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,104	| IOT094 |	You are don't you worry about that
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,152	| IOT094 |	If you can somehow
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,736	| IOT094 |	Tighten the thing to your hinge pin
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,040	| IOT094 |	Maybe that
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,064	| IOT094 |	Work
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:46,464	| IOT094 |	I don't think we need to tighten the store in Japan I think there needs to be a analysis and redesign
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:46,976	| IOT094 |	Yes
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,048	| IOT094 |	That is Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:50,560	| IOT094 |	Review of

EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:57,984	| IOT094 |	That
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:00,544	| IOT094 |	Probably is good for the news Fortune of this week show
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:04,896	| IOT094 |	You're going to still hear a lot more about CEs from us probably
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,456	| IOT094 |	Because I still have lots of things
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,224	| IOT094 |	I think about
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:08,736	| IOT094 |	And talk about
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,784	| IOT094 |	But it's going to be more Blended in

EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,560	| IOT094 |	And then we validate

EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:29,632	| IOT094 |	Labs to ensure that are custom

EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,472	| IOT094 |	You're in the business space
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:36,544	| IOT094 |	Type of iot is actually doing it
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,592	| IOT094 |	Disservice because it's making it harder for
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,640	| IOT094 |	For Business Leaders to really understand
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:43,456	| IOT094 |	Where they should focus their efforts around iot
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:46,016	| IOT094 |	What initiatives they should be putting into place
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,344	| IOT094 |	And that's why I hear Adele really working hard to shift
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:53,952	| IOT094 |	From use case stories or what I call Flying Pig there's a lot of those in
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| IOT094 |	In iot
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:58,304	| IOT094 |	Can moving more towards real deployments real r a y
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:01,376	| IOT094 |	Cut through all this how you can help our customers really make
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:04,448	| IOT094 |	Impactful decisions around their iot an issue
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:08,032	| IOT094 |	All right what is it about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:10,080	| IOT094 |	Requires companies to have
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:14,432	| IOT094 |	You know the issue is that there's so much fragmentation
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:18,784	| IOT094 |	And iot today 400 different and grieving up to 400
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,808	| IOT094 |	30 difference
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,600	| IOT094 |	Platforms that analysts are tracking
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,160	| IOT094 |	And what that means is every iota
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,184	| IOT094 |	Deployment
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,720	| IOT094 |	Tends to be a snowflake
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,512	| IOT094 |	Might look the same from a mark
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:31,584	| IOT094 |	Texture perspective but really when you dig in its
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:35,424	| IOT094 |	Unique is totally different there's lots of custom code being written
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:39,264	| IOT094 |	And the challenge there is that slows down our customers from
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:42,592	| IOT094 |	Really getting the return on these iot initiative
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:45,408	| IOT094 |	And that's the reason why these blueprints
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:49,760	| IOT094 |	Provides repeatability because I can't we validated it in our labs
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,320	| IOT094 |	And ultimately our customers can then trust because
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,344	| IOT094 |	It's proven
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:59,744	| IOT094 |	That they can implement it and not have it be a snowflake but had to be something that they can manage and secure and deploy
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,256	| IOT094 |	Boy faster
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,560	| IOT094 |	Kevin I've learned so much about Looper
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:03,840	| IOT094 |	Where can I buy
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:09,216	| IOT094 |	The best place to learn more is he go to dell.com iot

EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:18,592	| IOT094 |	Guys I've got to be all Fangirl
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,408	| IOT094 |	Tell me about the book
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:27,296	| IOT094 |	The book is called wiring The Internet of Things it will be published by O'Reilly
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:30,368	| IOT094 |	Later next year hopefully april-may time
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:35,488	| IOT094 |	It's already available on pre-orders you got to have a look on the O'Reilly website
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:37,280	| IOT094 |	And it's all about connecting
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:39,328	| IOT094 |	Hardware with aerobic like
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,096	| IOT094 |	Computer
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:42,400	| IOT094 |	Using node red software and
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,216	| IOT094 |	Mqtt messaging protocol
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,776	| IOT094 |	And just how you can put those three things together
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:50,848	| IOT094 |	And if you have the ability to put together
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,384	| IOT094 |	Ikea furniture
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:56,480	| IOT094 |	You have the ability to put together your own internet so sing sing
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:59,296	| IOT094 |	It's true and we're going to talk about that later in the show
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,600	| IOT094 |	So first off let's kick it off with
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,672	| IOT094 |	We've been like throwing around the phrase the internet of things for years now
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,976	| IOT094 |	And a lot already in this conversation
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,512	| IOT094 |	What does that even mean to you
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,536	| IOT094 |	Who is someone who is
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:12,864	| IOT094 |	Probably been doing connected stuff for way before this was like even
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,680	| IOT094 |	Get the Internet of Things me the million things
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,704	| IOT094 |	2 million different people
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:20,032	| IOT094 |	To me and how I like to think about it
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:20,800	| IOT094 |	Is
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,080	| IOT094 |	Guessing something
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,360	| IOT094 |	Say
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,640	| IOT094 |	The toy
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,664	| IOT094 |	And so you won't
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:28,736	| IOT094 |	Put a toy in your child's bedroom
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:33,344	| IOT094 |	And tweet them when it's time for dinner so you want the toy to start worrying if it's it's
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,624	| IOT094 |	Toy dinosaur you can
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT094 |	Facts that
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,464	| IOT094 |	Put it on your own WiFi
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,744	| IOT094 |	Connected to the internet
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:43,072	| IOT094 |	Tweet something else and it will make the dinosaur noise
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,096	| IOT094 |	In your child's bedroom
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,656	| IOT094 |	Take another step further what if
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,424	| IOT094 |	I know
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,704	| IOT094 |	Elderly parents
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,496	| IOT094 |	They're on the road
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,544	| IOT094 |	And that quite happy that quite good but
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,360	| IOT094 |	I'm a little bit worried about them what if I
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:35:00,224	| IOT094 |	Especially in person to monitor their electricity Supply and I know
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:01,504	| IOT094 |	My parents
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:06,112	| IOT094 |	Make a cup of tea first thing in the morning so that be a spike in their electricity
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,648	| IOT094 |	I want to see
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:09,184	| IOT094 |	Is that Spike happened
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:10,720	| IOT094 |	I don't want to see that
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,768	| IOT094 |	I just want to message that tells me
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,560	| IOT094 |	Other side of the country
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,328	| IOT094 |	That's yes
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:22,240	| IOT094 |	Put the catalog so everything's okay and if they haven't done that on my way to give him a ring so I want the message to say
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:25,824	| IOT094 |	Casino Newcastle Spike has been noted in electricity Supply
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,384	| IOT094 |	You might want to call your parents
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,664	| IOT094 |	Kind of Internet
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,944	| IOT094 |	Things connecting
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,456	| IOT094 |	Things
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:35,808	| IOT094 |	But we may not quite know about so quite we want to
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:38,368	| IOT094 |	Going to intricate detail but more
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:41,184	| IOT094 |	Insurance things make things have a life of Their Own
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,512	| IOT094 |	And then if we can take that a step further and stomp actually
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,048	| IOT094 |	Analyzing some of that stuff
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:48,608	| IOT094 |	Take Canadian industry.
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,400	| IOT094 |	Where Internet of Things is really going to work
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:52,704	| IOT094 |	So this gets to me
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:54,240	| IOT094 |	Theory of making
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,776	| IOT094 |	Because I think the same way you
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:01,408	| IOT094 |	I got all these bits and Bobs and what can I do with them to make cool new things out of
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:05,248	| IOT094 |	It occurred to me after covering this for a while that most people don't
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:06,272	| IOT094 |	Shake That
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:10,368	| IOT094 |	Most people want prescribed recipes are products that are like
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,648	| IOT094 |	I do this
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:15,232	| IOT094 |	So is this an eighth thing and everyone looks like
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:17,792	| IOT094 |	Creativity and desire to make it how can we make it
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,816	| IOT094 |	More so I guess
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,096	| IOT094 |	Future Generations is that even in
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,912	| IOT094 |	I think it's really important
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:23,424	| IOT094 |	I think
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,472	| IOT094 |	It was a night
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:27,008	| IOT094 |	And
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:27,776	| IOT094 |	If you look good
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,080	| IOT094 |	3 4 5 year olds
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,896	| IOT094 |	Will they doing all the time that playing with stuff
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:37,248	| IOT094 |	That making things happen they using their imagination
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,040	| IOT094 |	The filing and the filing Austin
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,088	| IOT094 |	But it doesn't matter then
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:43,392	| IOT094 |	They keep trying again and they build on that
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:45,952	| IOT094 |	Episonic climb a tree they might
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,512	| IOT094 |	Full of the first Branch hunting salesman
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,536	| IOT094 |	Dinotu
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,328	| IOT094 |	Hold on better next time
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:52,608	| IOT094 |	And so this
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,400	| IOT094 |	Picture of learning
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:55,680	| IOT094 |	What we do when we
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,448	| IOT094 |	Playing
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:37:00,288	| IOT094 |	Is really critical in to be creative or what happens if
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,592	| IOT094 |	What can I do when
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:05,664	| IOT094 |	How do I make this do what I wanted to do
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:07,968	| IOT094 |	Which is oldest things that we have as a child
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,248	| IOT094 |	Thought
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,016	| IOT094 |	School
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,320	| IOT094 |	Parents growing up
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| IOT094 |	Something
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,624	| IOT094 |	Nazi sound of us
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,392	| IOT094 |	We don't want
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:18,208	| IOT094 |	Play anymore we don't want to be seen to be failing
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:20,000	| IOT094 |	But I think the actual
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:22,048	| IOT094 |	Having fun the creative bit
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,352	| IOT094 |	Alps Iceman and houses get
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:29,472	| IOT094 |	Tudo que what is it that I want to do I no longer want to just be
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,240	| IOT094 |	Even
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,008	| IOT094 |	Dissolution
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,824	| IOT094 |	Because what I want isn't actually
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,592	| IOT094 |	What
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:36,128	| IOT094 |	10 of the people want I want
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:42,016	| IOT094 |	To me and said to get Luke bespoke Solutions we're going to have to start doing them for ourselves
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:45,088	| IOT094 |	So for kids I love her like
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,648	| IOT094 |	You're a big fan of the Raspberry Pi so
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,672	| IOT094 |	Maybe this is why
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:49,952	| IOT094 |	But like
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:52,512	| IOT094 |	If I want an easy way into this as an adult
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:56,352	| IOT094 |	Or if I want to provide something for my kids
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,144	| IOT094 |	What are the tools you think I would
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,448	| IOT094 |	I'm going to go with the roster
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:02,240	| IOT094 |	Because
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:05,824	| IOT094 |	It is an expensive is 30 pounds for a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:10,432	| IOT094 |	It has a base of the computing power of a computer from about 10 years ago
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:15,808	| IOT094 |	Answer 10 years ago you wouldn't have given anybody here you all his the family
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:17,088	| IOT094 |	Computer this
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:18,624	| IOT094 |	Thousands of pounds
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:21,952	| IOT094 |	You wouldn't let someone just going to hack into Old try things
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:24,256	| IOT094 |	With it too if you broke it that would be a big
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,024	| IOT094 |	Copeland
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:28,864	| IOT094 |	If you break a 30 pounds computer will not such a big problem
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,912	| IOT094 |	I'm not computer that. Moseby
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:31,936	| IOT094 |	Supplies the brain
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:36,032	| IOT094 |	Which you can hang other things off so whether you're programming it
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,568	| IOT094 |	In a programming language or
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:43,712	| IOT094 |	Node red which is visual flow so you can see he doesn't need to worry about the semantics of
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:46,784	| IOT094 |	How about through color in the right places do I need to
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:53,184	| IOT094 |	Finish this with a colon or semicolon on how does this work the first step but that's my knee
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,720	| IOT094 |	The computer step
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:55,488	| IOT094 |	The brain bit
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:58,048	| IOT094 |	What I really like is actually
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:58,816	| IOT094 |	Reconnecting that
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:00,096	| IOT094 |	To hardware
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:01,632	| IOT094 |	Putting the toys
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,400	| IOT094 |	The things
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,680	| IOT094 |	Some boots
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:08,800	| IOT094 |	That you can Suites the McCulloch and they'll change color this LEDs in the bottom of them
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:13,408	| IOT094 |	I bought them and they just lit up but now
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,432	| IOT094 |	Because of hat
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:19,808	| IOT094 |	You can treat them and they change color rather than just going to the pre-programmed color that was already on there
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:21,344	| IOT094 |	I love that you as an adult
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,368	| IOT094 |	Spotlight
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:29,024	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,560	| IOT094 |	It sounds like a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,096	| IOT094 |	Possum
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,632	| IOT094 |	Since you got no red on there
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,960	| IOT094 |	You can learn a lot from that until your book comes out
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,752	| IOT094 |	Check it out
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,032	| IOT094 |	And then
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,056	| IOT094 |	The actuator
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,080	| IOT094 |	Parts in
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,896	| IOT094 |	Yeah do you just buy these from like Adafruit or
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,176	| IOT094 |	Where would I run around
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:47,968	| IOT094 |	This is
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:51,296	| IOT094 |	At the moment still the next the tricky stage
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:54,368	| IOT094 |	Because you're at the moment you still have to
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,904	| IOT094 |	By the by
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:56,928	| IOT094 |	What scooter hat
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:59,488	| IOT094 |	Which you put on top of your Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:02,816	| IOT094 |	And that enables you to connect mooses or
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,608	| IOT094 |	Next census to the pie
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:06,400	| IOT094 |	But sometimes you still have
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,424	| IOT094 |	How to do some soldiering
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:09,216	| IOT094 |	Which is another
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:12,288	| IOT094 |	Coupe to jump so if you don't have a soul drain line if you've never
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,056	| IOT094 |	Done and Isolde ring
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:19,968	| IOT094 |	My soul drink five years ago was horrendous I found some reason it is Big blowup sold everywhere I used to burn my fingers
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:21,504	| IOT094 |	I'll take it awhile but
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:25,088	| IOT094 |	Uncle Philip better but those first steps already a little bit daunting
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:27,648	| IOT094 |	Product School
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:28,928	| IOT094 |	Back inductive
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,696	| IOT094 |	Which is paint
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:31,488	| IOT094 |	So you can paint your own solder
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:36,096	| IOT094 |	And use that for the smaller items you can make cards and
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:41,728	| IOT094 |	Cause that light up with LEDs because you just painted the soda on there are lots of things to get you started in
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,776	| IOT094 |	And then these hot some of them have
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:46,848	| IOT094 |	Screw terminals so you cannot just screw the wise in
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,896	| IOT094 |	Adafruit
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,688	| IOT094 |	RS Components
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:52,736	| IOT094 |	A lot of these companies have
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,272	| IOT094 |	Bits that you can take
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,040	| IOT094 |	As a maker
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,064	| IOT094 |	And
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,368	| IOT094 |	Adafruit on Broad Street
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,136	| IOT094 |	Pi
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:02,208	| IOT094 |	And RS Components and many other
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:03,488	| IOT094 |	Websites out there
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:07,584	| IOT094 |	Showing you how to do these things there was a wonderful community
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,632	| IOT094 |	We make a community of
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:11,936	| IOT094 |	This is how I did this
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,728	| IOT094 |	You can follow my step by step instructions
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:20,384	| IOT094 |	This phone I've done a PNC but I can't get to DNS what did I do wrong
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:23,456	| IOT094 |	You'll get many suggestions
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:26,784	| IOT094 |	If you could have done wrong and how to how to get there
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:28,576	| IOT094 |	Okay now you are also a mechanic
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,624	| IOT094 |	Sophia
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,392	| IOT094 |	How much of that
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:32,928	| IOT094 |	You rely on
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,208	| IOT094 |	But I have a
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,232	| IOT094 |	At the Graham
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:36,256	| IOT094 |	Mechanical engineering
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:42,656	| IOT094 |	And also PhD in fluid dynamics of the page that I must say I'm not relying on it to have late when I'm doing any of this
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,424	| IOT094 |	Baking stuff
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,960	| IOT094 |	And actually not much
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:47,008	| IOT094 |	The degree
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:52,384	| IOT094 |	Inasmuch as the mathematical calculations to find out how to do
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,151	| IOT094 |	I'm not using
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:55,455	| IOT094 |	But my experience all
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:59,039	| IOT094 |	I know which materials are probably best for various things
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:01,343	| IOT094 |	The electronics of Greeley
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:02,879	| IOT094 |	From scratch
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:05,951	| IOT094 |	And onion Last 5 Years and not Spain
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:07,231	| IOT094 |	On the way
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:10,303	| IOT094 |	Undercoating I've learned from scratch in last 5 years
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:12,863	| IOT094 |	From the web and from people helping me
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:15,423	| IOT094 |	Okay so that it actually feels really
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:15,935	| IOT094 |	Doable
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:18,495	| IOT094 |	You're probably a smart woman
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:20,287	| IOT094 |	We got lots of smart
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,847	| IOT094 |	Anything you need
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,871	| IOT094 |	Is the logic
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:24,639	| IOT094 |	Remind
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,663	| IOT094 |	To know that
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,967	| IOT094 |	You go to do this before you can do that
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:29,247	| IOT094 |	Before you can do the other
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,015	| IOT094 |	Order of operations
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:33,343	| IOT094 |	Recipe how do you cook
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:37,951	| IOT094 |	Cooking recipe you can follow a lot of these things on the web
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,231	| IOT094 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:39,999	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:41,023	| IOT094 |	Let's get to the
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,303	| IOT094 |	Project
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:42,815	| IOT094 |	Fortunate
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,607	| IOT094 |	I'll let you choose
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,375	| IOT094 |	Your projects
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,399	| IOT094 |	I'm helping
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:46,911	| IOT094 |	Best Buy speakers
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,471	| IOT094 |	So
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,263	| IOT094 |	Take a project and let's walk
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,287	| IOT094 |	People threw in a little bit
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:55,871	| IOT094 |	Okay I'll work with the bus project that I'm fat
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:56,639	| IOT094 |	Just finished
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| IOT094 |	I gave a talk
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:01,247	| IOT094 |	A while ago and
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:07,391	| IOT094 |	Using raw sweet pies and what up and doing in the interactive dinosaurs that we've been working with a theme park
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,951	| IOT094 |	A lady came up to me at the end and said
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:11,743	| IOT094 |	What I really want
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,535	| IOT094 |	Is a Visual Alert
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:19,935	| IOT094 |	That tells me that in 5 minutes time the buses going to be at my bus stop
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:22,239	| IOT094 |	Which gives me X. Makoto
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,519	| IOT094 |	Go downstairs
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:24,799	| IOT094 |	I'm get to the bus stop
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:25,823	| IOT094 |	Just before the bus arrives
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:29,151	| IOT094 |	Should be up this apps that you can look at
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,687	| IOT094 |	As soon as I look at my phone
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:32,223	| IOT094 |	I checked my emails
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:37,599	| IOT094 |	So I just want something visual that flashes at me that says right now is the time to go
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,367	| IOT094 |	Get your bus
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:45,279	| IOT094 |	About this and she lives in London to transport for London have got on the website
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,303	| IOT094 |	When the bus
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,071	| IOT094 |	Did you
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,095	| IOT094 |	Hub.
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:51,167	| IOT094 |	A lot of the transport infrastructure now
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:55,263	| IOT094 |	Space information Outlet so you cannot see it stopped because I've used
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,031	| IOT094 |	2
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:57,823	| IOT094 |	You're on your own.
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:00,127	| IOT094 |	Okay so would it be like an API that I
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:04,991	| IOT094 |	You got to go in and that she have a look at it so it
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:11,135	| IOT094 |	You need a little bit more understanding of what's that website will give you it is that which they write Pi that you'll look
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:14,207	| IOT094 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:14,975	| IOT094 |	Bus API
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:17,791	| IOT094 |	Yep I bet I'm going to get a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,863	| IOT094 |	Yep you've got a real sweet I
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:23,679	| IOT094 |	Buns on your home
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,191	| IOT094 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:27,263	| IOT094 |	So you set out to run on your home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:28,031	| IOT094 |	Which
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:31,871	| IOT094 |	Theoretically is very simple as long as you've got a keyboard and the monitor
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:34,431	| IOT094 |	And you can just plug lighting and type in your
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:35,199	| IOT094 |	Wi-Fi code
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:38,015	| IOT094 |	How about you can bend take out
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:41,599	| IOT094 |	The Monitor and the guy is
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,879	| IOT094 |	Is working only
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,647	| IOT094 |	Network
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:47,743	| IOT094 |	You don't need it pumped into anything apart from the mains from then on it
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:51,327	| IOT094 |	So do you need Wi-Fi
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,351	| IOT094 |	I'm bored
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:53,375	| IOT094 |	So you don't need even to plug
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,679	| IOT094 |	The wife I don't go in anymore
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:58,751	| IOT094 |	Used to in the old applies you go to
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:00,287	| IOT094 |	Depay running and you put some
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:02,079	| IOT094 |	Code on that which basically says
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:05,919	| IOT094 |	Between the hours of 7 and 8 in the morning
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,967	| IOT094 |	Go to the
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:09,247	| IOT094 |	Website and
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:11,807	| IOT094 |	How to get the information from this API
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:13,855	| IOT094 |	Who tells me when a bus is coming
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:17,183	| IOT094 |	And is a different number is it says it's less than
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:17,951	| IOT094 |	Between
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:21,023	| IOT094 |	2 in in 5 minutes then
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,815	| IOT094 |	Something red
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:25,375	| IOT094 |	SI Pat Green
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:30,495	| IOT094 |	And if it's longer than 30 minutes so there's no bus coming within the 30 minutes flash red because I need to know
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:31,519	| IOT094 |	That
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:34,079	| IOT094 |	I've got to go and get another message
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:38,687	| IOT094 |	Getting into work today I can't go to the boss because there are no buses that there's a problem with that
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:40,735	| IOT094 |	About sea
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:42,015	| IOT094 |	The node red roster
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:46,623	| IOT094 |	The pipe is enough of put this old up online and you can just download it has its up on GitHub
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:49,951	| IOT094 |	You can download my software and put it on your thigh
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:51,999	| IOT094 |	And I will s*** I would like to that in the show note
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,559	| IOT094 |	Sofas parts
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:57,375	| IOT094 |	Your pie is still plugged into your keyboard cuz you're going to have to
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:45:58,655	| IOT094 |	Controller
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:00,959	| IOT094 |	You can either do that
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:05,823	| IOT094 |	To your keyboard or actually with another laptop
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,103	| IOT094 |	Computer that's on your WiFi
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:12,223	| IOT094 |	Can you use it for a web browser you can program the pi through your web browser
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:15,039	| IOT094 |	Got it. You just look into that pie
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:18,111	| IOT094 |	You built like this 3D enclosure and you
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:21,183	| IOT094 |	Created like this LED light up bus which is adorable
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:22,463	| IOT094 |	My house is full of
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:23,231	| IOT094 |	Like hue light bulb
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:25,791	| IOT094 |	Which does have an SDK
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:26,559	| IOT094 |	And I
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,071	| IOT094 |	I think also
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:33,471	| IOT094 |	So I saw this and I was like oh how can I use my existing infrastructure as opposed to 3D printing something
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,287	| IOT094 |	Cuz cuz I'm lazy
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:39,103	| IOT094 |	Is there a way to do something like that
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:40,127	| IOT094 |	Or is it just not
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,407	| IOT094 |	Fluid enough yet
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:42,687	| IOT094 |	Are we not open enough
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:45,759	| IOT094 |	I believe you
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:47,551	| IOT094 |	You can I haven't tried it yet
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,367	| IOT094 |	I might now have to stop thinking about that
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:53,695	| IOT094 |	It shouldn't be too complicated if you can get
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:56,255	| IOT094 |	If you can control of the
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:58,303	| IOT094 |	The light bulbs with your phone then you can
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,327	| IOT094 |	Control it with a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:00,351	| IOT094 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:03,423	| IOT094 |	Yeah
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,215	| IOT094 |	The Browns beat pie is too soft
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:07,007	| IOT094 |	Rabbits about that's the brains
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:09,055	| IOT094 |	Connected to
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:10,591	| IOT094 |	A light
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:12,383	| IOT094 |	Answer me I had a
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:15,711	| IOT094 |	3D printed little bus that I made
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:20,319	| IOT094 |	Did I put in some neopixels smelly days and I connected.
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:21,343	| IOT094 |	Through
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,647	| IOT094 |	Wemos
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:25,183	| IOT094 |	The one chip
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:25,695	| IOT094 |	It's
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:26,975	| IOT094 |	A chip.
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:30,559	| IOT094 |	Has wifionboard so you can
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,327	| IOT094 |	Tok Twitter
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:32,607	| IOT094 |	Over the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:36,191	| IOT094 |	And you can program it just like you program an Arduino
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:36,703	| IOT094 |	Gatlin
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:38,751	| IOT094 |	Ghost and tools
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:41,567	| IOT094 |	Makes your LEDs talk to your husband pi
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:43,615	| IOT094 |	Did the Busby
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:45,663	| IOT094 |	He probably doesn't have to be in the same place
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:46,175	| IOT094 |	Azul light
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:48,735	| IOT094 |	Oh nice to
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:50,015	| IOT094 |	You could actually
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:51,295	| IOT094 |	Build json incel it
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:55,135	| IOT094 |	You can as long as I can get it on that Wi-Fi thoughts
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:56,671	| IOT094 |	Turn on the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:57,183	| IOT094 |	And it be
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:00,511	| IOT094 |	Tied to that
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:03,839	| IOT094 |	Yeah good gift for your neighbors guys
EDL	00:48:04,607	00:48:06,143	| IOT094 |	If your neighbor is not going to look at you funny
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:11,007	| IOT094 |	You sang I'm always late
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,359	| IOT094 |	Nevermind scratch that don't make it again
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:16,639	| IOT094 |	Okay
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:19,967	| IOT094 |	I like this that gets to the reason why I'm going to
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:20,735	| IOT094 |	Segway here
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:22,527	| IOT094 |	It's the reason why we need
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:26,879	| IOT094 |	Kind of that long tail Solutions because no one's going to manufacture this because
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:29,951	| IOT094 |	Pasta is so intensely local you can never
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:32,511	| IOT094 |	Produce enough until enough to make something like this worthwhile
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:34,559	| IOT094 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,095	| IOT094 |	Yay
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:37,119	| IOT094 |	Reason number one
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:39,935	| IOT094 |	Actually
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:43,007	| IOT094 |	Let's talk about project number 2
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:44,799	| IOT094 |	The bus was connect
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:47,359	| IOT094 |	Change a website to some lights
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:48,383	| IOT094 |	Basically
EDL	00:48:48,383	00:48:54,271	| IOT094 |	What are Michael Jackson's I found Grace Van Der waals was hacking the toy dinosaur that I mentioned earlier
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:56,063	| IOT094 |	Photo of a
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:57,599	| IOT094 |	Small electronics
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:58,879	| IOT094 |	Kit is designed
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:00,415	| IOT094 |	For 8 year olds
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:03,487	| IOT094 |	And it's a Dinosaur say when you
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:05,791	| IOT094 |	Pick the switch the dinosaur
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:07,583	| IOT094 |	Notes head up and down
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,095	| IOT094 |	But it's
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:09,631	| IOT094 |	It's an assembled
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:12,959	| IOT094 |	Sing to you slept like a 3D jigsaw puzzle
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:15,519	| IOT094 |	You connect to the
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:18,335	| IOT094 |	The switch in the battery and that's your electronics training
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:19,871	| IOT094 |	The children
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:21,919	| IOT094 |	Took you take the switch out of that
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:24,479	| IOT094 |	And put in a little bit of electronics
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:25,247	| IOT094 |	Which
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:31,647	| IOT094 |	You can do with that very cheap electronics but I see the ordering with you you plug everything your resist
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,671	| IOT094 |	Justice and transistors
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:34,207	| IOT094 |	If you've never done that
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:36,511	| IOT094 |	The full that cynical complex all that I have written
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,071	| IOT094 |	Upload post for the magpi magazine
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:41,375	| IOT094 |	Easy downloadable
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:44,191	| IOT094 |	Play magazine is the wrong size
EDL	00:49:44,191	00:49:45,727	| IOT094 |	Magazine
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:47,775	| IOT094 |	How to use in that
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:49,567	| IOT094 |	I can now tweet my
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,335	| IOT094 |	Toy dinosaur
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:51,615	| IOT094 |	Orthomed
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:53,663	| IOT094 |	Set it up to rule when
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:56,991	| IOT094 |	All the other dinosaurs roaring
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:50:01,599	| IOT094 |	Tweets those or even set to talk with an empty TT feed
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:02,367	| IOT094 |	If you want to do that
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,647	| IOT094 |	Celexa
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:05,695	| IOT094 |	A great fun little project
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,743	| IOT094 |	That sounds like fun I
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:08,767	| IOT094 |	I'll need a soldering gun
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:12,863	| IOT094 |	Note because it's designed for the eight year olds
EDL	00:50:12,863	00:50:14,655	| IOT094 |	You can do it with
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,215	| IOT094 |	What's called a breadboard which is
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:20,287	| IOT094 |	A piece of plastic with lots of holes in that you can stick your legs
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:21,055	| IOT094 |	Tronix into
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:23,871	| IOT094 |	You don't need
EDL	00:50:23,871	00:50:25,663	| IOT094 |	Trusting to any sold ring
EDL	00:50:25,663	00:50:26,175	| IOT094 |	However
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:29,759	| IOT094 |	It wouldn't be so secure so you wouldn't be officers around
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:33,599	| IOT094 |	But it's it work for long enough going to be secure enough
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:35,647	| IOT094 |	Tri-Cities ER ornament on your desk
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:37,183	| IOT094 |	All right
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:38,463	| IOT094 |	I loved it
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:41,023	| IOT094 |	You're building this stuff I can't wait to see what you make Nets
