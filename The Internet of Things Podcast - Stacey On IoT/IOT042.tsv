EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:24,320	| IOT042 |	Although I am going to do one quick plug for the Amazon Echo before we get to
EDL	00:00:24,320	00:00:25,344	| IOT042 |	Too heavy into things
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:27,904	| IOT042 |	There is we're going to talk this week about the
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:31,488	| IOT042 |	We're going to talk about the best Wi-Fi water sensors
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:34,048	| IOT042 |	Are actually the only two that we could find
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:37,632	| IOT042 |	Egg minder are the quirky egg minder because Kevin just got one
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:38,144	| IOT042 |	And
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:41,216	| IOT042 |	Hot new gear from Under Armour
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:43,264	| IOT042 |	And we also have a
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:45,056	| IOT042 |	I guess that will leave a surprise but
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:47,616	| IOT042 |	Near and dear to our hearts
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:49,664	| IOT042 |	So surprised it's a very good surprise
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:51,712	| IOT042 |	Let's get started with a quick
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:55,296	| IOT042 |	Last hopefully last mention for the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:56,064	| IOT042 |	Which
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:56,832	| IOT042 |	This week
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:58,112	| IOT042 |	Or actually news last week
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:01,952	| IOT042 |	Amazon announced that you can actually get your Kindle
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:02,720	| IOT042 |	Books
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:03,488	| IOT042 |	Read to you
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:05,280	| IOT042 |	From the echo
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:05,792	| IOT042 |	Which
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:08,096	| IOT042 |	If you're into that sort of thing
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,888	| IOT042 |	It's it's not like an after reading it
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:14,240	| IOT042 |	Noted that you're right it happened last week it was
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:19,360	| IOT042 |	Friday afternoon news dump kind of thing it happened to catch it right away
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:20,640	| IOT042 |	Read about it and tested it
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:24,992	| IOT042 |	It's there's some good and some bad here. Did you try it yet
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:26,016	| IOT042 |	I did try it
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:30,368	| IOT042 |	I didn't think I would use it but I like to read
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:31,392	| IOT042 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:36,256	| IOT042 |	And I love to read I read anywhere from one to three books or paper books a week
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| IOT042 |	And
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:38,816	| IOT042 |	I'm not an
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:40,096	| IOT042 |	Audio
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,376	| IOT042 |	Book fan
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,144	| IOT042 |	I like
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:42,912	| IOT042 |	To read
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:49,312	| IOT042 |	However you know it's not terrible you is using as you said Alexis voice is not using a professional
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,080	| IOT042 |	Actor
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,872	| IOT042 |	Voice actress you not getting this
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,152	| IOT042 |	You know the feel of the
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:53,920	| IOT042 |	The tax
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:56,480	| IOT042 |	It's what she does okay I think
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:59,296	| IOT042 |	I mean
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,320	| IOT042 |	Voice kind of yours
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,416	| IOT042 |	Yeah but the nice thing is
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:08,768	| IOT042 |	Amazon audible I don't remember when they did that but I know they bought Audible
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:12,608	| IOT042 |	Sometime ago and if you want to hear professional
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,888	| IOT042 |	Read your books to you
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,728	| IOT042 |	Audible's great way to do it I forget what the subscription is like 10 $15 a month
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,544	| IOT042 |	Whisper book to use and so on
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,080	| IOT042 |	This is actually free
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,688	| IOT042 |	So that's was like I was like wow this is awesome even if it's not outstanding it's not going to
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,480	| IOT042 |	Really compete with Audible
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:32,832	| IOT042 |	It's free for some people who maybe there's vision-impaired people want to hear their books and don't
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| IOT042 |	You know
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,416	| IOT042 |	We also noticed
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:41,792	| IOT042 |	Who also love to hear Echo talk so I agree with you
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:45,376	| IOT042 |	I have about 250 Kindle books in my account right now
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,448	| IOT042 |	And out of all of them it was like a handful five or six
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:50,240	| IOT042 |	We're not eligible for this
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,776	| IOT042 |	So pretty much like
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,568	| IOT042 |	Who's my whole Library I can just have
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,872	| IOT042 |	Bianca read to me
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:03,808	| IOT042 |	So I just thought that was worth noting for people who may not you know Amazon Echo newsletter
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,576	| IOT042 |	Every week
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,112	| IOT042 |	Which
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,136	| IOT042 |	Don't know
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,720	| IOT042 |	Somehow I'm not surprised redo
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:13,536	| IOT042 |	So we have an obligation to our list
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,072	| IOT042 |	So this week
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| IOT042 |	We're going to talk about Ness
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,680	| IOT042 |	Because why we talked about this
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:24,288	| IOT042 |	Why are we talking over the New York Times
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,824	| IOT042 |	He has a sad
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:31,712	| IOT042 |	Is he wrote this week about our last week
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| IOT042 |	About the
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,552	| IOT042 |	The issue that Gizmodo actually wrote about
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,600	| IOT042 |	Kind of during the middle of CES
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,624	| IOT042 |	Csb
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,256	| IOT042 |	Nest 2nd generation Nest out there that have an issue with
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,328	| IOT042 |	A software glitch that drains the battery
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,376	| IOT042 |	If you're not using
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,168	| IOT042 |	Wired power
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,008	| IOT042 |	So it's it's less than a percentage of the second generation Nest
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,592	| IOT042 |	And if you want to fix it it's like a 9
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| IOT042 |	Step process
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,408	| IOT042 |	So it is not a simple thing
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:05,760	| IOT042 |	And I think some people if they actually fix it
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:06,784	| IOT042 |	Which
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:12,928	| IOT042 |	Problem this is coming on the heels actually if you know we complained about some issues with with my nest
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:16,256	| IOT042 |	And I don't know about you Kevin you said you might have an issue with your nest
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:24,959	| IOT042 |	Say about it I told you beforehand and I had some that mention I didn't have the problem but I just found out literally right
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,983	| IOT042 |	Thank you for the show
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:31,359	| IOT042 |	But I never got the software update that actually caused the glitch in the reason I know that is because
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,151	| IOT042 |	Got an email today from wrestling
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,943	| IOT042 |	Hey we've noticed that you haven't
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:38,783	| IOT042 |	Don't have the latest and greatest software on your nest even though I know it got it
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,319	| IOT042 |	Configure to get the updates
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,879	| IOT042 |	So it told me how to
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,903	| IOT042 |	Reset the nest
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:48,767	| IOT042 |	And that's a lot of buy back and get one or two of the steps that people are doing actually fix their nests
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:54,399	| IOT042 |	And I and I didn't know if you pushed the ring in for about 10 things that actually reset resets it reboots it
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,935	| IOT042 |	And I had to do that today
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,983	| IOT042 |	I will get the software update soon
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| IOT042 |	I'm not
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,311	| IOT042 |	Worried about having a battery problem because
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,335	| IOT042 |	I have wired power to
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| IOT042 |	Got it
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:06,175	| IOT042 |	So there's a lot to unpack
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| IOT042 |	I want to start
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,087	| IOT042 |	Products physical products
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,599	| IOT042 |	Is hard
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| IOT042 |	I don't think that could be interesting
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,415	| IOT042 |	Because
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,511	| IOT042 |	Has a really good job
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,143	| IOT042 |	You know we can say it we can know that the nest protect had you know
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,191	| IOT042 |	It was recalled for a while
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:30,495	| IOT042 |	Because of the whole waiting in the air thing but
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:36,895	| IOT042 |	You know I still buy Apple products that you know have recalls associated with them because
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,199	| IOT042 |	Malfunctioning or
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,223	| IOT042 |	You know
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,503	| IOT042 |	Your battery
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,975	| IOT042 |	Good Hardware products
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| IOT042 |	Is really hard
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,303	| IOT042 |	So in some ways I'm like
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,607	| IOT042 |	When you add
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,631	| IOT042 |	Computerize parts
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,935	| IOT042 |	Anything you make them infinitely more copper
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,215	| IOT042 |	Located
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| IOT042 |	And so
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| IOT042 |	This is a problem
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:08,639	| IOT042 |	Yeah and I don't think you're giving Nest up a pass here I think what you're trying to say is
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,479	| IOT042 |	You know this happens to various products any products
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,503	| IOT042 |	Like this
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| IOT042 |	Faces so many challenges so and I agree with you on that
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,855	| IOT042 |	So I think as an industry
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,391	| IOT042 |	Overall
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,951	| IOT042 |	We've got to figure out because Nest problem
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:25,023	| IOT042 |	In what state is stuck to someone's wall
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,983	| IOT042 |	People like I used to forget about me
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,263	| IOT042 |	Right
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,591	| IOT042 |	Deal
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,615	| IOT042 |	With a thermostat
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| IOT042 |	You don't think about it
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,503	| IOT042 |	Think about when people
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,783	| IOT042 |	I was at my parents with
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:49,599	| IOT042 |	They're just like
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:55,999	| IOT042 |	Why does it have to get an update what's it doing what's it getting what's the changing
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,791	| IOT042 |	Kind of a nerd
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,559	| IOT042 |	To that now
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:01,119	| IOT042 |	I'm sitting in my car
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,143	| IOT042 |	Which happens to be a Tesla
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,959	| IOT042 |	And happens to have a lot of software associated
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:06,751	| IOT042 |	And
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| IOT042 |	I was like
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,199	| IOT042 |	What the heck
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:19,807	| IOT042 |	And I'm trying to troubleshoot that and then my phone for some reason was also
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,319	| IOT042 |	Not working
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,903	| IOT042 |	And it's totally Verizon provides the radio in my
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:28,255	| IOT042 |	Either I am liking a cellular black hole right now or I'm having
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,023	| IOT042 |	Some sort of
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,535	| IOT042 |	Weird
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,559	| IOT042 |	Issue
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,143	| IOT042 |	It was so frustrating to me because like
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,423	| IOT042 |	I have two things in my life that
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,727	| IOT042 |	Phone usage
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,495	| IOT042 |	Find
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:42,079	| IOT042 |	So we have all these things around us that are just getting kind of
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,127	| IOT042 |	Squishy
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,199	| IOT042 |	And I think the bigger picture here is that we
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,759	| IOT042 |	We have these great new devices
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,831	| IOT042 |	That are solving problems worth making things
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,599	| IOT042 |	Better
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,647	| IOT042 |	When we come to re and we come to rely on them
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,439	| IOT042 |	The point where
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| IOT042 |	You know you expect your
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,559	| IOT042 |	Your heat in your house to be on when it's cold out and Sonic and Nick Bilton
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:07,423	| IOT042 |	He woke up to it was like 64 degrees in the apartment and the baby was crying probably because it was cold
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:08,959	| IOT042 |	And he was like
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,031	| IOT042 |	Distance versus make life easier for us
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,847	| IOT042 |	But anytime you add complexity you run the risk of
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,383	| IOT042 |	Essential making things worse
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,431	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:21,247	| IOT042 |	It's a challenge is a challenge so we've got to figure out
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,319	| IOT042 |	Is there a is there a solution here I don't know
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,367	| IOT042 |	Is it lambasting
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,439	| IOT042 |	You know I don't know if it was on the front page
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,743	| IOT042 |	Complexity
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| IOT042 |	From a breeder formula
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,215	| IOT042 |	Listener this person was asking about
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,983	| IOT042 |	Wi-Fi sensor
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,031	| IOT042 |	I do not want to hug
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,335	| IOT042 |	And given Kevin you probably can't blame them
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,407	| IOT042 |	I was like
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,711	| IOT042 |	There's there's a couple issues there we found two
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,759	| IOT042 |	Using smart home DB
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,063	| IOT042 |	The D-Link
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,623	| IOT042 |	Water sensor which retails for
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:01,183	| IOT042 |	About 55 to 60 bucks
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| IOT042 |	Depending on where you go
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,255	| IOT042 |	This works
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,047	| IOT042 |	Any Wi-Fi not just dealing
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,607	| IOT042 |	Connectsense
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,655	| IOT042 |	Water sensor
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,191	| IOT042 |	Which is 150
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,983	| IOT042 |	Michelle
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,495	| IOT042 |	For me
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:24,735	| IOT042 |	Similar reviews I was looking on Amazon I haven't tested these out
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,527	| IOT042 |	Personally because I
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,807	| IOT042 |	Have I think I have
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:32,415	| IOT042 |	A cluster of hope so I use Zippy and Z-Wave hubs
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:35,487	| IOT042 |	Just to clarify these are water
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,279	| IOT042 |	Detection like water leak sensors
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,839	| IOT042 |	Water leak sensor so these are things are going to stick
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,119	| IOT042 |	Under your sink spider
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,935	| IOT042 |	Water heater wherever you want
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,007	| IOT042 |	3 weeks in my house
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| IOT042 |	Since I moved into it
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,567	| IOT042 |	Fun fun
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,615	| IOT042 |	Actually ever been
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| IOT042 |	Where
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| IOT042 |	I've had a leak
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| IOT042 |	Theoretically
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:55,967	| IOT042 |	My mileage
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,319	| IOT042 |	Sneaky water download sensors aren't
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,599	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,671	| IOT042 |	The challenge with Wi-Fi sensors
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,231	| IOT042 |	Is because Wi-Fi is such
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| IOT042 |	You have to plug
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,351	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,143	| IOT042 |	They all are little funny
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,983	| IOT042 |	Play that's why most of the water sensors
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| IOT042 |	Use a hug
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,823	| IOT042 |	Is because you need a zigbee or Z-Wave or some sort of
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,359	| IOT042 |	Really low power radio
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,687	| IOT042 |	So I'm just giving that to you guys straight
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,503	| IOT042 |	So even if you're like Wi-Fi
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,039	| IOT042 |	You may want to
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:34,111	| IOT042 |	If you're going to really like sensor outfit your home
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,647	| IOT042 |	You may just be Leo
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,439	| IOT042 |	I'm just going to invest in the hub
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,487	| IOT042 |	Sehrazat
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:39,999	| IOT042 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:46,655	| IOT042 |	And it's ironic that you had this topic on the show notes today because I just put some plants in the house that I want to get some
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,959	| IOT042 |	Soil / water sensors
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| IOT042 |	And how goes into my
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| IOT042 |	System here
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,103	| IOT042 |	And they're not cheap either I mean
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| IOT042 |	Achievement
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,199	| IOT042 |	Heartless the parrot flower power
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,271	| IOT042 |	Looks nice and I think it cost
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,551	| IOT042 |	$60
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,343	| IOT042 |	I mean that's just for one
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,879	| IOT042 |	Potted plants
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:11,231	| IOT042 |	You know that's that's not cheap I saw the plant link
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,327	| IOT042 |	Which is a much smaller sensor and the center itself is only $35
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,351	| IOT042 |	But you do need
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,655	| IOT042 |	Plantlink hub
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:23,775	| IOT042 |	So if you buy the Hub and One sensor it's like $79
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:27,871	| IOT042 |	Anthony traditional sensor because you can have up to 64 sensors at the base station
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:31,711	| IOT042 |	Level is $35 I told little bit less expensive overtime
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,271	| IOT042 |	It's not cheap I
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:39,647	| IOT042 |	I wish it was that either I mean I know I can buy a nod non-connected one you just like a
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:44,511	| IOT042 |	Give me to plug in a thing and it just reads the soil over time and when it's done you throw it away disposable on
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,535	| IOT042 |	It's a lot cheaper but
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,351	| IOT042 |	You
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:49,631	| IOT042 |	LASIK
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,447	| IOT042 |	I know I know that you're right that's exactly what I'm doing now because
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:57,311	| IOT042 |	I'm checking that the top inch of soil and both plants right now bye-bye feel so
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:00,895	| IOT042 |	I can live with that. I'm not going to spend I don't think the money is just just just too expensive
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,175	| IOT042 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,527	| IOT042 |	You could try those watering stones
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,831	| IOT042 |	Wiring stones
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:14,463	| IOT042 |	Yeah they like Whiskey Stones what are you do with the are not buy them from like The Container Store like fancy
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| IOT042 |	Pipe catalog
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,839	| IOT042 |	They're like little glass globes that you stick
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:25,727	| IOT042 |	Water in and then you cook them in the plant and they're supposed to water them slowly over a. Of like a week or two
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:32,383	| IOT042 |	So this is good for people who travel more people like me or forgetful and then you just said
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| IOT042 |	Reminder for like
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:39,295	| IOT042 |	Every every two weeks
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:46,207	| IOT042 |	I might do that. You know what though I also saw alveron instructables for
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:50,047	| IOT042 |	People have the time to Tinker you can actually use an Arduino
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,815	| IOT042 |	Pacific sensor
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:55,679	| IOT042 |	And if you want him put little LCD on there so tell you exactly how much moisture is in there
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:00,031	| IOT042 |	And you could use that and the parts were about fifty bucks that's
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,103	| IOT042 |	It's actually less than a lot of course
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,431	| IOT042 |	Download the source code know what you're doing
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,991	| IOT042 |	There you go alright well I look forward to
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,111	| IOT042 |	Going to make an Arduino sensor
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,647	| IOT042 |	Did you something
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| IOT042 |	Equally silly
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,207	| IOT042 |	I think so
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,487	| IOT042 |	You purchased
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:20,767	| IOT042 |	A product
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,327	| IOT042 |	Once retail for $60
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,631	| IOT042 |	Yes and now goes for a
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,727	| IOT042 |	I'm interested
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,031	| IOT042 |	I didn't
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,567	| IOT042 |	Wicked Amazon I just
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:38,431	| IOT042 |	Saw something for $15 a night and I spent $15 on the quirky egg minder
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:41,247	| IOT042 |	You and your first question I told you before the show is
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT042 |	Would you mind at 4
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:53,279	| IOT042 |	Because I don't want to take my ex out of a container in Stick
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:59,679	| IOT042 |	Sure sure so it's so it's basically a plastic egg
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,959	| IOT042 |	Crate container
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:05,311	| IOT042 |	That holds a Baker's Dozen plus 1 to 14 eggs
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,103	| IOT042 |	Two dozen eggs at a pop
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,663	| IOT042 |	And there's a little sensor inside each
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,967	| IOT042 |	Holder for the egg
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,271	| IOT042 |	So there are 14 little sensors
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:18,623	| IOT042 |	When you take an egg out it notifies the Corky app through with my case wink
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,183	| IOT042 |	Bet that egg is gone
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:24,767	| IOT042 |	And now you know how many eggs you have it all time
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:28,095	| IOT042 |	The other thing it does there's a little blue LEDs next to each
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,607	| IOT042 |	Egg
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,399	| IOT042 |	Soldier in the crate
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,495	| IOT042 |	And it lights up and says this is the freshest egg
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,287	| IOT042 |	It says so in the app as well
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,335	| IOT042 |	Physically as you put the eggs in it
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,871	| IOT042 |	It's going to tell you which ones you put in
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:40,895	| IOT042 |	First
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:47,295	| IOT042 |	First in first out basically in and tells you I didn't buy it for that cuz we go through exit so quickly I bought it thinking
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,575	| IOT042 |	It's nice
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,391	| IOT042 |	If the whole family knows how many eggs we have in the house
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,183	| IOT042 |	At any given time in case we need them
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,743	| IOT042 |	Wow
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,023	| IOT042 |	Would you recommend to others
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:58,815	| IOT042 |	Should have said
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,375	| IOT042 |	Well I think
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:07,775	| IOT042 |	If you want to know at all times how many eggs you have in your fridge I would say yes but with caution and I'm curious if you
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,823	| IOT042 |	Saw any issues such as I'm saying
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,615	| IOT042 |	First of all the setup was kind of
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,175	| IOT042 |	Looky it just didn't seem to want to connect
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:17,247	| IOT042 |	Add to my Wi-Fi network in the way you do it
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,551	| IOT042 |	You actually use the Wink app
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:24,927	| IOT042 |	You add the quirky egg minder to the Wink app to the wink Hub through your app
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,719	| IOT042 |	And then you hold your phone
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:32,863	| IOT042 |	Face down over a sensor on the quirky egg minder and it flashes lights and that's what tells it
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,631	| IOT042 |	What
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,679	| IOT042 |	Wi-Fi network in the password is
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:37,983	| IOT042 |	And took me like 10 tries to get that working for summer
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,287	| IOT042 |	Did you have that issue I did not have
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,567	| IOT042 |	A problem
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:46,175	| IOT042 |	Yeah but that was only one of two challenges because I'm looking at the
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,711	| IOT042 |	App
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:53,599	| IOT042 |	Are the Wing Cap right now and I'm looking at the egg minder and it shows me 14 little eggs in there even though I know three of already been used as of yesterday
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| IOT042 |	So it's not
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,671	| IOT042 |	Either it's not refreshing
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:02,815	| IOT042 |	It's not refreshing or the sensor isn't just seeing that there's no egg in those three spots anymore
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,583	| IOT042 |	Sure
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,375	| IOT042 |	I know one thing about this because of my
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:08,447	| IOT042 |	G with the Wi-Fi you know it's kind of a wifi
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:13,823	| IOT042 |	How much Wi-Fi signal is need to get out through the fridge does it only work on the doors open
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,871	| IOT042 |	I'm thinking it just
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:18,431	| IOT042 |	Dinner the Faraday cage as you would have talked about once before
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:24,831	| IOT042 |	Can you close your app
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| IOT042 |	I've always had to close out
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,415	| IOT042 |	And that's all what that's all about
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,463	| IOT042 |	Supposed to
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:31,999	| IOT042 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:38,655	| IOT042 |	I just did that and reopen the app and all the eggs flash like they weren't there and then all the eggs and out back there
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,959	| IOT042 |	And they're all there even though I know they're not
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,543	| IOT042 |	This is definitely it don't bite
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:45,823	| IOT042 |	It doesn't do it
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:53,503	| IOT042 |	Function well it could be because I'm connected to a Wi-Fi network with a router is on the opposite side of the house
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,807	| IOT042 |	And the only reason I had to do that this is another
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,087	| IOT042 |	Potential gotcha
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:17:00,671	| IOT042 |	The quirky egg minder only works with 2.4 gigahertz
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| IOT042 |	Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,719	| IOT042 |	MI
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,023	| IOT042 |	Am I Google onhub
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:08,863	| IOT042 |	Kind of merges those to the 2.4 in the five
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,191	| IOT042 |	And I It wouldn't connect to that one side to connect to the further away
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,703	| IOT042 |	Router
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| IOT042 |	So there challenges here
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:21,919	| IOT042 |	You know you have to know your instructor at your house to really know who's going to work for you
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,455	| IOT042 |	Interesting point to make about connect
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,759	| IOT042 |	Devices because I know that my Roost
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,295	| IOT042 |	Connected smoke alarm
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:31,135	| IOT042 |	I have another couple devices that only connect to the 2.4
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,927	| IOT042 |	Yep so
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:37,279	| IOT042 |	Daddy is at done because of its cheaper cheaper chips
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:43,423	| IOT042 |	I don't know I pay extra that work with 5G network is my reliable
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,215	| IOT042 |	Which is not far from the fridge at all
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,751	| IOT042 |	And that's a very future
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,287	| IOT042 |	Design right there
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| IOT042 |	Watch investigator
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,175	| IOT042 |	Alright let's see
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT042 |	What else
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,015	| IOT042 |	Oh I know what else Kevin
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,807	| IOT042 |	Json testing out some excited
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,879	| IOT042 |	Kevin you've been reviewing everything this week I love it
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| IOT042 |	Sit back and take a vacation
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,695	| IOT042 |	Quotes about your other
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,743	| IOT042 |	What we mention this
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:11,071	| IOT042 |	One or two shows back I think two shows ago that
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,607	| IOT042 |	Under Armour has a new
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:17,983	| IOT042 |	Help kid in a box I connected a bunch of connected devices in a single box called the UA
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,495	| IOT042 |	Healthbox
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:23,359	| IOT042 |	And it was announced at CES I actually had it before so yes we can talk about it
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:25,151	| IOT042 |	And even when it launched at CES
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:28,735	| IOT042 |	I couldn't give a final review because the UA folks told me
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:32,319	| IOT042 |	We're going to have additional software update you're not going to final software for another week or two
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:36,671	| IOT042 |	So that means basically we couldn't really go into detail about it until this week
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:40,255	| IOT042 |	So what can I tell you was just to recap what's in the box
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:43,583	| IOT042 |	You can have wifi-connected scale that works with up to eight different people
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:44,863	| IOT042 |	You get a
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:50,239	| IOT042 |	UA band which is designed by HTC actually HTC Desire
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,519	| IOT042 |	Scale as well
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:54,591	| IOT042 |	Bose very well-designed products working very well for me
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:58,943	| IOT042 |	You also get the UA strap which is a heart rate monitor that you can wear if you'd like
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,223	| IOT042 |	Addition of that
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,271	| IOT042 |	Outside the box I also received
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:06,111	| IOT042 |	A pair of Gemini 2 speedform connected
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:10,463	| IOT042 |	Sneakers running sneakers and I've been running in those quite a bit since I've had him
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:10,975	| IOT042 |	That's where we
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,815	| IOT042 |	They have a sensor inside a radio inside battery inside
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,351	| IOT042 |	You'd never know it from looking at it
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:19,423	| IOT042 |	The trends will wear out before the battery is what these folks tell me
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,471	| IOT042 |	I put about 40 miles on the sneakers
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,519	| IOT042 |	Annies automatically
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:27,359	| IOT042 |	Sync up their data into the MapMyRun program which then sink
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,127	| IOT042 |	Everything up
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,943	| IOT042 |	The other devices into the UA record
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,455	| IOT042 |	App
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,759	| IOT042 |	And I am
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,527	| IOT042 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:38,623	| IOT042 |	In the Box there's a scale there's a band and isn't there an activity tracker
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,159	| IOT042 |	The band is the activity tracker
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:43,743	| IOT042 |	Oh wait
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| IOT042 |	That's correct
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:49,887	| IOT042 |	There are three things in the box which is $400 if you want to buy them separately
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,679	| IOT042 |	Just real quick the scales 180
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:54,239	| IOT042 |	The band is 180 the heart rate monitor
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:56,287	| IOT042 |	80
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:00,895	| IOT042 |	Yeah if you want that and then you can add on if you want somebody else in the house to use the
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| IOT042 |	Band
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:05,247	| IOT042 |	180 they cannot Abandon All ties into the same system
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,783	| IOT042 |	So it's
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,807	| IOT042 |	Pricey
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,343	| IOT042 |	But I like
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:11,647	| IOT042 |	What they put together here and the key is
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,671	| IOT042 |	I think
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:17,791	| IOT042 |	The key is you a kind of bought their way into
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:22,911	| IOT042 |	Having a big audience for this because they purchased the MapMyRun and MapMyFitness
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,935	| IOT042 |	Software
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,703	| IOT042 |	Platforms
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,471	| IOT042 |	Last year
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:28,543	| IOT042 |	Faking like a hundred and thirty million
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:31,871	| IOT042 |	Users of their platform to track nutrition and Fitness
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,919	| IOT042 |	And then added more
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,735	| IOT042 |	Wearables that work with it
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,015	| IOT042 |	And you're
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:40,319	| IOT042 |	A fan of those MapMyFitness and MapMyRun products
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:46,207	| IOT042 |	You'll be happier the shoes just sync automatically I mean you can go for a run with nothing on but the shoes walk
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:49,535	| IOT042 |	Close hopefully no bands no phone no nothing
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:52,351	| IOT042 |	You didn't have to turn the shoes on you just go for a run
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,935	| IOT042 |	An automatic retracts of NSYNC the data into the MapMyFitness stuff
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:58,751	| IOT042 |	Which is all viewable in your dashboard in UA record
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:03,103	| IOT042 |	And that my fitness also pulls in your data from other
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,871	| IOT042 |	Ticketspice
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,479	| IOT042 |	It's one of the best ones out there for tracking
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,247	| IOT042 |	Suit
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,039	| IOT042 |	That would be great
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,063	| IOT042 |	Is pal
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,672	| IOT042 |	And they're all kind of
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,208	| IOT042 |	USA map
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:19,744	| IOT042 |	In my brain
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:27,168	| IOT042 |	And you you mentioned tying in those those abs tie into with a lot of other devices as well which is fine if you want to use us
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:34,592	| IOT042 |	Jawbone whatever you want is fine but here's the thing to UA record app which is your record for your health
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:38,688	| IOT042 |	Baptizing all that scale data the Band-Aid
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,992	| IOT042 |	It works with your but I can link it with
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| IOT042 |	Apple Health Apple watch
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:46,112	| IOT042 |	Connect powered by Garmin Jawbone

EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,976	| IOT042 |	Dead bug and Believe by Sports Authority
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:57,120	| IOT042 |	So if you don't want to use you a apps you don't need to order devices
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:00,704	| IOT042 |	But I will say that there's an integration that works really well because
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| IOT042 |	Not that far from Apple your butt
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,288	| IOT042 |	They own the hardware and the software
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,080	| IOT042 |	All right hand
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:12,992	| IOT042 |	Yes I I keep getting insights from watts and although today's was really weird
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,040	| IOT042 |	Today's word something on lines of
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:20,160	| IOT042 |	Out of all the other people in your age group using map my or MyFitnessPal
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| IOT042 |	They have three point five friends
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,536	| IOT042 |	Am I good for that
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,472	| IOT042 |	Last Bachelorette
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:39,104	| IOT042 |	And then I get that it wouldn't all the other apps that have used I appreciate the social aspect because I put my
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,384	| IOT042 |	Running out there
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,944	| IOT042 |	You know on the line as they say in the
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,712	| IOT042 |	The Internship
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:48,576	| IOT042 |	I have actually run and had real-time geolocation of my races
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:54,464	| IOT042 |	So that people could see me and why not to let people continue because I wouldn't want to let those people down or actually help me
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,512	| IOT042 |	So now there's a lot of
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,304	| IOT042 |	A lot of aspects to that so
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:02,656	| IOT042 |	I think you'd like the band I know you've learned some other band Stacy and this one
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,680	| IOT042 |	It's comfortable
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:08,800	| IOT042 |	It measures your steps and measures your sleep it does both those automatic it was a beautiful thing
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,104	| IOT042 |	As the time has alarms the silent alarm
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:14,432	| IOT042 |	It's got a heart rate monitor built-in at checking your resting
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:17,760	| IOT042 |	Heart rate right before you wake up or at the end of your sleep cycle
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,808	| IOT042 |	I got a ton of great data and I
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:22,112	| IOT042 |	I've lost several pounds I reduce body fat
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:26,464	| IOT042 |	I am running more because of this granted I'm doing the work yet
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,256	| IOT042 |	UA health kit
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| IOT042 |	But
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:33,120	| IOT042 |	It's working well I'm getting all information I could ever want
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:35,936	| IOT042 |	Okay cuz I'm actually in the market
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:38,496	| IOT042 |	Core Fitness
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:43,616	| IOT042 |	I would recommend looking at least at the band even if you don't buy the other things and
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:46,944	| IOT042 |	The reason being you just said you had lost some trackers and they concert a lot
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,224	| IOT042 |	This
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:51,552	| IOT042 |	I literally don't take off at all except when I take a shower
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,624	| IOT042 |	And when I took a shower I usually put this on the charger
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,160	| IOT042 |	And it's last
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:59,744	| IOT042 |	5 days on a charge and it only takes 30 minutes to charge so it's never
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,304	| IOT042 |	In a place for me to lose it so to speak
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,096	| IOT042 |	Nice okay
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,888	| IOT042 |	Well I'm at
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,168	| IOT042 |	Guess who Our Guest is
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,704	| IOT042 |	Who is it
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,984	| IOT042 |	O'Malley
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:14,848	| IOT042 |	I know that guy we all do
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:18,432	| IOT042 |	Piece in the New Yorker that everyone was talking about
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,968	| IOT042 |	About what was it
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,528	| IOT042 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,552	| IOT042 |	And how
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:26,368	| IOT042 |	We are currently in this era of how companies
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,952	| IOT042 |	There can only be one it's like the Highlander era of company
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,048	| IOT042 |	I'm very curious how that plays out with
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,584	| IOT042 |	Consumer devices and
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,400	| IOT042 |	The smart home in the internet of things because
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:42,752	| IOT042 |	I know a lot of companies believe that especially if they're selling Hardware
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:49,152	| IOT042 |	But I'm curious how that's actually going to play out and sit so mad I are buddies he's been my mentor he great
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,296	| IOT042 |	Decided he would talk to me about this so stay tuned
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:05,024	| IOT042 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast I am your host Stacey Higginbotham and with me is this week's guests
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,048	| IOT042 |	O'Malley
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,328	| IOT042 |	Hello how are you doing
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:10,144	| IOT042 |	I am great Stacy Happy New Year
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,424	| IOT042 |	Happy New Year
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,448	| IOT042 |	Happy posts
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,216	| IOT042 |	CES
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:15,520	| IOT042 |	How old is a venture
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,568	| IOT042 |	A true I'm a partner in
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:22,432	| IOT042 |	I will see I was be escalating you I'm so sorry that I had to other show this week
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,200	| IOT042 |	Typical
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| IOT042 |	You wrote
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,480	| IOT042 |	What about
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:25,760	| IOT042 |	A really good
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,784	| IOT042 |	Story of The New Yorker
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,552	| IOT042 |	How
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,576	| IOT042 |	Startups
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,600	| IOT042 |	We are Becoming monopolies
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:33,440	| IOT042 |	They're doing this because they have this infrastructure advantage
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,768	| IOT042 |	I'd love for you to kind of give a quick summary of your article
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:39,072	| IOT042 |	And we're going to talk about how that may or may not apply to the internet
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:43,168	| IOT042 |	So my theory is that there is a new
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,936	| IOT042 |	Which applies
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:48,032	| IOT042 |	Pretty much any languages in the
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,312	| IOT042 |	Connected space
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:50,080	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,616	| IOT042 |	Salute goes like this
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,640	| IOT042 |	The service
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,688	| IOT042 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,968	| IOT042 |	I logged into
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,992	| IOT042 |	Dada
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:57,760	| IOT042 |	And that Loop
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,296	| IOT042 |	Keeps going
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,600	| IOT042 |	More data you have more intelligent
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,904	| IOT042 |	Are you allowed to them becomes and from Dad
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:08,000	| IOT042 |	Your service becomes more useful to the people who are using it
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,024	| IOT042 |	Like this is what
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:13,888	| IOT042 |	Google did so effectively this is what Facebook did so effectively and
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:17,216	| IOT042 |	I think I see you were doing this really really
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:20,032	| IOT042 |	Aggressive user of uber I know
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:23,616	| IOT042 |	Need the predictive nature of uber is pretty scary
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,432	| IOT042 |	But it's also pretty nice because they
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,712	| IOT042 |	Populate my
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,248	| IOT042 |	My Uber VIP
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:32,064	| IOT042 |	You know. 15 to 20 drivers
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,624	| IOT042 |	Who I actually seem to like to give
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,184	| IOT042 |	I started eating more often than others
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,232	| IOT042 |	And that is actually a pretty
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,536	| IOT042 |	It's a deeper relationship not just
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:45,632	| IOT042 |	Read the service but also with the drivers themselves
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,424	| IOT042 |	I know their names
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,704	| IOT042 |	I know how they're doing
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,800	| IOT042 |	Is United member to ask the questions that need to be asked
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,336	| IOT042 |	Next porch light
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:56,384	| IOT042 |	Uber the dog
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:58,688	| IOT042 |	Like them trying to make any
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,456	| IOT042 |	Interference
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:03,040	| IOT042 |	Right it's not creepy it's just a very
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,648	| IOT042 |	Are there drivers like waiting outside your house
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:11,232	| IOT042 |	Remove
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:16,352	| IOT042 |	Them knowing that at 9 I need to go to
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| IOT042 |	Is pretty scary
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,936	| IOT042 |	So we got this virtuous cycle
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,216	| IOT042 |	Am I question for you
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:24,800	| IOT042 |	Because what I read this was like this works for internet services
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,592	| IOT042 |	Uber obviously
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,128	| IOT042 |	It's a real world service
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,968	| IOT042 |	Does this work
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,736	| IOT042 |	4
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,784	| IOT042 |	Physical devices in the Smart Home
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,552	| IOT042 |	Because
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:38,368	| IOT042 |	There's there's a huge difference here with consumer devices
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,184	| IOT042 |	I have to spend $250 on a nest
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| IOT042 |	And I know with like
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:47,072	| IOT042 |	Nest cam when it was Dropcam they actually did very well
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:50,144	| IOT042 |	Creating is virtuous Loop
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:52,448	| IOT042 |	By having enough
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:52,960	| IOT042 |	People
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,008	| IOT042 |	Submit kind of
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,312	| IOT042 |	Data to them that they were able to create
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:01,152	| IOT042 |	Facial recognition that helps make a better service
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,712	| IOT042 |	And they did an itemized to that sort of thing
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,576	| IOT042 |	So in some ways this is true they had enough data to create a better service in
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:11,392	| IOT042 |	People loved it so can you do this with a physical.
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,464	| IOT042 |	Okay the number one thing I would say on that
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,024	| IOT042 |	We haven't seen the device
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,048	| IOT042 |	Make which we make this
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,728	| IOT042 |	But we don't love them enough
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,752	| IOT042 |	Laura
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,264	| IOT042 |	Scale
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,872	| IOT042 |	Yeah I don't know how many nests are out there may be less than a million
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,688	| IOT042 |	February 1st I'm hoping we'll know
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,200	| IOT042 |	Alphabet
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,736	| IOT042 |	What's number
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:37,504	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,784	| IOT042 |	That's not
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:39,552	| IOT042 |	Enough
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,832	| IOT042 |	Nest in the market
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,368	| IOT042 |	Wacky hat
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,160	| IOT042 |	For them to have
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,440	| IOT042 |	Say
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:47,232	| IOT042 |	Stockbridge
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,792	| IOT042 |	Which can become more useful to
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:53,632	| IOT042 |	From from that standpoint you know it still radio today's for
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,912	| IOT042 |	Internet of things change
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,752	| IOT042 |	So we're looking for
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,288	| IOT042 |	Do you have a sense of how many
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,848	| IOT042 |	We need to have in the real world
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,384	| IOT042 |	Apple was smart in
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,688	| IOT042 |	Nina badric together
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,992	| IOT042 |	Homekit would be very very
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,784	| IOT042 |	Good way to move forward
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,832	| IOT042 |	Pumpkin cars
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,392	| IOT042 |	The ability to provide identity
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,696	| IOT042 |	Store and manage data
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,000	| IOT042 |	And create a more personalized
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:20,512	| IOT042 |	Expedient
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,048	| IOT042 |	And have the infrastructure
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,096	| IOT042 |	For Independence
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:24,608	| IOT042 |	Small
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,144	| IOT042 |	In The Internet of Things
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,984	| IOT042 |	So far it has been
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:32,544	| IOT042 |	I miss it's not even a hit in the mess
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,336	| IOT042 |	Is a complete mess
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:38,176	| IOT042 |	Same goes for Google right Google can do exactly the same thing
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:42,016	| IOT042 |	Amazon could do exactly the same thing
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,296	| IOT042 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,344	| IOT042 |	I'll be doing
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,648	| IOT042 |	Like any of these companies
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,976	| IOT042 |	You know look outside their silos
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:55,584	| IOT042 |	So from my standpoint this is an opportunity for somebody
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:57,888	| IOT042 |	Maybe Facebook I don't know but
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:01,984	| IOT042 |	There is an independent service provider out there
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:04,288	| IOT042 |	Who can you can capitalize on this
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:04,800	| IOT042 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,592	| IOT042 |	Individual
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,432	| IOT042 |	Device makers are still so small
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:12,736	| IOT042 |	And they don't have what it takes I don't think
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,320	| IOT042 |	Samsung has water takes what example with the SmartThings
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,856	| IOT042 |	United status
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:21,184	| IOT042 |	It seems like. Quite a mess like I stop using it
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:25,280	| IOT042 |	And you know and then there was blank which was a good idea but
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,584	| IOT042 |	Never really took off until
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:31,424	| IOT042 |	But you know the Phillips we don't know they have their own Hardware agenda
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,984	| IOT042 |	Everybody has their own agenda
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,520	| IOT042 |	And nobody's getting mumps
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,288	| IOT042 |	Scary just
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,848	| IOT042 |	Anyone get scared going to be
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,408	| IOT042 |	That you will get the loop right
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,456	| IOT042 |	Okay and
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,992	| IOT042 |	You know it may be that it
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,040	| IOT042 |	Because he's our devices in homes
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,576	| IOT042 |	And there's about a hundred and
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:52,928	| IOT042 |	20 million homes quote-unquote homes in the US just in the US
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:55,232	| IOT042 |	I am curious if that's even enough
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,280	| IOT042 |	Scale
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,048	| IOT042 |	Yasso
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,840	| IOT042 |	I remember
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,864	| IOT042 |	You and I talked about
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,400	| IOT042 |	Last year
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,680	| IOT042 |	About
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,472	| IOT042 |	Like I want to connect to
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,496	| IOT042 |	Annapolis
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:10,336	| IOT042 |	Play like it is such a basic building block
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,128	| IOT042 |	Gmail
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,944	| IOT042 |	Every little gadgets in your house
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,968	| IOT042 |	Quasi connect
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:17,248	| IOT042 |	Right
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,040	| IOT042 |	Quasi internet
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:20,832	| IOT042 |	The Baxter
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,136	| IOT042 |	I still think those guys have the right off
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,928	| IOT042 |	Somebody
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,952	| IOT042 |	Who can make
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:28,512	| IOT042 |	Really affordable power strip
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| IOT042 |	Is it really nice
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,632	| IOT042 |	Openstack with people can plug into
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,656	| IOT042 |	And that becomes
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,960	| IOT042 |	Building blocks for
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:37,984	| IOT042 |	For what comes now
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,520	| IOT042 |	I think I still feel
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:44,384	| IOT042 |	$15 product is the right entry point for Internet of Things
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,176	| IOT042 |	Hello Manuel
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,736	| IOT042 |	They got to get scale before they can get that
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,016	| IOT042 |	Cuz
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:53,088	| IOT042 |	The power strip you're looking at Wi-Fi and a Wi-Fi chip
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,368	| IOT042 |	In one of those like
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,904	| IOT042 |	You're going to add $5 to like
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,464	| IOT042 |	Building materials and then
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,768	| IOT042 |	No but I think it's
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,816	| IOT042 |	It's like you look at $5
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,328	| IOT042 |	You look at
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:07,424	| IOT042 |	You know you have all these new like microcomputers which other
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:11,008	| IOT042 |	Take Micronor you can call them Nana computer the same tree
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,056	| IOT042 |	Which are coming to market now
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:16,896	| IOT042 |	If you have those and you can send for less than $10
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:21,248	| IOT042 |	I think there is still room to make a smart intelligent
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,808	| IOT042 |	Power strip for like less than
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,320	| IOT042 |	$15
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:27,136	| IOT042 |	What are the key for that is to have
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,184	| IOT042 |	A stack which is more
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:32,256	| IOT042 |	And innovate more programmable for other people
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| IOT042 |	2
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,560	| IOT042 |	Do you know
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,584	| IOT042 |	Piggy back office
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:36,608	| IOT042 |	I took
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:39,680	| IOT042 |	I do look at people like Belkin have their power strips but
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:42,752	| IOT042 |	You know they don't have a stack or they don't have any
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,568	| IOT042 |	Intelligent verification
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,848	| IOT042 |	What to do with that
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:50,688	| IOT042 |	Innocent opportunity I always think
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:53,504	| IOT042 |	The most basic thing you can do
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:58,368	| IOT042 |	With the internet of things in this is the power strip
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,672	| IOT042 |	The five belkin.com
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,720	| IOT042 |	Okay you know
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:08,096	| IOT042 |	Just open yourself up to all of the guys out there trying to build a 15-2
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,632	| IOT042 |	$20 power strip giving you
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,400	| IOT042 |	Call Sol
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:12,704	| IOT042 |	With that in mind
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:16,544	| IOT042 |	In your role as a as a VC
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:21,664	| IOT042 |	What do you think right now given given the FourSquare just had a Down Round given
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:25,248	| IOT042 |	Bet there's been some consolidation already and kind of
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,296	| IOT042 |	I guess it was in The Flash sales Market
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:31,136	| IOT042 |	What do you see coming into 2016 for the internet if they
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:34,464	| IOT042 |	I think that is too big trends with
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,024	| IOT042 |	Are happening right now one
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:40,096	| IOT042 |	Is the Asian manufacturers
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:44,704	| IOT042 |	Quickly imitating some of the more successful products
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:46,240	| IOT042 |	And offering them
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,544	| IOT042 |	To turn parties AJ
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:49,824	| IOT042 |	The old
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:52,640	| IOT042 |	School companies which resetting power strips
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,688	| IOT042 |	And become enough
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,200	| IOT042 |	Connecting
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,224	| IOT042 |	Power strip
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:57,760	| IOT042 |	Satellite
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,064	| IOT042 |	We saw the rise of the
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:04,416	| IOT042 |	That is the Wi-Fi routers and stuff like that
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:07,232	| IOT042 |	So that is a huge Trend which is going to
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:10,048	| IOT042 |	Suck out any prophets left in the market
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT042 |	I'm a little worried about that
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:15,680	| IOT042 |	From from a startup perspective I think that is a
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,728	| IOT042 |	What is enunciate
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:18,752	| IOT042 |	Carbon monoxide.
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:20,800	| IOT042 |	In my opinion
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:24,896	| IOT042 |	Ain't nobody sees it just one day just got you though
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,664	| IOT042 |	And boom
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,456	| IOT042 |	You're gone
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,784	| IOT042 |	And the server Market by quantity and
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,576	| IOT042 |	Are those guys just
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,856	| IOT042 |	Took away everything from
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT042 |	Some of the more established
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:39,488	| IOT042 |	He saw the same thing in phones and we have seen that in a turnip
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:43,584	| IOT042 |	Is happening really fast
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:44,864	| IOT042 |	Situation
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| IOT042 |	II
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,168	| IOT042 |	Isave
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:49,216	| IOT042 |	I think the biggest challenge remains
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:53,824	| IOT042 |	Very few Internet of Things companies are gone from
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:58,432	| IOT042 |	You know they go from 0 to 25000 customers very easily
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:01,504	| IOT042 |	But it's very hard to go from 25000
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,808	| IOT042 |	To 250000
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:08,160	| IOT042 |	And 250,000 to like 25 billion side view
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:12,000	| IOT042 |	Dollar girl challenge
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,280	| IOT042 |	We don't know how big it is
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,352	| IOT042 |	Play the biggest
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,888	| IOT042 |	Internet of Things company
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,168	| IOT042 |	You still don't know how big it is
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:20,448	| IOT042 |	Gun show
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:21,472	| IOT042 |	It's pretty big I mean
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,288	| IOT042 |	It's been around for a while and living selling
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,568	| IOT042 |	But we don't know
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,336	| IOT042 |	Right
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,128	| IOT042 |	That is a challenge nu-vu
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:31,456	| IOT042 |	Have gone past the 25000 Mark in
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:33,248	| IOT042 |	You're over
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,272	| IOT042 |	Unit 2 words
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,808	| IOT042 |	Marching towards to
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,856	| IOT042 |	250000 users
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:40,928	| IOT042 |	Our buyers are accounts whichever way
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:42,464	| IOT042 |	You want to calculate it
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,488	| IOT042 |	I think you're on the right
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,304	| IOT042 |	That's pretty good project free
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:49,120	| IOT042 |	Yeah I would think nest in probably a Philips Hue
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,912	| IOT042 |	Are probably the biggest connected
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:52,448	| IOT042 |	Products in Phillips
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,008	| IOT042 |	It's kind of its own Beast because it is
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:56,544	| IOT042 |	Phillips
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,568	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:00,640	| IOT042 |	I understand a little bit more presumably hadoop support products
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,480	| IOT042 |	Weibo has 1.5 million users
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,016	| IOT042 |	Which is
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:06,784	| IOT042 |	A lot
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:07,808	| IOT042 |	They're actually struggling
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,856	| IOT042 |	And their own by Falcon which
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,648	| IOT042 |	Sounds a lot of physical product
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:12,672	| IOT042 |	Kinecta Prada
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:13,952	| IOT042 |	Not so much
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,512	| IOT042 |	I think so I don't know what
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:20,352	| IOT042 |	The challenges of Belkin may or may not be my view is that if
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:20,864	| IOT042 |	If you
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,400	| IOT042 |	Have multiples
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,424	| IOT042 |	Use like
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,448	| IOT042 |	You know they have
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:27,520	| IOT042 |	I mean it's it's very hard to be a very focused
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,568	| IOT042 |	Connected device company
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:32,384	| IOT042 |	What's a separate company
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,456	| IOT042 |	Running independently as a
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,760	| IOT042 |	Tech company and not as part of Belkin
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:39,552	| IOT042 |	I bet you they probably would have
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:41,088	| IOT042 |	Way better cracker
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:41,856	| IOT042 |	Action did they have right
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:45,440	| IOT042 |	So we're calling for a spin out of WeMo
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,536	| IOT042 |	You're calling first.
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,072	| IOT042 |	I was seeing a Toyota Cruiser
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,680	| IOT042 |	An independent company that would have
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,216	| IOT042 |	Way more
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:58,240	| IOT042 |	Controller test
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,640	| IOT042 |	Alright so what are the biggest challenges you think for the
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:08,736	| IOT042 |	Not just a smartphone but just for the internet of things because I feel like this year is
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,296	| IOT042 |	This could be a big here at CES
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:14,880	| IOT042 |	I saw a lot of big companies coming into the space
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,672	| IOT042 |	We can call it taking a startups ideas
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:24,352	| IOT042 |	A lot of the ideas coming from startups we're really just like hey I've got these awesome sensors I'm going to connect them in the
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,632	| IOT042 |	Then I can do amazing things with her
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,144	| IOT042 |	Which
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:31,008	| IOT042 |	Yes that is a novel idea but it's also kind of what technologies all about
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,288	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:33,312	| IOT042 |	Dallas.
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,616	| IOT042 |	You know Procter & Gamble I've got you know
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,896	| IOT042 |	Sleep Numbers
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:40,480	| IOT042 |	Coming head and connectivity to their mattress in a way that
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:43,296	| IOT042 |	Smaller companies have already done
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:43,808	| IOT042 |	So
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,600	| IOT042 |	What do you think this year is going to bring us
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:51,744	| IOT042 |	I think the whole thing really reinforces when I was talking about is that
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,536	| IOT042 |	Because
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:54,304	| IOT042 |	It's so much
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,584	| IOT042 |	Easier for
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,144	| IOT042 |	But the Asian
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:00,448	| IOT042 |	Manufacturer
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,472	| IOT042 |	Replicate
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:03,008	| IOT042 |	Successor of someone
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,032	| IOT042 |	New startups
