EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,696	| IOT141 |	Last week
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,976	| IOT141 |	I was in California
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,512	| IOT141 |	And watching
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT141 |	AWS
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:15,680	| IOT141 |	From my computer for part of the time in
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,960	| IOT141 |	Amazon
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:18,240	| IOT141 |	They did a great job
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,288	| IOT141 |	Watching a bunch
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,336	| IOT141 |	Of iot services
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,128	| IOT141 |	Rent out the list but we're going to focus on a cup
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,688	| IOT141 |	It wasn't actually a bunch
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,992	| IOT141 |	If you read their press release it was the slew
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:30,784	| IOT141 |	That is a fairy
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:34,880	| IOT141 |	Cinnabon
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:39,232	| IOT141 |	Who is more than 3 and a slew
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,512	| IOT141 |	6
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:41,536	| IOT141 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,584	| IOT141 |	Maybe we should ask madam
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,656	| IOT141 |	So what day do you want to list
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| IOT141 |	Some of the things they now
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:52,544	| IOT141 |	I sure some of these are available in preview or coming soon so I'll know that right up front
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:56,384	| IOT141 |	Breath about bad AWS iot one click
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,176	| IOT141 |	Which is available in preview
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:03,040	| IOT141 |	That's to enable single button devices to print to do whatever you want
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:09,184	| IOT141 |	Dash theme shopping like this way it's more of maybe you want to call customer support
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:16,096	| IOT141 |	Jesus is a suite of three things I'll just list them out and talk about them
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,400	| IOT141 |	AWS iot device management
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:24,800	| IOT141 |	AWS iot device Defender which is coming in the first half of next year in AWS iot
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| IOT141 |	Analytics
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,104	| IOT141 |	Alright.
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,872	| IOT141 |	The other two
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| IOT141 |	Two things
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,408	| IOT141 |	Go back and talk
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,064	| IOT141 |	Amazon free artist
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,368	| IOT141 |	So let's tackle
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:41,440	| IOT141 |	Device Defender device one click
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,232	| IOT141 |	And Analytics
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,256	| IOT141 |	These are basically
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:47,840	| IOT141 |	Some of these have actually been around like device management
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| IOT141 |	Amazon has had for a while
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,960	| IOT141 |	Company a while back in added a lot of this so
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| IOT141 |	They're just beating up some of their Chi
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,520	| IOT141 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| IOT141 |	Device Defender is interesting
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,104	| IOT141 |	Because
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:03,200	| IOT141 |	It's going to allow you to apply to wristox2 any iot system
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,224	| IOT141 |	That you've got hosted in
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,784	| IOT141 |	Amazon's Cloud devices
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| IOT141 |	Behaving oddly
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,600	| IOT141 |	CBS network
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,648	| IOT141 |	Say hey why is that
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,928	| IOT141 |	Or rather it will say
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:15,744	| IOT141 |	Yep and I didn't I did not see the event
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:20,351	| IOT141 |	Unfortunately my take on this was that you could apply security policies to devices
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:26,239	| IOT141 |	And this would be monitoring those policies of the compliance those policies at the device
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,031	| IOT141 |	Yes in actually this is hell
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,311	| IOT141 |	A lot of
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:32,127	| IOT141 |	Companies were doing
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,175	| IOT141 |	Managed air
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,687	| IOT141 |	Devices out
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,991	| IOT141 |	Field today they just had to build it
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,759	| IOT141 |	Custom
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:42,111	| IOT141 |	So if you think of companies like a large thermostat vendor that sells men
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,391	| IOT141 |	Any thermostats to consumer
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:43,903	| IOT141 |	Xiamen other
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,207	| IOT141 |	They have this sort of thing
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,791	| IOT141 |	So this is actually a really
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,815	| IOT141 |	Useful product
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,655	| IOT141 |	And it makes total sense for Amazon to launch this for
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,703	| IOT141 |	Device management
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:01,567	| IOT141 |	He had a lot of this so they're just kind of packaging it up
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,103	| IOT141 |	Great Clips
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,919	| IOT141 |	I was intrigued by Adele
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| IOT141 |	We've had this
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| IOT141 |	Kind of with
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:07,967	| IOT141 |	The dash bus
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,783	| IOT141 |	It is something that
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,855	| IOT141 |	Prior to this you did have to program your dash button
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,623	| IOT141 |	So you had the iot
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,415	| IOT141 |	Amazon Islam
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,439	| IOT141 |	Song Happy
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,047	| IOT141 |	I think they're just kind of making it a little easier and
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:26,143	| IOT141 |	Kind of getting rid of some of the obstacles so that developers are hackers tinkerers can
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:31,263	| IOT141 |	Get started with them I don't know if they already had the pre-configured Lambda instances
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:35,871	| IOT141 |	That work with 54 so that's that seems to be new to me
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:39,711	| IOT141 |	Again removing obstacle see if they can figure a Lambda instance
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,479	| IOT141 |	And so on
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:45,087	| IOT141 |	So yeah they had it but I guess you could say that beat it up or made it a little bit easier to use
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,743	| IOT141 |	Let's go to AWS Greengrass
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,767	| IOT141 |	This is something
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,583	| IOT141 |	Gosh so much earlier this year
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:59,935	| IOT141 |	This is an edge instance or Edge compute the time
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| IOT141 |	Which is better functional programming
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| IOT141 |	Switch
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,031	| IOT141 |	If we lost all of you
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,311	| IOT141 |	I totally get that
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:10,687	| IOT141 |	Lambda is Amazon server list
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| IOT141 |	Computing
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,223	| IOT141 |	Effort
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,039	| IOT141 |	I guess it's how to think of it I always think about it
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,575	| IOT141 |	In plain English terms as
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,855	| IOT141 |	You know
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,135	| IOT141 |	When you have
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,183	| IOT141 |	Compute instance with Amazon
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:24,255	| IOT141 |	You have to have a server that's ready to be spun up
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| IOT141 |	It is there
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,583	| IOT141 |	And if you're doing whatever you ask it to do
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:31,679	| IOT141 |	You don't want to have a server just existing
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,703	| IOT141 |	Throughout the house
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,239	| IOT141 |	Parody of time
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:37,055	| IOT141 |	Because it's costing you money and you have a device it's going to wake up
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,847	| IOT141 |	And it's going to say hey
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,127	| IOT141 |	I want to send some information
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,919	| IOT141 |	Innocence information
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| IOT141 |	With Linda
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,991	| IOT141 |	And the circle is architecture
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,295	| IOT141 |	What you do is whenever you call it up
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,575	| IOT141 |	Amazon
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| IOT141 |	I Spit It Up
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,879	| IOT141 |	And that cost less
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT141 |	Really brilliant for
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,975	| IOT141 |	Coyote stuff
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,791	| IOT141 |	Yeah absolutely and the only thing I would add to that is
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:04,191	| IOT141 |	I believe that as a computer service you just said you know anytime you needed your call Lance there that's true but it can also be a
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,751	| IOT141 |	Event-driven so it's not like you have to do something
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,311	| IOT141 |	If your devices need the computer
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:14,175	| IOT141 |	They can reach out to AWS Lambda and get that compute
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| IOT141 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:22,367	| IOT141 |	So green grass basically ties the functionality of Lambda back to
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,743	| IOT141 |	Pushed a lot into green grass
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,535	| IOT141 |	I'm just going to add a link
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:35,423	| IOT141 |	In the show notes that explains this little bit more because it's really complicated and most of you guys probably are never going to care
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,727	| IOT141 |	Macro perspective
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,543	| IOT141 |	One more news
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,103	| IOT141 |	The other piece of news is Amazon is done
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,407	| IOT141 |	What it called Amazon
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,175	| IOT141 |	And
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:48,223	| IOT141 |	Our house stands for real-time operating system
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,247	| IOT141 |	It's these
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:52,831	| IOT141 |	Tiny little os's that run on microcontrollers
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,343	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,415	| IOT141 |	You don't like you that the OS for your phone
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,207	| IOT141 |	A computer
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,767	| IOT141 |	Microcontroller are top of the world is free
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:04,607	| IOT141 |	Amazon

EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,727	| IOT141 |	If I could just go back one second and just
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:14,335	| IOT141 |	Only because again I did not see the event but going back to the green grass bit and the edge compute
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:21,247	| IOT141 |	Just this is jumped out at me and I don't know if they'd had this or discuss it at the event but out of the press release and said
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:26,111	| IOT141 |	Greengrass ml interface ml machine learning
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,135	| IOT141 |	Models
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:32,255	| IOT141 |	To perform inference locally get results in and make smart decisions quickly even when they're not connected
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| IOT141 |	So this kind of goes back to that
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,583	| IOT141 |	Piece I wrote on the blog about
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:41,471	| IOT141 |	Making smart and smarter with machine learning and AI I have a feeling that's where this will come into play
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| IOT141 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,567	| IOT141 |	Kevin will be happy
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,103	| IOT141 |	There's a reason you are on the show
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:55,039	| IOT141 |	Yes and back to free art is basically every connected device needs to run an art us
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:58,111	| IOT141 |	Or at least run some kind of operating system
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| IOT141 |	If it said
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| IOT141 |	Tiny dumb device
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:04,767	| IOT141 |	The Big Challenge here is if you are a developer
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:09,887	| IOT141 |	You're trying to build for so many of these right now cuz back in the day everybody who made a microcontroller
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,167	| IOT141 |	There are a lot of them
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| IOT141 |	Call Heather
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,287	| IOT141 |	If you wanted to build something
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| IOT141 |	Software for something
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,383	| IOT141 |	Then you actually have to start with a custom OS in that sucked
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,295	| IOT141 |	And developers to make a good flat
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,343	| IOT141 |	Developers you want to have as few
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:32,671	| IOT141 |	Operating systems is few platforms for them as possible
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:36,511	| IOT141 |	Arm launched one a while back there others like
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,607	| IOT141 |	This is actually free
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,655	| IOT141 |	An Amazon now having this
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,703	| IOT141 |	Means that I'm assuming
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,751	| IOT141 |	Don't make it so easy
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,799	| IOT141 |	If you're running this on your device
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:53,151	| IOT141 |	That you're going to be tied and almost automatically with one click service
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,687	| IOT141 |	AWS which is
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,991	| IOT141 |	Right now
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,039	| IOT141 |	A lot of the other Cloud vendor
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,575	| IOT141 |	Have deals
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT141 |	Mysterious like
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,391	| IOT141 |	Sudbury Centre,
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,207	| IOT141 |	Needs to link your stuff automatically into their cloud
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,255	| IOT141 |	By getting into the game
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| IOT141 |	An artist
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,631	| IOT141 |	It was some kind of like sidestepped all of the individual board efforts that it be
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,959	| IOT141 |	The efforts to connect individual boards
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| IOT141 |	Specifically
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:22,591	| IOT141 |	And I have a question for you and because I don't know the answer and I
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:27,711	| IOT141 |	And if you don't that's fine too we can look into this would you say this is comprable to
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,991	| IOT141 |	Google's Android things
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,015	| IOT141 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,039	| IOT141 |	If I could
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:35,135	| IOT141 |	Nail someone from Google down on Android things
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:40,255	| IOT141 |	I might it might be but I feel like everything's might be for
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,559	| IOT141 |	Requires maybe larger memory
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| IOT141 |	Venda traditional artists
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| IOT141 |	I would have to
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:53,311	| IOT141 |	You should look into that we should take some time to look into that because to me this is Amazon's big iot push and it made me question
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,847	| IOT141 |	What are the competitors doing
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:58,175	| IOT141 |	To the person that is like a big competitor so what are they doing
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,735	| IOT141 |	But maybe it's not the same
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:04,319	| IOT141 |	Comfortable exercise for bigger stuff
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,367	| IOT141 |	You need 500
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:12,511	| IOT141 |	512m
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| IOT141 |	Jeffrey Artis
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,071	| IOT141 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,167	| IOT141 |	So yes that's the answer
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| IOT141 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| IOT141 |	But even though
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,823	| IOT141 |	Which event happened last
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,871	| IOT141 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| IOT141 |	They have iota
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,223	| IOT141 |	Cloud news
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,991	| IOT141 |	I do not know why this
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:35,807	| IOT141 |	It's fine
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:38,111	| IOT141 |	They actually Microsoft
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:45,023	| IOT141 |	Has had an iot presents for a while in a lot of companies
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,559	| IOT141 |	They use it
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:49,119	| IOT141 |	Because no it manager gets fired for buying
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,423	| IOT141 |	Actually I'm pretty sure that's not
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,543	| IOT141 |	They have iot Central
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,103	| IOT141 |	They've had an iot Hub platform
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,407	| IOT141 |	It was like platform-as-a-service
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:05,503	| IOT141 |	And now they have iot Central which is a software-as-a-service
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,575	| IOT141 |	So basically they've taken everything they've done
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,647	| IOT141 |	With all of their iot analytics device management
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:18,047	| IOT141 |	That you had to customize and they said you know what we're going to build a couple scenarios in Bryn off of that is a spur
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:21,375	| IOT141 |	I saw the demos there very compelling
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:21,887	| IOT141 |	If you
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| IOT141 |	Want to start something
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| IOT141 |	You can start there
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,287	| IOT141 |	There's going to be a lot more features coming over time
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:31,103	| IOT141 |	And I don't really know what else to say about that other than
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,407	| IOT141 |	Basically everybody and their mother is trying to
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,943	| IOT141 |	Make it easier to put your devices on
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| IOT141 |	Promise results
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:43,647	| IOT141 |	In fact along with that to make things easier they have made the Azure iot Hub device provisioning service
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| IOT141 |	Is generally available
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,231	| IOT141 |	Is pretty sure that was out in like a preview for quite a while now
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,071	| IOT141 |	Yes in you know between you and me I can never figure out what's app
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,351	| IOT141 |	What's today what's
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:56,959	| IOT141 |	Yeah what time is it
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:00,287	| IOT141 |	Well this is definitely
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,055	| IOT141 |	Yes as a
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,151	| IOT141 |	Okay so that's
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,919	| IOT141 |	That's not all
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,199	| IOT141 |	That is not all
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| IOT141 |	Because a tree
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:11,295	| IOT141 |	Amazon also discussed
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,831	| IOT141 |	For business
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,415	| IOT141 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,183	| IOT141 |	Big picture
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:20,767	| IOT141 |	Amazon wants to move into the office
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,839	| IOT141 |	Open talk about for quite some time so it makes sense
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| IOT141 |	We have lots of questions
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,167	| IOT141 |	Because
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,727	| IOT141 |	I'm just going to save as a madam
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,495	| IOT141 |	I'm trying to like
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:33,311	| IOT141 |	My biggest challenge so far in my life
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,079	| IOT141 |	With my smartphone
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,847	| IOT141 |	Has been
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,639	| IOT141 |	Making my Spotify app
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,407	| IOT141 |	Accounts
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,175	| IOT141 |	Work on all night
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,575	| IOT141 |	So I signed up for multi-user
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,111	| IOT141 |	Spotify
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,183	| IOT141 |	Which is not based on devices based on people
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| IOT141 |	And my daughter
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,023	| IOT141 |	Who is the most common Spotify listener
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:53,791	| IOT141 |	Cuz she's 11
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:54,815	| IOT141 |	That's all
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,375	| IOT141 |	She actually isn't legal
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,399	| IOT141 |	In the Amazon
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,679	| IOT141 |	Amazon
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,727	| IOT141 |	Doesn't really recognize her email address
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:02,751	| IOT141 |	And she doesn't get
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,543	| IOT141 |	Mattamy functionality basically
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:09,407	| IOT141 |	So then I had to address for my home
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| IOT141 |	Associate that with my
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,735	| IOT141 |	The point
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:13,759	| IOT141 |	Is
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,807	| IOT141 |	That's complicated in my family
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,879	| IOT141 |	When we bring this into
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,415	| IOT141 |	Office
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| IOT141 |	It becomes wackadoo
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,231	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:27,071	| IOT141 |	Yeah it's going to be an IT logistical
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,887	| IOT141 |	I want to say nightmare about this a challenge for now
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:36,287	| IOT141 |	Because I don't know how this is going to be implemented and I can see why they want to do this and then there's some of the examples are saying
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,567	| IOT141 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,383	| IOT141 |	Hey Madam a you know get me a conference room
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| IOT141 |	Or
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,711	| IOT141 |	Give me directions to the right room
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,551	| IOT141 |	Piece of broken equipment
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,575	| IOT141 |	I get all that
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,367	| IOT141 |	But the challenge that I see
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:52,415	| IOT141 |	It's the same one that Google actually faces
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,183	| IOT141 |	Because you
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:58,047	| IOT141 |	Typically can't use a Google Apps account for like Google Assistant Google home
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,839	| IOT141 |	And that's because of businesses
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| IOT141 |	On their data
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,143	| IOT141 |	And the way these
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,703	| IOT141 |	Assistance work is they work with that data
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,471	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:07,775	| IOT141 |	How is Amazon going to manage that
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,799	| IOT141 |	Businesses
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:14,431	| IOT141 |	And misses are very eager I talked to lots of businesses who are very
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,735	| IOT141 |	Madame a into their offices
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,551	| IOT141 |	And there are certain companies that have built skills to do
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,063	| IOT141 |	Things like
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,599	| IOT141 |	Hainan
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,623	| IOT141 |	What were sales
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:24,927	| IOT141 |	Q4
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| IOT141 |	Facebook
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,303	| IOT141 |	The questions I still have I've read through
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,583	| IOT141 |	Amazon stock
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,119	| IOT141 |	There's no mention it like
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:37,215	| IOT141 |	Microsoft active directory
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,983	| IOT141 |	For example
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,007	| IOT141 |	Which
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,287	| IOT141 |	I kind of like you can
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:46,431	| IOT141 |	Blanket to Office 365 Microsoft Exchange
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:52,831	| IOT141 |	It lets you made it so people come in with their personal Amazon account so this assumes that everyone's going to have their own personal
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,343	| IOT141 |	Amazon account
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:59,487	| IOT141 |	It's probably not a crazy assumption for most people but there's going to be people who don't have this
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,815	| IOT141 |	I wonder if they will have
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:09,215	| IOT141 |	Atty the the work email addresses to Amazon business account so to speak for this
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,751	| IOT141 |	I don't know don't go personal
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:18,431	| IOT141 |	Reading through this book Kevin and I are a little confused because
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,551	| IOT141 |	Rockets
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:24,831	| IOT141 |	Divvied up
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| IOT141 |	You can invite
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,695	| IOT141 |	And users it says to enroll their personal
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,975	| IOT141 |	Madame a account
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,279	| IOT141 |	With your mad at me for business account
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,815	| IOT141 |	So there is some
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,887	| IOT141 |	Teacher there to allow you to use a personal account but
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,959	| IOT141 |	I don't know if people going to want to do that with her employers number one
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:45,823	| IOT141 |	And secondly in one of the case studies that actually work they say they build a skill
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:50,175	| IOT141 |	And it called a private still see what they private skill that we've built
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:56,575	| IOT141 |	Matt American Reserve conference room style help tickets for Community management team and provide important
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,855	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:01,951	| IOT141 |	Maybe that's a way to get around the whole you know having access to the business data
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,975	| IOT141 |	You do it through
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:06,047	| IOT141 |	Enabling your own skills at your corporation
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:12,703	| IOT141 |	I don't know a lot of different ways this can go and I don't know if it's really clear yet to anyone
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,055	| IOT141 |	We will see
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:23,711	| IOT141 |	What challenges related
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,015	| IOT141 |	What was it called
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,159	| IOT141 |	That was a nightmare
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:41,631	| IOT141 |	This is bad times more so cuz it's more devices more skills
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:48,543	| IOT141 |	I'm in a household with people who do things I have no one in my house loves the fart ass but imagine you know your boss
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,079	| IOT141 |	Apps
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:56,479	| IOT141 |	And the other see there's a lot of lines crossing between personal and work there and additionally how
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,015	| IOT141 |	Amazon handle
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:02,111	| IOT141 |	Recognizing people through the voice Services here
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:05,951	| IOT141 |	Because it's struggle sometimes
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:12,351	| IOT141 |	Should someone who just happens to be in your conference room have access to all the data that's available on your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,399	| IOT141 |	Probably not
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:20,543	| IOT141 |	So those are the things were curious about
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,591	| IOT141 |	Pretty sure or if you're piloting
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,455	| IOT141 |	That's my Insite for that
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT141 |	Battles
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,271	| IOT141 |	Battlegrounds
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,575	| IOT141 |	With Amazon
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,879	| IOT141 |	And now Google YouTube
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,647	| IOT141 |	Has been again
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,183	| IOT141 |	Code for the echo show after
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:40,511	| IOT141 |	Brief moment when I could watch the Corgi videos of breakfast also
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,535	| IOT141 |	They pulled it from the Fire TV
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,327	| IOT141 |	And Amazon is now
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,351	| IOT141 |	No longer selling
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:49,215	| IOT141 |	Products yeah I think the nest ceasing of selling nest
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:52,031	| IOT141 |	Product has been a couple weeks if not more
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:57,663	| IOT141 |	But this whole YouTube getting pulled from the show and surprising with a Fire TV
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:06,623	| IOT141 |	I hear you have a show you had then you lost it and then I seen you had to work around to use the web version
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:08,927	| IOT141 |	Can you can access
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,743	| IOT141 |	Reinstated it
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:20,959	| IOT141 |	This is a big battle right now it really affects Amazon's products the show I kind of get
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,727	| IOT141 |	Because
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,751	| IOT141 |	I don't think
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:27,871	| IOT141 |	They worked out whatever deal they needed with Google in advance at the Fire TV I mean
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:30,431	| IOT141 |	It on there for a while I mean
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,711	| IOT141 |	And that's
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,527	| IOT141 |	Not an iot device theoretically it's
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| IOT141 |	I'm surprised
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:39,903	| IOT141 |	I like guys get over it YouTube has the audience so you need to be on the television
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,695	| IOT141 |	Amazon
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:43,743	| IOT141 |	Retail stores so you got to sell your product
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:44,767	| IOT141 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,071	| IOT141 |	We can I mean
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,119	| IOT141 |	Apple products
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,631	| IOT141 |	Amazon sale
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,191	| IOT141 |	I'm used to that but it's still really darned
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:57,311	| IOT141 |	As a normal consumer not like
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,359	| IOT141 |	Waiting up till 3 in the morning.
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,383	| IOT141 |	IPhones or what
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,943	| IOT141 |	So this is just a mess and it's
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,967	| IOT141 |	It's a mess
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,991	| IOT141 |	Consumers ultimate
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,527	| IOT141 |	The price for
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:09,087	| IOT141 |	It is extra frustrating because when you buy these things
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,391	| IOT141 |	You think they're going to work one way in
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,951	| IOT141 |	And now they're not because of the stupid Court
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,719	| IOT141 |	Fights
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,231	| IOT141 |	Remind me
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:25,215	| IOT141 |	Arguments for the last couple years when you're like
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:32,127	| IOT141 |	Yeah it's that same argument all over again just on different devices in a different content delivery mechanism if you do have a Fire TV
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,431	| IOT141 |	How big is start singing notification morning saying that
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:41,343	| IOT141 |	YouTube on no longer be available on the Fire TV as of January 1st 2018 so watch it
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:44,159	| IOT141 |	Nginx turn
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:49,791	| IOT141 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,303	| IOT141 |	I just hate everyone
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,095	| IOT141 |	That's frustrating
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,679	| IOT141 |	What is move to happier news
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,447	| IOT141 |	Corporate excitement
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,471	| IOT141 |	Walmart
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,775	| IOT141 |	Walmart AR
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,055	| IOT141 |	This is a great story
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,335	| IOT141 |	So Chris Ensley
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,639	| IOT141 |	Who is
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,919	| IOT141 |	Head of a team in
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:09,503	| IOT141 |	Walmart is 500%
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,527	| IOT141 |	Walmart so he seems like
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,111	| IOT141 |	He basically wants a
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,903	| IOT141 |	Sensor that cost less than a buck
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:20,512	| IOT141 |	So he can stick it on all of their products track of around the world Etc
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,072	| IOT141 |	She wants it to sense movement Keepin vibration
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,864	| IOT141 |	He would like it to be energy harvesting
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| IOT141 |	And
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,424	| IOT141 |	He wants to get it really cheaply
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,216	| IOT141 |	Vigilia
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:31,776	| IOT141 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,848	| IOT141 |	He said we have nearly 12000 stores
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:39,968	| IOT141 |	And they've kind of done at initial rollout of iot stuffing about 5000 stores
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:40,992	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,016	| IOT141 |	It's not like they're
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,552	| IOT141 |	Starting to play stuff
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,088	| IOT141 |	But it's obviously expensive
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:52,000	| IOT141 |	Actually made a really good point is I just changing our light bulbs is a huge undertaking in terms of cost and effort and songs
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:54,560	| IOT141 |	I get it
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:59,424	| IOT141 |	Talk about using LED bulbs Beacon somehow soda
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:04,288	| IOT141 |	That is something that people have talked about for a while so that makes a lot of sense cuz they're powered in
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,824	| IOT141 |	People that consumers can access them
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,664	| IOT141 |	Great article I will link to it
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:11,712	| IOT141 |	You can learn and you know if you have this
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,992	| IOT141 |	Apparently Walmart wants to talk to you
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,016	| IOT141 |	Coma
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,320	| IOT141 |	All right I was in
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:20,928	| IOT141 |	Another guy was at an event at the Target open house actually was
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:23,232	| IOT141 |	Last week and I had a panel
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:23,744	| IOT141 |	On
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:27,584	| IOT141 |	Building sustainable
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,632	| IOT141 |	And
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:30,912	| IOT141 |	Hives
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| IOT141 |	Which is a subscription
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,240	| IOT141 |	Connected Products Company
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,800	| IOT141 |	British gas
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,848	| IOT141 |	Rob Martin's who is from Schlage
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,128	| IOT141 |	And Matt van
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:40,896	| IOT141 |	Horn who is the CEO
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,712	| IOT141 |	And I learned many things
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,504	| IOT141 |	And I'm going to send them up really quickly
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:46,784	| IOT141 |	1
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,832	| IOT141 |	The June oven which cabinet I love
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,928	| IOT141 |	Stop for the holidays
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:56,768	| IOT141 |	Because they did is crazy pricing paint with Williams-Sonoma
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:01,888	| IOT141 |	They charged some $1,000 for this thing and it's Norm
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,680	| IOT141 |	$1,500 an hour
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,960	| IOT141 |	They have no more to say
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,752	| IOT141 |	1500
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,568	| IOT141 |	Niedermeyer
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,664	| IOT141 |	Early adopters that's a tax I paid all my life
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,480	| IOT141 |	That's terrible
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,760	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:22,368	| IOT141 |	More related to the panel topic was this idea that we should be selling Hardware as a service in
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:26,464	| IOT141 |	A lot of these guys actually really resisted the idea
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| IOT141 |	That
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,512	| IOT141 |	This is actually what they were selling
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:34,400	| IOT141 |	But the more I talk to people the more I'm aware of the fact that every connected device you buy
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,192	| IOT141 |	It's not a product that you buy
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:38,240	| IOT141 |	It is a service that you
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:38,752	| IOT141 |	You're going to buy
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,800	| IOT141 |	Now whether or not
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,616	| IOT141 |	You paid a monthly subscription
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| IOT141 |	For the service
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:45,920	| IOT141 |	It's still a freaking service
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,992	| IOT141 |	And they have to
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,760	| IOT141 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:57,952	| IOT141 |	Educate consumers as consumers we need to think about these things this way
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:23:59,232	| IOT141 |	Because right now
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:02,304	| IOT141 |	We're buying these things thinking they're going to last
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,352	| IOT141 |	The same amount of time an unkindness
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,120	| IOT141 |	Active device with
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,656	| IOT141 |	And that's fine if it's a
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,704	| IOT141 |	And it only last 3 years but
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,752	| IOT141 |	If it's a door lock
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:12,288	| IOT141 |	And you want that thing to last
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:12,800	| IOT141 |	30
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:20,992	| IOT141 |	Expectation seen numerous updates feature.
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:24,064	| IOT141 |	Missions like every couple weeks we get something
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,112	| IOT141 |	I got an email today
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:32,512	| IOT141 |	Yes thank you I love it so these things they have to build
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,816	| IOT141 |	R&D to figure out how to add these new features
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,352	| IOT141 |	Continue to support the old teachers
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:40,448	| IOT141 |	Hopefully into perpetuity quite honestly and then
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:46,592	| IOT141 |	You know you support them through questions
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,432	| IOT141 |	That's the second
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:53,504	| IOT141 |	And this is from Roy
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,040	| IOT141 |	Operations prayer hive
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| IOT141 |	He was like
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:59,392	| IOT141 |	You really need to consider when you're building this product
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,928	| IOT141 |	The timeline you're willing to
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,744	| IOT141 |	Because that's going to affect
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:07,840	| IOT141 |	What you charge for it up front but also how you're going to monetize it over
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:11,936	| IOT141 |	Overtime you can't just stick a something out there and be like I will figure it out later
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:13,216	| IOT141 |	Which is exactly what happen
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:17,312	| IOT141 |	Because people 90 world in the computer world were used to
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,616	| IOT141 |	Things that may be last for 3
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:24,224	| IOT141 |	Well they tend to lease a lot of things
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:26,784	| IOT141 |	I thought that was really a good point
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,600	| IOT141 |	Because if you're designing something to last for 10 years
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:33,184	| IOT141 |	You're going to have a very different cost equation then something for 3 years or
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,232	| IOT141 |	Our customer
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,000	| IOT141 |	Rather
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,792	| IOT141 |	Maybe we should lie siriano to devices
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,144	| IOT141 |	Something somebody should be looking into
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:45,728	| IOT141 |	There's a lot of questions I have about that like what it means to start
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,544	| IOT141 |	Paying for things monthly that used to own because
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:50,848	| IOT141 |	The form of wealth
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,128	| IOT141 |	Eurasian rights
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,992	| IOT141 |	Can I get equity in my door lock
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,320	| IOT141 |	Yeah but once you start
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,160	| IOT141 |	Are you sore
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:10,816	| IOT141 |	And having things taken away that's why we shouldn't have to pay for anything at all
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,376	| IOT141 |	Not so fast.
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,776	| IOT141 |	That is not true that is not
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| IOT141 |	We feel
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,336	| IOT141 |	Or that's how I feel
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:22,848	| IOT141 |	Apparently
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,664	| IOT141 |	Okay so
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,200	| IOT141 |	Let's Talk About Kevin
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:27,968	| IOT141 |	Has he got a new Gadget
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:33,344	| IOT141 |	Yes we'll keep this kind of shorts cuz it's not super
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:40,000	| IOT141 |	Glitzy but I finally got around to installing the controls
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:44,352	| IOT141 |	For those who are interested it's model number G
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:49,216	| IOT141 |	I think you can find it online for 80 90 bucks actually bought a refurbished one for $61
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,032	| IOT141 |	So it's just a big Square module
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,848	| IOT141 |	That has a light
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:57,664	| IOT141 |	And you literally it to me tennis install this thing
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:00,992	| IOT141 |	You literally plug it in near your Z-Wave Hub witch
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:05,344	| IOT141 |	My case is a wink and tear it up using the Hub app
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,880	| IOT141 |	That way you can make your connection
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,160	| IOT141 |	Didn't unplug the device
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:12,768	| IOT141 |	Garage door garage door opener
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,072	| IOT141 |	Mine is an old Genie
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,400	| IOT141 |	It's probably came with this house which is Bill 18 years ago
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:24,800	| IOT141 |	And literally you connect two wires from the gocontrol Z-Wave controller to the garage door opener
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:28,896	| IOT141 |	If the same screws that your push button control for garage door
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:31,712	| IOT141 |	Is so easily stimulates a push of the button and then
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:39,648	| IOT141 |	Tilt sensor that you stick on your garage door and that will tell the
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,928	| IOT141 |	Controller if the door is
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:45,536	| IOT141 |	Copper down and that's pretty much it I mean I have it working with my wink perfectly
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:49,120	| IOT141 |	One thing I will note with this particular controller and this may be common
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:53,472	| IOT141 |	It will only accept one command every 30 seconds if you open the door
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:56,032	| IOT141 |	Remotely then you got to wait at least 30 seconds
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,080	| IOT141 |	How to close a tanning spray safety
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| IOT141 |	Tradition which I can understand that but
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:03,200	| IOT141 |	Working really well I've created a robot 2
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,736	| IOT141 |	Shut the door for me if I
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:09,344	| IOT141 |	Leaving based on GPS Android
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,696	| IOT141 |	I'm not sure what you got
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:17,536	| IOT141 |	For my garage door is when the garage door opens after dark it turns on
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,304	| IOT141 |	My porch light
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,840	| IOT141 |	Very nice
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,376	| IOT141 |	Yes I like that
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,448	| IOT141 |	I like that
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,728	| IOT141 |	I will do that
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,008	| IOT141 |	Anyway
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,032	| IOT141 |	Very easy like I said
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:30,848	| IOT141 |	The 10 minutes to install anybody can do this quite honestly
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,664	| IOT141 |	Very inexpensive to I thought what it does
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,432	| IOT141 |	No that's awesome
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:42,624	| IOT141 |	Got it feels like decades and Internet of Things
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,928	| IOT141 |	Garage door
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:52,096	| IOT141 |	The challenge with all of these is for security reasons a lot of them don't let you do like voice control for the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,632	| IOT141 |	Google home
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,680	| IOT141 |	And some of them don't let you control asthma
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,704	| IOT141 |	Play things from Hobbs
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:57,984	| IOT141 |	Curse my thanks
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:04,896	| IOT141 |	Price Rite and I did check I cannot voice control this through either my echo devices or through my Google home it just isn't
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,664	| IOT141 |	Supported yet
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,688	| IOT141 |	I believe I can
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:10,016	| IOT141 |	Control the mic
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| IOT141 |	Fee

EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:14,880	| IOT141 |	There you go
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,904	| IOT141 |	All right
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,952	| IOT141 |	Let's go to this week's
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:18,976	| IOT141 |	Voicemail
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:21,536	| IOT141 |	Find The Internet of Things podcast listener hotline

EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:34,080	| IOT141 |	So you have to have a smart home system
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,408	| IOT141 |	See what's possible is it
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| IOT141 |	Already
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,992	| IOT141 |	Let's play the voicemail

EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:52,512	| IOT141 |	They're getting confused with multiple living room notations for the
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:54,048	| IOT141 |	Various iot devices
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,352	| IOT141 |	WeMo switch home

EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,032	| IOT141 |	Appreciate your help thank you
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,360	| IOT141 |	This is a
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,128	| IOT141 |	Great question
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,664	| IOT141 |	And there are so many ants
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,992	| IOT141 |	The basic
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,016	| IOT141 |	Problem
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:17,600	| IOT141 |	Okay so there are many ways to tackle it but I'm going to give you a philosophy
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,624	| IOT141 |	Because that's what I think
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:19,648	| IOT141 |	Is going to help them
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:22,208	| IOT141 |	I pick one thing
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,000	| IOT141 |	What I'm naming devices
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,048	| IOT141 |	I pick one thing tickets the name
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:29,120	| IOT141 |	Lake of the room that it's in and it's usually the
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,656	| IOT141 |	Dominant lighting Source in
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,448	| IOT141 |	So I have living room
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,520	| IOT141 |	And then the for ceiling can lights teacher living
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,056	| IOT141 |	So it's like
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,336	| IOT141 |	Left shelter
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,128	| IOT141 |	Easy chair
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,712	| IOT141 |	Or whatever and then they're all grouped together under that name
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,016	| IOT141 |	Everything else in that room
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,576	| IOT141 |	Get something that does not have the name
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,088	| IOT141 |	Living room
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:51,648	| IOT141 |	So there's a fan that's
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,160	| IOT141 |	Big fan
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,440	| IOT141 |	Is that a yes
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:58,048	| IOT141 |	It's named Afro Circus because my daughter named it after
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:58,816	| IOT141 |	Something
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,840	| IOT141 |	From Madagascar
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,608	| IOT141 |	When that was hot
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:01,632	| IOT141 |	Years ago
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:07,776	| IOT141 |	You can name it whatever you want I was suggesting that do not sound like others
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| IOT141 |	Thanks
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,080	| IOT141 |	And I also have
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,408	| IOT141 |	Batman lose all of my downstairs downstairs
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,176	| IOT141 |	Which meant that
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,944	| IOT141 |	When I
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,712	| IOT141 |	Added my
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,992	| IOT141 |	And stuff
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:19,808	| IOT141 |	I used to call them downstairs blinds and upstairs blinds but
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:21,856	| IOT141 |	Diffusing so
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,160	| IOT141 |	Lower
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:26,976	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:33,376	| IOT141 |	Right and I'm shaking my head because this is a great question and it's a common Challenge and
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:39,776	| IOT141 |	I take a similar approach to pretty much everything that just obviously makes sense
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:46,176	| IOT141 |	Name some things by room office lights but I have
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,480	| IOT141 |	Office middle office bottom cuz they're on
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:53,856	| IOT141 |	Vertical lamp so yeah it's really tricky so I do it by placement and room
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,136	| IOT141 |	I try to be as descriptive
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,160	| IOT141 |	Possible
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:32:01,280	| IOT141 |	I think at the end of the day what we really need is what's taking place right now such as the
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:05,888	| IOT141 |	Grouping of things we don't even need the names so so you can just say it lights off
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,936	| IOT141 |	In the room that you're in free sample
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:14,080	| IOT141 |	No the challenge
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,384	| IOT141 |	My fans are on
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:19,456	| IOT141 |	Technically light switch so when I turn on my living room
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:23,552	| IOT141 |	So when I say
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,344	| IOT141 |	Everything is pink sza light
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:27,648	| IOT141 |	Even though some of those things are not lights
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,416	| IOT141 |	Stair fan
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,952	| IOT141 |	Or if you have a switch

EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,232	| IOT141 |	The fireplace
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:36,096	| IOT141 |	And that is because this is still very rudimentary
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| IOT141 |	And we need
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:42,240	| IOT141 |	Had to go back to that article from last week we need some a i and some ml to say

EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,816	| IOT141 |	I would say pick your dominant

EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,704	| IOT141 |	The most sewing
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,728	| IOT141 |	Many cases it's going to be
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,288	| IOT141 |	And then from there
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:18,080	| IOT141 |	Descriptive
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,616	| IOT141 |	Crazy however

EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,552	| IOT141 |	Can you start off by telling me a little bit about Lux products
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:09,952	| IOT141 |	I sure can so the folks at lox we are proud philadelphia-based innovators of HVAC
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:12,768	| IOT141 |	Control and we've been around for over a hundred years
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:16,096	| IOT141 |	You probably don't know this but in the middle of last century
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:20,704	| IOT141 |	We came up with what I jokingly call is the world's first home automation device
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,728	| IOT141 |	Which is the luck
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:23,520	| IOT141 |	Minute minder kitchen timer
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,568	| IOT141 |	I'll bet you have one in your Homer
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,848	| IOT141 |	Your grandmother told me your mother
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:30,432	| IOT141 |	Terrific well I'll jump ahead
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:35,808	| IOT141 |	2 about 30 years ago where we started focusing solely on HVAC controls
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:39,904	| IOT141 |	And I'll jump ahead even more to tell you that we've just launched our third
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,184	| IOT141 |	Wifi connect
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,464	| IOT141 |	Food product called Deluxe

EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,560	| IOT141 |	Ancona was a Hawaiian word that mean
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:47,840	| IOT141 |	Inviting
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:52,704	| IOT141 |	I think when people see the product they'll know why we need to Kono it is something you want to touch
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,728	| IOT141 |	And get to know
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:55,776	| IOT141 |	We focused on personalization
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:56,800	| IOT141 |	Design and comfort
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:58,848	| IOT141 |	Tell me a little bit more about

EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,344	| IOT141 |	Expected has
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:12,928	| IOT141 |	The geofencing we call that home-and-away aware it has
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,208	| IOT141 |	Smart scheduling

EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,768	| IOT141 |	Estimated
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:23,168	| IOT141 |	We have energy runtime and usage reporting on the app and it connects with all the three major
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:27,008	| IOT141 |	Voice assistance all at what we believe is a great affordable price
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,544	| IOT141 |	149 buck
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:31,616	| IOT141 |	Another thing I'd like to talk about fricano hazard warranty

EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:49,024	| IOT141 |	Another two years on top no one touches
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,048	| IOT141 |	Just that sort of Warrant
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:56,960	| IOT141 |	Okay now it sounds like you guys have really embraced the startup mentality since you've been around for so long
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,520	| IOT141 |	And you made such a wide variety of products
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,336	| IOT141 |	How is this influence how you develop
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:05,152	| IOT141 |	We have the drive and exciting
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,432	| IOT141 |	Man and the creativity of a
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:12,832	| IOT141 |	The startup but we have this established company mentality there are over 15 million Lux thermostats on the wall
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,880	| IOT141 |	Walls throughout the country already
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,648	| IOT141 |	Throughout the past
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:18,208	| IOT141 |	30 years and we build on that knowledge
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,744	| IOT141 |	And that experience
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,768	| IOT141 |	Of knowing
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:25,632	| IOT141 |	What the mainstream of America want so we design our products and develop everything
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,424	| IOT141 |	That will meet the needs of the mass Market
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,472	| IOT141 |	We're trying to get past that I owed
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:31,264	| IOT141 |	Key bump of early adopters
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:33,568	| IOT141 |	To get really through that and into the main part of
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,080	| IOT141 |	The marketplace
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,872	| IOT141 |	Rap sounds great

EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,200	| IOT141 |	How you doing
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:18,112	| IOT141 |	Super well so we're here to talk about what it means to actually dig into the Enterprise I
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:21,440	| IOT141 |	Iot world and what you actually need to do is a business to make the
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:21,952	| IOT141 |	Successful
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:25,024	| IOT141 |	So let's get started
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:28,352	| IOT141 |	Quickly talking to me a little bit about why you think
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:30,144	| IOT141 |	We have maybe misled p
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,192	| IOT141 |	People about iot and its
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:32,704	| IOT141 |	Complexity
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,264	| IOT141 |	Secy CIT coyote like
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:36,544	| IOT141 |	Dashiki
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:39,360	| IOT141 |	Onset of high expectations
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,640	| IOT141 |	And sadly
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:42,432	| IOT141 |	Numbers astronomy
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,272	| IOT141 |	Jose Enterprises and consumers
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,576	| IOT141 |	Excited and we do believe that eventually
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:50,624	| IOT141 |	Come to fruition
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,392	| IOT141 |	But I think
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,184	| IOT141 |	Significant
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:53,952	| IOT141 |	It's amazing how you
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,976	| IOT141 |	You transfer me
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:57,280	| IOT141 |	The physical world to the digital world
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:59,584	| IOT141 |	And I think because of the
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:03,680	| IOT141 |	Technology has been moving in the last few years
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,752	| IOT141 |	Sometimes server to clouds to mobile
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:09,056	| IOT141 |	Expectation is that this is Magic
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,080	| IOT141 |	Call Alexis.
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:10,848	| IOT141 |	Looking for

EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:14,432	| IOT141 |	Coyote
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:16,736	| IOT141 |	And enter the number of factors agenda
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:18,784	| IOT141 |	16
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:19,552	| IOT141 |	Why We Sing

EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,136	| IOT141 |	We need to adjust
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:28,768	| IOT141 |	Okay well let's dig into that you took my Segway right away from me I love it so
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,304	| IOT141 |	Let's talk about why
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,608	| IOT141 |	Iot is different from it
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:34,144	| IOT141 |	So the first
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:35,936	| IOT141 |	Singing it recognizes via connecting
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,240	| IOT141 |	Assistance

EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:47,456	| IOT141 |	Not being the 30 of IT department
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:49,504	| IOT141 |	The first step to even connect
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,272	| IOT141 |	A physic

EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:49,056	| IOT141 |	Huge number of

EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:07,999	| IOT141 |	It does not corporate headquarters what's happening at the branches at the retail stores at the factories
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:11,583	| IOT141 |	So git Department which is almost all decentralized
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,351	| IOT141 |	Does not
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,399	| IOT141 |	Vicky see the tangible benefits
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:16,191	| IOT141 |	In front of them so they often

EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,519	| IOT141 |	Visible to them and their bosses
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:23,359	| IOT141 |	Okay and this reminds me of life back in
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:29,759	| IOT141 |	Kind of the late 90s maybe the early aughts when I T was very siloed
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:31,295	| IOT141 |	A lot of integration work
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,599	| IOT141 |	You know life was just a lot harder
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:38,719	| IOT141 |	And there was debate over should ITP centralized cost center all of these fun thing
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,535	| IOT141 |	And cloud computing came and changed
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:44,607	| IOT141 |	A lot of that as did like the SAS software model
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,375	| IOT141 |	So
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:51,775	| IOT141 |	Right now a lot of solutions are coming onto the market with the same as more modern biz
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:53,567	| IOT141 |	Business models attached in
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,615	| IOT141 |	The ROI that you're talking about
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:43:01,503	| IOT141 |	Should we be going back in time or should we be trying to bring the standards and everything
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:02,271	| IOT141 |	Up to
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,295	| IOT141 |	Modern times
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:05,599	| IOT141 |	Interesting
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,879	| IOT141 |	Change which has happened in
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,671	| IOT141 |	Assassin bug

EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:13,279	| IOT141 |	Because you started making a lot of
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,815	| IOT141 |	Purchasing decisions without doing
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:18,143	| IOT141 |	So what we are seeing is
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:21,983	| IOT141 |	Is it Department actually have been outsourced to shrink in size
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:24,287	| IOT141 |	Because bedroll is much more Gemini's for likes
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,847	| IOT141 |	Boston Market
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:28,639	| IOT141 |	The weather in managed by

EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:33,503	| IOT141 |	The organization that she much smaller than the 90
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,527	| IOT141 |	And then on top of
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,551	| IOT141 |	Dad security
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:38,367	| IOT141 |	Beaches in opposite of existential dread
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| IOT141 |	Have kept them so busy.
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:42,975	| IOT141 |	This new project quality.
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:43,999	| IOT141 |	Doesn't get
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:45,023	| IOT141 |	Supported deserves
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,303	| IOT141 |	And then
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,071	| IOT141 |	Some organization
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:48,607	| IOT141 |	Utica College
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:51,935	| IOT141 |	When we actually interview simatai
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,447	| IOT141 |	Videos
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:54,239	| IOT141 |	We find it actually busy

EDL	00:43:55,519	00:43:56,287	| IOT141 |	Did you have this
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:43:57,311	| IOT141 |	You have this you understand

EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:04,991	| IOT141 |	Are people and projects really under them of any
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:06,271	| IOT141 |	Size 2 actually
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:09,855	| IOT141 |	Execute project early strategies for trying to advise
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:16,255	| IOT141 |	Golden seals on how they should think about the future a future of digital start writing what we find is this

EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:18,815	| IOT141 |	Challenge
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,119	| IOT141 |	Really
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,399	| IOT141 |	Global mindset
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,935	| IOT141 |	A longer-term Roi
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,471	| IOT141 |	He's not getting
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,007	| IOT141 |	The attention it deserves
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,031	| IOT141 |	And hence

EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,759	| IOT141 |	Digitize their leg
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:40,575	| IOT141 |	OSIM retail store in California decides to

EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,071	| IOT141 |	Reasons for doing this
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,607	| IOT141 |	Corporate headquarters
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:55,935	| IOT141 |	Not as engaged let's do it
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:56,959	| IOT141 |	Blank slate
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:45:00,287	| IOT141 |	I am a company that wants to get this right or maybe
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:04,127	| IOT141 |	Uno's Viera
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:07,967	| IOT141 |	Or a big company for the description look like
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:10,783	| IOT141 |	What was the organization who handles iot
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:14,111	| IOT141 |	I don't know what the title should be but
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:16,415	| IOT141 |	Should be an individual who
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,695	| IOT141 |	Is butter
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,463	| IOT141 |	Senseless
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,743	| IOT141 |	Carpet function notable
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:24,863	| IOT141 |	And this person needs to have an organization p&l which allows them to
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,655	| IOT141 |	Deploy
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:29,727	| IOT141 |	This obviously this individual event have to be Matrix
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:32,287	| IOT141 |	To the be used because the Auto I
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:34,591	| IOT141 |	From iot benefits
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,359	| IOT141 |	Business units
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:39,199	| IOT141 |	So they need to work closely with beans they need to work with it Department because
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:41,759	| IOT141 |	The date of each comes out of iot have students
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:46,623	| IOT141 |	So this individual does have the challenge of having
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:48,415	| IOT141 |	Organizational
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:50,207	| IOT141 |	Liters to make this happen
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:52,255	| IOT141 |	But this individual needs to be a stand
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:54,815	| IOT141 |	Leader who reports into
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:56,863	| IOT141 |	Levels of organization
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:45:59,935	| IOT141 |	The second point is they need to have the
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:02,751	| IOT141 |	Flexibility of longer-term Roi
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:05,567	| IOT141 |	Given the mandate to
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:07,103	| IOT141 |	Sun experiments which have
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,383	| IOT141 |	Five-year-old device
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:12,735	| IOT141 |	So that they can actually deploy these yet
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:15,295	| IOT141 |	Because the labor and the Catholics required
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:15,807	| IOT141 |	To make this book
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:21,183	| IOT141 |	Is that because everyone no one else is going to do it because they
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:23,743	| IOT141 |	Demon Cycles
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:25,535	| IOT141 |	It companies which actually exist
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,815	| IOT141 |	Because this I going to benefit
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,863	| IOT141 |	It's a bit like her Amazon
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:29,887	| IOT141 |	Building Warehouse
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,935	| IOT141 |	It's a little bit more like that
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:35,007	| IOT141 |	Think about how did the world look in 2025 in water
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:35,775	| IOT141 |	Investments
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:40,127	| IOT141 |	It's competitive advantage and I think that's the mindset of an iot
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:41,151	| IOT141 |	Key project
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,431	| IOT141 |	What's the ROI in the next 18
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:44,223	| IOT141 |	The last point I think
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:46,527	| IOT141 |	To put some of this problem back to the
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:47,551	| IOT141 |	This applies to vendors
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,623	| IOT141 |	I think to get send you can find supplies for wedding
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,927	| IOT141 |	To the deployment
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:53,951	| IOT141 |	Education and
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:54,975	| IOT141 |	Mention the software
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:59,839	| IOT141 |	Subscription monthly basis I think that's a better relationship than trying
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:01,887	| IOT141 |	Shifted out the deployment
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:03,679	| IOT141 |	Bead installation
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:10,335	| IOT141 |	A more complex deployment environment
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:13,407	| IOT141 |	And how do you think they should handle the local asp
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,455	| IOT141 |	If I'm at the edge
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:18,015	| IOT141 |	I have a business how do I
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:24,415	| IOT141 |	Report back to this digital officer
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:24,927	| IOT141 |	Push project
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:27,487	| IOT141 |	Yes I'll give you a real example of
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:30,303	| IOT141 |	Just to make this year Leslie back to come
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:34,143	| IOT141 |	LED control Solutions and direct selling
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,167	| IOT141 |	Beihai quality
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:36,191	| IOT141 |	Solutions to
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:38,751	| IOT141 |	Taxis in New Hampshire
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,287	| IOT141 |	North Carolina's and
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,311	| IOT141 |	What they found was
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,591	| IOT141 |	Stanton local
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:44,639	| IOT141 |	Facilities manager
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:46,431	| IOT141 |	Because their budgets were highly.
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,199	| IOT141 |	Localized
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:48,223	| IOT141 |	MP3
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:49,503	| IOT141 |	Monitoring them against
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:50,527	| IOT141 |	The cheapest solution
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:53,343	| IOT141 |	Chinese supplier
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:55,391	| IOT141 |	Width of a Sharpie back because the
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:56,671	| IOT141 |	The building facilities
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:04,095	| IOT141 |	Incentive was to just control an annual budget Evernote thinking about strategic benefits to the
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:04,863	| IOT141 |	Headquarters
EDL	00:48:07,167	00:48:07,935	| IOT141 |	Budget Inn
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:08,959	| IOT141 |	Incentivization
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:11,263	| IOT141 |	And so the way.
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,031	| IOT141 |	Connect the edge
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:14,591	| IOT141 |	Actually tell the building
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:16,639	| IOT141 |	Facilities managers
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:17,407	| IOT141 |	That's
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:18,687	| IOT141 |	Ubud dog shelter
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:19,967	| IOT141 |	Solutionreach
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:21,759	| IOT141 |	Which is not just about the cheapest
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:22,527	| IOT141 |	Dissolution
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:25,087	| IOT141 |	Light up your buildings but which actually gets you act
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,111	| IOT141 |	The data and then
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,415	| IOT141 |	40
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:29,951	| IOT141 |	Which can be used to run this
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:30,463	| IOT141 |	Back to you
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,767	| IOT141 |	Weather for the next 5 to 10 years
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:35,071	| IOT141 |	Do that then
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:36,351	| IOT141 |	Given the budget
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:40,191	| IOT141 |	As I said in a 5-year fashion Nova
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:43,263	| IOT141 |	So the local managers with it
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,311	| IOT141 |	Retail store manager
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:47,871	| IOT141 |	And at your local hardware store
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:48,895	| IOT141 |	Local Target
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:50,687	| IOT141 |	Needs to be
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:51,967	| IOT141 |	Wendy
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,735	| IOT141 |	Securing lights
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:53,247	| IOT141 |	Example
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,295	| IOT141 |	Cameras in their stores
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:56,319	| IOT141 |	Dania
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:58,623	| IOT141 |	HQ
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:01,183	| IOT141 |	Did you sell right now.
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:01,695	| IOT141 |	Is not the case
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:03,999	| IOT141 |	Today incentives have to be aligned
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:07,839	| IOT141 |	They have to be the largest for doing the right thing for the corporation not just for the
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:14,239	| IOT141 |	Got it okay and all this sounds really complicated so what are the first steps
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:17,823	| IOT141 |	A company that wants to benefit from a digital transformation
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:22,687	| IOT141 |	Should I just like fire this CDO person should they what do you do if you want to get to the
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:25,759	| IOT141 |	So I think the only time of year
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:26,783	| IOT141 |	Scene Solutions
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:28,319	| IOT141 |	Coyote sightings
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,855	| IOT141 |	Ian has been where
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:32,159	| IOT141 |	The CEOs organization has
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:35,743	| IOT141 |	But we made the decision that they're going to transform the organization
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:38,303	| IOT141 |	Digitized dog medication and twin
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:39,839	| IOT141 |	And they going to
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:41,375	| IOT141 |	Footaction
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:43,935	| IOT141 |	Resources to go to the first step in my opinion
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:45,471	| IOT141 |	It's not the title
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:46,495	| IOT141 |	It's basically putting
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:47,007	| IOT141 |	Somebody
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:48,799	| IOT141 |	6 + 2
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:50,591	| IOT141 |	The CEO and the CFO
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,383	| IOT141 |	On this project
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:53,151	| IOT141 |	And then
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:53,919	| IOT141 |	Give them
EDL	00:49:55,455	00:49:56,223	| IOT141 |	Elegance
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:57,503	| IOT141 |	Environment
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:59,039	| IOT141 |	Franchisee
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:00,319	| IOT141 |	Like pasta
EDL	00:50:01,087	00:50:03,135	| IOT141 |	Where is very hard for example
EDL	00:50:03,135	00:50:05,439	| IOT141 |	4 corporate headquarters to tell franchises
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:11,583	| IOT141 |	What to do in DC this in McDonald's and hotel chains where even though otherwise way clear franchises
EDL	00:50:12,095	00:50:16,191	| IOT141 |	Which effectively on this hotels and restaurants have no incentive to spend money
EDL	00:50:16,191	00:50:19,519	| IOT141 |	Different than where the
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:20,799	| IOT141 |	Crunches actually
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:23,615	| IOT141 |	Bullion by headquarters of the organisation structure
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:24,383	| IOT141 |	The difference
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:25,407	| IOT141 |	I think Sanchez
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:29,759	| IOT141 |	Completely on the accident.
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:30,527	| IOT141 |	The edge of your neck
EDL	00:50:33,343	00:50:35,135	| IOT141 |	Like useful so that would be nice
EDL	00:50:37,695	00:50:38,719	| IOT141 |	Genovesi
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:39,999	| IOT141 |	The second thing you would do
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:40,767	| IOT141 |	My technician
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:44,351	| IOT141 |	By the ocean and tricycles everyday
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:45,631	| IOT141 |	Addition problem
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:47,167	| IOT141 |	Pick one use case with
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:48,191	| IOT141 |	Chinese food
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:49,983	| IOT141 |	Could be security could be
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:51,263	| IOT141 |	Predictive maintenance
EDL	00:50:51,263	00:50:52,031	| IOT141 |	Could be
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:53,823	| IOT141 |	Customer satisfaction
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:58,175	| IOT141 |	Just pick one and just run with it on a national level
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:51:01,759	| IOT141 |	Opposed to trying to sell security maintenance customer happiness
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:04,831	| IOT141 |	Everything in one massive project
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:05,599	| IOT141 |	I would try to
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,367	| IOT141 |	To just run
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:09,183	| IOT141 |	One single use case with the base year value
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:11,487	| IOT141 |	Across the country
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:13,279	| IOT141 |	And then once
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:14,047	| IOT141 |	Stats exceed
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:15,071	| IOT141 |	Send
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:17,119	| IOT141 |	One by one
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:18,399	| IOT141 |	Alright Island
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:20,703	| IOT141 |	If I am evaluating
EDL	00:51:20,703	00:51:26,847	| IOT141 |	Project so let's say I put the infrastructure in place to actually do this
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:30,175	| IOT141 |	What kind of projects tend to generate
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,711	| IOT141 |	The most value
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:33,503	| IOT141 |	I think
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:37,855	| IOT141 |	The team switched into Jen has the most strikeouts at least tangible value tenths
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:38,623	| IOT141 |	To be
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:39,391	| IOT141 |	I would say
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:41,695	| IOT141 |	Operational effectiveness and labor count
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:43,743	| IOT141 |	Labor productivity basic
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:45,535	| IOT141 |	Please show if you can get more work
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:47,583	| IOT141 |	Square foot of space
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:50,399	| IOT141 |	In a factory on the retail store
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:51,679	| IOT141 |	You can sell mortgages
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:53,727	| IOT141 |	Inside Fry's Electronics
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:56,543	| IOT141 |	Private lesson number in Plaistow Central
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:58,079	| IOT141 |	Get the quickest
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:51:58,591	| IOT141 |	Feedback

EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:00,639	| IOT141 |	Feedback
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:03,455	| IOT141 |	English basically makes
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:05,247	| IOT141 |	What Cosmo Collective inside
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:06,015	| IOT141 |	Building
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:08,063	| IOT141 |	Car and get more work done
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:10,879	| IOT141 |	I think those would be what I call low hanging fruit
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:12,927	| IOT141 |	The next one I would say
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:15,487	| IOT141 |	I would say predictive maintenance
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:16,767	| IOT141 |	Trying to figure
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:17,791	| IOT141 |	Phone sin
EDL	00:52:17,791	00:52:21,631	| IOT141 |	Environments before they happen so that you don't have to spend enormous money

EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:26,495	| IOT141 |	Would be the second level
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:29,567	| IOT141 |	Customer happiness and satisfaction tents
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:30,079	| IOT141 |	To be
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:32,127	| IOT141 |	More intangible and takes longer
EDL	00:52:32,127	00:52:34,687	| IOT141 |	Trying to figure out
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:36,735	| IOT141 |	Shareholder value
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:38,783	| IOT141 |	I just lost project to standard
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:40,319	| IOT141 |	This would not be my first phone
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:43,647	| IOT141 |	Productivity
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:47,743	| IOT141 |	Magnifica facility optimization as my first project
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:51,327	| IOT141 |	This is in line with your long-term vision
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:54,399	| IOT141 |	And where do you think things like sustainability
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:59,519	| IOT141 |	Set in because I think iot has a lot of it offers a lot of benefits from
EDL	00:53:00,031	00:53:02,591	| IOT141 |	Inefficiency standpoint and that goes all the way
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:03,871	| IOT141 |	Through two things like

EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:13,599	| IOT141 |	Chill
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:17,183	| IOT141 |	When were talking about the big picture and digital transfer
EDL	00:53:17,183	00:53:21,279	| IOT141 |	Formations when do we go or should we go beyond Roi and talk about others
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:24,095	| IOT141 |	I discussed this the Lord you know
EDL	00:53:24,607	00:53:25,887	| IOT141 |	If I was building a brand new
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:26,399	| IOT141 |	New house
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:30,239	| IOT141 |	If I was buying a brand new car most likely
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:34,847	| IOT141 |	Has all the features but if I have an old home or a legacy
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:36,639	| IOT141 |	Sikar trying to connect everything
EDL	00:53:36,639	00:53:39,711	| IOT141 |	Which is an expensive proposition so I actually make
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:41,503	| IOT141 |	Brownfield sites
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:44,319	| IOT141 |	Science groundskeeping Legacy environment
EDL	00:53:44,831	00:53:46,367	| IOT141 |	I think there's a notch
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:47,903	| IOT141 |	You cannot Transformer Lego
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:50,463	| IOT141 |	Legacy environment where tens and thousands of years of
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:53,023	| IOT141 |	Legacy Investments have gone in
EDL	00:53:54,815	00:53:57,119	| IOT141 |	Facility training efficient environment
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:58,399	| IOT141 |	What you trying to do is
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:53:59,679	| IOT141 |	Make it more efficient
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:05,311	| IOT141 |	ICD-10 sustainability value prop in an old facility is going to be tough
EDL	00:54:06,079	00:54:07,871	| IOT141 |	On the other hand if I'm building a new fact
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:08,895	| IOT141 |	Can you retest
EDL	00:54:09,407	00:54:11,711	| IOT141 |	Anything's a new healthcare facility
EDL	00:54:13,503	00:54:16,319	| IOT141 |	Look for Latina Platinum LED environment
EDL	00:54:16,319	00:54:17,087	| IOT141 |	Idiot
EDL	00:54:17,087	00:54:18,367	| IOT141 |	Try to make it out
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:19,903	| IOT141 |	Sustainable as I could
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:20,927	| IOT141 |	Because I have the ability
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:24,511	| IOT141 |	Do that fresh and the interesting thing which I learned
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:25,535	| IOT141 |	In my thoughts
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:27,583	| IOT141 |	Construction engineer
EDL	00:54:27,583	00:54:28,351	| IOT141 |	What I found was
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:31,935	| IOT141 |	Six buildings against
EDL	00:54:31,935	00:54:32,703	| IOT141 |	Earthquakes
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:34,751	| IOT141 |	In the mid-nineties in California
EDL	00:54:35,263	00:54:36,799	| IOT141 |	And what I found was
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:37,311	| IOT141 |	Fixing a
EDL	00:54:38,847	00:54:39,359	| IOT141 |	Building
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:44,479	| IOT141 |	Making it earthquake compliant is far more expensive on a per square foot
EDL	00:54:44,479	00:54:46,271	| IOT141 |	Good bases and to build a new
EDL	00:54:46,271	00:54:48,319	| IOT141 |	Building from sky so I actually worked in
EDL	00:54:48,831	00:54:50,111	| IOT141 |	Old Hospital building
EDL	00:54:50,111	00:54:50,879	| IOT141 |	Does Kaiser
EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:52,671	| IOT141 |	Permanente
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:53,695	| IOT141 |	Design new Kaiser
EDL	00:54:54,975	00:54:56,511	| IOT141 |	And on the square foot
EDL	00:54:57,791	00:54:58,815	| IOT141 |	Dimension index
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:54:59,327	| IOT141 |	Environment
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:02,143	| IOT141 |	Without dislocating the employees in the
EDL	00:55:02,143	00:55:03,423	| IOT141 |	What is inside the building
EDL	00:55:03,935	00:55:04,959	| IOT141 |	And thinking in
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:05,983	| IOT141 |	That building up to
EDL	00:55:05,983	00:55:07,775	| IOT141 |	Who was Far farmer
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:08,799	| IOT141 |	Expensive
EDL	00:55:09,311	00:55:14,687	| IOT141 |	On the first page footage faces and a new building
EDL	00:55:14,687	00:55:15,199	| IOT141 |	UA test
EDL	00:55:15,967	00:55:18,015	| IOT141 |	The cost of doing that is going to be much more expensive
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:20,575	| IOT141 |	And that's what we say
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:22,623	| IOT141 |	Nrt2
EDL	00:55:23,135	00:55:24,671	| IOT141 |	Retrofit and exist
EDL	00:55:24,671	00:55:25,695	| IOT141 |	Sing environment
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:26,207	| IOT141 |	Space pen
EDL	00:55:26,975	00:55:28,255	| IOT141 |	But you must sometimes do that
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:31,839	| IOT141 |	To conceive
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:32,351	| IOT141 |	A blank
EDL	00:55:33,631	00:55:34,143	| IOT141 |	Looky looky
EDL	00:55:34,655	00:55:35,679	| IOT141 |	All my new car
EDL	00:55:35,679	00:55:36,959	| IOT141 |	Construction in online USA
EDL	00:55:37,471	00:55:39,775	| IOT141 |	Kylie digitize Hialeah
EDL	00:55:40,287	00:55:42,591	| IOT141 |	Invested 20 years bag
EDL	00:55:43,103	00:55:45,919	| IOT141 |	I can only be selectively able to do that
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:47,199	| IOT141 |	Okay
EDL	00:55:47,199	00:55:50,271	| IOT141 |	Be the most optimistic note to end on
EDL	00:55:50,271	00:55:52,063	| IOT141 |	But I think it's a good one
EDL	00:55:52,063	00:55:56,927	| IOT141 |	And maybe you'll come back sometime and talk about how to change that how do we deal with Brownfield
EDL	00:55:56,927	00:56:00,255	| IOT141 |	So much for coming on the show this week
EDL	00:56:02,559	00:56:08,959	| IOT141 |	That's all for this week's Internet of Things podcast remember if you want more iot news please sign
