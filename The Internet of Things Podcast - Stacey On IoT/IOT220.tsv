EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,376	| IOT220 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:45,888	| IOT220 |	Well
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,936	| IOT220 |	Get started we've got
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,264	| IOT220 |	A couple big stories happening this week first I'm going to
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,544	| IOT220 |	I'll start off with the
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:54,080	| IOT220 |	Hacking of the US
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:56,128	| IOT220 |	Customs and Border Patrol database
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:59,200	| IOT220 |	Partially because here I am in Canada this week
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,528	| IOT220 |	As I was walking through customs in Montreal I was like
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,344	| IOT220 |	I wonder if my photo
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| IOT220 |	And it is
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,416	| IOT220 |	It is
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,464	| IOT220 |	In front of the little
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| IOT220 |	Passport machine in it
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| IOT220 |	So I guess we should start with the story
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,144	| IOT220 |	Do you want to tell us what's going on yes yes
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:20,192	| IOT220 |	Well you are a way out of the country
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,984	| IOT220 |	Apparently
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:25,056	| IOT220 |	The Customs and Border Protection Agency
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,336	| IOT220 |	Which had stored
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,920	| IOT220 |	Restoring images of Travelers in license plates
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:33,760	| IOT220 |	Nearest tens of thousands of those images I don't know exactly how many yet
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| IOT220 |	Basically hacked
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,344	| IOT220 |	Us
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:40,672	| IOT220 |	Government reportedly says no more than a hundred thousand people had their
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,696	| IOT220 |	Compromise
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| IOT220 |	The way this
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,768	| IOT220 |	Hackworth it wasn't
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,304	| IOT220 |	Customs and Border Protection
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,352	| IOT220 |	Self which has the data
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,192	| IOT220 |	Contractor subcontractor
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| IOT220 |	That works
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:57,312	| IOT220 |	For the CDP transfer copies of images
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,336	| IOT220 |	And that Network
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,360	| IOT220 |	Was hacking
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:03,456	| IOT220 |	They're not supposed to be actually transferring was images
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| IOT220 |	2
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,760	| IOT220 |	So that's the story
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:08,320	| IOT220 |	But it was too much larger questions about
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,856	| IOT220 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,880	| IOT220 |	But lots of things
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,928	| IOT220 |	So this is actually very similar Sony
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:16,768	| IOT220 |	The big Sony hack from a couple years ago happen the same way it was a third-party contractor
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,559	| IOT220 |	Which first off
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,863	| IOT220 |	Everybody who's Gathering anytime
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,191	| IOT220 |	Consumers
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,519	| IOT220 |	You should be evaluating your third-party contractors
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,031	| IOT220 |	Security practice
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,823	| IOT220 |	Like as much as your own
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,871	| IOT220 |	So we'll just get that out of the way
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,431	| IOT220 |	Now let's talk about the
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| IOT220 |	The second aspect
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,479	| IOT220 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,247	| IOT220 |	Tissue
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,295	| IOT220 |	So this is disturbing for a cup
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:39,807	| IOT220 |	Couple of reasons
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,599	| IOT220 |	1
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,391	| IOT220 |	The US government has been
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,671	| IOT220 |	Using facial rash
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,463	| IOT220 |	Definition in pulling this data
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,743	| IOT220 |	Without really talking
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,023	| IOT220 |	People about
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:49,535	| IOT220 |	How is being
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,583	| IOT220 |	It even gives Airlines
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| IOT220 |	Access to this data
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| IOT220 |	If they want
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,679	| IOT220 |	So there's been a lot of
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,727	| IOT220 |	Controversy right now
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,495	| IOT220 |	About
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,775	| IOT220 |	How people are using
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| IOT220 |	Image data
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,335	| IOT220 |	And facial
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,103	| IOT220 |	Recognition
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,151	| IOT220 |	Without talking to people about how they
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:09,503	| IOT220 |	I think the underscore your point it was only a few months ago
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,831	| IOT220 |	Everybody was up in arms when some people wore
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:16,159	| IOT220 |	Going to flights at US airports that was an artist
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,183	| IOT220 |	These little cameras
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,719	| IOT220 |	And there was no
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,999	| IOT220 |	Knowledge
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:23,583	| IOT220 |	Which is there and say What are you do at that point decide not to go on your flight
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,375	| IOT220 |	Because you want to review
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,447	| IOT220 |	The terms and conditions
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,007	| IOT220 |	First you check and make sure it's not a
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:36,639	| IOT220 |	Boeing Max 770 or whatever that was a butt second yeah you check and see if
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,943	| IOT220 |	Your picture there
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:44,831	| IOT220 |	It's very quiet that's a thing I guess you said this not being discussed at least
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,391	| IOT220 |	In China we know this is all happening at maybe
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,671	| IOT220 |	I would imagine the Chinese
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,999	| IOT220 |	And they're Building Services on it
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,303	| IOT220 |	Their advertising services
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,583	| IOT220 |	Right here it is
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,119	| IOT220 |	It's a little bit more clandestine
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:00,703	| IOT220 |	There's also no consent happening
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,287	| IOT220 |	The frustrating thing is what happens when it says haxo now
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,567	| IOT220 |	People have
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| IOT220 |	Picture
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,919	| IOT220 |	Disassociated very accurate
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,199	| IOT220 |	What's my name
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| IOT220 |	So accurately enough for
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,319	| IOT220 |	I used Tabitha expression is good enough
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,415	| IOT220 |	Which usually means it's not
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,719	| IOT220 |	I I don't know if I should rethink that
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,511	| IOT220 |	Particular era
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,583	| IOT220 |	So they have access to this
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:32,703	| IOT220 |	I don't know it talks about license plate government also has a lot of biomass
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,263	| IOT220 |	Didn't they have my fingerprint data for example is part of
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,799	| IOT220 |	Customs and Border
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:39,615	| IOT220 |	Protection agency has my fingerprint data is part of the
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:41,151	| IOT220 |	Nexus global entry program
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:45,503	| IOT220 |	Is that kind of information gets hacked and suddenly people have a way to
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,295	| IOT220 |	Possibly
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,599	| IOT220 |	Access things that it in the physical
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:54,207	| IOT220 |	And as we start moving to biometric
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,231	| IOT220 |	Authenticators
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,743	| IOT220 |	That's a given
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:59,071	| IOT220 |	Strangers easy access to ways to
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,351	| IOT220 |	Get into
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| IOT220 |	Any number of other people
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,679	| IOT220 |	Tails or
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,215	| IOT220 |	Homes or that's what
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,263	| IOT220 |	I hate to ask this question
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,079	| IOT220 |	Cuz I only want to think about the answer but
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,151	| IOT220 |	Longer here in the US do you think it will be
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,199	| IOT220 |	Before it's more like what China does
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,479	| IOT220 |	Today in terms of
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,015	| IOT220 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,807	| IOT220 |	The newsletter
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,087	| IOT220 |	A week or two ago
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:25,439	| IOT220 |	There was a great video about being in China what it's like to be there if you're not a citizen maybe you're
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,487	| IOT220 |	Startup company Oregon Shenzhen
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,839	| IOT220 |	And one of the guys who's from Australia for some companies building
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,887	| IOT220 |	Digital ski coach
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| IOT220 |	Products
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| IOT220 |	DJ walkzz
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,215	| IOT220 |	The camera caught him
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,263	| IOT220 |	In 20 seconds he got his ticket
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,055	| IOT220 |	Over WeChat
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,335	| IOT220 |	And because I have funds in WeChat
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,151	| IOT220 |	The ticket was safe for me to take it out
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,943	| IOT220 |	He's not even a Chinese citizen
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,455	| IOT220 |	Lesbian China
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,759	| IOT220 |	How long before we get there
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,295	| IOT220 |	Because I think we're going to
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,855	| IOT220 |	I want to be
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| IOT220 |	Especially about that
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,439	| IOT220 |	Is
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,487	| IOT220 |	I think we could be there very cool
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| IOT220 |	I think we won't get there
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:04,863	| IOT220 |	From a practical standpoint because there would be less
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,399	| IOT220 |	Lawsuit over things like that
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,679	| IOT220 |	But the
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,703	| IOT220 |	Larger issue
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,239	| IOT220 |	In one that's inherently about
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,519	| IOT220 |	Fairness is
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| IOT220 |	If you have
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,103	| IOT220 |	This automated Eye in the Sky the
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,639	| IOT220 |	Can enforce every law
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| IOT220 |	Right so see if someone's jaywalker
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| IOT220 |	And then enforce them
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,807	| IOT220 |	If it's automated it creates a much more fair
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| IOT220 |	Society
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,367	| IOT220 |	In the sense that
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,927	| IOT220 |	Right now predominantly African-American
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,999	| IOT220 |	Please. Them as opposed
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,047	| IOT220 |	And
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| IOT220 |	The question that makes
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,167	| IOT220 |	What laws does a society decide to add
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| IOT220 |	X-Force
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,959	| IOT220 |	If you're going to have it
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,239	| IOT220 |	Art by autumn
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,055	| IOT220 |	Right where it applies to everybody regardless
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,823	| IOT220 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,615	| IOT220 |	You know it's true
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,175	| IOT220 |	There's pros and cons of ultimately
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,967	| IOT220 |	Knee-jerk reaction is woke that is
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:58,111	| IOT220 |	We also then took a hard look at the laws that we want
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,391	| IOT220 |	Force or the out
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,439	| IOT220 |	Comes we would like to see from those laws
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,231	| IOT220 |	We might actually be able to
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,023	| IOT220 |	Make a more fair Society
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,447	| IOT220 |	Alright Lizzie and speaking of
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,983	| IOT220 |	Enforcement
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,007	| IOT220 |	And facial
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,519	| IOT220 |	Rescue Mission
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| IOT220 |	You came across the pretty
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| IOT220 |	Creepy story
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:24,479	| IOT220 |	I did and it's about a new set of smart glasses
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,759	| IOT220 |	American company
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,039	| IOT220 |	Music switch
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:29,855	| IOT220 |	Almost every year at CVS I see some new
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,927	| IOT220 |	Products from them in this space but I've never really
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,975	| IOT220 |	Bible come to Market
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,535	| IOT220 |	And I'm really hoping this one doesn't but unfortunately
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,559	| IOT220 |	Looks like it is
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,351	| IOT220 |	They are making
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,119	| IOT220 |	Smart glasses
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| IOT220 |	That works on
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:46,751	| IOT220 |	Basic software and services from a dubai-based firm
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,775	| IOT220 |	Call nntc
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,079	| IOT220 |	INTC
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,127	| IOT220 |	Facial recognition algorithms
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,711	| IOT220 |	Megapixel camera and glasses
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,015	| IOT220 |	Where these and scan faces
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| IOT220 |	Krowd
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| IOT220 |	Data is compared against
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:04,927	| IOT220 |	A database of 1 million images and literally
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:08,255	| IOT220 |	These things can detect 15 pieces per frame
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| IOT220 |	Second
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| IOT220 |	Dirty Clippers
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,863	| IOT220 |	Yeah so you can you can scan through
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,679	| IOT220 |	A crowd to find maybe a suspect.
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,471	| IOT220 |	Something safe your police which it is
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,263	| IOT220 |	What I think they are starting to
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| IOT220 |	Target PS4
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,359	| IOT220 |	And I know that in China going back to that they do have some
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:23,871	| IOT220 |	Something similar
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:27,711	| IOT220 |	To these we don't hear in the US but I think we might soon
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,735	| IOT220 |	I don't know yet
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,039	| IOT220 |	50 pairs produce
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:31,551	| IOT220 |	So
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,599	| IOT220 |	It's not like these are mass-produced
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,927	| IOT220 |	I could see some places
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| IOT220 |	Imagine the scene you said like a
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,255	| IOT220 |	Protest
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,047	| IOT220 |	That would be Beyond Scared
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,863	| IOT220 |	It's just in your lawn
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,375	| IOT220 |	Is right now
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| IOT220 |	People's Facebook pages
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,471	| IOT220 |	To see where they are
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:54,847	| IOT220 |	And there are a lot of places like I remember me now going through London a couple years back there's cameras everywhere
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,383	| IOT220 |	So there are tons of like
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,919	| IOT220 |	Closed-circuit cameras
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,431	| IOT220 |	Various
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,967	| IOT220 |	Countries and regions
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,247	| IOT220 |	Where is
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:05,087	| IOT220 |	They can apply facial recognition algorithms to the date of there so it's not like
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,879	| IOT220 |	This is new what's new about it
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,671	| IOT220 |	Right
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,439	| IOT220 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:12,255	| IOT220 |	And imagine being able to hack into
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,791	| IOT220 |	Biometric data
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| IOT220 |	For example
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,631	| IOT220 |	Imagine being able to not just hack into it but maybe
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,679	| IOT220 |	Hack into the system in
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,447	| IOT220 |	Change that data
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| IOT220 |	Suddenly
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,495	| IOT220 |	You have this
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:24,287	| IOT220 |	Hey

EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:41,087	| IOT220 |	The story that we listen to work
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,879	| IOT220 |	You know there's likely to be
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| IOT220 |	Feeling pressure and stress
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,439	| IOT220 |	So
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,255	| IOT220 |	You know you you start advertising something at work distressing

EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,911	| IOT220 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:13:00,031	| IOT220 |	Tighten a couple weeks ago Amazon the news came out
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,847	| IOT220 |	Just playing around
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,639	| IOT220 |	Wrist-worn wearable that would track
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,663	| IOT220 |	People's moods
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,687	| IOT220 |	Impossibly
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,991	| IOT220 |	Some of the theories were like oh yeah
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,783	| IOT220 |	Maybe we could help people interact
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:11,807	| IOT220 |	With other people
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,599	| IOT220 |	More social
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,135	| IOT220 |	I think I should like this idea
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| IOT220 |	Discover that what they do with it
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,487	| IOT220 |	I would be thrilled if my digital assistant
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,791	| IOT220 |	Read my moon that way cuz
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| IOT220 |	DOT cameras it's not that invasive if you know
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,191	| IOT220 |	What if your mood was
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| IOT220 |	Well
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| IOT220 |	They would know what music you're playing
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,895	| IOT220 |	I would know to do the lights
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,175	| IOT220 |	That I'm like
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT220 |	Pair
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,295	| IOT220 |	There's a lot of movies like
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:46,623	| IOT220 |	Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood I don't even tell my family cuz I'm like
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:49,695	| IOT220 |	Sometimes you know when you're like pouting or really salty
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| IOT220 |	You like I know I should not
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:59,423	| IOT220 |	Don't talk to Mom anime says she's in a bad mood I don't really want people to know I'm having a temper tantrum
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,447	| IOT220 |	Cuz that is not cool
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,495	| IOT220 |	Close to my family does know anyway but
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,519	| IOT220 |	But still
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:08,383	| IOT220 |	So I don't trust any of these companies enough to give them that
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:11,199	| IOT220 |	Kind of level data even if it does make my home
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,967	| IOT220 |	A better place
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,527	| IOT220 |	I think I'm willing to draw the line
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,295	| IOT220 |	Emotional survey
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,087	| IOT220 |	I don't know where Kevin Skinner
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,135	| IOT220 |	Maybe we'll hit it maybe we will
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:22,463	| IOT220 |	I don't have many rides that I won't cry so
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:29,375	| IOT220 |	Just cuz I like to try things and learn about vacations of upsetting what the value is for the cost song
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,679	| IOT220 |	If they said that we do have this product
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,287	| IOT220 |	Thatcher open
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:39,103	| IOT220 |	So which beta the new Facebook portal
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,711	| IOT220 |	I didn't even pay the old ones cuz I won't touch those
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,039	| IOT220 |	This is this is curious so did
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,551	| IOT220 |	Did you draw the line
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,599	| IOT220 |	Facebook did you drive
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:56,511	| IOT220 |	No it's result video chat I mean I video chat with my son almost everyday
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,535	| IOT220 |	We video chat
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,607	| IOT220 |	You and I do video chat sometimes
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,423	| IOT220 |	I am always wonderful
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,519	| IOT220 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:11,359	| IOT220 |	No I get utility out of video chatting without a doubt
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| IOT220 |	But
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,687	| IOT220 |	I don't need to use Facebook's platforms
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| IOT220 |	Do so and
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,503	| IOT220 |	Get what I need
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| IOT220 |	From them
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:21,599	| IOT220 |	If I use their platform so why bother is my taken
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,975	| IOT220 |	I know there's people that bought this thing I've never seen them
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,023	| IOT220 |	There's a there's a market for it
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,071	| IOT220 |	Certain people I'm just not one of them
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,607	| IOT220 |	Bring in another
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| IOT220 |	Stories
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,655	| IOT220 |	There is a story
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT220 |	About
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| IOT220 |	AI
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:39,007	| IOT220 |	Recognizing Common Place household objects
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| IOT220 |	Looks like soapstone
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,799	| IOT220 |	Vision
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:45,663	| IOT220 |	And I was thinking about old Facebook would love to know like the products in my
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:50,527	| IOT220 |	Amazon Echo Show has lots of products
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:53,343	| IOT220 |	Yeah I don't know if it's pulling that data
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,111	| IOT220 |	So
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,415	| IOT220 |	This particular story was about how
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,999	| IOT220 |	They are much better at recognizing
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,279	| IOT220 |	Things from
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,863	| IOT220 |	First World countries basically so if you're in a poor country with
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,143	| IOT220 |	Generic for people soap
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:08,959	| IOT220 |	Bransford
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,495	| IOT220 |	African country
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:14,591	| IOT220 |	Heyde Eye doesn't recognize those because the engineers usually
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,735	| IOT220 |	Yeah they need to expand the model
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,527	| IOT220 |	With these other products that teach it
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:26,623	| IOT220 |	So it's going to be there
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,159	| IOT220 |	The Blind Side
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:32,255	| IOT220 |	You know it's at I don't think I don't think that are
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,303	| IOT220 |	They're trying to get the most bang for buck here
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:34,815	| IOT220 |	So
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,095	| IOT220 |	All right they don't
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,631	| IOT220 |	I asked my opinion
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:38,655	| IOT220 |	I care but
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,495	| IOT220 |	Figure model it is some more the better
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,823	| IOT220 |	You know I don't think we said you mentioned beta test these Facebook portal
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,359	| IOT220 |	Apparently
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,663	| IOT220 |	CNBC Facebook has said that they have
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,967	| IOT220 |	New versions of their portal video chat
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,551	| IOT220 |	This fall different form-factors perhaps
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,319	| IOT220 |	We
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,647	| IOT220 |	Before the show try to guess what this form factors would be and you don't even want
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,975	| IOT220 |	Think about what we thought about cuz I have no idea what it was like to be doing
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,743	| IOT220 |	What about it
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,023	| IOT220 |	You talk to your wife
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,863	| IOT220 |	You do not care what I do talk to you on your way
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:15,007	| IOT220 |	Right place
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:18,079	| IOT220 |	Because video chat for me tends to be a long
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,615	| IOT220 |	So I'm kind of thing well I'll spend
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:23,199	| IOT220 |	510 30 minutes whatever depending on the person in the
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| IOT220 |	Ana purpose
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,551	| IOT220 |	Whereas talking to my watch is there any micro transactional send a text
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| IOT220 |	Reply to somebody
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:29,855	| IOT220 |	Etc
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,903	| IOT220 |	9 that's it
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,439	| IOT220 |	Legendary chest
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| IOT220 |	Tend to be very
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,231	| IOT220 |	Transactional
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,791	| IOT220 |	It's like let me show you this place that I'm at
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,095	| IOT220 |	Check this out and then we switch to
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,191	| IOT220 |	Different
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,471	| IOT220 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,287	| IOT220 |	Alrighty let's talk about 5G
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:48,799	| IOT220 |	Man
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,895	| IOT220 |	Because we haven't we haven't
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,663	| IOT220 |	Yasso
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,223	| IOT220 |	Couple exciting things about the story
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:18:01,087	| IOT220 |	She is actually that would it be more exciting things but AT&T is working with Uber's elevate
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,623	| IOT220 |	To test out
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,927	| IOT220 |	Basically how do you bring cell service
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,695	| IOT220 |	Into
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| IOT220 |	Your taxi
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:06,975	| IOT220 |	Syndromes
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,767	| IOT220 |	YG is really just throwing in here
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,839	| IOT220 |	Market purpose because right now luberon 80
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,607	| IOT220 |	AT&T reusing
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| IOT220 |	BL2 E network
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,911	| IOT220 |	To see how to connect
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,703	| IOT220 |	The Ubers
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:19,007	| IOT220 |	Potential are taxis
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,335	| IOT220 |	The interesting thing about this press release was that they were saying that
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,919	| IOT220 |	Expects Elevate to launch its first taxis
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,223	| IOT220 |	In 2023 which is only 4 years
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:32,831	| IOT220 |	Well that's something else I would beta test although not a very tall height
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,903	| IOT220 |	Like you said the 5G biddestone here because of marketing
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:40,511	| IOT220 |	Even question why it's in there at all because we talked about millimeter wave and
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,279	| IOT220 |	Line of sight
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,119	| IOT220 |	Why you do that with an air taxi
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:47,167	| IOT220 |	Without spending billions and billions are there
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:53,567	| IOT220 |	Line of sight I mean if you're going up your orienting your antennas up there's not actually as much stuff
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,103	| IOT220 |	You know there's no buildings
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,175	| IOT220 |	The latency
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,199	| IOT220 |	Elements are
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| IOT220 |	Compelling
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,319	| IOT220 |	Just think the power management though I mean a lot of
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,855	| IOT220 |	5G what it's going to look like
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,903	| IOT220 |	Actually talk to somebody from Annex
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,927	| IOT220 |	Speed recently about
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,207	| IOT220 |	Managing
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,743	| IOT220 |	The radios
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:16,863	| IOT220 |	And what's going to happen is a lot of these companies are going to deploy
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,727	| IOT220 |	GE service
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:24,799	| IOT220 |	If that millimeter-wave isn't available or it's just
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,407	| IOT220 |	That processing that's going to happen
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:33,503	| IOT220 |	That has to happen like on the Drone and at the base station level
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,295	| IOT220 |	And that's going to
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| IOT220 |	Gobs of
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| IOT220 |	Just suck up
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,879	| IOT220 |	Types of power saws
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,391	| IOT220 |	Museum
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,951	| IOT220 |	Yeah that becomes important when
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,743	| IOT220 |	If you run out of power
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| IOT220 |	In the air
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:50,143	| IOT220 |	No millimeter-wave is going to help you
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,679	| IOT220 |	Is a bigger battery
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:56,799	| IOT220 |	We'll see
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,847	| IOT220 |	I guess that really sums up my
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,383	| IOT220 |	I think it's going to have to be like
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,967	| IOT220 |	Coruscant Star Wars I apologize for the reference but they're just going to have space Lane
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,039	| IOT220 |	Driving there
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,319	| IOT220 |	I'm not even asked
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:10,623	| IOT220 |	I think people who know Star Wars
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,903	| IOT220 |	They'll understand
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| IOT220 |	All right
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| IOT220 |	Trust me
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,231	| IOT220 |	Hey did you buy the
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,255	| IOT220 |	Amazon blink
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:17,791	| IOT220 |	Xt2 video camera
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,583	| IOT220 |	I know we talked about doing it but
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,607	| IOT220 |	I never did
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:24,959	| IOT220 |	We we did I did not get $1 / 150 battery power
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,311	| IOT220 |	Yeah in the blink cameras have been around for a while Amazon
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,175	| IOT220 |	This one was around for
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,503	| IOT220 |	How long has this been around
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,295	| IOT220 |	2 weeks
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:43,391	| IOT220 |	It was just back in May that they started taking orders and
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,159	| IOT220 |	Marshalls products
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:45,695	| IOT220 |	Already
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:52,863	| IOT220 |	Yeah Amazon has temporarily stop taking orders for this camera
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,887	| IOT220 |	They did it because
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,911	| IOT220 |	Cuz it was getting
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,471	| IOT220 |	Mapreduce with some buyers
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,543	| IOT220 |	Saying that it had poor range between their camera in the router
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:03,359	| IOT220 |	Bad software bad movement detection
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,127	| IOT220 |	And so am
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,663	| IOT220 |	Sunset
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,687	| IOT220 |	Let's take a closer look
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,991	| IOT220 |	I don't know if this is true but
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:12,575	| IOT220 |	Reportedly a Amazon reviewer for the product
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT220 |	Rote
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,367	| IOT220 |	Amazon review
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,952	| IOT220 |	I got an email from the founder of blank letting you know they are working out
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,488	| IOT220 |	Unexpected issues with
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,768	| IOT220 |	Does expand on
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:23,840	| IOT220 |	Enter very willing to work with me to get this figured out
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| IOT220 |	There's issues
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,680	| IOT220 |	And this is hard and
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,472	| IOT220 |	How hard is it is so hard that
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,520	| IOT220 |	I don't know if you guys remember wechat
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,288	| IOT220 |	August
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,312	| IOT220 |	View doorbell
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:36,640	| IOT220 |	Vegetable that like 3 weeks after it's lost
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,176	| IOT220 |	Lunch in this was a battery power
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,712	| IOT220 |	Are just like the blink camera battery power
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,248	| IOT220 |	Video doorbell
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,528	| IOT220 |	And
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,064	| IOT220 |	This was also
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,576	| IOT220 |	Because it
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,368	| IOT220 |	Behaving inconsistent
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:49,440	| IOT220 |	What can we say it's hard to do battery-powered video tube
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,512	| IOT220 |	Especially because they have to use Wi-Fi so that's
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,280	| IOT220 |	Powersox
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,304	| IOT220 |	They've got to figure something out there
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,352	| IOT220 |	You got to have this
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:22:00,192	| IOT220 |	Sleeping awake mozyr very difficult on this because you basically
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:03,776	| IOT220 |	You know if it's movement detection you're after the second
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:07,360	| IOT220 |	It detects movement he wanted to start recording are you want to already
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:07,872	| IOT220 |	I've been
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,920	| IOT220 |	And just like
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,456	| IOT220 |	Delete recordings continuously
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,248	| IOT220 |	So this is really
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,040	| IOT220 |	Is really a struggle
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,552	| IOT220 |	Four companies
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,344	| IOT220 |	I suspect this is why we don't
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,392	| IOT220 |	Battery power
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,160	| IOT220 |	Camera
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,208	| IOT220 |	Yeah I mean Arnold's done a good job here
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| IOT220 |	Even Arlo actually gets
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,304	| IOT220 |	Get yelled at sometimes for
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,096	| IOT220 |	Basically sucking up battery
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:32,192	| IOT220 |	And they've actually got their own Wireless in their early cameras
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,728	| IOT220 |	They had a hug that
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| IOT220 |	Work with a cam
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:36,032	| IOT220 |	Which I assume is a
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,056	| IOT220 |	More robust
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,336	| IOT220 |	Wireless protocol
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,616	| IOT220 |	To handle things like lag
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:46,016	| IOT220 |	What about Google and their environmental sensors and iot
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:51,648	| IOT220 |	Yeah this is cool for the tinkerers out there if you have a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:56,000	| IOT220 |	You can now buy for $25 and add on board on board
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,280	| IOT220 |	That's
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,816	| IOT220 |	Is 4
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT220 |	Google
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT220 |	Coral
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:03,168	| IOT220 |	Mental boards the coral Dev board
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,728	| IOT220 |	It has
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:07,008	| IOT220 |	Machine learning board with
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,520	| IOT220 |	How to use yes
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,104	| IOT220 |	So the TPU is a separate USB plugin
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:15,712	| IOT220 |	And what that does is that let you do machine learning without the cloud you kind of
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:20,832	| IOT220 |	Bring it down to the edge connect connect this board to that
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:22,880	| IOT220 |	Daisy chain
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:26,208	| IOT220 |	Daisy chain
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:32,352	| IOT220 |	You can get tensorflow on the edge TPU to work with a python and SQL
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:37,216	| IOT220 |	Scott a humidity and temperature sensor ambient light sensor
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,984	| IOT220 |	Pressure
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:48,480	| IOT220 |	You know it's like I said it's something for like iot development it's not something
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,016	| IOT220 |	Consumers are going to go by but I thought was kind of
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:53,344	| IOT220 |	Could you use it to make our our fabled washer
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,112	| IOT220 |	Hair dryers
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:59,488	| IOT220 |	The infamous washer dryer sensor I think you could I don't see why
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,000	| IOT220 |	Not
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,048	| IOT220 |	I wish I had vibration
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,328	| IOT220 |	He doesn't have that
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,424	| IOT220 |	Humidity
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,008	| IOT220 |	Maybe when the washer is going
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,032	| IOT220 |	Politely
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,384	| IOT220 |	All right there's a lot of ways we can skin that cat
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,152	| IOT220 |	We just have
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,920	| IOT220 |	I figured it out yet
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,200	| IOT220 |	Okay well
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:23,040	| IOT220 |	I think that's enough for this week especially since I'm traveling and just coming out the movie
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:28,672	| IOT220 |	Guys I cannot wait for the move to be finished we're so close now so maybe in the next week or two
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:33,792	| IOT220 |	Actually know the first thing I'm going to do and it relates to this week's voicemail question
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,072	| IOT220 |	Witches from Lynn
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,400	| IOT220 |	Before we hear it the iot podcast hotline is sponsored
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:41,984	| IOT220 |	This month by a pharaoh with the fifth largest iot patent
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,520	| IOT220 |	Portfolio in the world
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:47,616	| IOT220 |	A pharaoh provides a proven iot platform that doesn't risk your brand
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:52,480	| IOT220 |	Affero customers have experienced as much as an 80% reduction in time to mark
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,528	| IOT220 |	M10x higher activation rates

EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,136	| IOT220 |	All right
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,160	| IOT220 |	And now
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| IOT220 |	To the voicemail
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,976	| IOT220 |	Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| IOT220 |	When's the Maryland
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:08,864	| IOT220 |	Your most underrated
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,912	| IOT220 |	Picture of your smart home
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,448	| IOT220 |	That you would tell a new
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,264	| IOT220 |	Thanks
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:16,800	| IOT220 |	Lynn
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| IOT220 |	It's such a good question
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,360	| IOT220 |	And
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:22,176	| IOT220 |	I will tell you the first thing I'm going to do when I get back
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:24,224	| IOT220 |	Since I now have internet access in my house
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,784	| IOT220 |	And my smart devices unpacked
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,576	| IOT220 |	Actually get a setup
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:33,696	| IOT220 |	Motion sensor in my hue light bulbs motion sensor the Hue bulbs so that you can do it with
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,720	| IOT220 |	Thompson Center
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:35,744	| IOT220 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,536	| IOT220 |	Who said that
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,304	| IOT220 |	Lighting thing
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| IOT220 |	Did my laundry
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,656	| IOT220 |	I cannot get over how much
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:44,704	| IOT220 |	I miss walking into my laundry room with
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,520	| IOT220 |	Purse full of laundry and having the lights turn on automatically
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:49,312	| IOT220 |	Then turn off
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:50,592	| IOT220 |	You have 2 minutes after
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,872	| IOT220 |	No motion has been detected
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,920	| IOT220 |	It's such a small thing but
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,688	| IOT220 |	I love it
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,736	| IOT220 |	And not having it is driving me absolutely crazy
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:03,648	| IOT220 |	And I haven't wish I had because I would love that perspectives like what I miss the most will be
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:07,232	| IOT220 |	The very first thing I have to put back in place
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,000	| IOT220 |	I'm just turn the internet off
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,328	| IOT220 |	Could do that just make
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,608	| IOT220 |	The family will love that
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,120	| IOT220 |	Yes
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,680	| IOT220 |	No YouTube TV for you come back one year
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:17,728	| IOT220 |	But I have to say the most
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,776	| IOT220 |	Unexpected
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,568	| IOT220 |	Expected as well as underrated
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:23,104	| IOT220 |	Value that I've gotten
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:27,456	| IOT220 |	From my smart home and I've mentioned this probably a year ago cuz I think it's going to happen
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,992	| IOT220 |	Was having
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,272	| IOT220 |	A webcam
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:33,088	| IOT220 |	Inside my house looking out the front window
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:37,184	| IOT220 |	Where my driveway and the road as whatever townhouse communities
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,976	| IOT220 |	We sometimes park on the road
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,256	| IOT220 |	Sometimes have cars in the driveway
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:44,352	| IOT220 |	But I did put it out there for that I put out there to see who's walking up there
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,912	| IOT220 |	Pass to come around to the front door Etc
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,192	| IOT220 |	And yet
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,496	| IOT220 |	A $20 wyze cam
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:54,592	| IOT220 |	Whichever it is now it was a mess when I had a pack and play for this particular
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,104	| IOT220 |	Instance
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:59,200	| IOT220 |	Save me $1,500 because it captured
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| IOT220 |	A neighbor
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,272	| IOT220 |	Eating my Park
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,552	| IOT220 |	Car on the street
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:07,648	| IOT220 |	And that was used as evidence for the insurance claim because the neighbor claims
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,416	| IOT220 |	She did not have
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| IOT220 |	The car
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,232	| IOT220 |	I never thought I would use it for that
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,792	| IOT220 |	I need the money back on that webcam
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:18,656	| IOT220 |	Many many times over and I would never get rid of it for that very reason because
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,936	| IOT220 |	You never know when
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,216	| IOT220 |	You're going to have fuse for like that
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,776	| IOT220 |	Slightly more expensive
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:27,104	| IOT220 |	Camera similar use case I would recommend
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,640	| IOT220 |	The Logitech Circle 2
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,688	| IOT220 |	It's not as cheap as the wise cam
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,456	| IOT220 |	But
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,736	| IOT220 |	It has discrete filtering
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,784	| IOT220 |	That makes it so when you
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,552	| IOT220 |	Use it
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,832	| IOT220 |	In these specific I am
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,368	| IOT220 |	Cricket inside and outside
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,440	| IOT220 |	It doesn't get the glare off the window at night
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:47,072	| IOT220 |	It's also homekit certified and it will be one of the first cameras that work with
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,120	| IOT220 |	Apple secure video
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,680	| IOT220 |	API that Apple talked about last week
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:53,216	| IOT220 |	WWDC
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:56,800	| IOT220 |	And I'm in Canada right now so I'm looking at prices and seeing Canada prices
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,848	| IOT220 |	Kevin how much is that in the US
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:06,016	| IOT220 |	Here in the US that looks like it retails for about $180 at Amazon
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:08,832	| IOT220 |	Does have it for $12 less
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,624	| IOT220 |	Excellent so it's more expensive
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:14,208	| IOT220 |	But if you're trying to catch like things happening at night in your house
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:17,024	| IOT220 |	And you have money you'd like to birds
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,560	| IOT220 |	That is another option
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:21,888	| IOT220 |	Okay I realized we didn't talk about any of apples
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,704	| IOT220 |	You did mention the video
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,008	| IOT220 |	Camera API and
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,312	| IOT220 |	Set real quick to say what it is I basically
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,848	| IOT220 |	Really clever
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:34,432	| IOT220 |	Continue to double down on privacy as a way to stand out from the crowd here
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,736	| IOT220 |	Homekit cameras
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,040	| IOT220 |	Better enabled with this API
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:41,856	| IOT220 |	The video streams won't be sent
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,392	| IOT220 |	To the
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,952	| IOT220 |	Cloud of the hardware manufacturer
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,512	| IOT220 |	Which could often be a third-party cloud provider
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,840	| IOT220 |	Dean's dad will be encrypted and then sent
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,608	| IOT220 |	2
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,376	| IOT220 |	ICloud
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,936	| IOT220 |	And you will not pay for the
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:56,448	| IOT220 |	Storage
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,008	| IOT220 |	10 days
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:04,896	| IOT220 |	And even app will not be able to see what's been captured on video so therefore there's no
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,688	| IOT220 |	Privacy implications
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:10,016	| IOT220 |	It's new advertising location Etc
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:12,320	| IOT220 |	Erodditys Hardware makers
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| IOT220 |	Basically from the
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,208	| IOT220 |	Bobby's camera monitoring services
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:22,304	| IOT220 |	Yeah and they also actually Apple also addressed another big question
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,328	| IOT220 |	We Care a Lot
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,096	| IOT220 |	At the
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:24,608	| IOT220 |	Podcast
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:28,448	| IOT220 |	Which is how do you secure your home network for your iot device
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:30,240	| IOT220 |	Ww.w
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:30,752	| IOT220 |	BGC
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,288	| IOT220 |	Apple did say
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,592	| IOT220 |	They're working with a few router maker
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,384	| IOT220 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,152	| IOT220 |	Linksys
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,176	| IOT220 |	And Gyro
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:39,968	| IOT220 |	Which ironically
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,504	| IOT220 |	Brazilian by Amazon
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:46,112	| IOT220 |	But what they're going to be doing is homekit certified routers and these are going to have
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,904	| IOT220 |	Three different layers of
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:48,672	| IOT220 |	Troll
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:51,488	| IOT220 |	So all of your homekit devices on the network
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:56,352	| IOT220 |	You'll be able to select the device and then you'll be able to say hey restrict this only to the home
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,888	| IOT220 |	Which means
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,912	| IOT220 |	Only talk to things
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,680	| IOT220 |	In the home
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,192	| IOT220 |	Homekit devices
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,240	| IOT220 |	Automatic which is
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:03,520	| IOT220 |	Restricted
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,568	| IOT220 |	I'm talking to the outside weird websites but
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,872	| IOT220 |	Its own website and a few others are fine
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,664	| IOT220 |	And then no restrictions
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,224	| IOT220 |	Let it do whatever I want
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,552	| IOT220 |	Which is open up your front door and walk away from your house
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,088	| IOT220 |	So that's
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:21,952	| IOT220 |	Really interesting and I can't wait to hear about people's experiences on this cuz it does seem like
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,744	| IOT220 |	One is an extra layer of
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| IOT220 |	Complexity
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| IOT220 |	2
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:28,352	| IOT220 |	People I think are going to be like most secure restricted home
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,912	| IOT220 |	But then they're going to be pissed when things like Amazon
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,192	| IOT220 |	Echo Cloud Integrations
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:39,616	| IOT220 |	It's kind of the big news from Apple will talk about more of that as we see iOS 30
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,408	| IOT220 |	Because they're so cool
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,688	| IOT220 |	Homekit related short
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,456	| IOT220 |	That's that'll be happening
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,760	| IOT220 |	But wait till we can
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:46,272	| IOT220 |	You play with it
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,576	| IOT220 |	That's all the news for this week
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:51,136	| IOT220 |	Let's stay tuned for our guest
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:51,904	| IOT220 |	Dominique
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:52,672	| IOT220 |	Getting out
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,720	| IOT220 |	Who is the CTO of
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,232	| IOT220 |	Everything
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:31:00,352	| IOT220 |	We are going to be talking about what it means we have a trillion connected devices
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,656	| IOT220 |	Either NFC Bluetooth bass tags
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,192	| IOT220 |	Even our can of Campbell's Soup
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:05,472	| IOT220 |	Might one day have a little
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:07,776	| IOT220 |	What does that mean for the rest of
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:12,384	| IOT220 |	But before we get into that let's hear from this week sponsor
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:18,784	| IOT220 |	Hey everyone we're taking a quick break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,552	| IOT220 |	Sponsor is
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,832	| IOT220 |	Dell Technologies
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:23,136	| IOT220 |	And I'm here today with John Curtis
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,160	| IOT220 |	Or JD
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:28,000	| IOT220 |	The sales VP of solutions for Dell Technologies
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,328	| IOT220 |	Your team is talking about becoming datafirst
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,864	| IOT220 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:39,264	| IOT220 |	That's a great question and given just a sheer quantity of data has been created nowadays remember
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,288	| IOT220 |	Ice cream gigabytes
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,824	| IOT220 |	By the year 2025
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:46,432	| IOT220 |	Cloud first point of view
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:50,016	| IOT220 |	Everything should be pushed to the Public's cloud
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,296	| IOT220 |	It's just not practical
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:55,392	| IOT220 |	Directions to cut generating from the edge
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,696	| IOT220 |	Interpret all of it into the cloud is just
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| IOT220 |	Impractical
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,744	| IOT220 |	We need to think today
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| IOT220 |	The cloud first
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,584	| IOT220 |	Delaware
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,864	| IOT220 |	Rather than starting to
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,632	| IOT220 |	Determine what they do
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,168	| IOT220 |	Testicular clog can do for you
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:09,472	| IOT220 |	Thinking of it more from what is your data
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,496	| IOT220 |	And what can your data do
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:14,336	| IOT220 |	So that means an increasing focus on the edge
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:18,944	| IOT220 |	And why is Edge Computing essential for success and Industrial scale iot
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,016	| IOT220 |	Yeah energy the first world
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,576	| IOT220 |	Removing the data
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:27,904	| IOT220 |	In performing actions closer to the edge is going to be critical
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,440	| IOT220 |	There are three main reasons
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,464	| IOT220 |	We feel
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,232	| IOT220 |	You need to look at that
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,512	| IOT220 |	1
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,536	| IOT220 |	Overall volume
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,352	| IOT220 |	The sheer volume of data generated at the edge today
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:36,864	| IOT220 |	Is Mass
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:38,912	| IOT220 |	And it's grown exponentially
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:39,680	| IOT220 |	Thunder prediction
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:46,336	| IOT220 |	Stitched it up Spotify 75% of the Enterprise data by the year 2022 and it's up 10% today
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:50,688	| IOT220 |	Active again based on the amount of data
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,456	| IOT220 |	It is just
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:57,088	| IOT220 |	Too expensive to move everything to the cloud more activities and analytics needs to be done at the edge
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,368	| IOT220 |	And then Speed most important
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,416	| IOT220 |	The ability to make a decision
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,208	| IOT220 |	Right there at the edges
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:02,720	| IOT220 |	Critical
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,024	| IOT220 |	This is autonomous car
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:08,096	| IOT220 |	If a destron suddenly walks in front of the car
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,008	| IOT220 |	For the until the car hit the brakes
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,288	| IOT220 |	Too late
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:18,336	| IOT220 |	That decision needs to be done FBI
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:19,872	| IOT220 |	Aside from
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:22,176	| IOT220 |	Cars what are customers doing it is
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:22,944	| IOT220 |	What are you seeing
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:28,832	| IOT220 |	He actually seemed quite a bit of work done but just recently finished up some research with Forester
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:33,440	| IOT220 |	They basically took and looked at some of the iot enabled use cases
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,976	| IOT220 |	In ones where we're ready to go
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,048	| IOT220 |	Security surveillance
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:40,608	| IOT220 |	No doubt number one in the highest General use case
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:43,936	| IOT220 |	They're also starting to see a big traction and in track and Trace
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,472	| IOT220 |	NV Energy Management
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:47,008	| IOT220 |	Awesome
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:49,568	| IOT220 |	So what does Dell Technologies offer
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,336	| IOT220 |	For those looking
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:54,432	| IOT220 |	We've come to the market with very specific purpose
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,968	| IOT220 |	Stilt Edge devices for iot
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:59,296	| IOT220 |	In the form of an iot embedded PC
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,576	| IOT220 |	As well as in a Gateway product
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,880	| IOT220 |	We also have an incredible range of
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,416	| IOT220 |	A servers
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:05,696	| IOT220 |	Hyper-converged solution
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:09,024	| IOT220 |	Scale Computing I can meet a wide range of needs
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:10,560	| IOT220 |	Axilla
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,096	| IOT220 |	So where can boats go
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:12,608	| IOT220 |	To learn more
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:17,728	| IOT220 |	If I know more information your listeners can come to Dell Technologies. Com
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,264	| IOT220 |	4 / iot
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:24,128	| IOT220 |	Teresa Forrester report I mention as well as find out about their growing portfolio of edge Prada

EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,560	| IOT220 |	Everything
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,352	| IOT220 |	How are you
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:48,448	| IOT220 |	Thanks for having me on the show
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:55,616	| IOT220 |	I'm super glad you're here and we should probably take it off
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:56,896	| IOT220 |	What
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:57,664	| IOT220 |	Everything is
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,736	| IOT220 |	Sure everything is in identity
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:02,784	| IOT220 |	See provider for old Kansas
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:05,856	| IOT220 |	But in particular CPT apparel
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:06,624	| IOT220 |	Luxury goods
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,672	| IOT220 |	Food products
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:11,744	| IOT220 |	Essentially provide a unique web identity
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,280	| IOT220 |	For each of these products
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:19,424	| IOT220 |	These identities can be used for all kinds of applications consumer-facing applications

EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:25,312	| IOT220 |	Applications product authenticity and Analytics
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:31,968	| IOT220 |	We are going to get into that and I should tell everybody
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:34,784	| IOT220 |	Campbell Soup
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,296	| IOT220 |	So
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,576	| IOT220 |	I have been
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,880	| IOT220 |	Operating or aware of everything
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:42,720	| IOT220 |	I feel like you were
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:45,024	| IOT220 |	You guys were very early in the
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:48,096	| IOT220 |	Cuz I think there's a lot of
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,632	| IOT220 |	So what have you learned
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:50,912	| IOT220 |	The past
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,680	| IOT220 |	2 years of doing this
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,616	| IOT220 |	After we started
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:01,664	| IOT220 |	Indeed will change quite a bit
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,432	| IOT220 |	Since then
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:06,528	| IOT220 |	We started in the space we're in today so we started really
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:12,928	| IOT220 |	Sinking of connecting absolutely everything
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,952	| IOT220 |	The company ever
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:14,976	| IOT220 |	And then
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:18,816	| IOT220 |	The markets that we are targeting we're not quite ready back then
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,632	| IOT220 |	We already targeting cpg
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:24,192	| IOT220 |	To Market Square
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:28,288	| IOT220 |	Interface Technologies serialization smart tax with no
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,568	| IOT220 |	Lights at the cost
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,104	| IOT220 |	But that they needed to be
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:33,920	| IOT220 |	4
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,688	| IOT220 |	So
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,480	| IOT220 |	12 the evolution of everything
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:37,248	| IOT220 |	We went
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:40,064	| IOT220 |	Two more I'd say traditional iot
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:46,720	| IOT220 |	Although the root Society are very matching RFID tagging items but when I say
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:50,560	| IOT220 |	People assume Azure iot today which is
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,096	| IOT220 |	Smart home connect
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:52,608	| IOT220 |	Cities
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,888	| IOT220 |	So we did that
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:37:00,288	| IOT220 |	But then it was a lot of competition in this Payson and as we were
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:03,616	| IOT220 |	Exploring
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:04,640	| IOT220 |	Let's connect
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,944	| IOT220 |	Tag sayings
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:07,712	| IOT220 |	Started
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:10,784	| IOT220 |	Cost of tags
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:13,856	| IOT220 |	Cost of circulation
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:20,256	| IOT220 |	Nosal generating consumer demands for more transparency more information about the brand stats
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,280	| IOT220 |	We're working with
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,816	| IOT220 |	And so all of that actually
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:26,656	| IOT220 |	Made it possible for us to rely on our initial objective
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:32,032	| IOT220 |	Okay tender questions here
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,312	| IOT220 |	You guys are
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:33,824	| IOT220 |	Using
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,360	| IOT220 |	RFID tags
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:38,432	| IOT220 |	And let's talk about how the cost of changed over
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,736	| IOT220 |	Because
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:43,808	| IOT220 |	100% up to date on where things used to be in where they are now
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,136	| IOT220 |	Yeah so we don't only use RFID
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,696	| IOT220 |	Agnostic
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:55,840	| IOT220 |	The technology song
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:59,168	| IOT220 |	Or even LT1 devices
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:04,800	| IOT220 |	For your question specifically about RFID tags there was always this Holy Grail
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,568	| IOT220 |	$0.05
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,848	| IOT220 |	Fertagyl or less
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:09,408	| IOT220 |	Many analysts promise
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:15,040	| IOT220 |	This actually didn't materialise for real until
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,832	| IOT220 |	Probably one
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,112	| IOT220 |	One and a half year ago
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| IOT220 |	4 hours ID
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:22,720	| IOT220 |	Where the prices when actually Dlow
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:25,024	| IOT220 |	5 Stanton and even even
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:27,840	| IOT220 |	Close to 1:17 in Massapequa
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:33,984	| IOT220 |	For other transponder technology such as the NFC for instance took a little bit longer
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:47,040	| IOT220 |	4 North massive volumes
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,600	| IOT220 |	It's about 10003 order to reach $0.05
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,136	| IOT220 |	Which really unlock
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:53,696	| IOT220 |	Launch number
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,768	| IOT220 |	It sure does I remember when
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:58,560	| IOT220 |	50 Cent
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:01,120	| IOT220 |	And then you were like value items
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:02,656	| IOT220 |	So it sounds like
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:04,960	| IOT220 |	Better standard
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:05,728	| IOT220 |	Switch deals
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,752	| IOT220 |	Obvious
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:07,264	| IOT220 |	What's happening
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,592	| IOT220 |	Absolutely standardization
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:14,688	| IOT220 |	For my scale adoption and for really reaching the trillions and that
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:16,224	| IOT220 |	Darren I'm really excited
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:22,880	| IOT220 |	Part of the standard that didn't make much noise yet but I think we make a lot of noise in the future you probably know the one
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:28,768	| IOT220 |	This one's a barcode is actually not accessible to
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:33,632	| IOT220 |	Consumers are not accessible on the internet and the web
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:37,984	| IOT220 |	With the gs1 digital link standard that was released last August
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,800	| IOT220 |	You know have a way of sterilizing
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,080	| IOT220 |	Product identities
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:43,360	| IOT220 |	Open urls
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,896	| IOT220 |	Dtrl sardana
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:45,664	| IOT220 |	Crates
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:48,992	| IOT220 |	To put into charcoals NFC tags are old Kansas
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,784	| IOT220 |	Two dimensional data carriers
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:54,880	| IOT220 |	So that standard is basically turning the good old one barcode
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,096	| IOT220 |	Talk about before this year
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:06,400	| IOT220 |	Digital scale
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,424	| IOT220 |	Market
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:09,984	| IOT220 |	And lots of Pilots are happening would be friends now
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:13,056	| IOT220 |	Behind you digitally standard
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:16,128	| IOT220 |	What is a diplomat look like
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:16,640	| IOT220 |	Chevrolet
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:19,200	| IOT220 |	Network agnostic
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,224	| IOT220 |	Pakistan
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:21,760	| IOT220 |	How does this work in
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:26,880	| IOT220 |	The first thing you want to reach is sterilization because
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:30,976	| IOT220 |	Look up the CPD markets are appearing more cats or or food market
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:36,864	| IOT220 |	We haven't reached their ization at my scale with serialization come
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,400	| IOT220 |	Large number
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,984	| IOT220 |	When you're at the genetic level
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,008	| IOT220 |	Did you pick up a product
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:44,544	| IOT220 |	CBD products
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:46,848	| IOT220 |	You have an identification of this product
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:49,408	| IOT220 |	It's usually taking the phone with the 1D barcode
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:51,200	| IOT220 |	UPC or Ean
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:55,040	| IOT220 |	Kittens as their cold today
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:57,600	| IOT220 |	Do you have in your hand
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:59,136	| IOT220 |	The salad
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:01,696	| IOT220 |	Identify the class of product
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,720	| IOT220 |	Sol de Janeiro
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,256	| IOT220 |	Identifiers
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,536	| IOT220 |	Civilization
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:08,864	| IOT220 |	To be able to identify dicm you have in your hands
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:12,960	| IOT220 |	Each item has a different number has a different address
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:18,080	| IOT220 |	Because it enables a large number of before
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:21,152	| IOT220 |	We're talking
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,480	| IOT220 |	Trillium
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:26,272	| IOT220 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:28,576	| IOT220 |	To reach 1 trillion
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:31,392	| IOT220 |	Slightly ambitious goal is to reach 1 trillion
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:39,072	| IOT220 |	Depends who you ask why did you have to CT or tomorrow
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:45,984	| IOT220 |	The CTO would like to reach it as soon as possible but I also know that one trillion date
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:46,752	| IOT220 |	The point is this
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:48,032	| IOT220 |	Is a very very hard
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:51,104	| IOT220 |	Manage and I also know it's not going to happen overnight
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:55,967	| IOT220 |	This could be possible
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,343	| IOT220 |	Exactly
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:02,111	| IOT220 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,391	| IOT220 |	Look at that
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:06,975	| IOT220 |	Cuz I am curious what kind of technology and what kind of resources you're going to need
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:08,255	| IOT220 |	Support battalion
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:10,047	| IOT220 |	But in the meantime
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:11,327	| IOT220 |	Let's go back
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:12,863	| IOT220 |	How this works oh no
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:18,239	| IOT220 |	How does that work
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:22,079	| IOT220 |	Put the tag on
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,615	| IOT220 |	Packaging to it is
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:24,895	| IOT220 |	Coming out of the store
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:37,183	| IOT220 |	No seriously she is not entirely new you during your has mass Concerta sational on expensive items
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:44,863	| IOT220 |	Swiss watches are certain dictionary items had certification for a 4-1 ready and I think a break
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,143	| IOT220 |	Two in the past few years
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:48,703	| IOT220 |	Ization truly accessible
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,519	| IOT220 |	Two-way Biden
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:58,175	| IOT220 |	So what to do with everything is that every item gets a URL you need your else know what that means is that true
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:05,343	| IOT220 |	You can interact with the API of this thing so every single thing religious an API
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:08,671	| IOT220 |	Applications much more easy
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:10,207	| IOT220 |	This identity was not
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:12,511	| IOT220 |	Also means that we can
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,815	| IOT220 |	Put this web identity into
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,351	| IOT220 |	Tags or data carriers
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:22,495	| IOT220 |	You can put this identity
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,263	| IOT220 |	Very easy
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,567	| IOT220 |	QR codes are NFC tags
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:32,223	| IOT220 |	Which allow consumers to scan them very very easy
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,855	| IOT220 |	Same thing with your culture
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,879	| IOT220 |	IOS camera
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:41,951	| IOT220 |	Charcoals with your ass out of the box
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:43,743	| IOT220 |	So just by changing this
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:46,303	| IOT220 |	Identigene to sterilize identity
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:53,215	| IOT220 |	API integration
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:57,567	| IOT220 |	From Beyond the supply chain
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:02,431	| IOT220 |	All right so let's talk about what that means
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:04,479	| IOT220 |	I think you have one with a
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:11,135	| IOT220 |	Yeah that's at the princess in one week
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,159	| IOT220 |	Leaders India
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:16,767	| IOT220 |	And they have
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:22,911	| IOT220 |	Cruising demand from consumers
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,983	| IOT220 |	Just like fresh food into
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:28,799	| IOT220 |	Is really under pressure from consumers
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:32,639	| IOT220 |	To provide full transparency so
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:33,919	| IOT220 |	Star Trek

EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:42,111	| IOT220 |	And to provide information
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:44,927	| IOT220 |	The consumers in a way that's really fairly accessible
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:47,743	| IOT220 |	So that they can read you know where the silo
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:48,511	| IOT220 |	Comes from
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:50,303	| IOT220 |	Teach anywhere
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:53,119	| IOT220 |	Was first put in water
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:55,679	| IOT220 |	When does Siloam was moved from the river
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:59,263	| IOT220 |	When the song was harvested
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:02,335	| IOT220 |	Exactly which way the silent hiding in the Junior
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:05,919	| IOT220 |	To the store so you can learn alot about it
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:20,255	| IOT220 |	Do consumers actually scan their items
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:26,655	| IOT220 |	I don't know if I'm going to scan every single item
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,679	| IOT220 |	That's what
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:29,215	| IOT220 |	Trying to figure out what the consumer
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,287	| IOT220 |	Into
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:33,567	| IOT220 |	How can this help Beyond
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:37,663	| IOT220 |	Yes I'm in your urine marking
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:42,783	| IOT220 |	Is there any interesting cuz I would tend to rewrite I'm not going to go to the store and scan every single item
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:46,623	| IOT220 |	I think I'm certain items We Care a lot more than others
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:47,391	| IOT220 |	Princes
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,951	| IOT220 |	Fresh food spacer
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:54,047	| IOT220 |	Just kidding. Seafood space where much more inclined to
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:55,583	| IOT220 |	You want to know what we're eating
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:46:02,239	| IOT220 |	There are several studies that that show that people are
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:04,543	| IOT220 |	Honda brands
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:10,431	| IOT220 |	Lodi public staff that was
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:16,063	| IOT220 |	The customers would switch to a brand that is more transparent
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,087	| IOT220 |	Then another brand
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:22,719	| IOT220 |	Story story but it's a big party
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,607	| IOT220 |	I don't think we would
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:30,911	| IOT220 |	Ashley
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,959	| IOT220 |	Can of Coke for incense
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,983	| IOT220 |	However
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:34,751	| IOT220 |	Kolkata
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,031	| IOT220 |	Is one of our customers in
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:43,967	| IOT220 |	News can you would be surprised
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,503	| IOT220 |	Cruising
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:46,783	| IOT220 |	In Europe in the US

EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:03,423	| IOT220 |	I feel like it would be really interesting
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,727	| IOT220 |	Lettuce for example
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:14,175	| IOT220 |	So that seems like a place where we might see something like this have benefits outside of
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:16,479	| IOT220 |	Gamification War chest
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:18,783	| IOT220 |	Making me feel good about where my stuff came from
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:20,319	| IOT220 |	Absolutely

EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:29,791	| IOT220 |	The same kind of problem setting these food safety
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:33,631	| IOT220 |	Food recalls field marketing are are great examples
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:37,215	| IOT220 |	Today when we were a food out the trash
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:49,503	| IOT220 |	Much more effective
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,551	| IOT220 |	Ic1 brands we worked with
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:54,623	| IOT220 |	Angry calls and icons mentioned their names.
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:56,415	| IOT220 |	Stop that was saying
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:00,511	| IOT220 |	Before
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:04,351	| IOT220 |	Truservice ation and to the use of online services you like everything
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,655	| IOT220 |	So that's that's one thing
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:08,703	| IOT220 |	Safety in Germany products safety
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:11,775	| IOT220 |	I think it was a lot of internal use cases

EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:12,191	| IOT220 |	What is this mean
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:17,567	| IOT220 |	Krumdieck tissue level is means
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:19,615	| IOT220 |	You'll be able to see me
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:23,967	| IOT220 |	They appear
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:26,015	| IOT220 |	Here and there usually with

EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:30,367	| IOT220 |	Where is here you be able
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:35,231	| IOT220 |	How to trace them much more accurately to know where they are to know who is
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:36,511	| IOT220 |	Using products
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,279	| IOT220 |	And also
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:45,471	| IOT220 |	I think obviously we need to
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:48,799	| IOT220 |	Interaction mechanism
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:52,639	| IOT220 |	I don't think you when I would like the world where we have to scan
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:54,175	| IOT220 |	Every single item we buy

EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:07,743	| IOT220 |	I think we will see some very interesting evolutions
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:12,863	| IOT220 |	Is that you see with Frontier between
EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:15,167	| IOT220 |	Uni connect

EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:58,431	| IOT220 |	So I actually have
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:01,503	| IOT220 |	And I don't know
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:02,783	| IOT220 |	It's pretty awesome
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:07,903	| IOT220 |	Right now the world seems to be very focused on

EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:14,047	| IOT220 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:16,351	| IOT220 |	If I had a Bluetooth
EDL	00:51:16,351	00:51:18,143	| IOT220 |	I would want it to be
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:19,935	| IOT220 |	Let me know if
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:28,639	| IOT220 |	At best go to website but usually it's asking me to download

EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:33,247	| IOT220 |	And to me this just seems like
EDL	00:51:33,759	00:51:34,783	| IOT220 |	Colossal waste
EDL	00:51:34,783	00:51:36,319	| IOT220 |	Really good Technologies
EDL	00:51:36,831	00:51:41,183	| IOT220 |	Curious if we just have to get through this marketing first step
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:48,095	| IOT220 |	I totally agree with you and I think this is the first step in the water capable

EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:50,559	| IOT220 |	What is my thing have this type of identity
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:52,351	| IOT220 |	I wonder about
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:56,191	| IOT220 |	Is there a point
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:59,263	| IOT220 |	Which we should be communicating with people who buy this stuff
EDL	00:52:59,263	00:53:02,591	| IOT220 |	There's information that can be cleaned
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:05,151	| IOT220 |	Possibly about them or from them from
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:06,175	| IOT220 |	Everyday products
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:10,015	| IOT220 |	I think we'll have to explain that there is a active
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:11,295	| IOT220 |	Tagging deer
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:15,135	| IOT220 |	Semi-active tags
EDL	00:53:16,927	00:53:20,511	| IOT220 |	Explain that only for from an interaction standpoint
