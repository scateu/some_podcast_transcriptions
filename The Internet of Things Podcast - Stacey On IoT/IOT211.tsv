EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,288	| IOT211 |	What a Sad start to this week
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| IOT211 |	I know
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| IOT211 |	In
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,872	| IOT211 |	Mandt
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:59,456	| IOT211 |	So stringify we got it we got an email all of the people who use string of
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:02,016	| IOT211 |	By which is a software-based program that allowed you
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,040	| IOT211 |	2
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,856	| IOT211 |	Basically they called him flows
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,904	| IOT211 |	These really complicated recipe
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,928	| IOT211 |	PS4 iot
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| IOT211 |	Devices
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,512	| IOT211 |	I used it a lot to create things like
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,024	| IOT211 |	I had
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,072	| IOT211 |	The ability to tell Google or
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,608	| IOT211 |	My Amazon Echo
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,376	| IOT211 |	Yoga time
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,912	| IOT211 |	And what would happen if
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:19,424	| IOT211 |	Is my
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,216	| IOT211 |	Shades would come down
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,752	| IOT211 |	My lights went dim
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,080	| IOT211 |	Television would turn on Socastee
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,592	| IOT211 |	I do yoga
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,432	| IOT211 |	So all of this happened and my air conditioning would actually go.
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,968	| IOT211 |	Is hot yoga Is For Fools
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,576	| IOT211 |	So all of that would happen just with the words yoga time
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,344	| IOT211 |	Time it was
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:37,856	| IOT211 |	Awesome
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,904	| IOT211 |	And now I can no longer have you
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:44,256	| IOT211 |	Will you can have yoga time but you won't have yoga time with stringify
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| IOT211 |	When Comcast
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,328	| IOT211 |	Purchase
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:47,840	| IOT211 |	Stringify
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,376	| IOT211 |	And this was about 80
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,424	| IOT211 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,192	| IOT211 |	We said
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,752	| IOT211 |	Caprichos both of us that said
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| IOT211 |	When do they shut it down
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,312	| IOT211 |	Play makes sense
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| IOT211 |	Comcast what is stringify
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,128	| IOT211 |	Because
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,920	| IOT211 |	I have complicated feelings about Comcast
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,456	| IOT211 |	But when it comes to the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| IOT211 |	They're doing
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| IOT211 |	Bang up job
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,528	| IOT211 |	Creating
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,320	| IOT211 |	A really good interface
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,600	| IOT211 |	For people to use in
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,648	| IOT211 |	Stringify help them get that
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,976	| IOT211 |	This is what they're X1 platform right
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,256	| IOT211 |	Yes there
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,280	| IOT211 |	Xfinity home
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:17,791	| IOT211 |	X1
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,583	| IOT211 |	They all have the same
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,887	| IOT211 |	Games
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:25,727	| IOT211 |	In Comcast is actually doing a three-front a job there approving Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,775	| IOT211 |	And they're doing a good job without with
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,823	| IOT211 |	Improving security
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:32,383	| IOT211 |	Excited about your new security services for
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,687	| IOT211 |	Connect devices and their improving
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,479	| IOT211 |	Their voice interface with
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,247	| IOT211 |	Set the X1 platform
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,527	| IOT211 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| IOT211 |	It got all of that
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,391	| IOT211 |	Stringify means
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:50,303	| IOT211 |	It did and I know we have people that listen to this podcast we're very passionate about stringify and love it and I guess
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,327	| IOT211 |	It's it's great
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,863	| IOT211 |	I lean towards
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,167	| IOT211 |	If this then that personally but the same concept
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:05:01,055	| IOT211 |	And it provides a valuable service for you to connect things that are not otherwise natively connectable
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,823	| IOT211 |	My butt
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| IOT211 |	To be fair
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:09,503	| IOT211 |	I don't think a massive amount of people are going to be affected by this CS again people here Elizabeth show probably
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,015	| IOT211 |	Fairmount
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:15,903	| IOT211 |	But we looked at what was it the download numbers for the stringify app compared to the If This Then That app
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,415	| IOT211 |	And what do we find
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,439	| IOT211 |	We found
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,463	| IOT211 |	Very sad
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,767	| IOT211 |	So the stringify app
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,071	| IOT211 |	By the way you guys the stringify app
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:23,839	| IOT211 |	Is no longer there
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| IOT211 |	Did the cash version
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| IOT211 |	For March 30th
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,423	| IOT211 |	We saw that it had
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,703	| IOT211 |	Over a hundred thousand
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,727	| IOT211 |	Switch actually surprise me
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:31,775	| IOT211 |	But if
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,823	| IOT211 |	Has over 5 million
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT211 |	Downloads
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,871	| IOT211 |	It is in the Google Play Store
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:43,551	| IOT211 |	Lot of people using this more people than I anticipated but not quite as many as you know a super star break
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,599	| IOT211 |	So it makes sense that Comcast would
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,623	| IOT211 |	Be like yeah we don't need to stop
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:50,463	| IOT211 |	And if you have your stringify flows
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,023	| IOT211 |	Those are going to be available to you until June
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,303	| IOT211 |	And then they're going to die
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,351	| IOT211 |	So I guess I have you a good time till
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,911	| IOT211 |	Which kind of leads into 2
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,935	| IOT211 |	Related topic
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,703	| IOT211 |	Extra questions
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,263	| IOT211 |	What do you do where do you go
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,567	| IOT211 |	Instead of stringify like we can tackle that first
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,359	| IOT211 |	Then the second question is
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,455	| IOT211 |	How do you get your stuff out of stringify and the easy answer is
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,479	| IOT211 |	You really don't
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:16,831	| IOT211 |	I hate to say it and there needs to be a new and I see we've been talking about this
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT211 |	For the past couple days
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,391	| IOT211 |	All of these
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| IOT211 |	Routine type platforms
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:24,767	| IOT211 |	Are built on standards to a point because they're using
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:29,119	| IOT211 |	The available apis for all of these devices and hugs and such
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| IOT211 |	2
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,679	| IOT211 |	And they put up a nice interface
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,471	| IOT211 |	Front of them and make them work together
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,495	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:37,055	| IOT211 |	Those are out there and available for anybody
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT211 |	But
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:41,919	| IOT211 |	The interphase part there's no import there's no export so it's not like you can
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:46,527	| IOT211 |	Get those routines out and moves away from stringify to an if this then that person
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,831	| IOT211 |	So yes you have to
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,415	| IOT211 |	You have to say to yourself I am prepared to spend another few hours
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,743	| IOT211 |	Taking all the things I did on stringify and moving it over to another
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:59,583	| IOT211 |	It is unfortunate I would love for the industry to come up
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,351	| IOT211 |	With
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:03,935	| IOT211 |	Because he's are all API calls are most of these are API calls it does
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:06,239	| IOT211 |	Make a challenging but I would love for them to come up with
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,263	| IOT211 |	Looks like a file format where
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,847	| IOT211 |	Pull these API calls and be like hey
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,127	| IOT211 |	I want the same thing to happen
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT211 |	In this new play
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:17,503	| IOT211 |	Some people might just shrug and be like that's what you get for being an early adopter
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:21,855	| IOT211 |	I think it also will help with things like vendor lock-in
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:24,927	| IOT211 |	So I've had people ask me there like God are you worried that you know
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:29,279	| IOT211 |	If you adopt Google then you can adopt Amazon later and I
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,815	| IOT211 |	Like actually I have
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,327	| IOT211 |	But I see
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,887	| IOT211 |	Super
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:36,447	| IOT211 |	Options if you're asking if I use Arduino
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT211 |	If this then that
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,031	| IOT211 |	Would you say node-red is another potential option
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:42,335	| IOT211 |	Yeah actually know red would be
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| IOT211 |	Interested now
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,919	| IOT211 |	You have to run node red on a
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,455	| IOT211 |	So you still
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,759	| IOT211 |	They put on a Raspberry Pi or something
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,039	| IOT211 |	Yes you have
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,319	| IOT211 |	You can't just like be like
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,343	| IOT211 |	Go to the web
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,951	| IOT211 |	You can't just have your phone
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,487	| IOT211 |	There's no node red app for your phone
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,303	| IOT211 |	That's going to be a little bit of an issue
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,839	| IOT211 |	In there a lot of
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,863	| IOT211 |	Things like that out
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,679	| IOT211 |	They're so you can run that on a Raspberry Pi and that has
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| IOT211 |	Very similar
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,775	| IOT211 |	Flow-based it's two ways you like run things around and
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,847	| IOT211 |	Oh no
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:15,359	| IOT211 |	Bad
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:22,271	| IOT211 |	The Raspberry Pi is your typical device that you would run node red on cuz a pie in the most you can spend on your Raspberry Pi like $35
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,087	| IOT211 |	You can run it locally you can actually have a
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:28,159	| IOT211 |	Create a Docker container if you have a Linux machine you could do it there
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| IOT211 |	You can
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,695	| IOT211 |	Do it with
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,231	| IOT211 |	An Arduino or a
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,511	| IOT211 |	Beaglebone black
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,559	| IOT211 |	Or if you use
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:37,375	| IOT211 |	And I know a lot about be familiar with us but I've used it before
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,447	| IOT211 |	The termux app in Android
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,775	| IOT211 |	Which is basically a terminal emulator you could run it there
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,543	| IOT211 |	Or
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,567	| IOT211 |	If you were like me and
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,127	| IOT211 |	Gravitating towards the crack cloud
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,943	| IOT211 |	You can put on IBM Cloud sent Technic
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,455	| IOT211 |	Fred
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,991	| IOT211 |	Never heard of that
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:55,295	| IOT211 |	Amazon web services or Microsoft azure
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,599	| IOT211 |	What's right I got a check for that after the
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:01,183	| IOT211 |	So you had a lot of options but nobody like you said says no like
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,231	| IOT211 |	App to download to your phone and just get going
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,095	| IOT211 |	And in that same day there a lot of other platform
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,631	| IOT211 |	So you could use it or not
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,167	| IOT211 |	Read so you can use openhab
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,215	| IOT211 |	You could use home assistant
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| IOT211 |	You could use
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,031	| IOT211 |	Homebridge
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:18,079	| IOT211 |	And all of those are
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,407	| IOT211 |	Open source base programs that let you download their
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:24,479	| IOT211 |	Trolls basically to a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:24,991	| IOT211 |	Blink all that up
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,575	| IOT211 |	And like stringify these are actually incredibly
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,367	| IOT211 |	Create all sorts of
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:31,903	| IOT211 |	But
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,183	| IOT211 |	Directions
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,023	| IOT211 |	I I find myself in some way
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| IOT211 |	I'm Paralyzed by
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,863	| IOT211 |	You don't like all my God there's so many features
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,167	| IOT211 |	Like you can see sensors and your devices that
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,447	| IOT211 |	Even the manufacturer
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,335	| IOT211 |	Yeah it gets down to how a how technical you want to get like
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:53,919	| IOT211 |	If you want to get into building things with HTML and JavaScript
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,199	| IOT211 |	And you're comfortable with that
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,991	| IOT211 |	Yeah I know right can do that for you at work
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,527	| IOT211 |	Can offer that to you
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,063	| IOT211 |	But you can be tinkering a lot
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,343	| IOT211 |	How do you know if same width
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,367	| IOT211 |	The other is that you
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,159	| IOT211 |	You know you mentioned you're going to be tinkering
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,999	| IOT211 |	This is not none of these are like a cortical off-the-shelf solution
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,535	| IOT211 |	But those are the off the shelf
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| IOT211 |	Shirley software-based
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,863	| IOT211 |	The same way that stringify was
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:16,447	| IOT211 |	Would be something like you know me yonomi
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,471	| IOT211 |	They have a software platform
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:24,383	| IOT211 |	It doesn't have as much granularity but it is really easy to use and the cool thing about you know me is you can
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:24,895	| IOT211 |	Actually
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| IOT211 |	Run the app
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,991	| IOT211 |	It'll discover a lot of the devices at your house
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,807	| IOT211 |	And will actually automatically start suggesting
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,599	| IOT211 |	Recipezaar floser
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,159	| IOT211 |	Apps that lets whatever you want to call them
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,463	| IOT211 |	For you using the particular devices
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,487	| IOT211 |	Since you have which
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| IOT211 |	I think is really used
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,839	| IOT211 |	I like that a lot that that starts getting this
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:48,447	| IOT211 |	Putting the smart in the smart home and it's only got mad amazed been doing with the the hunches
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,983	| IOT211 |	Yes although I haven't seen her
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:55,103	| IOT211 |	No and I'm home all the time I couldn't let me out so I'm shocked
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,383	| IOT211 |	Do you know
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,711	| IOT211 |	I'm pretty I have a very repeatable process between
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:04,063	| IOT211 |	Coffee writing naptime Netflix and so on so I don't get it
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,391	| IOT211 |	Yeah and I haven't gotten guard either I signed up for the beta program
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:15,071	| IOT211 |	None of them have happened for me that's where the echo will listen for broken glass as a security feature
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,631	| IOT211 |	Yes okay if that was a little Segway Sino
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,655	| IOT211 |	That wasn't a Segway
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:25,823	| IOT211 |	A day in the life of Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:30,175	| IOT211 |	Bats you so other than you know me there is everybody's favorite if
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| IOT211 |	Which
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| IOT211 |	We actually talked about
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,783	| IOT211 |	Fairly recently there's some
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,599	| IOT211 |	Turmoil ifft leadership changes that sort of
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,111	| IOT211 |	Think so
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| IOT211 |	I still say they get bought
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,183	| IOT211 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,999	| IOT211 |	I say they get bought by a Google or Amazon
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,023	| IOT211 |	We'll see
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,071	| IOT211 |	So if this
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:49,119	| IOT211 |	Still a good option it is
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,679	| IOT211 |	Not you can't do the multi-pronged
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| IOT211 |	Applets you
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,983	| IOT211 |	You have to do everything into
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| IOT211 |	If it really so it's not as powerful
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,287	| IOT211 |	And then
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,103	| IOT211 |	If you're a SmartThings user you could actually build
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,895	| IOT211 |	Your own apps for some of the stuff
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,223	| IOT211 |	Ann Dunham Google
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:04,991	| IOT211 |	Oh you're groovies cuz
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| IOT211 |	Groovy language
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,927	| IOT211 |	And if you're an Amazon Echo or a Google home user
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,487	| IOT211 |	Could actually build some routines
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,023	| IOT211 |	And
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,071	| IOT211 |	Uses for voice control the cool thing about
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,607	| IOT211 |	The
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,655	| IOT211 |	Stringify thing was they didn't actually
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| IOT211 |	They have to be based on voice
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,727	| IOT211 |	Json
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,007	| IOT211 |	Voice but they could have been based on
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,519	| IOT211 |	Jamaica Center trick
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,311	| IOT211 |	We are any trigger event
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:32,383	| IOT211 |	You can't get if your home cat though you can use sensors as a
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,407	| IOT211 |	For certain
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:38,271	| IOT211 |	Because I believe the column automations in the home app
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,551	| IOT211 |	Automation
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,855	| IOT211 |	So many so many
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,135	| IOT211 |	Okay
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,439	| IOT211 |	So those are your alternatives
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:49,535	| IOT211 |	In just we wrote it I wrote a post about this on the site I said that
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,583	| IOT211 |	Stringify
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,095	| IOT211 |	And
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,655	| IOT211 |	The post earlier this week about
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,727	| IOT211 |	People being like we can't recommend the wink Hub anymore which
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,751	| IOT211 |	Kevin and I are also
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,287	| IOT211 |	Little cautious about the
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,359	| IOT211 |	I said this was the end of the Wild West era
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,895	| IOT211 |	In
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:09,247	| IOT211 |	Just put that in perspective I thought I really did I really thought back in 2012
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,015	| IOT211 |	When we started this that
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,319	| IOT211 |	You were going to be able to pull Lake
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:16,671	| IOT211 |	Sensors and outlets and connected devices and in the create your own stuff with
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,951	| IOT211 |	Kind of like Yahoo
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,463	| IOT211 |	Pipes
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,255	| IOT211 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:25,631	| IOT211 |	But just just build your own experiences in a way that was pretty easy in
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT211 |	I'm pretty
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:26,911	| IOT211 |	Reliable
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,191	| IOT211 |	That never happen
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:34,079	| IOT211 |	Yeah I mean because things are getting siloed unfortunately
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,359	| IOT211 |	To the different platforms
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:41,759	| IOT211 |	There is still the the open-source options that you mentioned and mainstream people are not going to likely
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:44,063	| IOT211 |	Get a Raspberry Pi install openhab or something like that
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:47,903	| IOT211 |	But your vision but you had in 2012
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:51,743	| IOT211 |	Is available to people if they want to put the time and effort into it
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,791	| IOT211 |	Yeah I just thought I'd be more
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:58,399	| IOT211 |	It is available to everyone but not everybody wants
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,471	| IOT211 |	To invest the time and Technical knowledge and learning
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,751	| IOT211 |	To do it yeah I was hoping
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:06,591	| IOT211 |	I was hoping you'd be the kind of like creating a Wix or Squarespace
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,735	| IOT211 |	That's where we are
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,527	| IOT211 |	That's a lot of talk about that
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,111	| IOT211 |	Let's move on Google is having its
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,135	| IOT211 |	Cloud next event
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,903	| IOT211 |	This week which
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,207	| IOT211 |	Where it talks about all the cool stuff happening
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,743	| IOT211 |	Google Cloud universe
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,583	| IOT211 |	In the iot space Google is
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:34,239	| IOT211 |	Decidedly behind Amazon and Microsoft when it comes to hosting different Enterprises in
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,775	| IOT211 |	Building iot things
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,799	| IOT211 |	However
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:39,359	| IOT211 |	Google has taken that weakness and turn it into boom
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| IOT211 |	Strength
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:40,895	| IOT211 |	Very jiu-jitsu
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,455	| IOT211 |	They announced anthos
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:48,319	| IOT211 |	Which is Google clouds new platform that let you run a nap anywhere
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,391	| IOT211 |	And it is using Open Standards
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,183	| IOT211 |	It lets you run your
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:57,023	| IOT211 |	Apps in Google Cloud Amazon Cloud Microsoft cloud and
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| IOT211 |	It also pulls it down to the
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,095	| IOT211 |	The Edge and it does that
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,143	| IOT211 |	With that support for kubernetes which is
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,679	| IOT211 |	An open-source
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,471	| IOT211 |	Management platform
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,311	| IOT211 |	I don't really want to get too into the weeds here
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,591	| IOT211 |	But yeah
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:14,943	| IOT211 |	Liquid with a smart thing as you said they took a weakness and turn it into a strength
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,223	| IOT211 |	Basically anthers
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,039	| IOT211 |	Innocence becomes your Cloud management platform
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,855	| IOT211 |	Regardless of the cloud you use or
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,135	| IOT211 |	Where it is
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,415	| IOT211 |	It doesn't even have to be in the cloud
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:29,535	| IOT211 |	Yes that's correct it could be hybrid Cloud yes absolutely so you could have
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,863	| IOT211 |	And it nap something last year the Google offered by play some Google
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,679	| IOT211 |	They brought kubernetes to on-prem or on-site
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:37,215	| IOT211 |	So you could actually have
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:42,335	| IOT211 |	Have your stuff in the cloud and you could have her stuff locally or have redundancy between local and
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,127	| IOT211 |	Cloud and saucer worth
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:48,991	| IOT211 |	But now they be silly put like I a cloud management layer on top of
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:51,807	| IOT211 |	Everybody's Cloud which is really smart
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:56,927	| IOT211 |	And what that does if you're a developer or you're an it a business decision maker
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:01,279	| IOT211 |	You can literally go to One dashboard one portal
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,351	| IOT211 |	And manage or subscribe to
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,911	| IOT211 |	Move from one Cloud to another
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,191	| IOT211 |	In one place yours
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,239	| IOT211 |	Support is there for all of your class you are
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:14,591	| IOT211 |	Billing is there for all of your closet doesn't matter if you use Google or not
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,359	| IOT211 |	Cloud
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:15,871	| IOT211 |	And
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,943	| IOT211 |	That is really really smart my opinion of Google
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:25,087	| IOT211 |	Yeah you know I last year when I was at Microsoft build conference which actually build will be in a
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,111	| IOT211 |	Weeks in May
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,671	| IOT211 |	But I thought Microsoft was going to
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,999	| IOT211 |	This I thought Microsoft was going to create this overarching
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,047	| IOT211 |	Multi-cloud management system
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:36,095	| IOT211 |	Both at the cloud and at the edge
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:42,239	| IOT211 |	Because of their support for kubernetes and some of the things they were doing with things called that cubelets
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,007	| IOT211 |	Which where
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,799	| IOT211 |	Kubernetes for managing container
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| IOT211 |	Containerized software
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,407	| IOT211 |	So maybe we're going to see Microsoft launched something like this in a cup
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,711	| IOT211 |	And that would be
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,735	| IOT211 |	Yeah maybe
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,527	| IOT211 |	It would be interesting I think
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:17:00,415	| IOT211 |	Google certainly knows they're behind and they would love for people to come to Google Cloud for everything I get it
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:03,999	| IOT211 |	Microsoft's obviously one of the biggest players here
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,279	| IOT211 |	Repeating mostly against
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| IOT211 |	Amazon
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,119	| IOT211 |	I don't know if Microsoft needs
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,911	| IOT211 |	Do that's what Google is doing
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,959	| IOT211 |	They might just to say we can do that too
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,031	| IOT211 |	The reason the world is going to end
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:16,543	| IOT211 |	Need this
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:17,567	| IOT211 |	Is
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:18,591	| IOT211 |	Cuz
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,639	| IOT211 |	In a business setting
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,687	| IOT211 |	You're not just going to have your cloud
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:25,759	| IOT211 |	How to manage like if you think of like a Supply Chain management thing
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:30,623	| IOT211 |	You're going to have other people you're going to want to see data and run applications
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,927	| IOT211 |	That tie back to your business
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| IOT211 |	On other
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| IOT211 |	Peoples
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,487	| IOT211 |	It infrastructure
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,279	| IOT211 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| IOT211 |	Yeah actually me
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:43,935	| IOT211 |	Maybe the movie infrastructure savings or something
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:46,239	| IOT211 |	I see this actually be really important
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,007	| IOT211 |	And it could
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,079	| IOT211 |	Zach Edwards tell me about containers which are
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,615	| IOT211 |	Are easily Deployable like
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,407	| IOT211 |	Basically applications using only
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,991	| IOT211 |	Imagine you can just throw an application on
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,271	| IOT211 |	One of your
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,807	| IOT211 |	Suppliers
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,879	| IOT211 |	Edge so you can monitor what you need to
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:06,207	| IOT211 |	Having that management layer becomes really essential
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:09,535	| IOT211 |	It might make sense just not just as Google turn in
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:15,423	| IOT211 |	Weakness into a strength but also because the world were going to live in to Manza in this actually would be better than like
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,191	| IOT211 |	Pulling like 8
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:16,959	| IOT211 |	Ati's and that's worth
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,007	| IOT211 |	Secure
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,567	| IOT211 |	Customization
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,079	| IOT211 |	Control
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:28,479	| IOT211 |	A lot of flexibility yes struggle with like
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,039	| IOT211 |	Maintaining them making shirts
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,575	| IOT211 |	Like communicating with people about like
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,343	| IOT211 |	What's going to go down
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,391	| IOT211 |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:39,743	| IOT211 |	So I think this is a really big deal and it's a really big shift and
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,535	| IOT211 |	It'll be very important
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,815	| IOT211 |	For all these companies were like
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,911	| IOT211 |	I'm going to use iot to make my everything better
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:50,239	| IOT211 |	Yeah and just to mention a couple companies of
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,519	| IOT211 |	We're partners
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,031	| IOT211 |	Spanish for this
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,311	| IOT211 |	Platform anthes
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:59,967	| IOT211 |	Google has enlisted some of the usual suspects but now I'm something that surprised me as well VMware and Dell
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,503	| IOT211 |	They they are very often
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:04,319	| IOT211 |	Google Partners as well as partners with the other cloud services
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| IOT211 |	Hpe
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,623	| IOT211 |	Intel and Lenovo
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,927	| IOT211 |	It's not like they have
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,719	| IOT211 |	Small no-name company set of
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,023	| IOT211 |	Glommed onto this so
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,607	| IOT211 |	Yeah that's what you're going to need if you're going to if you're going to succeed with us
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:17,887	| IOT211 |	That's a good start
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,679	| IOT211 |	Next up
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:24,287	| IOT211 |	We're going to be talking about a collaboration between Sonos and Ikea B
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,823	| IOT211 |	Furniture store
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,615	| IOT211 |	And the smart speaker
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| IOT211 |	Company
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:30,431	| IOT211 |	The connected Speaker Company have launched a
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,991	| IOT211 |	Well-to-do speakers one
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,783	| IOT211 |	Is a bookshelf speaker
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,831	| IOT211 |	That is about 99 bucks
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,855	| IOT211 |	Electrolux
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:41,439	| IOT211 |	It's pretty good. The other is $179 table lamp
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,487	| IOT211 |	That is also a smart speaker
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,767	| IOT211 |	And it
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,815	| IOT211 |	It's ugly
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,095	| IOT211 |	It yet
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:53,471	| IOT211 |	It's it's typical Ikea design one color I could live with the other color that's going to be available in August I could not
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,263	| IOT211 |	So but
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,311	| IOT211 |	It's $179 for the
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,151	| IOT211 |	Lamp that has the speaker built-in and it's 99 for the
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:04,479	| IOT211 |	Connected bookshelf speaker which definitely looks nice and
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,759	| IOT211 |	I don't know it sounds like that because
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,807	| IOT211 |	But
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:14,207	| IOT211 |	It probably sounds so it probably doesn't mean if they work with Sonos I'm sure there was some kind of specifications and tuning and so on
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,231	| IOT211 |	The strange thing is
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,791	| IOT211 |	They're kind of dumping he's a smart speaker
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:22,655	| IOT211 |	But there's no microphones built in so I thought originally like
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,191	| IOT211 |	Maybe I could replace one of the
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:28,287	| IOT211 |	You dozens of smart speakers I have in the house like a Google home
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,055	| IOT211 |	Mini
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,335	| IOT211 |	With this lamp
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,127	| IOT211 |	Because it's a smart speaker
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,431	| IOT211 |	But there's no microphones built into either one of these
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:38,783	| IOT211 |	Yeah and that's because Ikea was worried about
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| IOT211 |	Turning off privacy phone
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:44,415	| IOT211 |	People and I think when they call it a smart speaker they're talking about it as a connected
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,999	| IOT211 |	Again we're getting connected and Sonos I mean
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,327	| IOT211 |	I have Sonos speakers since like 2007
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,143	| IOT211 |	They weren't smart they were just connected but basically
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,983	| IOT211 |	They're connected the internet so they can play your Spotify or Pandora
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,263	| IOT211 |	Ever so that's what
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:20:59,775	| IOT211 |	They're talking about their
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,567	| IOT211 |	I'm not on board with this person
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,151	| IOT211 |	I'm about to go into a new house and it's
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,199	| IOT211 |	Could be rented so I can see picking up a
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| IOT211 |	A couple I mean I loved so
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,759	| IOT211 |	Sonos speakers that sound great
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,295	| IOT211 |	Work really well
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:12,831	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:18,464	| IOT211 |	I've been making a big push to add like they added Amazon's voice Services last year and this year they're
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,000	| IOT211 |	The waiting on it
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,280	| IOT211 |	One day soon
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:25,888	| IOT211 |	We supposed to be last year they're supposed to add to Google Assistant support but they haven't done that yet that's in the works
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:29,216	| IOT211 |	So it's weird to me like they're making this big push and yet
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,520	| IOT211 |	Bucyrus Brandon
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:36,640	| IOT211 |	Speakers won't stream and Ikea you know they've done kind of their own path with
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,224	| IOT211 |	Stuff so it's possible that this is
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,736	| IOT211 |	What people want
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,272	| IOT211 |	And we're just crazy
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| IOT211 |	I guess
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,088	| IOT211 |	Who knows
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:50,464	| IOT211 |	Okay let's talk about inference at the edge specifically with regards to smart
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:50,976	| IOT211 |	Videoke
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:53,792	| IOT211 |	There is a conference happening right now this
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,864	| IOT211 |	This is ISC West this is an international
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,144	| IOT211 |	Security and control systems
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:21:59,936	| IOT211 |	And you can
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,960	| IOT211 |	Sensors
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,728	| IOT211 |	Can see all kinds of
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,240	| IOT211 |	Cool stuff
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,288	| IOT211 |	Big trend
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,312	| IOT211 |	Apparently is
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,128	| IOT211 |	Video cameras with built-in surveillance
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:13,248	| IOT211 |	They have chips that are capable of running at the edge so running these models
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,528	| IOT211 |	To determine who people are
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,808	| IOT211 |	Baby
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,576	| IOT211 |	Are they people
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,624	| IOT211 |	Are they doing something weird
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,160	| IOT211 |	Maybe even identifying people
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,696	| IOT211 |	Who are supposed to be there
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,000	| IOT211 |	So this is not brand new
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,048	| IOT211 |	But it is definitely
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:29,376	| IOT211 |	Going to be it's going to start being much more difficult to buy a video cam
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,400	| IOT211 |	It doesn't happen
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:35,008	| IOT211 |	So Western Digital announced their new storage system
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:36,032	| IOT211 |	4
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,312	| IOT211 |	These cameras
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,592	| IOT211 |	Set ability to process
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,872	| IOT211 |	Crap ton of data with
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,664	| IOT211 |	Best 4K video cameras
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:44,224	| IOT211 |	And it also allows for storage and in
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,504	| IOT211 |	The edge
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:51,648	| IOT211 |	Call, announce the new chips so they have the Qualcomm Vision intelligence 400 and 300 platforms they're using
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,440	| IOT211 |	Latest
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:58,048	| IOT211 |	Qcs 605 and qcs 603 soces
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| IOT211 |	That was a lot of
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,864	| IOT211 |	Data and nobody really needs to know
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,400	| IOT211 |	Anything about them except
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,936	| IOT211 |	You can basically do
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,216	| IOT211 |	Advanced
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:09,312	| IOT211 |	All of that for
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,080	| IOT211 |	That has computer
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:14,688	| IOT211 |	Back to mention a ton of partners that are planning to use these chips
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,968	| IOT211 |	It's like
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:16,992	| IOT211 |	Well over a dozen
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,040	| IOT211 |	That's kind of surprising
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,368	| IOT211 |	Yeah the bullets it's becoming very much a
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:26,208	| IOT211 |	It's just an integral part people want cameras they want surveillance cameras and
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,232	| IOT211 |	They want
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:31,584	| IOT211 |	If you add computer vision at the edge or some sort of modeling capability
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,608	| IOT211 |	You can do two things
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:35,168	| IOT211 |	S1 you reduce the amount of data that you send that to
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,936	| IOT211 |	The cloud cuz you don't
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,960	| IOT211 |	How to send everything
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,520	| IOT211 |	To you can build a system for alerts
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:42,080	| IOT211 |	Like there are people in this area when there's not supposed to be people
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:45,664	| IOT211 |	Or these are unrecognized people in this area
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,688	| IOT211 |	You're being super rich
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,968	| IOT211 |	If you got a super amazing
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,480	| IOT211 |	Algorithm running
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,528	| IOT211 |	Cuz we've long had
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,880	| IOT211 |	Cameras right the challenge though is you got all this camera data and pee
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,160	| IOT211 |	People have to sort through it and
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,672	| IOT211 |	And it's time to
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,464	| IOT211 |	Impossible
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,768	| IOT211 |	And uses a lot of bandwidth as you said so if you can
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:04,096	| IOT211 |	Keep all that locally and have it processed with a
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,400	| IOT211 |	Model that is already trained
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,960	| IOT211 |	You don't have to send that data to the cloud I would think
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:11,264	| IOT211 |	That might help some people
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,800	| IOT211 |	Because it's a little scary in
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:15,872	| IOT211 |	One side you want surveillance the other side you don't want to be surveilled right
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:19,456	| IOT211 |	You know if you want surveillance if you're home early
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,224	| IOT211 |	Wechat business
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,272	| IOT211 |	And you don't want the
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,320	| IOT211 |	Cloud provider to have the information
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,344	| IOT211 |	What the camera sees
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,136	| IOT211 |	This could resolve that problem
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:31,232	| IOT211 |	Yeah in and having all that locally process data means you can dump it
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,512	| IOT211 |	And then
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,536	| IOT211 |	It's a little bit more privacy
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,328	| IOT211 |	It may not be
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,888	| IOT211 |	I believe it's faster to interns the recognition because
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| IOT211 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,216	| IOT211 |	Alright so
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,752	| IOT211 |	I think trans coming out of is
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,032	| IOT211 |	Next up
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:48,128	| IOT211 |	What's an update on the mysterious mr. Aldridge
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,456	| IOT211 |	So we talked about
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,248	| IOT211 |	Mistral on the last project
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,784	| IOT211 |	A quick recap is that
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,064	| IOT211 |	In Google
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:59,392	| IOT211 |	Chromium public codebase which I read for fun
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:02,464	| IOT211 |	I found a bunch of code for a new device called Mistral
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:07,840	| IOT211 |	And tied to that code was Gale and Gale is the current Google Wi-Fi device
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,632	| IOT211 |	Gail was the codename for that
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,960	| IOT211 |	So I get to speculation and some more digging running
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,984	| IOT211 |	Code and said huh
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:19,104	| IOT211 |	They're using the new Qualcomm QSC 404 and 405 chips
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:19,872	| IOT211 |	Which have
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:23,968	| IOT211 |	On-device voice recognition they have a zigbee chip
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:26,272	| IOT211 |	I5 cores
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,088	| IOT211 |	Have a smart speaker
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,112	| IOT211 |	Capabilities
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,904	| IOT211 |	Schedule sitting capabilities I should say
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:35,232	| IOT211 |	So my speculation was huh this could be
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:39,584	| IOT211 |	The next Google Wi-Fi product as either 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 device
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,632	| IOT211 |	So it'd be your Mesh networking
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| IOT211 |	Product
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,192	| IOT211 |	Cluster Google
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,960	| IOT211 |	Assistance
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,240	| IOT211 |	Such as in a Google home
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,800	| IOT211 |	Plus potentially and actual
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,568	| IOT211 |	3 radio
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT211 |	Smart home hub
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:56,480	| IOT211 |	Well I still don't know about the last bit because I haven't seen any mention of the zigbee radio in any code yet
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,040	| IOT211 |	However this week as I was
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:02,624	| IOT211 |	Spending my fun time reading through code I noticed
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,184	| IOT211 |	That there are now numerous mentions of mesh
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:08,000	| IOT211 |	Wi-Fi capabilities
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,024	| IOT211 |	In this device
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:13,888	| IOT211 |	And for LED lights just like what device that you have right now Stacy
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,448	| IOT211 |	Google home
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,472	| IOT211 |	Google home
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:22,592	| IOT211 |	I don't know what to think of happy for you
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:27,712	| IOT211 |	He's probably true you probably do have lots of them but my specific in Frontier is
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,736	| IOT211 |	Yeah this is
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,784	| IOT211 |	Definitely at least a two-in-one now
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,576	| IOT211 |	Azure mesh Wi-Fi
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:35,136	| IOT211 |	Access point and War
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,672	| IOT211 |	As well as a Google home device
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:40,512	| IOT211 |	So I'm still waiting to see if there's any zigbee code Adam and I will keep
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,048	| IOT211 |	Looking because I love to Rico
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| IOT211 |	Yay
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,864	| IOT211 |	Alright other
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,888	| IOT211 |	Cool news bits
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:46,656	| IOT211 |	Eve
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:49,984	| IOT211 |	IT company that makes sensors just for Apple's homekit program
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,568	| IOT211 |	They have a new energy strip that is available
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,592	| IOT211 |	This is like
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,640	| IOT211 |	Protectors any
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,176	| IOT211 |	Individually control different Outlets
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,968	| IOT211 |	And that is what that is
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,296	| IOT211 |	What is it it's a smart
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,600	| IOT211 |	Power strip that work with tonkatsu
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,624	| IOT211 |	It has three
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,136	| IOT211 |	Regular
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,928	| IOT211 |	Electrical outlets in it
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,464	| IOT211 |	As well as it looks like
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,488	| IOT211 |	Possibly
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,256	| IOT211 |	Q yuan
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,280	| IOT211 |	Babies
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,072	| IOT211 |	How to tell from the pictures
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,608	| IOT211 |	It does it does have a couple USBS
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,912	| IOT211 |	It is a surge protector as well
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,192	| IOT211 |	Drax actor
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:26,336	| IOT211 |	Yeah it has direct Wi-Fi connection so it should be very easy to set up so it's not like you're gonna have to
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,616	| IOT211 |	Mess around with an e
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:30,688	| IOT211 |	Your network settings to too much there
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,480	| IOT211 |	And then obviously you could use
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,784	| IOT211 |	Homekit automations to
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,576	| IOT211 |	Turn things on or off that are plugged into this
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:37,856	| IOT211 |	And it'll be a hoe
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:39,904	| IOT211 |	9995
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| IOT211 |	All right
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:45,280	| IOT211 |	Another newspaper JD Powers
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,304	| IOT211 |	Where's the company that we
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,608	| IOT211 |	I associated with JD Power Ranking
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:51,680	| IOT211 |	Kingsbury sing so like how awesome a company is and turn
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,496	| IOT211 |	Consumer sentiment surveys
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:57,824	| IOT211 |	But they also do benchmarking and they are
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:00,384	| IOT211 |	They've signed a deal with company called uptake
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,152	| IOT211 |	That is based in
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,920	| IOT211 |	Chicago
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| IOT211 |	And take
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:06,784	| IOT211 |	Basically pulls in tons of data and they suggest models to make
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:08,064	| IOT211 |	Prediction
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,112	| IOT211 |	Take whatever action you think
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,904	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,952	| IOT211 |	The two companies have gotten together to
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:20,352	| IOT211 |	Create new benchmarks based on the automotive industry in this is really interesting what they're doing is there pool
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,376	| IOT211 |	Pulling in data from
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,448	| IOT211 |	Connected factories from connected cars
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,984	| IOT211 |	And they're trying to
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,520	| IOT211 |	Figure out
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:30,336	| IOT211 |	What kind of metrics might make sense for
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:33,152	| IOT211 |	Future vehicles in terms of
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,688	| IOT211 |	How long it takes for
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,992	| IOT211 |	Service how happy people are with them that sort of
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:44,928	| IOT211 |	It's really fascinating and I'm actually going to try to get JD Powers to come on the show to talk about what they're hoping to get out of this in
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:47,488	| IOT211 |	Workouts because are also going to apply this to the
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,768	| IOT211 |	The Telecommunications industry
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,584	| IOT211 |	And the utilities industry
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:52,864	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:56,448	| IOT211 |	Discount of a little teaser expect more to come on this because I'm
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:00,544	| IOT211 |	Really interested in how they're going to pull industry-wide data and make that
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,592	| IOT211 |	Useful for consume
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:08,224	| IOT211 |	Yeah I am related to this and it's not
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:12,576	| IOT211 |	A direct relation but I noticed that on the Amazon developer blog this week
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,136	| IOT211 |	They showed a JD Power survey
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| IOT211 |	4
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,976	| IOT211 |	Consumer purchasing preferences of
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,488	| IOT211 |	Cars
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:23,840	| IOT211 |	And its related because 76% of the respondents
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,120	| IOT211 |	Said they would
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,936	| IOT211 |	Want the same brand of resource they have at home
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,216	| IOT211 |	Triana next vehicle
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:32,032	| IOT211 |	Sure that makes total sense you don't want multiple
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:34,080	| IOT211 |	Assistance one for him and one for your car
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,616	| IOT211 |	But more importantly
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,896	| IOT211 |	59%
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,200	| IOT211 |	Said they were more likely to buy a certain
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:41,504	| IOT211 |	Car or from a certain car company
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:43,552	| IOT211 |	If the voice service is available in the
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,624	| IOT211 |	Car so almost 6 and 10 car buyers
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,184	| IOT211 |	Want voice services in a car
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:55,584	| IOT211 |	According to JD Power survey with Amazon Amazon send me my auto echo my echo Auto
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,096	| IOT211 |	Please
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:58,656	| IOT211 |	That's right you ordered that into I did
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:04,288	| IOT211 |	Pussy pussy if you're worthy to have lunch

EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,432	| IOT211 |	Right upfront
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,200	| IOT211 |	But it's really cool
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,736	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,016	| IOT211 |	Let's hear from this week's scholar
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,344	| IOT211 |	Free to use this on the show
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,624	| IOT211 |	Myquest
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:24,160	| IOT211 |	Is I have a
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,672	| IOT211 |	Google home
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,792	| IOT211 |	My issue is whenever I have guests over if they like
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,072	| IOT211 |	To turn Z-Wave
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,144	| IOT211 |	I'd like to know how to stop my gas
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:34,656	| IOT211 |	From
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,216	| IOT211 |	Turning out the temperature for my Google Assistant
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:38,752	| IOT211 |	Thank you
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,520	| IOT211 |	All right
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,288	| IOT211 |	The first
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,056	| IOT211 |	I have bad news for
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,104	| IOT211 |	If these are your friends
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,992	| IOT211 |	That's how it's been how to stop this don't invite these people over anymore
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,808	| IOT211 |	Let's let's assume your friends are actually
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,368	| IOT211 |	Pretty decent human beings they just have to
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:54,880	| IOT211 |	Spunside
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,720	| IOT211 |	There's really one way to help
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,000	| IOT211 |	But it's going to be
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,024	| IOT211 |	It's it's a way that
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:01,792	| IOT211 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,816	| IOT211 |	You're going to want to
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,352	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:06,912	| IOT211 |	Google actually lets you do voice matching for this
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,424	| IOT211 |	Car sound system
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:08,960	| IOT211 |	B
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,240	| IOT211 |	All you do is
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,800	| IOT211 |	You can turn this on in your settings in the
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:15,872	| IOT211 |	Google home and then you will train your Google Assistant
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,664	| IOT211 |	To recognize your voice it's like you
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,944	| IOT211 |	Repeat phrases 3 times
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,480	| IOT211 |	And then it recognizes you
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,760	| IOT211 |	And then
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:23,552	| IOT211 |	Walla
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,832	| IOT211 |	Only when you say some
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,904	| IOT211 |	You're the admin of your house witch
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:28,928	| IOT211 |	Rate
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,464	| IOT211 |	Have all the power
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,000	| IOT211 |	Patella
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,096	| IOT211 |	If anyone else wants to use it back to train their voice
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| IOT211 |	So if you live with
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:38,400	| IOT211 |	More than just you
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:41,216	| IOT211 |	You're going to want to train their voice if you have children
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:43,776	| IOT211 |	You have to then implement this insane
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,312	| IOT211 |	So it takes forever
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,848	| IOT211 |	Where you have to create an account
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:47,872	| IOT211 |	Kids count
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:49,408	| IOT211 |	It it's not fun
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,432	| IOT211 |	It will take you time
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,736	| IOT211 |	And that's if they're under 13
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:53,248	| IOT211 |	That's if they're under 30
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:57,600	| IOT211 |	Is there over 13 they just have to have a Google account and
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,624	| IOT211 |	A Google Assistant
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:32:59,904	| IOT211 |	And then they Trade It
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,696	| IOT211 |	If they're going to trade it on your phone
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:04,768	| IOT211 |	Pro-tip they're not going to check your child age
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:08,864	| IOT211 |	But you still have to then they have to have a separate device to turn
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,400	| IOT211 |	Chapter
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,704	| IOT211 |	And then finally
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,264	| IOT211 |	As someone who is actually implemented voice
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,568	| IOT211 |	On voice matching on their Google device
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,336	| IOT211 |	It doesn't always work
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:22,688	| IOT211 |	So sometimes we even when I'm asking Google for something
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,712	| IOT211 |	It's like
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,224	| IOT211 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:25,760	| IOT211 |	I can't help you with that
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:28,320	| IOT211 |	If you would like to train your voice go and do this
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:34,208	| IOT211 |	Google I can't speak to that because I did not turn on voice match because
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:36,512	| IOT211 |	Say I don't have any friends so nobody comes
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:40,096	| IOT211 |	And be my everything work my family they would be very upset
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:43,424	| IOT211 |	Yeah my family it basically my house is Haji turn on television
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,216	| IOT211 |	And then she says
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,240	| IOT211 |	I have permission to
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:47,776	| IOT211 |	And then you hear
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:49,056	| IOT211 |	Harem anime
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:49,824	| IOT211 |	Turn on television
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:51,104	| IOT211 |	Group the time
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,176	| IOT211 |	That's usually how that operation
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,992	| IOT211 |	That and that explains why you have both
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:57,760	| IOT211 |	Pussy system
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,528	| IOT211 |	There you go
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:01,856	| IOT211 |	And this is an underlying problem that is not being addressed
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,136	| IOT211 |	In these
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,160	| IOT211 |	Which is
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:05,696	| IOT211 |	Peaceably admin rights for individual
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,488	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:09,024	| IOT211 |	Not everybody in your house should be
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,048	| IOT211 |	Be able to turn the
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:10,560	| IOT211 |	Heating and
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,888	| IOT211 |	Maybe not everyone in your house should have access to
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,680	| IOT211 |	The water's edge
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:19,264	| IOT211 |	Maybe not maybe not everyone in your house should have
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:20,800	| IOT211 |	The ability to
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:23,360	| IOT211 |	Invite people to open your door locks
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,920	| IOT211 |	That's actually most relaxed do actually have those say
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:26,944	| IOT211 |	So you can let p
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,712	| IOT211 |	People in
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,480	| IOT211 |	As an admin
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:28,992	| IOT211 |	Where's a gas
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:35,136	| IOT211 |	But it seems like there should be another layer of security in here at some point in the future
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,416	| IOT211 |	To say
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:38,464	| IOT211 |	Yes I am the admin of the house
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,512	| IOT211 |	And only the admin
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,840	| IOT211 |	Can change the thermostat or only the admin and these people
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:47,424	| IOT211 |	So the kind that gets one more granular as opposed to
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:53,056	| IOT211 |	Voice match which is an all-or-none situation number one and number two we have other devices that can help
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,360	| IOT211 |	Determine who's actually
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:35:00,480	| IOT211 |	In the room for example I presume that this person is gas or doing it when he's not in the room
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:01,504	| IOT211 |	You know and
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,040	| IOT211 |	If you have a camera in the room
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,600	| IOT211 |	Maybe the voices can say it wait
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,904	| IOT211 |	Anybody can turn ya now
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,208	| IOT211 |	You're not here that doesn't make sense
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,792	| IOT211 |	I was going to say what we actually need us both
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:17,888	| IOT211 |	You need the ability to know you recognize who is asking for something
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,424	| IOT211 |	And then you need a layer of
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,496	| IOT211 |	Basically like active directory for your home
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| IOT211 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,336	| IOT211 |	I can't believe you went there hello
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:29,920	| IOT211 |	CD for the smart home ad for iot the newest Azure service
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:34,784	| IOT211 |	Well I'm at Grimm
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,552	| IOT211 |	End
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,320	| IOT211 |	Devastated
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:36,832	| IOT211 |	The awful
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,928	| IOT211 |	I don't want to spend more time in
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,464	| IOT211 |	Skinny to make it easier
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,280	| IOT211 |	It's called at the end of
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:48,864	| IOT211 |	This week's news section that stay tuned for a message from our sponsor

EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:02,688	| IOT211 |	We need to think about biomarkers for medical devices and how we're authenticating and actually doing some
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,224	| IOT211 |	Some reviewing of
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,504	| IOT211 |	Claims about certain

EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:21,888	| IOT211 |	After a message
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:29,568	| IOT211 |	Dispenser is software AG hey everyone we are taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:35,456	| IOT211 |	I guess for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is software Ag and I have John MacTavish
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,760	| IOT211 |	Who's in the iot group as software AG
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,856	| IOT211 |	This week we're going to talk about how to succeed in the iot
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,392	| IOT211 |	But before we do that
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:45,184	| IOT211 |	Can you remind us what it is
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,208	| IOT211 |	Software AG does
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:47,232	| IOT211 |	India

EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,624	| IOT211 |	And we also have
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,392	| IOT211 |	Different Analytics
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,184	| IOT211 |	Solution second layer on top
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:22,304	| IOT211 |	We're here to talk about how we can Succeed In The Internet of Things
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,352	| IOT211 |	What are the first things we should think about
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,632	| IOT211 |	Taking this on
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,168	| IOT211 |	A couple things
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:27,936	| IOT211 |	1
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,240	| IOT211 |	Drive to project really map to keep it
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:33,312	| IOT211 |	It's really been driven down by a bee
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,616	| IOT211 |	Why I say that is
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:39,200	| IOT211 |	Make it successful you really have to have by in that
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,736	| IOT211 |	Iot can solve a critical Miss
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:43,296	| IOT211 |	That's really the basic tonight
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,064	| IOT211 |	Project going
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:48,672	| IOT211 |	Successful iot project understanding ecosystem
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,208	| IOT211 |	Ic3 critical parts
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:51,744	| IOT211 |	The hardware Park
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,536	| IOT211 |	Safari Park
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:54,304	| IOT211 |	And the application
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,328	| IOT211 |	Analytics Spark
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,608	| IOT211 |	Personally I'd like to talk about
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:57,632	| IOT211 |	Hardware
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,448	| IOT211 |	Understand that
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,472	| IOT211 |	Securing Hardware
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,496	| IOT211 |	Installing Hardware
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:05,312	| IOT211 |	It's a critical part and not every company has strength
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:05,824	| IOT211 |	In the space
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,360	| IOT211 |	That is one part of the
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:10,176	| IOT211 |	Ecosystem yet understand either to do that internally or Outsource
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:14,784	| IOT211 |	The second part Stacey is really getting the date of slowing and that's what team lost
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT211 |	What's the data
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,624	| IOT211 |	Percentage outside
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| IOT211 |	Shenzhen Hardware
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,672	| IOT211 |	Jimmy John's Pekin
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:22,720	| IOT211 |	Manage that data
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,000	| IOT211 |	To the application layer
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,792	| IOT211 |	And the third part of the ecosystem
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,816	| IOT211 |	Really see application
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,400	| IOT211 |	Quinoa as a great application
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:34,496	| IOT211 |	Quickly I design applications to get data
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:35,264	| IOT211 |	To the business
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:35,776	| IOT211 |	People that need them
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:38,848	| IOT211 |	We also have three different Analytics
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:39,872	| IOT211 |	Solutions II
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:43,200	| IOT211 |	That has a greater layer of value
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,040	| IOT211 |	Ways to make a really really great decision
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:48,832	| IOT211 |	Change within you
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,928	| IOT211 |	Okay and what are some of the common pitfalls when trying to implement
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,952	| IOT211 |	Some sort of Iota
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,464	| IOT211 |	T strategy
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:39:01,120	| IOT211 |	Moving too fast too quickly it's one of the things I see these these projects can take a long long time diplomats
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,912	| IOT211 |	And trying to bite off more than
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:06,240	| IOT211 |	What is that really mean
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,544	| IOT211 |	He's really to try to connect
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:12,384	| IOT211 |	Quite different multiple products at once
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,176	| IOT211 |	Let's just pick one product
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,456	| IOT211 |	Through the volume
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:15,968	| IOT211 |	Business case
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:17,760	| IOT211 |	And then move on
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:18,528	| IOT211 |	Prescribed
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:24,160	| IOT211 |	In John where can I go to find out more about software Ag and the cumulus

EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:48,992	| IOT211 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,016	| IOT211 |	Andy Corbett
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:53,344	| IOT211 |	Who is the CEO and co-founder of Elektra
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,392	| IOT211 |	Hi Eddie how are you
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:57,184	| IOT211 |	Hygrate
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:57,952	| IOT211 |	Thanks for having me
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:40:01,024	| IOT211 |	I am super excited because we are going to talk about
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:02,816	| IOT211 |	Iot
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,096	| IOT211 |	In healthcare
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,912	| IOT211 |	That's my happy noise
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:09,984	| IOT211 |	Alright so let's kick it off with telling everybody
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:12,544	| IOT211 |	What it is that you were trying to do with Electra
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:18,688	| IOT211 |	So we are working with connected devices that can remote monitor people in their own homes
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:25,344	| IOT211 |	Where we really started was over time we realized that people are increasingly more honest with their phones and their with their
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:28,160	| IOT211 |	And if you ask anyone
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:28,928	| IOT211 |	Including myself
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:34,048	| IOT211 |	How many times do you work out last week I would probably give you a number that's far higher than what my Fitbit says
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,840	| IOT211 |	I mean if you think about
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:41,728	| IOT211 |	A lot of people like we hate filling out surveys to get any sort of remote data and so a lot of these Technologies
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:47,104	| IOT211 |	Finally got Joe point where they're collecting clinical-grade data they can do and pass away in your own home
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:49,920	| IOT211 |	And they don't look terrible no more and more people wearing connected products
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:52,480	| IOT211 |	And so what we're doing with Electra is helping
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:58,112	| IOT211 |	Mostly today Pharma companies in overtime doctors and payers and providers use resource
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,136	| IOT211 |	Connected jewels
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:01,696	| IOT211 |	Remotely and have better relationships with their
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:03,488	| IOT211 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:08,096	| IOT211 |	That is awesome and exciting and really promising and also scary as all get-out
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,632	| IOT211 |	So we're going to dig into
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,144	| IOT211 |	All of
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:11,680	| IOT211 |	But first
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:14,752	| IOT211 |	Just the idea of being able to do this
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,544	| IOT211 |	Is
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:19,360	| IOT211 |	Confusing to me in some ways because I feel like
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:23,456	| IOT211 |	I have a lot of these connected devices and that might range for my Fitbit 2
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,992	| IOT211 |	I used to have this
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,272	| IOT211 |	Crazy like anti-snoring
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,296	| IOT211 |	Device Italy
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:30,624	| IOT211 |	Attract my story made all sorts of
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,648	| IOT211 |	Correlations about my health
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:32,928	| IOT211 |	But
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,952	| IOT211 |	All of these things
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,232	| IOT211 |	They're not
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:39,328	| IOT211 |	Really FDA-approved necessarily or peer-reviewed so I kind of called them digital snake
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:42,656	| IOT211 |	So I'm really curious how you guys are
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:43,936	| IOT211 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,960	| IOT211 |	Making sure
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:46,240	| IOT211 |	These devices are actually
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:47,520	| IOT211 |	Trying to write
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,544	| IOT211 |	Conclusions at your house
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,312	| IOT211 |	Counts from the data
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:51,360	| IOT211 |	The Wanted
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,128	| IOT211 |	Things that off
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,431	| IOT211 |	Healthcare is Eid around
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:54,943	| IOT211 |	Digital health
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:57,247	| IOT211 |	What happened with a lot of visual health is
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,527	| IOT211 |	Really think about what not to do
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:02,111	| IOT211 |	So anything that has stopped wearing Healthcare from
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,647	| IOT211 |	Medical records
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:09,791	| IOT211 |	And other connected devices to app seem to be in the surrounding digital house which sometimes feels a little bit more oily than having actual
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:13,375	| IOT211 |	Find it there's been a movement because
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:14,911	| IOT211 |	People don't realize that these
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:19,775	| IOT211 |	Did Jules have a pretty meaningful way to really change how we deliver care and and you need
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:24,895	| IOT211 |	To think about how do we actually build a regulatory strategy and instead of trust around
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:25,663	| IOT211 |	Quality
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,711	| IOT211 |	And so there's been a movement towards
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:28,735	| IOT211 |	Call digital medicine
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:30,783	| IOT211 |	Where did medicine is a subset of
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,343	| IOT211 |	Is your house that has that level of Clue
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:39,487	| IOT211 |	And many people split into about three different categories so stop wearing algorithms
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:40,511	| IOT211 |	Take a measurement
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:43,327	| IOT211 |	Stop that do some sort of diagnosis
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,119	| IOT211 |	Measure and diagnose
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:51,007	| IOT211 |	Treat and there's a whole realm of new product called digital Therapeutics that have that sort of treating capability
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,823	| IOT211 |	Okay that is a lot
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:56,383	| IOT211 |	And what is the goal of your company in this white
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,175	| IOT211 |	Talked about
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:42:59,199	| IOT211 |	Biomarkers in
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:00,223	| IOT211 |	Acting is Cisco
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:01,247	| IOT211 |	Pharmacy
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:03,807	| IOT211 |	For digital Health Products what is that actually
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,623	| IOT211 |	Yes we focus on the measure
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:09,439	| IOT211 |	JD around digital biomarkers
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:13,791	| IOT211 |	And using software younger than that can measure some sort of Behavioral physiological
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,839	| IOT211 |	Should I be something like
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:17,631	| IOT211 |	Step count with picture
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,655	| IOT211 |	Height weight age
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:21,471	| IOT211 |	Gyroscope accelerometer and then predict whether or not you make
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:26,079	| IOT211 |	So all of these artificial by markers are forms of types of algorithm that then
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:28,127	| IOT211 |	Can be used to either inform
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:28,895	| IOT211 |	Or drive
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:29,663	| IOT211 |	Different parts of care
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,967	| IOT211 |	Specifically we work with armor
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:33,247	| IOT211 |	Companies that are
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:37,855	| IOT211 |	Doing something called decentralized clinical trials which means they're collecting data outside of the clinic
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:41,183	| IOT211 |	And are collecting things like vital signs are tremors
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:42,719	| IOT211 |	Or any sort of product that
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,767	| IOT211 |	Expecting some sort of digital biomarker
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,583	| IOT211 |	Bedford assessment
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:50,399	| IOT211 |	Are you certifying the algorithms or
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,191	| IOT211 |	We have an atlas
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,983	| IOT211 |	That has six hundred and
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,263	| IOT211 |	40 different types
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,031	| IOT211 |	Chef products
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:57,055	| IOT211 |	And so
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:44:03,455	| IOT211 |	General Lee a Pharma company needs to think about which type of product they would want to use a cross for spectrum so wanted
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:07,807	| IOT211 |	Kaiser on verification and validation verification being if I walk a hundred steps
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,343	| IOT211 |	Is it measure on your stuff
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:12,671	| IOT211 |	Invalidation is does 100 step mean something for
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:16,255	| IOT211 |	I could just see you or for my Parkinson's or what my clinical population is
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:21,887	| IOT211 |	Second is around usability what's the battery life not worth it in the shower
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:23,167	| IOT211 |	It look like a prison bracelet
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:23,935	| IOT211 |	I wear it
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:29,055	| IOT211 |	Third is around the security principles for this don't like how do I actually manage the risk
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:35,455	| IOT211 |	If I'm instrumenting someone with multiple sensors like how do I think about the attack servicenow the person that something from hasn't released
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:36,479	| IOT211 |	Before
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,503	| IOT211 |	And enforce
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:38,271	| IOT211 |	Is around
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:40,063	| IOT211 |	BK Racing Engine
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:46,975	| IOT211 |	Accurate even if it's relatively usable even if it's relatively secure doesn't solve the Cambridge
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:47,999	| IOT211 |	Issue
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:48,767	| IOT211 |	Where
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,559	| IOT211 |	Data were shared and not
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:52,863	| IOT211 |	But we're here in a way that people did not enter
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:57,727	| IOT211 |	And what we do is we have instead of objective measures across
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,495	| IOT211 |	Insidious
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,287	| IOT211 |	Four Concepts and then
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:01,055	| IOT211 |	We
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,847	| IOT211 |	Score that effectively like Nutrish
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:07,199	| IOT211 |	Where you might say okay really need to make sure this has a peer-reviewed paper or it's been used
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:09,759	| IOT211 |	In an FDA level study and
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:11,807	| IOT211 |	Can cover how you think about accuracy
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:14,367	| IOT211 |	I don't really care if you can be used in the shower now that's not so
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:15,647	| IOT211 |	Important to us
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:16,927	| IOT211 |	And then you can make trade-offs
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| IOT211 |	To decide which
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:19,743	| IOT211 |	Type of choice quotes
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,511	| IOT211 |	Forgiven
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,279	| IOT211 |	Environment
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:25,375	| IOT211 |	I had never thought about that side effects may include dry mouth and hacking
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:25,887	| IOT211 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:32,543	| IOT211 |	Okay yeah so this would be something like my Fitbit or my Apple watch and I would just
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:36,895	| IOT211 |	I bring that in and it would be that for a specific type of use case cuz
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:39,711	| IOT211 |	My Fitbit might be awesome for steps the Apple watch might be
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:42,783	| IOT211 |	Great for measuring certain types of heart issues is at the way to think about it
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:46,879	| IOT211 |	Yeah and what's really been interesting as I think people historically is that okay we have
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:48,671	| IOT211 |	Consumer devices and then we have
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:51,231	| IOT211 |	Clinical devices in these things are totally different.
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:55,071	| IOT211 |	Starting to happen is that they're merging so many of the clinical device
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:58,655	| IOT211 |	Companies have been partnering with tech companies that have created more Nimble and
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,679	| IOT211 |	Products
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:02,495	| IOT211 |	Depending on what they need you might go for either
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:08,895	| IOT211 |	And so for many of the more traditionally consumer products they've been working with the FDA to the FDA has a new program called.
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:10,943	| IOT211 |	Pre-certification program and a number of
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:14,015	| IOT211 |	Big tech companies have been involved in it so damn son
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,039	| IOT211 |	Fairly which is an ox
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:16,319	| IOT211 |	Google
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:17,087	| IOT211 |	Apple
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:23,487	| IOT211 |	Fitbit and number of others are all working with the FDA to create higher evidence-based products that they can then submit and have part of
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:25,279	| IOT211 |	Regulatory and Healthcare.
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:28,095	| IOT211 |	Okay and we will get to the FDA soon
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:29,631	| IOT211 |	But before we do
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:32,703	| IOT211 |	Let's talk about the big elephant in the room which is
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:33,983	| IOT211 |	Privacy
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:35,263	| IOT211 |	Actually guess it's not the other
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,287	| IOT211 |	Because you're totally named it but
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,823	| IOT211 |	Not this earlier
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,591	| IOT211 |	So
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:40,639	| IOT211 |	You mentioned that right now
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:43,199	| IOT211 |	This is mostly for pharmaceutical companies that
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,735	| IOT211 |	They're using this
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:48,831	| IOT211 |	And it is for their clinical trials so let's talk first about
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:51,135	| IOT211 |	What is this mean and how would you use this in a clinic
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:51,647	| IOT211 |	Michael trial
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:54,207	| IOT211 |	And then we'll talk about what this means is it
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,743	| IOT211 |	Expands to a broader pop
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:56,255	| IOT211 |	Population in town
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:57,535	| IOT211 |	How we're going to think about
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:01,631	| IOT211 |	Listening coyote in clinical trials what does it look like today
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:09,055	| IOT211 |	Yes I think privacy kind of has two ways that I generally think about it so privacy being more like 1
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:14,431	| IOT211 |	Affected the security part where maybe somebody's attacking assistant and then there's also privacy where you
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:18,783	| IOT211 |	You don't necessarily have an attack but you're the way that the date eraser structure and somebody can do
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:21,087	| IOT211 |	Alexey moron
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,367	| IOT211 |	Security
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:23,135	| IOT211 |	Contact
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:24,671	| IOT211 |	Start has never really had to
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:27,487	| IOT211 |	To think about anything like that before the date of the fifth collected
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:28,767	| IOT211 |	Clinical trials
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:33,887	| IOT211 |	Blood drives or other things that are relatively standard and they have most of their data
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:34,655	| IOT211 |	Stored in
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:36,447	| IOT211 |	Ways that they have to four
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,215	| IOT211 |	Science
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,007	| IOT211 |	And I never really had to use the
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:41,567	| IOT211 |	Things that are internet connected on multiple
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,615	| IOT211 |	Time today that are remote from
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:47,711	| IOT211 |	And so this kind of creates an entirely new type of infrastructure that they
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:48,735	| IOT211 |	I think I'll have to think about it
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:52,831	| IOT211 |	Are they looking at using this data for
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:59,231	| IOT211 |	In a clinical trial setting I assume that this data is isolated for that setting or they trying to create massive
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:47:59,743	| IOT211 |	Stores of
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:03,583	| IOT211 |	Potential patient data what are the rules in place that they
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:04,863	| IOT211 |	Thinking up when trying to use
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:08,959	| IOT211 |	I think many of this is up for play
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:15,103	| IOT211 |	The most Pharma companies when they think about running a clinical trial their data has always been their data so they run is steady and
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:16,895	| IOT211 |	The Last of Us
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:18,431	| IOT211 |	Father of the study
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:19,967	| IOT211 |	What's different about a lot of connects
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:22,015	| IOT211 |	It's all these they don't necessarily have back
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:24,831	| IOT211 |	Can fit them better just going to store clinical trial date anyone
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:27,135	| IOT211 |	They pull out of it together
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:33,535	| IOT211 |	And in fact many is a wearable companies use that data to retrain their models over time and they don't have a way of splitting it out
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:37,119	| IOT211 |	This is pretty new for them to think about it okay if you're going to collect
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:37,887	| IOT211 |	Data auto
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:39,679	| IOT211 |	Relatively vulnerable patient population
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:40,959	| IOT211 |	How do I
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:44,799	| IOT211 |	Ensure that these data maintain private or that
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,079	| IOT211 |	We know
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,847	| IOT211 |	How something
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:50,175	| IOT211 |	Has been consented overtime and we can manage it away that's responsible for our
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:53,247	| IOT211 |	Okay and let's go big picture in it
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:54,527	| IOT211 |	That's because you you mentioned
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:57,855	| IOT211 |	Earlier that the concept of personalized medicine is
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:59,135	| IOT211 |	Basically surveillance
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:00,159	| IOT211 |	Because
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:03,743	| IOT211 |	To deliver this care you're going to have to understand someone
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:06,303	| IOT211 |	Inside and out in a way that's really kind of
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:07,327	| IOT211 |	Is it raining
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:08,863	| IOT211 |	That's a big responsibility
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:09,887	| IOT211 |	How should we
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:13,983	| IOT211 |	Think about that world is that something we should really welcome or the benefits outweighing the
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:14,751	| IOT211 |	The cost
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:20,383	| IOT211 |	I think the constant question is just making sure the benefits outweigh the cost in some instances they will and some they won't
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:26,783	| IOT211 |	Bermuda thing that starts get more important is really thinking about some of the Norms that we have the questions that people with
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:28,575	| IOT211 |	Identify
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:32,671	| IOT211 |	And at some point you collect so much data that the identification become
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:35,487	| IOT211 |	Analogies thinking about
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:37,023	| IOT211 |	How would you be identified by
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:41,119	| IOT211 |	You can't write like my genome is unique
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:43,423	| IOT211 |	Me and if it were truly G identify
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:44,447	| IOT211 |	Then it went really do
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:49,823	| IOT211 |	Might be able to strip out parts of personally identifiable information
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:52,639	| IOT211 |	U-Store-It but if I ever had a snip it you'd be able to
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:58,783	| IOT211 |	Parrot back 30 seconds of walked in and I'm a uniquely identifiable person
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:03,391	| IOT211 |	Thinking about things like so who owns the day that there's not really data ownership is
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:06,463	| IOT211 |	It's really much more about data governance and who gets access to it
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:09,279	| IOT211 |	And really thinking about okay if we're going to be in a system where things
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:10,815	| IOT211 |	Can TD identified
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:14,399	| IOT211 |	How do we make sure that only the right people have access to it and they're using it in a way that's
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:16,703	| IOT211 |	And how far away are we from
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:21,567	| IOT211 |	It really all depends on how the registry is or how the data are stored
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:22,591	| IOT211 |	Armentine
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:26,431	| IOT211 |	And then the thing that I really like about working with Pharma is that
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:27,967	| IOT211 |	They think a lot about him
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:28,735	| IOT211 |	Subjects research
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:30,271	| IOT211 |	That's the whole work that they do
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:32,831	| IOT211 |	And so there's a lot of norms
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:34,111	| IOT211 |	And thoughts around informed
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:36,159	| IOT211 |	And making sure that that consent is
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:36,927	| IOT211 |	Truly
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:39,743	| IOT211 |	Informed if you think about post-market and
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:42,559	| IOT211 |	Text companies we're constantly and human subjects test
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:48,447	| IOT211 |	I'm sure Facebook running a number of experiments with me about what they're showing me on the news feed and how I respond but that's
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:49,983	| IOT211 |	Pretty much unconsented
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:51,007	| IOT211 |	Human subjects research
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:52,287	| IOT211 |	Ento
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,847	| IOT211 |	The thing that I'm more nervous about is not necessarily would have
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:51:00,735	| IOT211 |	Structures but as it starts to move out and Warren Moore this check is used in a non-regulated
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:04,831	| IOT211 |	How do you make sure that somebody actually consented and know each other information is being used over.
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:08,671	| IOT211 |	Alright which seems like a good segue into
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:09,695	| IOT211 |	The FDA
EDL	00:51:09,695	00:51:11,487	| IOT211 |	You were recently in
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:12,767	| IOT211 |	Entrepreneur-in-residence
EDL	00:51:12,767	00:51:14,047	| IOT211 |	At the FDA
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:14,815	| IOT211 |	And
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:16,095	| IOT211 |	What were you doing with him
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:22,495	| IOT211 |	Isn't that the FDA would call the special government employee I've never acted as I no longer
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:23,519	| IOT211 |	Pepsi employee
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:25,055	| IOT211 |	What I was doing with the time is
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:28,895	| IOT211 |	Becky has been very forward thinking about how to handle some of these
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:34,015	| IOT211 |	I think there's so much opportunity and they recognized that holding things back is
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:36,575	| IOT211 |	In many ways a different way of
EDL	00:51:36,575	00:51:40,159	| IOT211 |	Stopping someone from getting care so we definitely don't want to have things that
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:45,791	| IOT211 |	Hurt or harm people but also having a solution that you don't allow people to get access to causing the different type of harm
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:49,375	| IOT211 |	She has realized we need to rethink how we manage diaper products
EDL	00:51:49,887	00:51:50,911	| IOT211 |	So today
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:52,191	| IOT211 |	You're not making constant
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:54,495	| IOT211 |	Changes to drugs over time but we are making
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:56,543	| IOT211 |	Changes to Software
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:59,359	| IOT211 |	If you had your imagined that Facebook could only
EDL	00:51:59,359	00:52:04,735	| IOT211 |	Check one software update a year that would be crazy and we don't expect Facebook to maintain order
EDL	00:52:04,735	00:52:05,759	| IOT211 |	Stay in somebody's life
EDL	00:52:06,783	00:52:08,319	| IOT211 |	We need to rethink as a
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:10,367	| IOT211 |	Society and at the regulatory
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:11,391	| IOT211 |	Institution
EDL	00:52:11,391	00:52:16,767	| IOT211 |	How do we add a whole group of people working in software wants to maintain a certain regulatory update
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:19,583	| IOT211 |	Okay and that is key so like
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:21,887	| IOT211 |	How do we adapt the
EDL	00:52:21,887	00:52:22,911	| IOT211 |	Approval process
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:25,983	| IOT211 |	For medical devices is one aspect
EDL	00:52:25,983	00:52:27,263	| IOT211 |	That I know the fda's
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:32,639	| IOT211 |	Another is actually a big topic that we've had people in the show talk about which is
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:34,175	| IOT211 |	How do you create
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:35,455	| IOT211 |	A security framework
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:37,247	| IOT211 |	That these devices can be both
EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:41,343	| IOT211 |	Tested and make sure that they're not vulnerable to hacks and then also
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:42,623	| IOT211 |	Updated on a regular
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:44,671	| IOT211 |	Killer bases this can be
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:45,695	| IOT211 |	Heart attack
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:47,999	| IOT211 |	Regulatory approval process
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:48,767	| IOT211 |	That we just talked about
EDL	00:52:48,767	00:52:50,303	| IOT211 |	But it could also be
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:53,887	| IOT211 |	Possibly making sure that things actually get updated
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:56,959	| IOT211 |	Which doesn't always happen especially in
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:01,311	| IOT211 |	I like the first one because
EDL	00:53:01,311	00:53:02,847	| IOT211 |	One of the pilot program today
EDL	00:53:02,847	00:53:05,151	| IOT211 |	It's quite interesting and then the second
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:07,711	| IOT211 |	What are the pilot programs yes she is working on
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:08,991	| IOT211 |	Play something called preacher
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:12,831	| IOT211 |	Any idea behind precert is that you would precertify
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:14,879	| IOT211 |	Company under a series at excellence
EDL	00:53:14,879	00:53:15,903	| IOT211 |	Principles
EDL	00:53:15,903	00:53:19,231	| IOT211 |	Include cyber security responsibilities quality safety
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:26,143	| IOT211 |	And companies that have this level of Excellence Banner able to ship updates in a way that they can do that a lot faster
EDL	00:53:26,143	00:53:27,935	| IOT211 |	There and have a different type of faster review
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:29,727	| IOT211 |	Amazing
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:33,567	| IOT211 |	I'm totally different from how the FDA has ever regulated a product before
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:36,383	| IOT211 |	We don't say hey Pfizer you make good drugs like kind of
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:42,271	| IOT211 |	Ship is made under this paradigm
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:43,039	| IOT211 |	Something that is currently being
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:46,111	| IOT211 |	Bears
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:47,903	| IOT211 |	A lot of different ways that the FDA
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:48,671	| IOT211 |	Thinking about this
EDL	00:53:48,671	00:53:52,511	| IOT211 |	They've released a free market and post Market Guidance the last year
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,535	| IOT211 |	2 years
EDL	00:53:53,535	00:53:57,375	| IOT211 |	One of the big topics that has come out of that is thinking about something called
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:53:59,679	| IOT211 |	Cyber security or software billing
EDL	00:53:59,679	00:54:04,543	| IOT211 |	Materials and the idea behind materials is thinking about a piece of software
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:06,335	| IOT211 |	Like a nutrition label
EDL	00:54:06,335	00:54:11,711	| IOT211 |	So today nobody Bill Cipher from scratch we all put in through three components into that
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:17,343	| IOT211 |	And if you have a third-party component that has a vulnerability how do you make sure that one you know that that component
EDL	00:54:17,343	00:54:19,647	| IOT211 |	Event your piece of software and that you've been able
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:20,671	| IOT211 |	Do the update
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:22,207	| IOT211 |	Any idea around having a list
EDL	00:54:22,207	00:54:22,975	| IOT211 |	Ingredients
EDL	00:54:22,975	00:54:25,791	| IOT211 |	First Security building materials then you would be able to
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:28,095	| IOT211 |	To maintain and manage that process overtime
EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:35,263	| IOT211 |	And what else is the FDA working on those the two big issues that the FDA cares about when it comes to
EDL	00:54:35,263	00:54:36,031	| IOT211 |	Connected medical devices
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:42,943	| IOT211 |	They definitely check out that your guidance is that they has one of things I think it's been really interesting about the way the FDA taking this approach
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:49,343	| IOT211 |	Which is making sure that they're not just building something in house and then releasing it out but how do they do the best type of collaboration
EDL	00:54:49,343	00:54:51,135	| IOT211 |	Security conference has been
EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:52,671	| IOT211 |	Surprisingly
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:59,071	| IOT211 |	Perhaps your many people place where the FDA has found out a lot of new information and has really been expanding its
EDL	00:54:59,071	00:55:00,607	| IOT211 |	Thinking around how to deal with
EDL	00:55:00,607	00:55:02,655	| IOT211 |	Security vulnerabilities and working
EDL	00:55:02,655	00:55:03,679	| IOT211 |	Security researchers
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:07,263	| IOT211 |	That 3 years ago the FDA went to Defcon for the first time
EDL	00:55:07,263	00:55:09,055	| IOT211 |	Which is amazing
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:12,895	| IOT211 |	Inogen.com is not a place that says generally go publicly
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:15,199	| IOT211 |	I think many TANF
EDL	00:55:15,199	00:55:17,503	| IOT211 |	Kind of go undercover but they don't show up as a Fed
EDL	00:55:17,503	00:55:19,295	| IOT211 |	There's a game called find the Fed
EDL	00:55:19,295	00:55:20,319	| IOT211 |	You do not want to be found
EDL	00:55:20,319	00:55:21,343	| IOT211 |	The biohacking Village
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:23,903	| IOT211 |	Which is one of the villages under
EDL	00:55:23,903	00:55:24,671	| IOT211 |	Domayne desk
EDL	00:55:24,671	00:55:26,463	| IOT211 |	Kind which looks at a lot of
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:29,279	| IOT211 |	Tracking devices in different stores biohacking
EDL	00:55:29,279	00:55:31,583	| IOT211 |	Products and has been
EDL	00:55:31,583	00:55:33,119	| IOT211 |	Working collaboratively with them
EDL	00:55:33,119	00:55:34,655	| IOT211 |	The one thing that has been
EDL	00:55:34,655	00:55:35,679	| IOT211 |	Kind of meat is
EDL	00:55:35,679	00:55:42,079	| IOT211 |	In January the FDA had a very large public Workshop around cybersecurity and they launched a new initiative called
EDL	00:55:42,079	00:55:43,103	| IOT211 |	#sweetheart hacker
EDL	00:55:43,615	00:55:45,407	| IOT211 |	And if you go to sweetheart hacker
EDL	00:55:45,407	00:55:45,919	| IOT211 |	Dr. Org
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:47,199	| IOT211 |	This is
EDL	00:55:47,199	00:55:51,807	| IOT211 |	An initiative where the FDA has been working to build more collaboration around
EDL	00:55:51,807	00:55:53,855	| IOT211 |	Medical device communities and
EDL	00:55:53,855	00:55:54,879	| IOT211 |	The security research community
EDL	00:55:55,391	00:55:57,183	| IOT211 |	So Abbott thermofisher
EDL	00:55:57,183	00:55:57,951	| IOT211 |	Celebs
EDL	00:55:57,951	00:55:59,487	| IOT211 |	BB&T
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:02,303	| IOT211 |	Companies that all committed to attend Defcon this year
EDL	00:56:02,303	00:56:04,351	| IOT211 |	And I work collaboratively with
EDL	00:56:04,351	00:56:05,631	| IOT211 |	Researchers and regulator
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:11,775	| IOT211 |	And this is actually been a model that I personally think should be applied to other Industries
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:13,567	| IOT211 |	For example
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:16,639	| IOT211 |	We actually talked about this Kevin and I are earlier on another show
EDL	00:56:17,151	00:56:19,967	| IOT211 |	With regards to the Boeing 737 Max
EDL	00:56:20,479	00:56:21,247	| IOT211 |	And
EDL	00:56:21,247	00:56:22,527	| IOT211 |	The sensor malfunction
EDL	00:56:22,527	00:56:25,599	| IOT211 |	And idea here is if the FAA actually
EDL	00:56:25,599	00:56:27,903	| IOT211 |	Had a process that mirrored some of the things that
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:29,695	| IOT211 |	The FDA is doing
EDL	00:56:29,695	00:56:31,743	| IOT211 |	We may not have had that issue and
EDL	00:56:32,255	00:56:36,095	| IOT211 |	Also just going forward as we're talking about like autonomous cars and
EDL	00:56:36,095	00:56:38,143	| IOT211 |	Giving computers more control
EDL	00:56:38,143	00:56:39,423	| IOT211 |	For more things
EDL	00:56:39,423	00:56:40,959	| IOT211 |	This sort of framework
EDL	00:56:40,959	00:56:41,727	| IOT211 |	Makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:56:43,007	00:56:44,287	| IOT211 |	I know I think that's important
EDL	00:56:44,287	00:56:50,687	| IOT211 |	The thing that has been really interesting and amazing for me is before the FDA got involved it to communities
EDL	00:56:50,687	00:56:52,479	| IOT211 |	Had trouble working together
EDL	00:56:52,479	00:56:53,759	| IOT211 |	So that
EDL	00:56:53,759	00:56:55,295	| IOT211 |	Security research community
EDL	00:56:55,295	00:57:00,159	| IOT211 |	Started researching a couple different devices one of the first ones that they were looking at with pacemakers
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:04,255	| IOT211 |	Pacemakers generally try to maintain as long as battery life that they can
EDL	00:57:04,255	00:57:06,559	| IOT211 |	And not do anything that's computationally expensive
EDL	00:57:06,559	00:57:10,911	| IOT211 |	Turn that encryption of many types are found is computational expensive
EDL	00:57:10,911	00:57:11,935	| IOT211 |	I'm so
EDL	00:57:11,935	00:57:12,703	| IOT211 |	A lot of them work
EDL	00:57:13,471	00:57:18,079	| IOT211 |	So they're relatively trivial exploits that you could do that could reverse-engineer protocol
EDL	00:57:18,079	00:57:19,871	| IOT211 |	Drain the battery and or
EDL	00:57:19,871	00:57:20,639	| IOT211 |	Initiate a shock
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:26,015	| IOT211 |	So for many of the researchers and I found this they said hey we should disclose and
EDL	00:57:26,015	00:57:27,295	| IOT211 |	Help them do an update
EDL	00:57:27,807	00:57:29,599	| IOT211 |	I mean they were doing the disclosures
EDL	00:57:29,599	00:57:33,183	| IOT211 |	I'm like any normal tech company when you didn't disclosure there's something
EDL	00:57:33,695	00:57:38,559	| IOT211 |	Like a responsible and coordinated disclosure that you can then have the update maybe have a bug Bounty and every
EDL	00:57:39,327	00:57:41,375	| IOT211 |	It's fine with the connected devices
EDL	00:57:41,375	00:57:44,191	| IOT211 |	The device companies okay thanks for doing this we're going to see you
EDL	00:57:44,703	00:57:47,007	| IOT211 |	And that researchers like wait what
EDL	00:57:47,007	00:57:49,567	| IOT211 |	Are you doing this medical you tampered with our device
EDL	00:57:49,567	00:57:52,639	| IOT211 |	You can't we just can't ship updates whenever we want we regulated
EDL	00:57:53,919	00:57:56,223	| IOT211 |	And so the FBI stepped in and said hey
EDL	00:57:56,735	00:57:59,807	| IOT211 |	We are not going to be the problem here also that is a fallacy
EDL	00:57:59,807	00:58:01,855	| IOT211 |	You do have a security incident you can
EDL	00:58:01,855	00:58:05,951	| IOT211 |	Until we want to make sure that this sort of feedback mechanism is
EDL	00:58:05,951	00:58:06,719	| IOT211 |	Getting better
EDL	00:58:06,719	00:58:10,047	| IOT211 |	Is it has been a really big part of some of this
EDL	00:58:10,047	00:58:14,911	| IOT211 |	We're too it's helping some of these bigger companies for learning how to do things like coordinated
EDL	00:58:14,911	00:58:15,679	| IOT211 |	Disclosure
EDL	00:58:15,679	00:58:17,215	| IOT211 |	Can do it in a way that they can
EDL	00:58:17,215	00:58:18,751	| IOT211 |	What's it more of these sorts of updates
EDL	00:58:20,031	00:58:22,079	| IOT211 |	And that is a really important thing to say
EDL	00:58:22,079	00:58:23,871	| IOT211 |	So everybody out there listening
EDL	00:58:23,871	00:58:28,735	| IOT211 |	If you have a medical device and you need to update it for security reasons the FDA is totally okay with
EDL	00:58:29,503	00:58:30,271	| IOT211 |	Okay
EDL	00:58:30,271	00:58:30,783	| IOT211 |	What Andy
EDL	00:58:31,295	00:58:32,319	| IOT211 |	I have learned a lot
EDL	00:58:32,831	00:58:39,231	| IOT211 |	I am cautiously optimistic about the future of personalized medicine I love that you're helping address the digital snake
EDL	00:58:39,231	00:58:40,511	| IOT211 |	Coil problem and
EDL	00:58:40,511	00:58:44,607	| IOT211 |	I appreciate what you've done actually with the FDA as a person who
EDL	00:58:44,607	00:58:45,119	| IOT211 |	Uses battle
EDL	00:58:45,887	00:58:47,935	| IOT211 |	So the one thing I try to balance
EDL	00:58:47,935	00:58:53,567	| IOT211 |	A train is like not being to fudge like it does scare the crap out of me for a lot of this stuff
EDL	00:58:54,079	00:58:55,359	| IOT211 |	And also
EDL	00:58:55,359	00:58:56,127	| IOT211 |	How to use
EDL	00:58:56,127	00:58:57,663	| IOT211 |	They sold responsibly and safely
EDL	00:58:58,431	00:59:00,991	| IOT211 |	I think it has a lot of textures the whole movie fast
EDL	00:59:00,991	00:59:07,391	| IOT211 |	And break things and that means people die right in healthcare but the nice thing about Healthcare being a bit slower is we might
EDL	00:59:07,391	00:59:11,231	| IOT211 |	A chance to design systems that better serve people
EDL	00:59:11,231	00:59:15,071	| IOT211 |	And I think this is a really powerful time boats for Regulators for
EDL	00:59:15,583	00:59:21,727	| IOT211 |	Companies that are trying to develop trustworthy systems or more people are competing on trust so how can we make
EDL	00:59:21,727	00:59:22,495	| IOT211 |	Make sure
EDL	00:59:22,495	00:59:23,263	| IOT211 |	That way partner
EDL	00:59:23,263	00:59:27,359	| IOT211 |	Responsible and really hopeful. Some of the biggest issues that we have
EDL	00:59:28,127	00:59:29,663	| IOT211 |	So thanks for coming on the show
EDL	00:59:30,175	00:59:36,575	| IOT211 |	Thank you for having me that's it for this week thanks so much for listening and remember if you
EDL	00:59:36,575	00:59:42,719	| IOT211 |	I'd like more iot news sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot. Cam will see you next
