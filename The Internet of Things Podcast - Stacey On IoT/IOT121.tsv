EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,880	| IOT121 |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,416	| IOT121 |	Let's not going out
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,696	| IOT121 |	YouTube
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:09,536	| IOT121 |	Yeah we've been waiting for this for a while
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:14,656	| IOT121 |	Yeah yeah I know our guest from the Bluetooth Sig is going to really get into
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,216	| IOT121 |	The news here but just to
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,776	| IOT121 |	If you belie level Bluetooth
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,080	| IOT121 |	Will now support Mesh networking
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,640	| IOT121 |	Show Bluetooth devices instead of being
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,688	| IOT121 |	Peer-to-peer or one device to one
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:31,296	| IOT121 |	Prettymuch introduces many-to-many which is crazy
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,832	| IOT121 |	A good for
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,904	| IOT121 |	Oh geez I mean Smart Homes
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,464	| IOT121 |	Industrial industrial
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,280	| IOT121 |	Yeah this gets Bluetooth into the industrial world it's been
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,560	| IOT121 |	Excited about
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,144	| IOT121 |	The one thing we don't address
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,656	| IOT121 |	In
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,680	| IOT121 |	Interview
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,704	| IOT121 |	Is
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,496	| IOT121 |	What is this mean for Olive
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,008	| IOT121 |	The other stand
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| IOT121 |	So stay tuned for all of the stuff about it
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:56,128	| IOT121 |	Things called mesh models we talked about
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,920	| IOT121 |	How it does intelligent routing
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| IOT121 |	We talked about
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:02,016	| IOT121 |	Use cases and will even talk about things like
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,552	| IOT121 |	IPv6 a bandwidth since
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,832	| IOT121 |	So there is a lot
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,600	| IOT121 |	In the interview
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,976	| IOT121 |	Well I haven't heard the interview yet I'll hear it after the show
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:16,352	| IOT121 |	But so if you guys have talked about this that's so we can skip this but I'm curious about the
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:22,752	| IOT121 |	Power requirements I'm curious about if this will require new Bluetooth Hardware devices which I don't think it will I think it
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,032	| IOT121 |	Will actually work with
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,568	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth 4 and 5 devices
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| IOT121 |	Better already exist
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| IOT121 |	So am I correct in that
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,432	| IOT121 |	Kevin you're spoiling the interview
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,712	| IOT121 |	Yes you are correct
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,272	| IOT121 |	So it's only going to work over Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,576	| IOT121 |	He's not going to work over classic
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,112	| IOT121 |	What else did you want
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,184	| IOT121 |	Power I'm curious about any power
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:46,560	| IOT121 |	So we get into how it conserves power that's actually a huge portion of the interview
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,120	| IOT121 |	And then
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,704	| IOT121 |	When it comes to how it's going to be implemented
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,496	| IOT121 |	That really depends on
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,520	| IOT121 |	Yourself
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,616	| IOT121 |	So it goes all the way back to Bluetooth LE 4.
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,408	| IOT121 |	So it's backwards compatible
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,480	| IOT121 |	Provided your silicon provider update their chip
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,528	| IOT121 |	With the software needed to R
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,320	| IOT121 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:14,208	| IOT121 |	Okay okay well those are two key questions I was curious about before we actually answered the question you originally asked which is
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,744	| IOT121 |	What does this mean for
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,768	| IOT121 |	Other Technologies because
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:20,095	| IOT121 |	When I saw this news hit was the first thing I thought of and
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,655	| IOT121 |	I may be wrong I'll let you tell me
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:27,775	| IOT121 |	But I merely thought of Z-Wave because he waited always had National working as far as I can remember
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,567	| IOT121 |	And
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,359	| IOT121 |	What so happen to Z-Wave
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:35,199	| IOT121 |	So there's three Mesh networking technologies that matter in
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,479	| IOT121 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,015	| IOT121 |	Lesso the industrial
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| IOT121 |	Definitely the smart
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,831	| IOT121 |	Zippy
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,343	| IOT121 |	Z-Wave
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,367	| IOT121 |	And
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:51,327	| IOT121 |	I feel like Z-Wave is a little bit on the outs in talking to people
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,631	| IOT121 |	You have seen things like Eero supporting
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,911	| IOT121 |	Thread in their routers
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,983	| IOT121 |	Comcast is actually supporting
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,311	| IOT121 |	Thread in some of its Xfinity home gateways
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,103	| IOT121 |	So I look
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,151	| IOT121 |	If that is
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,175	| IOT121 |	Part of that so I'm like
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,967	| IOT121 |	Yeah I know
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:14,367	| IOT121 |	For the longest time I was at on-site anti Z-Wave and not against any technology that solves a problem effectively
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:18,719	| IOT121 |	But I've never felt confident of Z-Wave would come out as a
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,743	| IOT121 |	A leader
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,023	| IOT121 |	In the space
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:23,583	| IOT121 |	Just because mainly because I should say
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:30,495	| IOT121 |	It's not as prevalent in devices and by devices I mean the phones and tablets and things that people use to control
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,775	| IOT121 |	Other things
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,591	| IOT121 |	With all those devices have Wi-Fi all in my Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,919	| IOT121 |	And the Bluetooth was lacking match so does he weigh
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| IOT121 |	I started warming up to it
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:44,319	| IOT121 |	But now that Bluetooth has mesh it's almost like that whole Advantage is negated to me
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:46,367	| IOT121 |	Right and I think honestly
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| IOT121 |	A bigger
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:50,975	| IOT121 |	Question would be what is this due to sick because he pees really popular
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,999	| IOT121 |	In lighting
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| IOT121 |	It is the radio protocol behind like
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,863	| IOT121 |	Your Hue Lights and a lot of other
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| IOT121 |	Even industrial lighting
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT121 |	Thanks
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,215	| IOT121 |	It is a mesh Network
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,495	| IOT121 |	Work as well as a low-power mission
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:03,775	| IOT121 |	And
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,823	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth is coming
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,639	| IOT121 |	That's where we stand right here
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:14,527	| IOT121 |	Any advantage Bluetooth is going to have here is that it's in all these phones and other devices
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| IOT121 |	Today
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,831	| IOT121 |	If they can be updated
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,367	| IOT121 |	And many of them can be
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,159	| IOT121 |	Then you're going to see
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| IOT121 |	If you're in an industrial setting
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,999	| IOT121 |	Probably actually won't
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| IOT121 |	Control lot of stuff
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:25,791	| IOT121 |	From your phone
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,559	| IOT121 |	Rihanna Stay
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,607	| IOT121 |	But
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,655	| IOT121 |	There might be an advantage to having someone
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,679	| IOT121 |	Contribute
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,959	| IOT121 |	Using their phone
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,239	| IOT121 |	I can see cases where
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| IOT121 |	Hpac system
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,079	| IOT121 |	Someone could be like hey
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:44,735	| IOT121 |	They're still I'm not writing any of these other Technologies off by any means
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,039	| IOT121 |	Because I think there's still some advantages
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,855	| IOT121 |	I know the zigbee is really low power I I don't
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| IOT121 |	You know about
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,719	| IOT121 |	I'm sorry Z-Wave I was thinking cuz I looked it up earlier this morning
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,279	| IOT121 |	I'm so there may be power advantages
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,047	| IOT121 |	To have
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| IOT121 |	AZ wave
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,119	| IOT121 |	Chip inside
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:05,983	| IOT121 |	But that's not necessarily a bad thing that is
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,567	| IOT121 |	Doesn't necessarily a bad thing because not every application needs
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| IOT121 |	You know lots of megabits
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,359	| IOT121 |	Is per second
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,383	| IOT121 |	Trooper
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:19,039	| IOT121 |	And there may be some cost advantages in terms of the of the chips themselves it again like I haven't seen any compare
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,599	| IOT121 |	So I'm not writing it off yet
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,111	| IOT121 |	I just
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,903	| IOT121 |	That's kind of where my head's at right now
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,975	| IOT121 |	I think it will remain to be seen
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,767	| IOT121 |	Honestly
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,559	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth is going to
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,071	| IOT121 |	Conquer all
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,863	| IOT121 |	Just because
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,679	| IOT121 |	This is still very new
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:39,263	| IOT121 |	There's still a lot of unanswered questions even in the current spec
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,799	| IOT121 |	About how it handles some of the
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,103	| IOT121 |	Routing requirements and scalability requirements
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,663	| IOT121 |	I think it about
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,479	| IOT121 |	5 months maybe 6 months will
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:50,015	| IOT121 |	Kind of start seeing how this is going
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,295	| IOT121 |	The industry
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,831	| IOT121 |	Actually think
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,367	| IOT121 |	The more interesting question
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| IOT121 |	Is how does
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,159	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,183	| IOT121 |	Thread kind
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,999	| IOT121 |	Because one of the things Bluetooth doesn't do
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,279	| IOT121 |	And thread does to
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| IOT121 |	You can talk directly to the internet
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,143	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,447	| IOT121 |	Could do that but it
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,495	| IOT121 |	Doesn't nimesh situations
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,519	| IOT121 |	Won't
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,543	| IOT121 |	So
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,103	| IOT121 |	I'm kind of thinking about this and I'm like
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,735	| IOT121 |	I think this is an excellent technology
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,575	| IOT121 |	A lot of devices are already going to come out and support it
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,111	| IOT121 |	Today
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,135	| IOT121 |	And
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:31,999	| IOT121 |	It will be awesome because like right now my Bluetooth switches for example
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,791	| IOT121 |	If I'm not on the same floor as the light
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:34,815	| IOT121 |	I can't control
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| IOT121 |	Commensurate
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,375	| IOT121 |	That's just
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:38,911	| IOT121 |	Cell
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,703	| IOT121 |	We shall see
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,263	| IOT121 |	Let us move on to other
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,543	| IOT121 |	Exciting news
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,079	| IOT121 |	Google Glass
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,919	| IOT121 |	Google class which is also Bluetooth capable
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,015	| IOT121 |	Google glass cutter because I thought it was dead for
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,295	| IOT121 |	Good reason it was very
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,319	| IOT121 |	Consumer-focused
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,879	| IOT121 |	Google did the whole Explorer Thing 2
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:02,719	| IOT121 |	Early adopters Peyton want to pay $1,500 for
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,231	| IOT121 |	This
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:08,095	| IOT121 |	Camera and small processor and battery and sensors to
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:14,751	| IOT121 |	I didn't want to admit it but yeah
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:20,127	| IOT121 |	I still do an in a dresser drawer somewhere I have the original Google Glass
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,663	| IOT121 |	Edition Explorer Edition
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,967	| IOT121 |	Yes back when we work for a gigolo
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,759	| IOT121 |	Google home actually
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,855	| IOT121 |	Purchase that was for me to cover because we thought this could be very interesting space
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,391	| IOT121 |	And it is an interesting space
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,951	| IOT121 |	Suggested develop the way Google thought it would back in
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,511	| IOT121 |	I don't know 2013 or so
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:42,655	| IOT121 |	But quietly Google has continued to work on Google Glass for different type of customer
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,983	| IOT121 |	Mainly that is Enterprise and Industrial cuss
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,007	| IOT121 |	Mercy
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,799	| IOT121 |	They just announced that
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,615	| IOT121 |	Hey we've been doing this and it's actually working pretty well so
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:56,735	| IOT121 |	Companies such as GE Boeing DHL have all been using it doctors have been using it
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:02,879	| IOT121 |	DHL for example says that they've been dating Kris their supply chain efficiency by 15% where is
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,927	| IOT121 |	In healthcare it's reduced paperwork
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:11,327	| IOT121 |	Got loads by 20% and allows doctors spend more time with patients so so there is a glass Enterprise Edition that it's
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,887	| IOT121 |	Targeted towards I think the Right audience for that product
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,703	| IOT121 |	If your consumer nothing's really changed here but
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,727	| IOT121 |	Amateur
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,823	| IOT121 |	The workforce that you want to enable with some type of AR
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:25,151	| IOT121 |	Or additional information that they
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,479	| IOT121 |	The glance of an I know it's it's pretty interesting stuff
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,503	| IOT121 |	Well so this
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,623	| IOT121 |	I think remember how computers personal computers started out in the workplace and migrated out
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,183	| IOT121 |	I think this idea of heads-up displays
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,975	| IOT121 |	Arso
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,999	| IOT121 |	Both high cost
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| IOT121 |	Originally
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,839	| IOT121 |	It's a very big
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,887	| IOT121 |	Difference is a huge social
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| IOT121 |	User interface ship
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,055	| IOT121 |	So I think starting at the Enterprise make sense for a
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,127	| IOT121 |	Don't think of this Justice
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:11:01,503	| IOT121 |	Glasses right they just heads up display and not having to look at a screen is really compelling
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,575	| IOT121 |	And this is technology that is
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,903	| IOT121 |	Floyd
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,927	| IOT121 |	It's also technology
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,231	| IOT121 |	Microsoft is using
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| IOT121 |	With manufacturers
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,559	| IOT121 |	Using its hololens
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| IOT121 |	That's Amore
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:20,959	| IOT121 |	One of the big questions I have about things like a r is
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| IOT121 |	Do I really want to look at
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| IOT121 |	At the world through my phone
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,543	| IOT121 |	Play now
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,871	| IOT121 |	I was shocked actually when Google launched these for consume
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,639	| IOT121 |	Cuz I was like
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:32,223	| IOT121 |	This is this going to violate all kinds of social contracts in
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:37,087	| IOT121 |	Did just what you did
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,879	| IOT121 |	But but but I think
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| IOT121 |	The way I
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:43,231	| IOT121 |	Look at the product when it first launched for consumers was
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,559	| IOT121 |	Very much like I look at Android Wear and other
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,839	| IOT121 |	Smart watches
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| IOT121 |	That is
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:51,423	| IOT121 |	Contextual information at a glance
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:57,055	| IOT121 |	If you look at it that way it sort of makes sense unfortunate did much more than that such as recording people
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| IOT121 |	A video and so on and
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:01,407	| IOT121 |	We know light indicator that people knew you were recording them
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,991	| IOT121 |	This Enterprise Edition actually does have a little light so that people are aware
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,759	| IOT121 |	So
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,807	| IOT121 |	I got it just was the wrong
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,111	| IOT121 |	Form for that concept
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,159	| IOT121 |	Yes and this has
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,951	| IOT121 |	Better networking
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,279	| IOT121 |	Faster better processor longer battery life
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,351	| IOT121 |	It's got a camera that's 8 megapixels
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,375	| IOT121 |	So
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,143	| IOT121 |	Icing
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:28,031	| IOT121 |	In Enterprises are also going to be able to pay this price and then when we get economies of scale
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,543	| IOT121 |	Come down
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,847	| IOT121 |	I was at the Snapchat glasses sold
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,407	| IOT121 |	No we don't I don't I don't
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,455	| IOT121 |	Exist
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,247	| IOT121 |	Elsa real quick just cuz you were mentioning some
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,039	| IOT121 |	Inspect I noticed that there's an Intel atom
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,807	| IOT121 |	Inside witch
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,575	| IOT121 |	Surprise me
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,439	| IOT121 |	Yes yes because the original glass was kind of built
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,231	| IOT121 |	Apollon smartphone gots
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,279	| IOT121 |	Which made sense low power
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,583	| IOT121 |	But it was capable of doing what needed to be done
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,887	| IOT121 |	This actually has an Intel atom inside
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:58,495	| IOT121 |	Well in that might be because of software can a lot of enterprise software is an arm
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| IOT121 |	I'm compatible yet
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| IOT121 |	I don't know
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,591	| IOT121 |	And you know these guys
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,663	| IOT121 |	Presumably you can charge your glasses every night if you're in a workspace here
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:11,039	| IOT121 |	You don't think they take them home I employees use the method asking or on the
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,599	| IOT121 |	Production line or wherever they are doctors in the office
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| IOT121 |	So you got it you know
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,183	| IOT121 |	As long as you can get
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,743	| IOT121 |	I don't even know a full 8 hours or baby
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,791	| IOT121 |	I mean if you're on a production line you probably have a
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,583	| IOT121 |	Prescribed luncheon
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,095	| IOT121 |	Probably charge
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,935	| IOT121 |	Okay so that was exciting
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:30,751	| IOT121 |	I am stoked about the return of glass in what feels like
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,799	| IOT121 |	Immortal dragons
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:33,823	| IOT121 |	Gradual rollout
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:36,639	| IOT121 |	Tell me about
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,407	| IOT121 |	This alarm
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,199	| IOT121 |	Because it looks pretty
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:45,343	| IOT121 |	Yeah so that's a Kickstarter I say that right up front that has already exceeded its goal
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,391	| IOT121 |	So it is going to
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,927	| IOT121 |	Continue
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| IOT121 |	It's the
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:52,255	| IOT121 |	Sandman Doppler and I had not heard of this
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:57,375	| IOT121 |	Sandman company before but apparently they came up with a guy Kickstarter or successful Kickstarter
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,143	| IOT121 |	Previously
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| IOT121 |	Turn alarm clock like a Smart Alarm Clock
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,727	| IOT121 |	That did not have
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:05,311	| IOT121 |	The Voice services that Amazon Echo
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| IOT121 |	Rides
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:08,639	| IOT121 |	I don't want to say miss a Disney and that's why I said it that way
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:14,015	| IOT121 |	I'm so this is kind of interesting to me it's it's literally an alarm clock that
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,575	| IOT121 |	When you look at the screen or the display
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:20,671	| IOT121 |	It looks like an old-time LED or I'm sorry LCD
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,183	| IOT121 |	Alarm clock
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,791	| IOT121 |	But it has a pair of speakers I think 14 why so they probably
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,303	| IOT121 |	Allowed
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:31,935	| IOT121 |	And it's got the boy Services built-in as quick buttons that you can program to do
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT121 |	Cast
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,007	| IOT121 |	Instead of using your voice to say can you say
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:38,335	| IOT121 |	I think it's great miss a turn the lights out
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,615	| IOT121 |	In house
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:42,943	| IOT121 |	You can just program that to a button or several of those buttons
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:45,759	| IOT121 |	The screen display does show your your weather
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,063	| IOT121 |	Which is kind of nice the day of the week
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,623	| IOT121 |	It also has a little light bar which is customizable
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:56,255	| IOT121 |	To indicate certain things so you do you want to know if the stock market up or down you can program that light bar to psi
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,279	| IOT121 |	Show green or red
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:01,631	| IOT121 |	Obviously it's got a microphone built-in so you can speak to it
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,703	| IOT121 |	And what I thought was really smart of these guys
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:08,031	| IOT121 |	They put in 6 USB ports in the back of it
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,567	| IOT121 |	So you can charge your
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,615	| IOT121 |	Mobile devices off of this thing
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,407	| IOT121 |	And even more interesting Lee
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:19,807	| IOT121 |	You can pull three of those out at a time and replace them to a different form factors have the old USB a
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,087	| IOT121 |	Words you can put those in it
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,879	| IOT121 |	USBC you can put those in
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| IOT121 |	Really really clever design
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| IOT121 |	It's been funded
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:30,303	| IOT121 |	It looks like it will not be available to backers for about a year
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,351	| IOT121 |	Unfortunately we're just kind of a bummer
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:36,959	| IOT121 |	But if you want one on the cheap you can beta test that you're not going to get final Hardware ever
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,751	| IOT121 |	Beta test
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:41,823	| IOT121 |	Hardware in design for $89
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,615	| IOT121 |	You can still get
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,943	| IOT121 |	Essendant Doppler for 119 in advance
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,991	| IOT121 |	Don't know if they said the
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| IOT121 |	The MSRP
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,807	| IOT121 |	At this point they have a
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,599	| IOT121 |	Now I will say that feels
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| IOT121 |	I got a.
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:58,207	| IOT121 |	Then it's great So for 50 bucks
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,535	| IOT121 |	I can tell it to do all these things so I'm sitting here wondering
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,583	| IOT121 |	You know having a clock display
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,631	| IOT121 |	Is nice in the middle of the night I'm not going to ask
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,751	| IOT121 |	It feels like a lot of money just to get additional
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,519	| IOT121 |	Port Saint.
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,847	| IOT121 |	It's certainly going to sound better to
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,639	| IOT121 |	Okay well that's true okay
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:20,991	| IOT121 |	Yammy just has a pair of 14 watt speakers where is if I had to guess the.
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:25,855	| IOT121 |	You probably looking that more like us almost like a smartphone speaker week maybe two watsapp best
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:28,671	| IOT121 |	Oh and the quick access actually can do several
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,695	| IOT121 |	Thanks it's not just one thing
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,743	| IOT121 |	Okay so
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,023	| IOT121 |	Basically I don't
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,047	| IOT121 |	Dubai another device
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,839	| IOT121 |	You're really get it
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,375	| IOT121 |	I get it believe me I'm all
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:41,471	| IOT121 |	Newport Centre mall tapped out myself between the Amazon tap
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,519	| IOT121 |	Couple of God's Echo Google home
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:48,383	| IOT121 |	So this would have to be different but it appeal it was different enough to appeal to me
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,663	| IOT121 |	At that price
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,943	| IOT121 |	I haven't backed up yet but
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,967	| IOT121 |	Think I just might
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,735	| IOT121 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,247	| IOT121 |	Well
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,551	| IOT121 |	You know the other thing is
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,831	| IOT121 |	This looks pretty bright so
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:03,231	| IOT121 |	Hopefully they got it like that like most smartphones it has a sensor in there that can read the ambient light and
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,767	| IOT121 |	Dims automatically based on that so
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,583	| IOT121 |	Oh and it's powered by the next things chip
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| IOT121 |	I love the chip
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| IOT121 |	The southern
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,727	| IOT121 |	Has become the next thing
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,031	| IOT121 |	Makes a $9
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:16,799	| IOT121 |	Development
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,103	| IOT121 |	No chip Pro is a little bit more but
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| IOT121 |	I freaking love that come
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,175	| IOT121 |	All right very exciting
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,967	| IOT121 |	Justice
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| IOT121 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,831	| IOT121 |	Now that we're done with her
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| IOT121 |	Gadget fetish
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,135	| IOT121 |	Let's go into
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:35,231	| IOT121 |	00 security vulnerabilities
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,511	| IOT121 |	Devil's ivy
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,047	| IOT121 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,607	| IOT121 |	And this is something is a vulnerability that affects
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,655	| IOT121 |	IP base security
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,679	| IOT121 |	Cameras mostly but
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:47,263	| IOT121 |	Don't they all
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:50,591	| IOT121 |	That's the security cameras have been connected to the internet
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,151	| IOT121 |	Are long time forever before we even thought about all the stuff
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,735	| IOT121 |	So this one is
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:03,135	| IOT121 |	Particularly nasty because it is a vulnerability in open source software that is used by
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,903	| IOT121 |	A lot
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,415	| IOT121 |	Southeast security
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,231	| IOT121 |	The prevalence
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,255	| IOT121 |	Of the vulnerabilities
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,279	| IOT121 |	However
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:12,351	| IOT121 |	It doesn't appear too easy to exploit
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| IOT121 |	Redken
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,727	| IOT121 |	That yeah that's that's correct time in its
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:23,871	| IOT121 |	Once a device is compromised you actually have to have the user like uploader or get it like a tool Big File
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:28,735	| IOT121 |	It's not likely it's going to be exploited it's more of a buffer crash type thing
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT121 |	Overrun
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,295	| IOT121 |	But it's still not good
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:34,879	| IOT121 |	So it's not as nasty as a lot of other things we can make the Mirai bot for example
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,671	| IOT121 |	Talking about months and months ago
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,231	| IOT121 |	It's nothing like that but it's still concerning
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,071	| IOT121 |	I believe it was axis Communications
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,631	| IOT121 |	They say that about 249 of their
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| IOT121 |	Camera models
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,959	| IOT121 |	Perfected they've already patched them
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,495	| IOT121 |	And they have
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,543	| IOT121 |	Shared information with the
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:57,919	| IOT121 |	Industry at large on how to fix things but it's going to be up to each individual Hardware
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,735	| IOT121 |	Maker to update firmware cuz that's the only way to fix
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:05,343	| IOT121 |	Speaking of the FBI
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,367	| IOT121 |	People about
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,647	| IOT121 |	Connected toys
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:14,303	| IOT121 |	This is like a recurring theme with them I feel like it's once a year if I got time to other people about those smart toys
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,863	| IOT121 |	Or just smart things the FBI has done a
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,143	| IOT121 |	A warning about
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,191	| IOT121 |	Devices in general
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:23,519	| IOT121 |	This specific device is about privacy
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:24,799	| IOT121 |	Which
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,079	| IOT121 |	It's important it is important
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:29,663	| IOT121 |	But it basically goes in and it's like hey consumer
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,991	| IOT121 |	Lays out why iot toys are vulnerable
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| IOT121 |	Why you should care
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,831	| IOT121 |	And then it's got a section called what should I do
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,855	| IOT121 |	And I'm really
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,623	| IOT121 |	Hat
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:41,439	| IOT121 |	I'm cheesed about this because the wind should I do section
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| IOT121 |	Can is incredibly long
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,743	| IOT121 |	It is
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,279	| IOT121 |	Just
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,351	| IOT121 |	Mind-boggling that you would think a consumer would do this
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:53,983	| IOT121 |	So some of those things are research if your toys can receive firmware software updates and security patches
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,287	| IOT121 |	If they can ensure these
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| IOT121 |	Irenic that's great
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,079	| IOT121 |	Right
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,943	| IOT121 |	Research where user data is stored with the company third-party services or both
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,735	| IOT121 |	I am
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,039	| IOT121 |	Quarter have asked Mattel for data on
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,575	| IOT121 |	This type of thing
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:11,647	| IOT121 |	Including they also talked about
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:17,791	| IOT121 |	Do they use authentication when pairing a device via Bluetooth and do they use encryption when transmitting data from the Wi-Fi access point in
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:21,119	| IOT121 |	Why is reporter have sent this data to me
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| IOT121 |	These questions
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,167	| IOT121 |	Mattel
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,959	| IOT121 |	Mattel was like
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:32,127	| IOT121 |	Feeling like a consumer can just call up Mattel and be like hey I want to buy this
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,175	| IOT121 |	Connected Barbie doll for twenty bucks
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:36,991	| IOT121 |	So
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,783	| IOT121 |	Yeah this this to me points out
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,575	| IOT121 |	That we've got a big dick
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,599	| IOT121 |	Pinhole in consumers
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:48,511	| IOT121 |	So I totally agree with you as I look at some of the other questions and I'll read the disclosures and privacy policies to see if a company is victim
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,279	| IOT121 |	My Cyber attack
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:52,351	| IOT121 |	What will the company do if they were you know will they notify you
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:56,703	| IOT121 |	Where's your data being stored
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:59,263	| IOT121 |	All great questions but just as you said
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:02,847	| IOT121 |	People are not going to call and ask about that in the few that do
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,383	| IOT121 |	Where can I get the answers
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,943	| IOT121 |	So here's a thought just a thought I don't
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,223	| IOT121 |	Like to get into
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:13,087	| IOT121 |	Regulations and policy and whatnot but in this case I'm going to throw it out there
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:17,696	| IOT121 |	Should there be answers to those questions at least a high level
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,000	| IOT121 |	On the packaging for all of these devices
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:24,608	| IOT121 |	Yes this gets into this idea of having a some sort of labeling
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,888	| IOT121 |	First Data
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,192	| IOT121 |	And I totally
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:29,728	| IOT121 |	We should have
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,288	| IOT121 |	Basic consumer
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,056	| IOT121 |	Info for the stuff
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,616	| IOT121 |	And I feel like the FBI saying
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,408	| IOT121 |	It is not like Congress is going to
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:38,944	| IOT121 |	Hawaii
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,224	| IOT121 |	Thinking maps
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,064	| IOT121 |	I do think maybe the industry could get together in
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,856	| IOT121 |	You know some basics
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:46,880	| IOT121 |	Encryption
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,160	| IOT121 |	To the cloud
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,696	| IOT121 |	Today within the home
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| IOT121 |	Where is the data stored
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,792	| IOT121 |	Your TOS is actually going to happen
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| IOT121 |	Information about
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,584	| IOT121 |	Is it shared with her
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,096	| IOT121 |	Third-party data
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,400	| IOT121 |	Companies
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:03,520	| IOT121 |	And you don't even expecting people to read through all of that to get there as kind of

EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,200	| IOT121 |	Quick bits of news
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:13,248	| IOT121 |	Particle which is an iot developer
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,016	| IOT121 |	The platform
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,296	| IOT121 |	That offers
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:18,880	| IOT121 |	Wi-Fi Cellular Connections it's a pretty
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:22,208	| IOT121 |	We talked to them before Zach's Apollo the CEOs been on
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:22,976	| IOT121 |	Show
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,536	| IOT121 |	Erase 20 million dollars from spark capital
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,048	| IOT121 |	They are
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,840	| IOT121 |	They're doing really well
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,656	| IOT121 |	I was surprised so particle has built
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,424	| IOT121 |	Is easy
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,192	| IOT121 |	To put in development
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:36,800	| IOT121 |	And they have about a hundred and twenty thousand people that are building iot products
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,640	| IOT121 |	That's pretty significant there in a bunch of products
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:43,200	| IOT121 |	Ideo uses them Looney lunar design
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,480	| IOT121 |	Mindtribe
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,272	| IOT121 |	Actually power that Met Gala

EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:53,184	| IOT121 |	Yeah so they were there and uses them to track their
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,696	| IOT121 |	Campus bicycles
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,000	| IOT121 |	Pretty cool
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| IOT121 |	Lot of money for them
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,304	| IOT121 |	I am very excited
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,328	| IOT121 |	Because
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:03,424	| IOT121 |	My gosh building iot connected products is hard and
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:06,496	| IOT121 |	2 days to a company that has started up trying
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,520	| IOT121 |	Easier and in
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,312	| IOT121 |	Donald learned a lot of
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,872	| IOT121 |	Las Vegas has a
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:13,152	| IOT121 |	NB iot Network
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,968	| IOT121 |	That is building when conjunction with people
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,248	| IOT121 |	So I thought
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:19,296	| IOT121 |	Vegas fan
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:22,368	| IOT121 |	So I thought this was interesting they're going to use it for
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:26,720	| IOT121 |	Smart cities efforts in there doing a partnership Las Vegas is doing a partnership with call, derickson
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| IOT121 |	As part of this nb iot Network
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| IOT121 |	They're going to
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,840	| IOT121 |	Disconnect flood in storm
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,864	| IOT121 |	Drainage sensors
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,912	| IOT121 |	LED lighting and some
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,936	| IOT121 |	Weather temperatures
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:40,032	| IOT121 |	An environmental Network or a sensor for the weather
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| IOT121 |	Hot hot and hot
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,640	| IOT121 |	Sometimes it's cold and rainy
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,944	| IOT121 |	But yes normally
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,760	| IOT121 |	All right and then
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:51,296	| IOT121 |	Final bit of news in the
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,600	| IOT121 |	Iot wide area network business Comcast
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,416	| IOT121 |	Has launched their machineq
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,976	| IOT121 |	Product which is a lorawan
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,768	| IOT121 |	A worldwide
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,304	| IOT121 |	In
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,608	| IOT121 |	12 more cities
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,632	| IOT121 |	So
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,984	| IOT121 |	This is big news about a year ago Comcast took a chunk of Senate
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,544	| IOT121 |	Which is a company that makes the Laura chips
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:15,616	| IOT121 |	And they said they were like Hey we're going to try this
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:19,200	| IOT121 |	Basically they are expanding it to Seattle
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:24,320	| IOT121 |	A bunch of other cities and the idea that is not to create a city-wide
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:28,672	| IOT121 |	Lauren at work but to create these kind of private Lauren that works in like
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:31,232	| IOT121 |	Manufacturing spaces
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| IOT121 |	For warehouses
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:35,328	| IOT121 |	I think it would be kind of a really interesting
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,120	| IOT121 |	I guess thing to watch
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,960	| IOT121 |	So Kevin I think we've done a great job this week on the show
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,520	| IOT121 |	And in the coming weeks we actually want to do
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,080	| IOT121 |	Consumer-oriented

EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,440	| IOT121 |	Kevin and I are going to try to answer some of your questions on the air
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,000	| IOT121 |	And now
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:10,400	| IOT121 |	A message from our sponsor haverwood we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:14,752	| IOT121 |	But the message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Allegiant the makers of Schlage
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:16,800	| IOT121 |	Locks and I have Rob Martin
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:17,824	| IOT121 |	Who is the futurist
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,104	| IOT121 |	OverWatch League
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,128	| IOT121 |	Here to talk to us
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:22,688	| IOT121 |	About the smart home by Rob
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,480	| IOT121 |	Hi Stacy thanks for having
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:27,296	| IOT121 |	I am super excited so
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:30,112	| IOT121 |	Let's dig into this idea of things in the connected home
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,136	| IOT121 |	Working with Eva
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:31,648	| IOT121 |	Everything else
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,440	| IOT121 |	How do you think about that
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| IOT121 |	Well
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,256	| IOT121 |	I think there is a lot of
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,816	| IOT121 |	Misconceptions around
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:42,656	| IOT121 |	How things actually work today versus what's advertised
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,424	| IOT121 |	And media
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:49,568	| IOT121 |	The truth is is that Integrations the fancy word for the ability to work with other connected stuff
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,336	| IOT121 |	Our kind of fickle
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| IOT121 |	You're best off select
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,968	| IOT121 |	Testing devices that are going to suit a very specific purpose for you
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,480	| IOT121 |	First
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,016	| IOT121 |	And then looking at
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:02,624	| IOT121 |	What types of recipes routines robots whatever you want to call them
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,904	| IOT121 |	You can connect with
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,416	| IOT121 |	Later on
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:08,256	| IOT121 |	Now you guys so far has decided not to integrate
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,048	| IOT121 |	With the unlock function on your
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:12,096	| IOT121 |	Can you explain kind of your thinking there
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,192	| IOT121 |	Stacy Schlage is a security company for
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:21,568	| IOT121 |	So we're a little different than some other people who are focused on simply the convenience
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| IOT121 |	And comfort
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,128	| IOT121 |	Of the Smart Home
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,896	| IOT121 |	We're concerned
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,432	| IOT121 |	About the
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,992	| IOT121 |	The security of anyone behind that door
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,272	| IOT121 |	And we want to be certain
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,064	| IOT121 |	That your intent
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,832	| IOT121 |	Is to unlock
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:36,416	| IOT121 |	So what the voice assistance or next Generation technology
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,464	| IOT121 |	We support things
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,744	| IOT121 |	Dislike door status
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,256	| IOT121 |	Locking
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,536	| IOT121 |	But unless we can
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,840	| IOT121 |	Can be 100% certain that is you
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,864	| IOT121 |	We won't unlock the door
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,424	| IOT121 |	Do you think we'll ever get there I do
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,240	| IOT121 |	I think we will get there I think there's lots of
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:51,264	| IOT121 |	Nursing technology
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,592	| IOT121 |	And as a futurist it's my job to explore that
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,616	| IOT121 |	So I can say
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,152	| IOT121 |	With some certain
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:00,480	| IOT121 |	Going to eat we're starting to see some really interesting technology come for
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,552	| IOT121 |	That is moving us closer and closer
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,600	| IOT121 |	To be able to do that with great certainty
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,672	| IOT121 |	Do you want to tell me what those Technologies are
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:13,792	| IOT121 |	So Stacy there are so many exciting new technologies headed our way
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,584	| IOT121 |	It is a futurist it's my job
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,376	| IOT121 |	Explore all of them
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,168	| IOT121 |	Weather at the
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,448	| IOT121 |	Facial recognition
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,984	| IOT121 |	All different
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| IOT121 |	Types of biometric
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,544	| IOT121 |	Shoes
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:27,872	| IOT121 |	Both persistent and non-persistent Technology
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,920	| IOT121 |	There is just a
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,712	| IOT121 |	Wide variety of Technology
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| IOT121 |	See that you're going to see
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:33,504	| IOT121 |	Embedded
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,808	| IOT121 |	In many different types of
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,368	| IOT121 |	Security devices that are not only going to make it
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,184	| IOT121 |	Easier more convenient and simple
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:44,256	| IOT121 |	But potentially even more secure than it is today
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:47,072	| IOT121 |	Alright Rob where can I go to find out more

EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:29,568	| IOT121 |	Mesh
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,592	| IOT121 |	For what feels like
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,176	| IOT121 |	For two years
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,272	| IOT121 |	You guys just announced the Bluetooth mesh Spectre
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,088	| IOT121 |	We are so excited
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:41,856	| IOT121 |	This feels like
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,416	| IOT121 |	It was made for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,696	| IOT121 |	So
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,464	| IOT121 |	Talk to us
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,232	| IOT121 |	What is
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,560	| IOT121 |	Guess you're right it was made for the inter
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:57,472	| IOT121 |	And so specifically it is we are adding an additional Network topology
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,800	| IOT121 |	This one happens to be a Mesh networking
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:03,360	| IOT121 |	Topology so now what that means it allows
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,408	| IOT121 |	You'll have many to many device can you
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:07,200	| IOT121 |	What that means
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:11,552	| IOT121 |	Is it really suited for applications like building automation
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:15,392	| IOT121 |	Wireless sensor networks asset tracking things like that new
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,672	| IOT121 |	Have up-and-coming Market
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,696	| IOT121 |	It's where you have
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,744	| IOT121 |	Tens or hundreds or
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,280	| IOT121 |	Or even thousands of device
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,072	| IOT121 |	Is that somehow need to
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,864	| IOT121 |	Securely and reliably connect
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:29,216	| IOT121 |	So it builds on all the other capabilities Bluetooth has
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,264	| IOT121 |	Which is already supports a kind of a coin
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,288	| IOT121 |	The point Network topology
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,336	| IOT121 |	Broadcast topology
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:36,128	| IOT121 |	And now with this we are adding
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,152	| IOT121 |	A mesh Network
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,176	| IOT121 |	Anthropologie
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:40,992	| IOT121 |	Okay in a little bit we're going to get into
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,528	| IOT121 |	How you guys are doing the
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,064	| IOT121 |	Before that
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,600	| IOT121 |	Let's try to
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,880	| IOT121 |	Focusing on
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,672	| IOT121 |	How this relates to
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,952	| IOT121 |	The other flavors of
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:51,744	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth so now we have Bluetooth
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,280	| IOT121 |	Classic Blues
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,328	| IOT121 |	And then we have Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,632	| IOT121 |	Where does MASH fit in with
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:01,984	| IOT121 |	Actually there are only two flavors of Bluetooth that stays
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,776	| IOT121 |	True with the introduction of mass
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,360	| IOT121 |	For those of you that or where we started Bluetooth
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,408	| IOT121 |	21 years ago in the initial
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:13,504	| IOT121 |	Labor a Bluetooth is something that is called basic rate enhanced data rate
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:15,040	| IOT121 |	Or breeder
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:20,416	| IOT121 |	And that one so it was a really good technology and still is today or crazies kind of
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,696	| IOT121 |	Continuous wireless connection
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,000	| IOT121 |	Stream audio over
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,816	| IOT121 |	And that's what's the technology today behind
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| IOT121 |	The whole wireless audio industry
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,888	| IOT121 |	Weather in headsets
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:31,680	| IOT121 |	Speakers are in car systems
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,472	| IOT121 |	It also supports a simple
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:36,288	| IOT121 |	Point-to-point Network topology for one to one device
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| IOT121 |	That's a really really good Mark
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,128	| IOT121 |	Then back in
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,920	| IOT121 |	2010 timeframe
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:43,456	| IOT121 |	We launched the second
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,224	| IOT121 |	Flavor of Love
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,992	| IOT121 |	Which is
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,016	| IOT121 |	Cold low energy
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,552	| IOT121 |	Or Bluetooth LE
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:50,624	| IOT121 |	It is a yellow wire breeder was for
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,648	| IOT121 |	Continuous Wireless connect
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:54,720	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth LE is form or short bursts Wireless
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:58,560	| IOT121 |	It really was done to enable
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,840	| IOT121 |	Really really low power
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:03,936	| IOT121 |	Consumption it was initially targeted at at what the time was this nation
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,704	| IOT121 |	Connected
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,216	| IOT121 |	Device Market
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:08,800	| IOT121 |	Wle came along and they also supported that
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,080	| IOT121 |	The same point
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:10,848	| IOT121 |	The point Network
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:11,616	| IOT121 |	Topology
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,152	| IOT121 |	But now it was really for
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:16,992	| IOT121 |	What kind of data transfer services rather than streaming services and was
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,784	| IOT121 |	Again targeted that connected device mark
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,624	| IOT121 |	Interesting thing about Bluetooth LE is when we launched it
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:24,160	| IOT121 |	Not only did it also
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,928	| IOT121 |	Support point-to-point
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,720	| IOT121 |	Bre Dr
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,000	| IOT121 |	I mean also introduced
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,792	| IOT121 |	Another topology called Broad
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,864	| IOT121 |	Really around one too many
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:33,632	| IOT121 |	Medication
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,960	| IOT121 |	What does evolved into over the last couple of years left
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,288	| IOT121 |	People are really using for that or is this whole kind of Beacon Market
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:47,200	| IOT121 |	Yeah those kind of point-of-interest beacons there's item fighting deconcilis Technologies you now.
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:53,600	| IOT121 |	See out there that use Bluetooth is a way to find your lost keys or your wallet or your phone or even using deacons as a way to find you
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,880	| IOT121 |	Your way around an airport
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:58,720	| IOT121 |	Or Conference Center or Stadium
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,488	| IOT121 |	Broadcast
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,256	| IOT121 |	Last apology
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,536	| IOT121 |	For one too many
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,328	| IOT121 |	And that leaves us where we are today with mash
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| IOT121 |	What mesh is
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:06,656	| IOT121 |	It's not another flavor of Bluetooth
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,704	| IOT121 |	It's just an additional Network
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,472	| IOT121 |	Pieology Austin
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:12,032	| IOT121 |	Available for Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:14,080	| IOT121 |	So does Bill on top of Ellie
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:18,176	| IOT121 |	So mess is all about how you can enable now
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:22,784	| IOT121 |	Dementia before tens hundreds or even thousands of Bluetooth LE devices
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:25,088	| IOT121 |	To be able to exchange messages together
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:25,856	| IOT121 |	Anna Faris
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,648	| IOT121 |	Usher reliable in
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,672	| IOT121 |	Available way
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,440	| IOT121 |	All right
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:31,232	| IOT121 |	So Bluetooth classic
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,256	| IOT121 |	No mesh
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,024	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth LE
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,048	| IOT121 |	Jasmine
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:36,352	| IOT121 |	And it's going to go back
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,888	| IOT121 |	How far to what versions of
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:42,240	| IOT121 |	I decided to develop the Bluetooth mess Fest
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,032	| IOT121 |	Medication such that they would work back to you
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:47,872	| IOT121 |	Any Bluetooth LE that was 4. O or higher
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,408	| IOT121 |	This is really helpful
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:52,736	| IOT121 |	And for those of us who are super excited
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,296	| IOT121 |	Fashion I'm going to include myself in this category
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,856	| IOT121 |	I'm looking forward to it because I am
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,928	| IOT121 |	Excited about being able to control lights in my smart home
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:03,232	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth light bulbs
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,024	| IOT121 |	Without having to go to the floor there actually are
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,304	| IOT121 |	Which is right now.
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,352	| IOT121 |	Fireball
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,400	| IOT121 |	That's just me but what else are people thinking
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:10,912	| IOT121 |	Think about using
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,240	| IOT121 |	A lot of it
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:20,640	| IOT121 |	But let me go a little bit more into that so building Automation in general is an area where we see a lot
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,176	| IOT121 |	Olive activities that's looking
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,480	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth mesh to there
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:28,576	| IOT121 |	Then there's the wireless sensors O2 sensor Market in general
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:30,368	| IOT121 |	Especially kind of in industrial use case
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:34,208	| IOT121 |	Where they're looking to evolve their sensor Network
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,488	| IOT121 |	Wireless or economic
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:38,560	| IOT121 |	Endure being able to add more devices
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:40,864	| IOT121 |	Really helping out in there and they also NASA
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:43,168	| IOT121 |	Certain areas where
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:45,216	| IOT121 |	This technology really makes a lot of
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:48,544	| IOT121 |	Those are three big bucket areas where we see a lot of act
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,104	| IOT121 |	Building automation
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,640	| IOT121 |	I use that term relatively
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:54,688	| IOT121 |	Broadly there cuz there's residential which is
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:56,480	| IOT121 |	Is the smart home when what you kind of brought up
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:59,552	| IOT121 |	And which will be right in the middle of that as well
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,600	| IOT121 |	But when I'm really excited about is more than
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:02,624	| IOT121 |	Commercial area.
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:07,232	| IOT121 |	Where there are a lot of companies now that are
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,768	| IOT121 |	Targeting that for
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:13,376	| IOT121 |	Whether it's lighting or heating cooling or security or so forth
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,936	| IOT121 |	Aurelia doing a lot of sophisticated automation
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,448	| IOT121 |	Control
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| IOT121 |	For the building
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:24,128	| IOT121 |	And in their we're seeing a lot of energy where the initial thing is I'm actually on Commercial Lighting
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,920	| IOT121 |	We're seeing a lot of movement
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,200	| IOT121 |	In commercial lighting
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:29,760	| IOT121 |	Because the business case is pretty straightforward therefore
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,528	| IOT121 |	People wear
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:35,136	| IOT121 |	There's this whole other changes of what right now people going from complex fluorescent
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:37,184	| IOT121 |	And those buildings over to LED
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,976	| IOT121 |	At that time going over to wireless
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,256	| IOT121 |	Control makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:47,168	| IOT121 |	Is a lot of kind of governmental and local regulation going in for smart buildings and energy efficient buildings and so forth
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:53,568	| IOT121 |	A lot of things and planets aligning right now for that commercial building Automation and lighting specifically
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:58,176	| IOT121 |	Getting a lot of traction so you'll see a lot of activity in there
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,712	| IOT121 |	A few questions
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:01,504	| IOT121 |	What and these can be quick answer
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:06,880	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth mesh because it's compatible with Bluetooth low energy that means it is
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:07,648	| IOT121 |	Lord
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:09,440	| IOT121 |	Erase or rather
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,464	| IOT121 |	I won't be able to do audio
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,024	| IOT121 |	That's right these
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,304	| IOT121 |	Mesh networks not just
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,072	| IOT121 |	Just Bluetooth
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,120	| IOT121 |	Despedida lobbies low-power mesh Network
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:19,680	| IOT121 |	Really intended at those kinds of yusuke
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:25,824	| IOT121 |	Amounts of data around facilities in math where the domain of other other Technologies are
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:27,616	| IOT121 |	This one is really a
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:29,408	| IOT121 |	In these areas we talked about where it's at
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:31,456	| IOT121 |	Building Automation and sensor networks rehab
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:33,504	| IOT121 |	Lots and lots and lots of devices
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:37,088	| IOT121 |	They need to communicate with each other but that's generally not
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,368	| IOT121 |	Streaming large amounts of data
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,672	| IOT121 |	It's kind of command-and-control have a net
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:44,768	| IOT121 |	Will Bluetooth mesh take advantage of the greater range
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:46,816	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth 5
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:50,656	| IOT121 |	The initial set of specifications do not look to Leverage
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:51,936	| IOT121 |	Some of the princess
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,472	| IOT121 |	The broadcast data capacity enhanced
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,008	| IOT121 |	Incurred in five
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,544	| IOT121 |	Are not part of the initial messed up
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:01,408	| IOT121 |	Doing four or Mash those aren't imperative
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:02,688	| IOT121 |	Sure
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:03,968	| IOT121 |	The biggest complaint
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,736	| IOT121 |	I've heard
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,784	| IOT121 |	About Bluetooth as a mesh Network
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:11,392	| IOT121 |	Up until this moment in time has been that it is a flood based as opposed to a routing
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:11,904	| IOT121 |	Bass network
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:12,928	| IOT121 |	End
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,720	| IOT121 |	Basically what that means
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:18,560	| IOT121 |	It's just shouting his messages to everyone all the time
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,328	| IOT121 |	I'm in that can get
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,864	| IOT121 |	That can overload assist
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:23,936	| IOT121 |	Right as opposed to having intelligent routing which
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,008	| IOT121 |	Is a little bit less flexible you have to plan for it there's
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:29,312	| IOT121 |	There's constraints on both sides right
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,848	| IOT121 |	What you guys are
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,384	| IOT121 |	Done is y'all have
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,152	| IOT121 |	Created this
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,664	| IOT121 |	Intelligent
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,736	| IOT121 |	So explain to me how this is going
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:42,112	| IOT121 |	That's right so you a couple of years ago in when the group started this
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:48,256	| IOT121 |	Zephyr to create the mess specifications that was absolutely Abby imagined
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,560	| IOT121 |	What's the message
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,608	| IOT121 |	Transmission
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,912	| IOT121 |	You do around it approached or you do a flooded
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,216	| IOT121 |	And when they went
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:59,520	| IOT121 |	Through the whole exercise of looking at the requirements
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,288	| IOT121 |	Sports
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:02,080	| IOT121 |	Dale and reliability
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:03,360	| IOT121 |	Simplicity and everything else
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,664	| IOT121 |	It was really couldn't get there
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,944	| IOT121 |	With the route is broke
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:09,504	| IOT121 |	So I'll go I'll go back to the example of
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:10,784	| IOT121 |	Commercial Lighting where I have to have a
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:12,576	| IOT121 |	Switch
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,600	| IOT121 |	Turn on
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:16,160	| IOT121 |	Hundreds of lights all the same time massive multiki
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,184	| IOT121 |	Yelp
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:20,000	| IOT121 |	And you really can't get there with a router
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,792	| IOT121 |	Show is agreed that applied approach
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:24,096	| IOT121 |	Wireless mesh Networks
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| IOT121 |	Very very unique
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,144	| IOT121 |	Fundamentally different
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:28,704	| IOT121 |	And so have the
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,496	| IOT121 |	Requirements in different capabilities
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:33,568	| IOT121 |	It was determined after that the flood base approach was
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,872	| IOT121 |	Was uniquely suited for that
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:39,968	| IOT121 |	The kinds of scale the kind of reliability so it's inherently
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:40,736	| IOT121 |	Multipass
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,760	| IOT121 |	It's inherently selfish
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,552	| IOT121 |	Inherently no points
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:46,624	| IOT121 |	Failure rather than trying to engineer those things
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,696	| IOT121 |	Now you mention you got to be careful though
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:53,024	| IOT121 |	In a flood approach this deal with some of the power Quest
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:58,912	| IOT121 |	So those are those are things we done into what we call a manager
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,192	| IOT121 |	Blood approach for message
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:03,264	| IOT121 |	So for instance simple time to live counter
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,288	| IOT121 |	To make sure that message
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,312	| IOT121 |	Propagation doesn't
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,848	| IOT121 |	Go unnecessarily
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:10,944	| IOT121 |	Message caching so you don't get into an unnecessary looping they're looking a message
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:14,016	| IOT121 |	We have the relay function itself
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:16,064	| IOT121 |	Is actually not mange
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,904	| IOT121 |	Date when you provision device you declare whether that's
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,720	| IOT121 |	It's going to be relay messages or not
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:26,816	| IOT121 |	You wouldn't have a an on main power node for instance relay message
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,352	| IOT121 |	It would be too much energy
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,912	| IOT121 |	So is a developer I can set my
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:31,936	| IOT121 |	A device to be
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:33,472	| IOT121 |	Router
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:36,288	| IOT121 |	Have router functionality versus
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:36,800	| IOT121 |	Not or
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:46,016	| IOT121 |	Provisioning a Mains powered device
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:46,784	| IOT121 |	You would probably
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:48,320	| IOT121 |	Give that the real
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,368	| IOT121 |	Here's a message
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,904	| IOT121 |	There's not for itself
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,184	| IOT121 |	Then it will then retransmit that
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:55,232	| IOT121 |	QuikTrip is a sensor
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,280	| IOT121 |	Hanging out on battery I don't want that
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:58,560	| IOT121 |	Stop by when
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:04,192	| IOT121 |	Heavy duty cycle over there would be associated with having to have that on and listen
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:04,704	| IOT121 |	For those messages
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:10,592	| IOT121 |	OU more than that you mentioned a great one there like a sensor that sitting here in a coin cell battery
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:13,408	| IOT121 |	Even if it's not real aim you need to make sure that doesn't happen
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,176	| IOT121 |	Sit there and have it
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:16,224	| IOT121 |	Your radio all the time even listening
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,272	| IOT121 |	So there are other additional
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,552	| IOT121 |	Functions that can be
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,832	| IOT121 |	Provisions into any
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:23,392	| IOT121 |	So if you are a battery-powered
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,160	| IOT121 |	Sensor
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,952	| IOT121 |	You be given a look all the low power notes
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,000	| IOT121 |	And there's also a
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,280	| IOT121 |	Companion function called a friend
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,840	| IOT121 |	What you would provision into other main power device
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,352	| IOT121 |	Surround it
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,144	| IOT121 |	Low power
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:38,496	| IOT121 |	Node wakes up with this function in it first thing it does is look for a friend around it
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,032	| IOT121 |	They set up a relationship
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:43,104	| IOT121 |	And that one Indian down messages that are busy or Destin
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:48,224	| IOT121 |	For the low-power note to friend hold on to it and then that that low power
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,808	| IOT121 |	Minutes
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,600	| IOT121 |	And then retrieve this message
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,136	| IOT121 |	Messages from the friend
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,696	| IOT121 |	There's techniques in these other Solutions use not yours
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:40:00,768	| IOT121 |	Somewhat similar techniques but it's all around allowing for these
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:03,840	| IOT121 |	Battery-powered nose to operate for many many years on this
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:04,864	| IOT121 |	Single coin cell
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,400	| IOT121 |	Oh my God that sounds
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:09,216	| IOT121 |	Very useful and totally applicable towards
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,264	| IOT121 |	I'm surprised you're selling but it also sounds so incredible
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:17,408	| IOT121 |	Is this something that I now have to figure out is part of the spec
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:19,968	| IOT121 |	Or is this something that you guys are going to do for meat like
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,016	| IOT121 |	How much of this do I need to do
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:27,136	| IOT121 |	That's right there along with the Bluetooth
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:29,184	| IOT121 |	Your radio you're going to get the mess stack if you
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:30,464	| IOT121 |	UL weather yeah there's many ways
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:33,536	| IOT121 |	The source that whether it's from the Silicon provider Independence
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| IOT121 |	Within there
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:40,192	| IOT121 |	And then there's a provisioning tool that is provided to you as well and that's what's response
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:44,288	| IOT121 |	Possible for when you provision a device making that a very straightforward
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:44,800	| IOT121 |	Exercise
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:47,360	| IOT121 |	How does this handle IPv6
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:51,456	| IOT121 |	There is work underway to allow my pecan Chevy with a Bluetooth generic
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,016	| IOT121 |	But what we're trying to do with this is us
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:56,576	| IOT121 |	You know that I could get for use for many many use cases
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:00,672	| IOT121 |	That's not what's getting you so for actually enabling a mess
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:01,440	| IOT121 |	Based messaging
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,976	| IOT121 |	So how do I
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,280	| IOT121 |	Yo transmitter
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:07,328	| IOT121 |	Messages for command-and-control purposes
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,864	| IOT121 |	Many many many devices
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,168	| IOT121 |	That is not leveraging ipv4
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,704	| IOT121 |	Rb6 is part of that
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:15,264	| IOT121 |	Bright so I won't have a match that spans different IP
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,336	| IOT121 |	Snow
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:19,360	| IOT121 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,128	| IOT121 |	So
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:23,456	| IOT121 |	There's been a lot of conversation about different
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,480	| IOT121 |	Profiles
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:26,528	| IOT121 |	And I don't think you guys you call a mesh models
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,856	| IOT121 |	And there's one for lighting that's been developed
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:33,440	| IOT121 |	Tell me a little bit about what this is because it feels a little
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,048	| IOT121 |	So if you're used to Bluetooth you've heard
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,328	| IOT121 |	The car the profile turned
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:45,728	| IOT121 |	Before that's how we talked about whether they were gapped profiles or the traditional profiles for b r e d r l e
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:49,312	| IOT121 |	That was proposed to find how Communications happen between
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:51,360	| IOT121 |	Do devices using that simple point.
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,128	| IOT121 |	Wing connection
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,943	| IOT121 |	Now when you go to mash that hire kind of app
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:55,967	| IOT121 |	Application layer
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:56,991	| IOT121 |	Now if you will
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:42:03,135	| IOT121 |	So what defines a node on the network in the behavior of that node on the network that's done with something called
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,927	| IOT121 |	Model model
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,743	| IOT121 |	And the way that we approach that
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:14,143	| IOT121 |	Is really a very powerful way where there's a number of generic models that you use to them to find what the big
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,447	| IOT121 |	Behavior of a device on the network is Caesar buried
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:22,847	| IOT121 |	Very simple things were talking to on and off you up down those types of generic definition
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:24,383	| IOT121 |	Define envy
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:28,479	| IOT121 |	Library of math models that were that are beans part of the specification
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:33,343	| IOT121 |	So if I have a mesh model for and you can have one for like lighting
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,111	| IOT121 |	What other models
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:41,023	| IOT121 |	Generics that are just for buy everything and then there are some areas that have been gone into more
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:43,071	| IOT121 |	4 of theirs lighting is a big Focus
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:43,839	| IOT121 |	Did we mention
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:45,631	| IOT121 |	Sensors the whole set of definition
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,423	| IOT121 |	Surround sensors so that's the other
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:48,959	| IOT121 |	Really really big initial use cases
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:53,823	| IOT121 |	So you'll see stop an asset tracking and other other areas
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,591	| IOT121 |	Is well okay
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:55,871	| IOT121 |	So now
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:58,431	| IOT121 |	I hear the phrase mesh models and I think
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:59,711	| IOT121 |	Zigbee profiles
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:01,247	| IOT121 |	If you are
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:05,343	| IOT121 |	He may not have been a huge student of zigbee profiles but you know there's like
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,135	| IOT121 |	Home automation lights
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:09,439	| IOT121 |	However many datos that they had
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:14,303	| IOT121 |	And it was very confusing because not all of your Zippy devices would actually work together
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:16,607	| IOT121 |	When you brought them home
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:18,399	| IOT121 |	Unless they were part of the same
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:18,911	| IOT121 |	Profile
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,727	| IOT121 |	And so when I'm hearing
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:22,239	| IOT121 |	You talk about
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:25,055	| IOT121 |	Mesh models I am getting
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:28,895	| IOT121 |	Flashback to zigbee profiles and JB did away with them
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:29,407	| IOT121 |	7-Zip III
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:33,247	| IOT121 |	It still scares me so I'm worried that I
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,271	| IOT121 |	Bluetooth which is
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:34,783	| IOT121 |	Works really well
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,367	| IOT121 |	The Mind trust that has done that it is
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| IOT121 |	Do they come up with an approach is
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,183	| IOT121 |	Incredible power
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:43,743	| IOT121 |	Incredibly flexible and addresses the
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:45,791	| IOT121 |	Concerns you have about interoperability
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:46,559	| IOT121 |	Right so
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:48,607	| IOT121 |	For instance just to talk through this
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,631	| IOT121 |	54 seconds
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:54,751	| IOT121 |	Which is actually when you provision a device on network
EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:55,775	| IOT121 |	It goes and does
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:44:00,383	| IOT121 |	Theory of all the capabilities of that device and then that makes
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:02,943	| IOT121 |	Just all come together so it's it takes the
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,503	| IOT121 |	To the actual person who's doing the provisioning weather that's
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:07,039	| IOT121 |	Consumer rated commercial contacts
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:12,415	| IOT121 |	All that it's all that end or the developer that's all in place that does come together
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:17,279	| IOT121 |	If I got a product that is running running a lighting Bosch model
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:20,095	| IOT121 |	And I've got another product that is running a sensor measure
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:22,655	| IOT121 |	Can they talk to each other
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:29,055	| IOT121 |	Isn't that comes into the role of the provisioner that the provisions that will not a person so this is the provisioning configuration tool to get the
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,847	| IOT121 |	You get supplied with when you
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:32,127	| IOT121 |	By this message the system
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,407	| IOT121 |	These are system
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,943	| IOT121 |	Institutions are being presented to you
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:38,527	| IOT121 |	Aquarius device ID knows what kind of device it is okay it's alright
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:41,599	| IOT121 |	What's a thermostat
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:44,671	| IOT121 |	Thanks and then it also knows what capabilities.
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:52,351	| IOT121 |	And then is responsible for presenting this in a way that allows it gave you these things can work
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:57,215	| IOT121 |	Together right so that's the burden is put on the provisioning tool to make that very very straightforward and
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:58,495	| IOT121 |	The end-user
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:44:59,775	| IOT121 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,823	| IOT121 |	So let's talk about how long it's going to take
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,103	| IOT121 |	To get
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:04,895	| IOT121 |	2 mesh Bluetooth in
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,175	| IOT121 |	Commercial
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:06,687	| IOT121 |	Products
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:11,039	| IOT121 |	When there's changes in the Spectre effect
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:12,063	| IOT121 |	The radio layer
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:13,343	| IOT121 |	Like witches 5 did
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:16,415	| IOT121 |	There's a natural. Time it needs to have
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:18,719	| IOT121 |	For those products to
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:20,255	| IOT121 |	It developed and tested in
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:21,023	| IOT121 |	At the market
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:24,351	| IOT121 |	That was his message that we said this is another radio flavor of
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:26,911	| IOT121 |	Valve software layer the network
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,191	| IOT121 |	So things can happen
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:28,959	| IOT121 |	More rapidly
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:35,359	| IOT121 |	So y'all are normal answer here is typically on within 6 months you'll start to see products in the market I think here you'll see stuff
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:37,407	| IOT121 |	What happened pretty quickly based on the amount of
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,991	| IOT121 |	Of activities has already been going on here for quite some time
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:47,135	| IOT121 |	In the maturity of some of the solutions that are already out there so I think you'll see things will certainly this year and hopefully pretty quick
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:48,671	| IOT121 |	Awesome Ken
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,719	| IOT121 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| IOT121 |	For spending so much time
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:52,511	| IOT121 |	Explaining
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:57,375	| IOT121 |	I'm glad to do it thank you for having me on the show
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:03,775	| IOT121 |	That's it for this week's show thank you so much for listening and if you want more iot news you can buy
EDL	00:46:03,775	00:46:10,175	| IOT121 |	Sign up for my newsletter Stacey knows things at Stacey on iot. Cam will see
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:16,319	| IOT121 |	Next week
