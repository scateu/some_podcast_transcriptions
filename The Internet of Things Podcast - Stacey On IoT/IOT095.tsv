EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:14,848	| IOT095 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:16,384	| IOT095 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:18,432	| IOT095 |	And we have got an amazing show for
EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:18,944	| IOT095 |	Are you today
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:20,480	| IOT095 |	We have
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:21,760	| IOT095 |	New Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:24,832	| IOT095 |	We got a new smart home plan from Telstra Australia
EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,880	| IOT095 |	We've got home for Sonos
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:28,160	| IOT095 |	We've got
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:29,952	| IOT095 |	The future of retail
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:31,744	| IOT095 |	We're going to save some right
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:38,400	| IOT095 |	And if we get to it we will talk about my experience with stringify
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:39,424	| IOT095 |	Which is a
EDL	00:00:39,424	00:00:39,936	| IOT095 |	Really
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:42,240	| IOT095 |	How cool it's like it if this then that
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:44,800	| IOT095 |	They're going to hate me for saying it but that's what it does
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:49,152	| IOT095 |	We also have a sponsored message from
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:50,432	| IOT095 |	Cast an amazing guest
EDL	00:00:50,944	00:00:52,480	| IOT095 |	We have three amazing guess
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:53,504	| IOT095 |	I went to an event
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:57,856	| IOT095 |	National instruments and I managed to run into the CEO of PTC
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:00,416	| IOT095 |	The CEO of NRA
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,696	| IOT095 |	Alex Devereux
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:02,464	| IOT095 |	And
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:08,352	| IOT095 |	Their head of embedded systems Jamie Smith all of them are coming on the show this week to talk about
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:10,656	| IOT095 |	What is going on in the industrial
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:11,424	| IOT095 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:12,960	| IOT095 |	No
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:14,240	| IOT095 |	Let's go to a quick sponsor message
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,544	| IOT095 |	This week sponsor
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,640	| IOT095 |	That's right you guys I don't have a sponsor this week
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:27,040	| IOT095 |	But I decided to use the spot to tell you about two things one if you would like to be a sponsor the space
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:33,440	| IOT095 |	You should email Andrew at Coyote podcast.com into if you can't get a
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:39,840	| IOT095 |	Enough internet of things news for me here you should sign up for my newsletter Stacey on iot.
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:42,656	| IOT095 |	It's also my brand new website

EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| IOT095 |	All right I think that's it
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,832	| IOT095 |	How is my 32nd
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,136	| IOT095 |	Back to the show
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:04,928	| IOT095 |	Kevin
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,720	| IOT095 |	Weather
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,000	| IOT095 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT095 |	Hi
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:12,608	| IOT095 |	I love pies restaurants Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:13,888	| IOT095 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:18,496	| IOT095 |	So they got a new compute module is this is the
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,032	| IOT095 |	Third instance of it I believe
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,824	| IOT095 |	I almost feel like it's
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:24,640	| IOT095 |	No cuz they have raspberry they have the original
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,176	| IOT095 |	They have one that's better
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| IOT095 |	And then they have the zero
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,480	| IOT095 |	It's like
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,248	| IOT095 |	V bucks
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:30,784	| IOT095 |	And now they have
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:31,808	| IOT095 |	The superpower
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:35,136	| IOT095 |	Right okay so this is that they're calling the compute module
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,952	| IOT095 |	3 which is based on the the latest
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,000	| IOT095 |	Raspberry Pi the pi 3
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:43,584	| IOT095 |	And what the promising is even though it's all the same
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:48,704	| IOT095 |	Broadcom 2837 processor
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:54,592	| IOT095 |	It is double the RAM and about 10 times CP performance of the original computer module which was
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,408	| IOT095 |	2014, three years ago
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,480	| IOT095 |	And before the show States I eat you and I were talking like
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:05,088	| IOT095 |	Does a Raspberry Pi as in a compute module does it need more
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:08,672	| IOT095 |	Power if it's going to be safer IRT maybe a person like that
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,000	| IOT095 |	Right now maybe not
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,560	| IOT095 |	But you raised a good point they're trying to stay
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,096	| IOT095 |	I think because
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,632	| IOT095 |	As
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:19,936	| IOT095 |	We add more devices to our homes
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:26,336	| IOT095 |	It takes more time to compute what needs to happen all the little steps to turn things on turn things off or adjust based on
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| IOT095 |	Uncensored
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,872	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:31,968	| IOT095 |	You know at first I was like I don't really see the point is but based on your thought
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| IOT095 |	Makes sense it makes sense to stay ahead of the Curve
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,296	| IOT095 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,320	| IOT095 |	You're going to buy a hub
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:36,832	| IOT095 |	Probably
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,952	| IOT095 |	Every two to three years and for those of us who are shocked you like
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:46,048	| IOT095 |	I don't know you're not no it's it's a computer
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,072	| IOT095 |	You wouldn't die if you see
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| IOT095 |	Expected to last
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,680	| IOT095 |	I think this makes sense
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:54,496	| IOT095 |	I also think if we're going to do more local compute
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:57,312	| IOT095 |	For your house it also makes sense for that
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| IOT095 |	In this is actually really
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,920	| IOT095 |	Good use case for like the type of arm
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:07,296	| IOT095 |	Chips that are out there cuz these are very small workloads that are going to come in kind of all at once
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,344	| IOT095 |	And you're going to want to parse them up if you can
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,112	| IOT095 |	I'm not saying
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| IOT095 |	Maybe we should have a
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| IOT095 |	I don't know
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| IOT095 |	Or multi-core
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,512	| IOT095 |	That's kind of my thinking he
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,327	| IOT095 |	So yeah I'm excited about this Plus
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| IOT095 |	There's such a
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,935	| IOT095 |	Huge number of people out there building crazy stuff with pies
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:28,543	| IOT095 |	And no one no one in the history of the world has ever said I need less
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,639	| IOT095 |	Right right pricing is not bad at all
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:36,223	| IOT095 |	$20 for the compute module 3 they have
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:39,039	| IOT095 |	A lighter version for $25 so
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:41,599	| IOT095 |	You know if you just want to Tinker around
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,903	| IOT095 |	How to build your own Hub you some
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:50,303	| IOT095 |	Michelle software open source software
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:53,375	| IOT095 |	And that's that's a beauty the Raspberry Pi always has been and I hope they stick
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,143	| IOT095 |	And
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,679	| IOT095 |	Just so you know
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,471	| IOT095 |	The compute module is
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:01,055	| IOT095 |	Drop-in replacement for the first
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,895	| IOT095 |	Incompatible
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,919	| IOT095 |	Gosh this
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,711	| IOT095 |	Raspberry Pi print server
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,503	| IOT095 |	Can you make a pie Sprint soccer actually
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,807	| IOT095 |	I did
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,671	| IOT095 |	It doesn't make sounds
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,975	| IOT095 |	Alright so
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,767	| IOT095 |	Yay pie
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,047	| IOT095 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,815	| IOT095 |	2
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| IOT095 |	This is some fun
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,911	| IOT095 |	News for me because I own six of these
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,471	| IOT095 |	And I have been very frustrated
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:35,871	| IOT095 |	But Sonos actually last week and we didn't address it on the show John McFarlane the CEO of Sonos
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| IOT095 |	Step down
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,711	| IOT095 |	Replace with Patrick spens
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:41,247	| IOT095 |	Has been working at Sonos for a while
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,015	| IOT095 |	Is
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,807	| IOT095 |	This felt very much like
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:49,695	| IOT095 |	Great move for Sonos I mean
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:52,511	| IOT095 |	He basically he kind of missed the boat on
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,303	| IOT095 |	Voice and soda
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,607	| IOT095 |	Putting Sonos in the position of being not just the
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,679	| IOT095 |	Speakers for the entire car
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| IOT095 |	Make it home
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| IOT095 |	But also
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,239	| IOT095 |	The ears
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,287	| IOT095 |	Instead
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:08,127	| IOT095 |	Amazon created the Amazon Echo and boom they took that
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,895	| IOT095 |	In
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| IOT095 |	For what it's worth
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,943	| IOT095 |	Sonos is still a great
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:14,015	| IOT095 |	I'm actually holding onto my Sonos is
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:16,319	| IOT095 |	Cousin sometime this year they're supposed to start work
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,879	| IOT095 |	Fingers crossed
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,927	| IOT095 |	But Patrick spens
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:22,719	| IOT095 |	Is really up
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| IOT095 |	The Voice
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,279	| IOT095 |	He is like
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:31,167	| IOT095 |	We are doing it we are not going to do it ourselves we are going to work with others Sonos has always been really good at playing it
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,935	| IOT095 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:35,519	| IOT095 |	It originally came out with like this vision of being like
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:42,687	| IOT095 |	We want to be the best darn internet-connected speaker ever so they never tried to launch their own music service to compete with other
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:45,503	| IOT095 |	Mother's Day just wanted to make all of your existing Music Services
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,807	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,343	| IOT095 |	Hopefully that's the tact
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,415	| IOT095 |	They take invoice I think they actually could have done their own
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,439	| IOT095 |	Voice thing but now it's
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| IOT095 |	Too late
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,231	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,535	| IOT095 |	You know we'll see if it's
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,071	| IOT095 |	The way forward for them I guess
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:06,239	| IOT095 |	Yeah I wonder I mean it doesn't make sense for them to kind of create their own voice interface when there are options out there
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:10,335	| IOT095 |	And my daughter have been talking to Amazon and payment amounts anything
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,663	| IOT095 |	That may be the way to go to use the
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,223	| IOT095 |	Voice services from from Amazon
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:22,623	| IOT095 |	And it's kind of interesting yet I don't know if you caught this news or do we talked about it last week that Huawei actually has a phone with
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:25,695	| IOT095 |	Amazon voice services in it Prince all is well
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:29,791	| IOT095 |	That's why people are starting to do now just climb onto what's already available in working well
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| IOT095 |	That's true in
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,911	| IOT095 |	Way back in the day cuz Sonos launch super early
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,495	| IOT095 |	They actually had like a $300 controller
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,775	| IOT095 |	You bought two controllers
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,335	| IOT095 |	Smartphones
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| IOT095 |	Wait a second
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:49,759	| IOT095 |	People in app because that $300 controller while revenue for us is also a huge barrier to entry
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,319	| IOT095 |	In Dallas
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:56,927	| IOT095 |	Patrick Spence actually said that Sonos were in 20% of American households which
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:57,951	| IOT095 |	It's a lot
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,047	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,839	| IOT095 |	I think we can expect good things here
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,423	| IOT095 |	I am ultimately a little sad that they missed the boat
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,959	| IOT095 |	Last year on this but you know
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:15,615	| IOT095 |	There's still time in the got such a broad user base it's so you know I'm not saying it's easy but essentially integrates Employee Services
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| IOT095 |	You've got a
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:20,991	| IOT095 |	Hannah people you know that I'm much happier now and then
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,807	| IOT095 |	Less likely to leave for different connected speakers
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,671	| IOT095 |	Cuz like actually ditch
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,183	| IOT095 |	Best Bluetooth speaker
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:35,071	| IOT095 |	High quality Marshall
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,887	| IOT095 |	Stanmore Bluetooth speaker we talkin about
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:38,911	| IOT095 |	I just
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:39,935	| IOT095 |	Bluetooth speakers
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,751	| IOT095 |	This is one of our
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,591	| IOT095 |	The Fight Continues
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,199	| IOT095 |	This is a quick bit too quick fix for you
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,247	| IOT095 |	One is Telstra
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,527	| IOT095 |	We're going to go International for a moment
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| IOT095 |	HealthStream which is an Australian carrier
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:00,927	| IOT095 |	Is getting into the smartphone business much like Comcast or AT&T is done
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:04,511	| IOT095 |	They've created a service that's going to cost $25
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| IOT095 |	25 Australian dollars
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:08,607	| IOT095 |	And you basically will get a starter kit
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,191	| IOT095 |	One for either security or one for automation energy
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| IOT095 |	Take out their own hub
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:17,567	| IOT095 |	It's pretty much like what you would expect from other people
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,103	| IOT095 |	Like other carriers
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,663	| IOT095 |	I mention this mostly because
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,687	| IOT095 |	I do think
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:25,759	| IOT095 |	This year we're going to see a lot more carriers come out
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,551	| IOT095 |	With the sort of offering
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,087	| IOT095 |	And I think it's
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,391	| IOT095 |	A probable way
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,951	| IOT095 |	For smart home devices to get mainstream
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,279	| IOT095 |	One because it's easier
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| IOT095 |	And people love easy
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:44,191	| IOT095 |	You're going to feel more secure with it and you're going to feel like most of your devices are going to be free
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,031	| IOT095 |	Those are some of the worries that
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,311	| IOT095 |	Customers have
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,639	| IOT095 |	Those are valid concerns
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,455	| IOT095 |	It's interesting you mention security and I know that
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| IOT095 |	Last year
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:02,623	| IOT095 |	Telstra talking about using blockchain and biometric security for their iot stuff so
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,159	| IOT095 |	You know they're not
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:10,303	| IOT095 |	Fiddling around here in just putting products out there not thinking about the one of the most important aspects that we talked about all the time or just security so
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| IOT095 |	At least they're they're thinking forward in that respect
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,935	| IOT095 |	They are and they're one of the companies that it CES
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,751	| IOT095 |	Add a smart home suite of products out on display
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,079	| IOT095 |	This is probably
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,639	| IOT095 |	Good I don't know who makes telstra's gear
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:30,271	| IOT095 |	These are the kind of things that I'm going to be looking for is to or the providers to the
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,319	| IOT095 |	Terriers and security firms
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,599	| IOT095 |	Chinese
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| IOT095 |	Are they startups
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:41,535	| IOT095 |	Which startups are actually good enough to make it into these systems or being good enough
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,119	| IOT095 |	Question of some control
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,191	| IOT095 |	These are things that are
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,727	| IOT095 |	This this year is going to be a big
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| IOT095 |	For iot
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,519	| IOT095 |	In this function
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,055	| IOT095 |	Keep an eye on it
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| IOT095 |	Ok
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,663	| IOT095 |	Also international news
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,175	| IOT095 |	Nest
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,223	| IOT095 |	Has God for more European
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,735	| IOT095 |	Countries
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,527	| IOT095 |	They are now in
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,807	| IOT095 |	Germany
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,343	| IOT095 |	Austria Italy
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,111	| IOT095 |	In spades
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,903	| IOT095 |	They're already in the UK
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,951	| IOT095 |	And basically this just
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| IOT095 |	Pushes them out
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,767	| IOT095 |	Further into
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:20,447	| IOT095 |	I wonder that end I'll just say yes this is part of alphabet which one's Google and I
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,471	| IOT095 |	Nashville time
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,519	| IOT095 |	Consult for Google so I can get that out of the way
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| IOT095 |	I wonder what
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:30,943	| IOT095 |	Has taken so long as you think it's privacy laws in those countries that need to be mitigated or
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| IOT095 |	I'm so glad you are
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:35,807	| IOT095 |	Fat look at that it's not even on the show
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,343	| IOT095 |	And I just asked the right question
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:37,855	| IOT095 |	Yuan
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,903	| IOT095 |	That's why you're the host
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,415	| IOT095 |	Arco home
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,695	| IOT095 |	All right
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,767	| IOT095 |	So I think one of the issues here
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,279	| IOT095 |	Where is
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,815	| IOT095 |	Regulatory
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:50,399	| IOT095 |	Not just privacy but also
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:52,191	| IOT095 |	Getting things through the
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,983	| IOT095 |	Different countries versions of the FCC
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:59,615	| IOT095 |	And the reason this is kind of interesting to me is because when I was at CES I spoke
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,407	| IOT095 |	With a bunch of
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,455	| IOT095 |	Companies from like the France Tech Pavilion
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:05,503	| IOT095 |	And all that
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:12,671	| IOT095 |	And they were talking about they're not available here in the US the products aren't available in the US but they're working their way through the app
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,207	| IOT095 |	CC's process
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,511	| IOT095 |	That provides a lot of stumbling
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:18,303	| IOT095 |	Gymnastics
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| IOT095 |	Is pretty professional
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| IOT095 |	They're not like a starter
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,399	| IOT095 |	They probably can get through but
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,191	| IOT095 |	These things take time
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| IOT095 |	And so
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| IOT095 |	I don't know what this is
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:32,127	| IOT095 |	Good bad buddy wants a lot of interference jacking up their existing system so I tend to agree that it's good
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,151	| IOT095 |	But
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,199	| IOT095 |	That regulatory hurdle can take
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:41,855	| IOT095 |	Obviously not like Hardware Supply there's plenty of those products being billed as just getting through to like you
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:46,463	| IOT095 |	Correct spelling of the regulatory agencies that are specific to each country
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:50,815	| IOT095 |	And I can't say I'm up on the latest frequencies The Clash over
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,863	| IOT095 |	Yogurt making me use I don't know
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| IOT095 |	If there's something that
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:58,751	| IOT095 |	A typical Nest product uses that interferes with an everyday thing over there but
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,287	| IOT095 |	Still seems like a long time
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:04,383	| IOT095 |	Does an end you know they also have to hire
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:06,175	| IOT095 |	Company-specific support
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:10,015	| IOT095 |	If you're in Italy you probably don't do your customer support
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,599	| IOT095 |	PriceRite localization care
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,391	| IOT095 |	Challenges
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,511	| IOT095 |	This is a market
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:26,143	| IOT095 |	Where you're going to have to have a fairly large Footprints so you're probably going to want to go to places
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,167	| IOT095 |	Where you can
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,959	| IOT095 |	Build up your bar kit
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,775	| IOT095 |	Easily and quickly so that means smaller countries
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,591	| IOT095 |	May miss out on some products from startups
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,127	| IOT095 |	Eddie House
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| IOT095 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,711	| IOT095 |	Let's move from International
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,247	| IOT095 |	2
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,271	| IOT095 |	Enterprise iot
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:46,623	| IOT095 |	What we have here is this week is NRF National Retail Federation
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,183	| IOT095 |	Conference event
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:53,023	| IOT095 |	They called The Big Show the NRF Big Show cuz I was there yesterday at it
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,559	| IOT095 |	Did you see anything
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:02,495	| IOT095 |	I didn't have a lot of time I did see a lot of I did see a lot of exciting things interesting no retailers
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:05,311	| IOT095 |	They're looking for ways to be in a booster
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,127	| IOT095 |	Foot traffic in stores looking for ways to
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,919	| IOT095 |	What do we attract customers
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,199	| IOT095 |	Where they are in the store
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:15,039	| IOT095 |	How much engagement they have with a particular product or aisle
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,087	| IOT095 |	Even emotions
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,367	| IOT095 |	Cameras that will
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:20,671	| IOT095 |	Take a look at customer spaces and try and
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,439	| IOT095 |	Determine
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:26,559	| IOT095 |	How happy were disappointing people are in products or displays it
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,119	| IOT095 |	There's a lot of stuff going on there you wouldn't sink
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:32,959	| IOT095 |	Retail is glitzy in that respect but there's a lot going on Beyond the Sea
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,263	| IOT095 |	Use the word glitzy there
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,615	| IOT095 |	Retail is glitzy
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:47,807	| IOT095 |	What we actually what was interesting here is the keynote for the NRF
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,647	| IOT095 |	Event was Brian krzanich the CEO of Intel
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:56,255	| IOT095 |	A hundred million dollars
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,279	| IOT095 |	Investing in retail
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,839	| IOT095 |	They also announced basically
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| IOT095 |	It's a gateway
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:07,519	| IOT095 |	It's a Gateway lots of words but they all come down to this it's a Gateway it's a gateway
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:13,663	| IOT095 |	But the Gateway run software and idea of the software is Intel's trying to link these
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:18,015	| IOT095 |	Just for it retail systems into one intel-powered
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:18,783	| IOT095 |	Platform
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,295	| IOT095 |	Compute inform
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,111	| IOT095 |	Right now you might have
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:26,207	| IOT095 |	You know what Appliance or device that measures emotion
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,511	| IOT095 |	And you
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| IOT095 |	That goes into 1
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,607	| IOT095 |	Place and then if you want that you got to go to that one
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,167	| IOT095 |	One place until trying to do is bring
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| IOT095 |	The emotion track
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:39,775	| IOT095 |	The inventory tracking all of this into one platform
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,079	| IOT095 |	Support fraud
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:42,591	| IOT095 |	DIY spaces
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,895	| IOT095 |	I saw a lot of
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,943	| IOT095 |	Plays at that a lot of
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,735	| IOT095 |	Black puppies trying to
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,039	| IOT095 |	Bring cohesive solutions to
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:54,879	| IOT095 |	Manage and analyze all the data that these disparate systems
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,647	| IOT095 |	Capture
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,695	| IOT095 |	So that was a big theme I thought at the show
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,743	| IOT095 |	And that'll be a big scene
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,767	| IOT095 |	For everyone
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,047	| IOT095 |	Probably till the end of time
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,583	| IOT095 |	Cuz
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| IOT095 |	A lot of
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,631	| IOT095 |	These systems right now
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| IOT095 |	Are silos
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:09,215	| IOT095 |	Solutions
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:16,383	| IOT095 |	If I appoint device and then you're like oh no I want to get together with these guys have been
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,175	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,199	| IOT095 |	This is going to be
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,991	| IOT095 |	Increasingly important as
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,783	| IOT095 |	Retailers are
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:25,343	| IOT095 |	They're shutting down locations there
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,159	| IOT095 |	Having to really boost
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,207	| IOT095 |	The amount of money they make
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,231	| IOT095 |	Per square foot
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,023	| IOT095 |	They also are dealing with
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,559	| IOT095 |	You know hired labor cost
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,607	| IOT095 |	I said I really want to reduce
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,631	| IOT095 |	I'm guessing
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:41,215	| IOT095 |	But they will say they want to make each employee
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,519	| IOT095 |	Efficient and they can do that
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:46,847	| IOT095 |	Giving equipping them with more data and insights about the customer
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,663	| IOT095 |	So basically the goal is to make
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:52,223	| IOT095 |	The retail experience in-store alot
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,735	| IOT095 |	Higher ed
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:54,527	| IOT095 |	Mixer
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,135	| IOT095 |	80%
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,415	| IOT095 |	House off of Anna
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,719	| IOT095 |	And it's not because I haven't
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| IOT095 |	But
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,303	| IOT095 |	It's just easy and I hate to shop
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,327	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,119	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:13,215	| IOT095 |	We saw Intel making this announcement I actually talked to zebra
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:16,031	| IOT095 |	Which is a zebra Technologies it's a
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,871	| IOT095 |	It's well-known for RFID
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:24,735	| IOT095 |	And this one is kind of tied into tracking inventory and tracking
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| IOT095 |	Can customers
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:28,575	| IOT095 |	So actually they could end up possibly
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,599	| IOT095 |	Sending data to
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| IOT095 |	System
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,439	| IOT095 |	This actually has some cool stuff
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:35,231	| IOT095 |	Because it's RFID tags
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,303	| IOT095 |	In the clothing or in the inventory
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| IOT095 |	But it's also got these
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,607	| IOT095 |	Overhead
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,191	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| IOT095 |	Right now
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:48,543	| IOT095 |	A lot of people think of iot in retail and they think of
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,103	| IOT095 |	Beacons Bluetooth based beacons
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:54,943	| IOT095 |	But basically in even talking to Intel RFID is still King
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:18:00,831	| IOT095 |	Because it doesn't need power for one thing it's small can be
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:05,183	| IOT095 |	Attached to practically anything you know all of your inventory so
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:10,047	| IOT095 |	It just economically make sense I'm not saying it's the best solution but it's one that still work
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,631	| IOT095 |	Intel also showed off something
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:16,959	| IOT095 |	Really cool which is a 3D printer for
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,751	| IOT095 |	That was kind of annoying.
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:23,103	| IOT095 |	My voice but I was really excited it prints
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:24,895	| IOT095 |	Prince clothing
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| IOT095 |	This is business futuristic
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,735	| IOT095 |	And I'm really
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,295	| IOT095 |	Once
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:37,183	| IOT095 |	Retailers have this data am I going to get something crazy like smart mirrors that I look
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,207	| IOT095 |	I can see my clothes and
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,487	| IOT095 |	Suggestible things
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,791	| IOT095 |	Or is it going to be a little bit lower key
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,583	| IOT095 |	Would like the Apple Store
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:49,215	| IOT095 |	Play has like a tablet and they just come through and they're like oh I see you're doing this you know
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,263	| IOT095 |	This might also look good on you basically
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:19:01,503	| IOT095 |	Football scenarios because some customers want that handheld experience not handheld device
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,063	| IOT095 |	Not literally but
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:07,647	| IOT095 |	Store associate to walk them through and have personalized shopping
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:10,975	| IOT095 |	With assistance and some people just want to
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:15,071	| IOT095 |	Engage in the product themselves and figure out what's best for them and
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:18,399	| IOT095 |	And we saw that the smart mirror I think three years ago at CVS where
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:23,519	| IOT095 |	Literally stand in front of it and it would show you wearing different clothes of your choice based on your hitting a button
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:27,359	| IOT095 |	Superimposing the clothes to see what you look like in some people want that so I think
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,663	| IOT095 |	Retailers will Embrace both
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,687	| IOT095 |	I would like that in my home
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,503	| IOT095 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,807	| IOT095 |	Amazon show me what this looks like
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,623	| IOT095 |	Sunday Sunday
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,415	| IOT095 |	Pictures are
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:40,927	| IOT095 |	All right
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:44,511	| IOT095 |	Hey you guys asked for us to talk about the Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:46,047	| IOT095 |	And I was kind of like
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| IOT095 |	What
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,839	| IOT095 |	We can do that
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,631	| IOT095 |	But we can cuz Kevin went out and bought one
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| IOT095 |	Incentive
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| IOT095 |	Kevin such a sucker
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,727	| IOT095 |	I forgot it
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:20:00,127	| IOT095 |	That was the subjects I was going to say that out loud I think we all know
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,151	| IOT095 |	So tell us about the shield
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:08,063	| IOT095 |	I'm going to start off with something not negative but if I'm going to come out and say if you already have an Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:10,367	| IOT095 |	Shield because this came out 2 years ago originally
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:12,415	| IOT095 |	You don't need to buy a new Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,951	| IOT095 |	And I say that beat
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,719	| IOT095 |	Cause
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:18,047	| IOT095 |	Even though Nvidia at CES unveiled a new Shield
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:21,631	| IOT095 |	It's actually the same internals the new one in the in the old one
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,167	| IOT095 |	So if you have one
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,935	| IOT095 |	Don't
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:27,007	| IOT095 |	By 1 about a car to buy a new one because
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:30,335	| IOT095 |	With a software upgrade you going to get all the features that the new one has
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:35,199	| IOT095 |	And the reason it didn't really smarter than today I thought the reason didn't upgrade
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,967	| IOT095 |	They don't need to
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,551	| IOT095 |	The Tegra chip that they have in the original and now the new one again
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:42,879	| IOT095 |	Has plenty of horsepower to actually
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:46,719	| IOT095 |	Stream and show 1080p video no problem
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:50,815	| IOT095 |	4K video no problem 4K HDR video no problem
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:54,399	| IOT095 |	I don't have any crtv I do have a 4K TV antenna hooked up the shield
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,447	| IOT095 |	And the TV playback.
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:56,959	| IOT095 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:02,847	| IOT095 |	Television streaming in the house is done
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,639	| IOT095 |	I use PlayStation Vue for my
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,711	| IOT095 |	Typical channels in an Amazon Netflix and so on
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:12,319	| IOT095 |	There was coming in 4k in 4k HDR now for Amazon so on so forth so
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,111	| IOT095 |	So from that perspective it's good
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| IOT095 |	It's
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,440	| IOT095 |	Interesting also because
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,720	| IOT095 |	A it runs
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,280	| IOT095 |	Android TV the latest version of Android TV
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:26,144	| IOT095 |	And so it's got built-in voice recognition we talked about that earlier with Sonos
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,192	| IOT095 |	So you can use the remote
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:32,288	| IOT095 |	Corby game controller and searches by voice
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,080	| IOT095 |	OK Google Now type information
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:36,640	| IOT095 |	But the interesting thing from an outie perspective I think
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:41,248	| IOT095 |	Is that a video said we're going to bring Google Assistant to this
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,272	| IOT095 |	And
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:45,856	| IOT095 |	Because you're not always in the same room as your Shield
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:51,744	| IOT095 |	We're going to sell these little $50 plug-in modules that basically are microphones that you put throughout your house
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,280	| IOT095 |	And some people say why
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,816	| IOT095 |	Always listening
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:58,912	| IOT095 |	Some people do want that those that do will have access to Google Assistant
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,960	| IOT095 |	3DS little plug-in module
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,496	| IOT095 |	Really really intelligent
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,544	| IOT095 |	Real intelligent so
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:06,848	| IOT095 |	Trent Lott
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,896	| IOT095 |	Eventually if I have
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,688	| IOT095 |	Is more things get connected to
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,200	| IOT095 |	Google home
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,992	| IOT095 |	I could be able to
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:13,504	| IOT095 |	How to control it
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,784	| IOT095 |	The Shield
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,344	| IOT095 |	That is the idea
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,368	| IOT095 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,184	| IOT095 |	Would be no different than having an actual Google home
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,488	| IOT095 |	Hardware device were using your
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:28,864	| IOT095 |	Phone is Google assistant is supported which strain has the pixel and the pixel XL so
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:33,984	| IOT095 |	Yasso
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,544	| IOT095 |	But do the phone version the home version or the
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,824	| IOT095 |	Aloe version
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:42,176	| IOT095 |	Well the phone version is the same as the home version by and large
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:49,600	| IOT095 |	I know there's a there's a couple little things that are different
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,648	| IOT095 |	And then a low as you mentioned
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:56,768	| IOT095 |	Cuz people don't know you can tag Google I can say at Google and any
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,536	| IOT095 |	Chat with you
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,560	| IOT095 |	Your friends on Allo
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:04,448	| IOT095 |	And you get the Google Assistant Smart in the conversation so like Stacy if you and I are chatting
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,264	| IOT095 |	And we happen to be in the same city and say it was get some
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,800	| IOT095 |	Dinner somewhere we can add
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,872	| IOT095 |	At Google not chat say at Google
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:15,712	| IOT095 |	Find me the closest barbecue restaurant that has 4 stars or better
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:20,576	| IOT095 |	And boom it'll just give us both that information that we have maps and reviews and thoughts
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,672	| IOT095 |	Real quick just in case there's a game around
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,440	| IOT095 |	They're just in case
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,768	| IOT095 |	The other reason I got I bought the shield is because
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,560	| IOT095 |	It offers
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:33,120	| IOT095 |	The Nvidia GeForce now
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,936	| IOT095 |	Subscription for $8 a month first month is free
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,240	| IOT095 |	Where they actually run
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:41,824	| IOT095 |	Console games on PCS or servers in the cloud and
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:43,872	| IOT095 |	Stream them to you in real time
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,920	| IOT095 |	No download
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:49,760	| IOT095 |	So I was playing at 1080p 60 frames per second
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:53,600	| IOT095 |	Version of Tomb Raider on the shield from Xbox
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:57,696	| IOT095 |	Indistinguishable between the shield and the Xbox all the difference is
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| IOT095 |	On the shield it's all running in the cloud
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,536	| IOT095 |	It's neat
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,584	| IOT095 |	The thing is you got up
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,632	| IOT095 |	Here the caveat is
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:11,008	| IOT095 |	That if you're going to stream games from GeForce now at 1080p 60 frames a second
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:17,408	| IOT095 |	They look incredible would you also need an incredible connection for that base a 50 megabits per se
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,944	| IOT095 |	Second is what they recommend
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,224	| IOT095 |	And that's like
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,808	| IOT095 |	Even even with my 150 Meg service here
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,880	| IOT095 |	I occasionally see some
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:31,488	| IOT095 |	Some jagjit and stuff like that going on occasionally
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,512	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,816	| IOT095 |	Your mileage may vary
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:39,680	| IOT095 |	Your mileage may vary if it mean if your on something some slow internet don't even think about it
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,728	| IOT095 |	So how much is The Shield
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:45,568	| IOT095 |	The Shield is 199 which is the same as it was
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,848	| IOT095 |	A year or two ago
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:47,872	| IOT095 |	Debuted
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,176	| IOT095 |	The difference is another smart move
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,224	| IOT095 |	There including the remote and there are
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,784	| IOT095 |	Including the game controller both of which have a microphone
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:59,648	| IOT095 |	Before you had to buy at least one if not both of those separately for like
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,440	| IOT095 |	40 bucks a pop
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,720	| IOT095 |	50 bucks a Pop Evil
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,024	| IOT095 |	You're getting that now
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:05,536	| IOT095 |	Included
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,584	| IOT095 |	I'm glad you mentioned this though
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:13,728	| IOT095 |	Remember how I started by saying you have an old Nvidia Shield don't upgrade cuz you don't need it cuz you're going to get all the same software the
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,008	| IOT095 |	Voice remote start
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:19,360	| IOT095 |	Built into the game controllers you may want to get a new
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,384	| IOT095 |	Controller
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,176	| IOT095 |	For your old Shields I'm going to give him mine
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,200	| IOT095 |	Got it
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| IOT095 |	All right
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:26,016	| IOT095 |	Feel like we're out of time
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:31,392	| IOT095 |	So I'm going to do a pretty quick review of stringify to tell you about it
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,952	| IOT095 |	And then we'll spend some more time another show
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,000	| IOT095 |	So stringify
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,768	| IOT095 |	Is
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:43,168	| IOT095 |	Kind of like it's a way for you to connect lots of devices together and create what they call flows which are
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,936	| IOT095 |	Basically recipe
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,448	| IOT095 |	Puppies for
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:45,472	| IOT095 |	Making something
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,288	| IOT095 |	So the reason this is
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:52,384	| IOT095 |	Cool are useful as they finally released an Android version
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,432	| IOT095 |	Now the Android version is still in beta
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:58,016	| IOT095 |	And so it's not as full functioning at the iOS version
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:03,136	| IOT095 |	If you're really into the smart home and you have a bunch of devices it supports a lot of devices like
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,672	| IOT095 |	30 or 40 that I have
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:10,816	| IOT095 |	And then it also supports more than one conditional statement so you know where if this and that you have to do
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,584	| IOT095 |	There's no limit
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,864	| IOT095 |	What you do is you
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:15,424	| IOT095 |	Bring all of the devices in onto what they call it
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:20,032	| IOT095 |	And if you do download this I really recommend you watch the video on
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,312	| IOT095 |	On how to do this because it is
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,848	| IOT095 |	It's not super into
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:25,664	| IOT095 |	So the video on how to make flows is
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:30,272	| IOT095 |	So you pick all of your devices and let's say
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,296	| IOT095 |	I want to do
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,088	| IOT095 |	Think of something to do
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,624	| IOT095 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,672	| IOT095 |	When my Nest cam
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,696	| IOT095 |	She's a person
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,976	| IOT095 |	And I'm not at home
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,024	| IOT095 |	Send me an email
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,048	| IOT095 |	And also turn on the light
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:45,120	| IOT095 |	So that doing that and if this
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:45,888	| IOT095 |	Would take
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:46,400	| IOT095 |	Multiple redis
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,752	| IOT095 |	So here what I would do as I pull in my Nest cam
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:53,056	| IOT095 |	I told him my location
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:56,384	| IOT095 |	Little icons for each device
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,688	| IOT095 |	Accolade my location icon
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,992	| IOT095 |	And I'm going to put those on
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,040	| IOT095 |	The left side everything
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,320	| IOT095 |	Goes from left to right here
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:07,648	| IOT095 |	And then I'm going to also the things I want to have happen
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,696	| IOT095 |	Email icon and then
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:15,328	| IOT095 |	What am I doing I'm going to pull in the light
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:21,728	| IOT095 |	So then basically set a trigger for each of those so location is when I'm away
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,776	| IOT095 |	When I see a person
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,336	| IOT095 |	On the other side
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,128	| IOT095 |	I'm going to set triggers for each of those
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,200	| IOT095 |	And then I basically link them I just remove
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:34,272	| IOT095 |	Click on that icon and then I move it over to each of the
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,320	| IOT095 |	Things that I want to have happen
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:36,832	| IOT095 |	When something happen
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:39,904	| IOT095 |	Decrease bass strings between them in
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,720	| IOT095 |	I created a fairly complex
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,512	| IOT095 |	End
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,048	| IOT095 |	This again
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,888	| IOT095 |	You're going to have to play with this I'm going to do a review eventually they will have
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:50,912	| IOT095 |	Screenshot
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,448	| IOT095 |	Really helpful
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,264	| IOT095 |	This is free
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:58,592	| IOT095 |	They support you know things like the echo the Aesop
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,408	| IOT095 |	Arlo netatmo
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| IOT095 |	Nest
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:05,760	| IOT095 |	Like an amazing array of services I think ecobee
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,808	| IOT095 |	They don't do Sonos
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,576	| IOT095 |	So just
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,856	| IOT095 |	Telling you there
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,392	| IOT095 |	Skybell
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,440	| IOT095 |	Don't know if they do August
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:15,488	| IOT095 |	It's a pretty comprehensive system
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:21,632	| IOT095 |	It's free the way they pay for it is they actually do the same sort of thing for Enterprise customers and
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:24,192	| IOT095 |	Those guys actually
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,008	| IOT095 |	So yeah so instead of the Enterprise have to
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,568	| IOT095 |	Figure out all the apis for all these devices and
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:34,176	| IOT095 |	Sing themselves they actually do this for Enterprise customers they give
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,712	| IOT095 |	Like corporate it Department
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,016	| IOT095 |	These flows and support devices
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,552	| IOT095 |	Antos
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,064	| IOT095 |	Systems
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:44,672	| IOT095 |	So that they don't actually charge they just pull a PS4
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:48,512	| IOT095 |	Like for the Facebook and web-based ones they usually just pulled like the
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,048	| IOT095 |	Publicly available apis
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,328	| IOT095 |	10 + 4
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,352	| IOT095 |	The device
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,120	| IOT095 |	They actually usually
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,144	| IOT095 |	Conversation with
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,192	| IOT095 |	That makes it okay
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:58,752	| IOT095 |	Interesting model business model
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,800	| IOT095 |	It is like
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:05,408	| IOT095 |	I encourage anyone who's got multiple devices who's interested in
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,944	| IOT095 |	More complicated
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,992	| IOT095 |	Smart home programming to check this out
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,808	| IOT095 |	And it still bare bones
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,832	| IOT095 |	On the Android side
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,160	| IOT095 |	IOS is better and they're still features that they need to add
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,208	| IOT095 |	That'll come
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,000	| IOT095 |	Cool
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,280	| IOT095 |	Stringify

EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:11,520	| IOT095 |	We also installed a Dell Edge Gateway so that will be connected to the cold
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,664	| IOT095 |	What we're doing is saying
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,200	| IOT095 |	Temperature
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:22,272	| IOT095 |	Ilocos Arenal alarm condition

EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,584	| IOT095 |	So where can I find
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:39,680	| IOT095 |	You can put on information you need from
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,728	| IOT095 |	Dot-com
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,776	| IOT095 |	Which is our URL
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:50,176	| IOT095 |	We have a lot of interesting iot case studies from there too
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:56,576	| IOT095 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:59,648	| IOT095 |	Things podcast this week in a little bit different for you
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,184	| IOT095 |	I've got three guess
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,768	| IOT095 |	From a visit I took to the National instruments
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:05,280	| IOT095 |	Lab
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:08,096	| IOT095 |	So this is an industrial iot lab
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:15,008	| IOT095 |	Where I learned about a lot of crazy cool things and I talked to Jamie Smith the director
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:15,776	| IOT095 |	Instruments
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:18,592	| IOT095 |	An Alex devron CEO
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,688	| IOT095 |	Alex had the lovely Irish lilt
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,712	| IOT095 |	Voice
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:27,296	| IOT095 |	So I'm Jamie Smith on the director of embedded systems here in Nashua
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:31,136	| IOT095 |	Aaron the Chief Executive Officer of
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,952	| IOT095 |	All right today we're here
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:38,304	| IOT095 |	Launching their industrial internet-of-things lab
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:40,096	| IOT095 |	Which you guys maybe like
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:44,704	| IOT095 |	There's actually so many people playing Industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:47,008	| IOT095 |	Figuring out how to get everything to work together
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:47,776	| IOT095 |	Is
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:50,080	| IOT095 |	So let's kick this off with
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,360	| IOT095 |	Question about Partnerships
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:53,920	| IOT095 |	IC HP
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:57,760	| IOT095 |	So I thought until disco there's a lot of people here
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,808	| IOT095 |	How to companies
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,600	| IOT095 |	Bring you in
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:05,440	| IOT095 |	Are they bringing you in a massive conglomeration
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:06,208	| IOT095 |	Or
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,232	| IOT095 |	Are they bringing you in
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:10,304	| IOT095 |	That's a really good question
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:13,888	| IOT095 |	Because it is a large number of collaborators
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,168	| IOT095 |	These complex systems
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:19,008	| IOT095 |	And the customer engagements happen in a wide range
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:24,384	| IOT095 |	So what natural is expert in measure
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:25,664	| IOT095 |	Technology
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,968	| IOT095 |	Processing right there at the edge
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:30,528	| IOT095 |	Where sensors are coming into the
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,040	| IOT095 |	The industrial
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,320	| IOT095 |	Thanks
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,624	| IOT095 |	And all the collaborators we work with are aware of
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:38,464	| IOT095 |	So when their customers and their engagement
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:42,816	| IOT095 |	Additional sensing capability additional measurements or some form of advance
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:45,888	| IOT095 |	Troll right there at the edge still bring us in
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:47,936	| IOT095 |	Location
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:48,960	| IOT095 |	So where is
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,496	| IOT095 |	Your Edge
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:53,312	| IOT095 |	Because he could be a Gateway or it could be like that
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:35:00,224	| IOT095 |	Really good question as well that will redefine The Edge know if we think about or a traditional definition
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,992	| IOT095 |	And it's where the
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:06,112	| IOT095 |	Enterprise Network begins and is the barrier to the office Network
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:08,160	| IOT095 |	Home network begins or is it
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:10,464	| IOT095 |	Valerie to the internet service provider
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,000	| IOT095 |	That's the typical Edge boundary
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:13,792	| IOT095 |	I just got back from CVS
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:16,096	| IOT095 |	MSc industrial internet
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,144	| IOT095 |	Consumerism
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,448	| IOT095 |	Low margin
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:20,960	| IOT095 |	Blah blah blah
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:23,008	| IOT095 |	Where is the industrial internet
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,312	| IOT095 |	Where is it going
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:28,384	| IOT095 |	So the industrial internet today it's happening
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:34,016	| IOT095 |	Distributed systems in becoming more open
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:36,064	| IOT095 |	More complex
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:38,880	| IOT095 |	And collaboration of or vendors drysol
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,160	| IOT095 |	Inside
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:43,488	| IOT095 |	But the majority of Industries and companies
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,792	| IOT095 |	Have not adopted
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,120	| IOT095 |	So we're just getting started
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,168	| IOT095 |	Scratching the surface
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:55,008	| IOT095 |	But we're seeing a lot of interest
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,520	| IOT095 |	And
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,568	| IOT095 |	Indiana
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,616	| IOT095 |	Technology stocks
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:00,640	| IOT095 |	Becoming validated
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,224	| IOT095 |	Chest pains like we have in the lab
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:10,368	| IOT095 |	And if we can educate more of these and customers about
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:13,184	| IOT095 |	Then they can start doing a pilot
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:13,696	| IOT095 |	Program
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,232	| IOT095 |	And they move on
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,256	| IOT095 |	Broader adoption
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,792	| IOT095 |	Spaghetti.
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,816	| IOT095 |	Insights
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:19,328	| IOT095 |	Required
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,400	| IOT095 |	When you guys actually like to talk about your
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:27,264	| IOT095 |	Because that ties to a couple things he's mentioned already one is it
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,800	| IOT095 |	They didn't have anything
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:31,616	| IOT095 |	And now they have with a 30000 sensors
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,432	| IOT095 |	How did that come about
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:34,944	| IOT095 |	End
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,248	| IOT095 |	Is there a typical
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:40,064	| IOT095 |	I would say there is no typical yet
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:40,576	| IOT095 |	Industrial air
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:44,416	| IOT095 |	Duke Energy is the largest
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,440	| IOT095 |	Power provider
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,976	| IOT095 |	United States and
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,256	| IOT095 |	They
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:50,560	| IOT095 |	Realize that they can improve
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,352	| IOT095 |	Overall up time
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,888	| IOT095 |	All of their facilities they have more
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:55,680	| IOT095 |	They had
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,216	| IOT095 |	Experts in
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:37:00,800	| IOT095 |	Analysis of this vibration database rotini
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,568	| IOT095 |	Equipment
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,872	| IOT095 |	But they spent 80% of their time
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,896	| IOT095 |	Data collection
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,712	| IOT095 |	20% of their time analyzing
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,480	| IOT095 |	The database
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:10,016	| IOT095 |	They want to flip that
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:12,576	| IOT095 |	So they put an effort out to
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,880	| IOT095 |	Measurement taking
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:20,000	| IOT095 |	It's been 80%
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:20,768	| IOT095 |	Their data
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:22,304	| IOT095 |	Ensuring uptime
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,840	| IOT095 |	LS timing chain
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,400	| IOT095 |	How is the data collected
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:30,496	| IOT095 |	So the data was collected originally by walking around
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,032	| IOT095 |	Portable measurement equipment
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:38,176	| IOT095 |	Add capturing information that they needed to be transferred into a spreadsheet or another application
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,968	| IOT095 |	Now these systems
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:42,016	| IOT095 |	Online always acquiring
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,552	| IOT095 |	Connecting to the network
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,832	| IOT095 |	Defeat
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:46,112	| IOT095 |	Air plant Astoria
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,928	| IOT095 |	So there
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,208	| IOT095 |	Look at that data
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:59,424	| IOT095 |	Crafts to build on that to you know when we look at some of this aging infrastructure that's probably not on
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,216	| IOT095 |	The world
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:04,800	| IOT095 |	Part of the data collection process use that many of these large power plants
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,568	| IOT095 |	Is the human
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,664	| IOT095 |	And it can literally get a simple or a sophisticated
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:11,968	| IOT095 |	I'm going to touch
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,016	| IOT095 |	Machine to feel the vibration
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,832	| IOT095 |	And I'm going to listen to it
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,624	| IOT095 |	As a data collection and
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:26,560	| IOT095 |	Any customers in the similar situations are experts at doing this also
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,352	| IOT095 |	Tend to be getting a little older
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,376	| IOT095 |	And headed towards retirement
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,448	| IOT095 |	And they're worried about the ability to be able to replicate.
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,240	| IOT095 |	So as we
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:37,056	| IOT095 |	Deliver technologies that make it practical to
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,336	| IOT095 |	To be able to collect that data
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,384	| IOT095 |	In a synchronized fashion
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,920	| IOT095 |	Securely ideally
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:43,456	| IOT095 |	Future over wireless network
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:46,016	| IOT095 |	And then we developed story
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:49,088	| IOT095 |	Ability from a prognostic view
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:52,672	| IOT095 |	To record the symptoms of an impending
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,208	| IOT095 |	Future failure downtime
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:58,048	| IOT095 |	And that learning can be learned once and applied many times
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,608	| IOT095 |	In an automated fashion to dramatically
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:02,144	| IOT095 |	Iraq time zone
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:06,240	| IOT095 |	Answer the customer that also dramatically improve their use of energy
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,288	| IOT095 |	Which is an interest
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,384	| IOT095 |	All of these partners
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:14,944	| IOT095 |	How do you guys
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,736	| IOT095 |	Wright contract
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:18,784	| IOT095 |	Sell the product in a way

EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,744	| IOT095 |	It just feels very.
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:31,584	| IOT095 |	We as a company Nestle
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:32,864	| IOT095 |	I've always
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:34,144	| IOT095 |	Operated as part of an ecosystem
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:37,216	| IOT095 |	Where are the ultimate end solution
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| IOT095 |	Involved
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,544	| IOT095 |	Strom multiple suppliers
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,824	| IOT095 |	To be delivered
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,128	| IOT095 |	Tool supplier in the system supplier to scientist
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:48,224	| IOT095 |	So this has been our standard business model in r
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:52,576	| IOT095 |	Testing measurement market and we've applied this to as we've expanded our capability outings
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:56,416	| IOT095 |	That's a first of the business model is really clear
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,464	| IOT095 |	Hermosa apartments that we're engaging with
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:02,304	| IOT095 |	It's relatively well understood their portion in value chain
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:04,608	| IOT095 |	And ultimately the customer will decide
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:08,192	| IOT095 |	Some situations like Duke Energy the customer will choose
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:11,264	| IOT095 |	To purchase components from different
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:12,544	| IOT095 |	Kalamazoo Valley training
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,872	| IOT095 |	And that's a valuable use case
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:18,944	| IOT095 |	In other cases the customer want to
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:21,248	| IOT095 |	Just have one in Topeka
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:23,296	| IOT095 |	To deliver that complete value chain
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:27,392	| IOT095 |	And in that situation in a We have dealt with that is a business for many years and have a
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:30,208	| IOT095 |	I really clear way to to Castro Valley
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,768	| IOT095 |	City of tips for companies who are kind of it
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,328	| IOT095 |	There's a coming out this for maybe the first time
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:39,680	| IOT095 |	Well it certainly understanding your value and the solution is the single most
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:46,592	| IOT095 |	Understanding have differentiated your value is not have differentiated you'd like it to be or you might want it to be but a different you
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,128	| IOT095 |	It actually is
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:51,200	| IOT095 |	Can you get that from the customer to get that work
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:53,504	| IOT095 |	I think you get that from the customer absolutely
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:55,552	| IOT095 |	You know some cases it can get clouded
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:59,392	| IOT095 |	We have a great benefit because we also have a direct field Salesforce
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,952	| IOT095 |	So we have direct access to the customer
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:06,048	| IOT095 |	We sell to over 35000 different companies
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:07,584	| IOT095 |	Around the world every year
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:10,912	| IOT095 |	And we have deep relationships that the engineer to end
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,424	| IOT095 |	Engineer
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:14,240	| IOT095 |	And so our value
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:17,312	| IOT095 |	Is generally relatively well understood already
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:20,128	| IOT095 |	Two core constituencies within that customer
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,944	| IOT095 |	And that helps provide the frame of reference
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:23,968	| IOT095 |	House divided
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,504	| IOT095 |	A benchmark for us
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,528	| IOT095 |	To be able to
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,552	| IOT095 |	Engage with
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:30,624	| IOT095 |	A complete system level provider so my advice and Ensure
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:34,720	| IOT095 |	Would be understand your value understand how differentiated it is
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:35,232	| IOT095 |	Truly
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,304	| IOT095 |	And I would try to establish a price position
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,096	| IOT095 |	Independent
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,936	| IOT095 |	Selling direct to individual customers
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:46,240	| IOT095 |	To be able to validate my first two assumption
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:49,824	| IOT095 |	And be able to prove both to the End customer and my
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,592	| IOT095 |	Immigration partners
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:52,640	| IOT095 |	The value that I bring
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:53,151	| IOT095 |	Tomorrow
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:56,223	| IOT095 |	I would think also your relationship with engineers
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:57,247	| IOT095 |	Is important
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:41:59,551	| IOT095 |	As we seen in clouds
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:01,087	| IOT095 |	Developers are awesome
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,415	| IOT095 |	End
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:05,951	| IOT095 |	There's a lot more respect now for
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:10,559	| IOT095 |	On the industrial side is that same sort of
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:15,423	| IOT095 |	It may not be Grassroots but it might be respect for the technical
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:17,215	| IOT095 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:19,263	| IOT095 |	Ways we look at I-10.
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,031	| IOT095 |	Converging
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:22,079	| IOT095 |	The people will understand the problems and needs
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,615	| IOT095 |	Address of those on the fact
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,151	| IOT095 |	Where are the plants
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,967	| IOT095 |	In the field with the customer
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:33,087	| IOT095 |	So they understand
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:34,367	| IOT095 |	Needs what
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:35,135	| IOT095 |	Chang
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:37,951	| IOT095 |	But they may not have the insights in Denver
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,975	| IOT095 |	Information technology
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:42,815	| IOT095 |	Analytics Cloud technical respect
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:43,583	| IOT095 |	Pyside
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:44,863	| IOT095 |	Novation
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,143	| IOT095 |	Bad it's becoming
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,935	| IOT095 |	Clear that these groups
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,471	| IOT095 |	Together
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:52,287	| IOT095 |	And I would say that's the biggest shift I've seen
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,847	| IOT095 |	Look at the first part of my career
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:55,871	| IOT095 |	National instruments
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,663	| IOT095 |	There was
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:59,455	| IOT095 |	A desire for
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:01,759	| IOT095 |	Companies to provide freestyle over
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,831	| IOT095 |	Close systems to own the entire solution
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:06,623	| IOT095 |	And in some cases even hold a customer
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,695	| IOT095 |	Today those
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:13,279	| IOT095 |	Barriers are being broken down and companies are supplying to
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,047	| IOT095 |	Customers
EDL	00:43:14,047	00:43:16,863	| IOT095 |	Have a willingness in a desire to collaborate
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,399	| IOT095 |	And the customers are demanding
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:25,055	| IOT095 |	And so as companies are evaluating what move to make for the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,847	| IOT095 |	End customers
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:28,639	| IOT095 |	The one piece of advice I would give to down
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:29,919	| IOT095 |	Is 2 don't wait
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:34,527	| IOT095 |	Put down your biggest challenge your biggest headache your biggest
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,807	| IOT095 |	Opportunities for improvement
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:39,135	| IOT095 |	Start working to see how you can address that issue
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:42,719	| IOT095 |	That starting point can blossom real impact
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:45,535	| IOT095 |	And then to the next project
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:48,863	| IOT095 |	Izzy's Transformations are not going to be
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:50,655	| IOT095 |	Enterprise why all of
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,959	| IOT095 |	And some people have that view and
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:59,103	| IOT095 |	You guys are the people who are going to make a difference
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:00,383	| IOT095 |	And you should totally be
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:01,663	| IOT095 |	So sad
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:06,015	| IOT095 |	And now go to Jim heppelmann the CEO of
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,039	| IOT095 |	GTC
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:11,647	| IOT095 |	We talked about how PTC is acquired several companies such as
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,159	| IOT095 |	Xidan
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:15,487	| IOT095 |	Vuforia from Qualcomm
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:17,023	| IOT095 |	And kept where
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:18,047	| IOT095 |	Alta build
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:21,887	| IOT095 |	A platform for the internet of things called thingworx
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,655	| IOT095 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:23,679	| IOT095 |	And it also
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,703	| IOT095 |	Acquired thingworx
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,519	| IOT095 |	So I checked in with Jim to find out
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:28,799	| IOT095 |	How a year later
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,847	| IOT095 |	Those Acquisitions were performed
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,407	| IOT095 |	Division is alive and well
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:35,199	| IOT095 |	Business is doing exceptionally well
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,855	| IOT095 |	Machine learning and Predictive Analytics
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:46,719	| IOT095 |	Find out what we need to know and then to be able to turn around using augmented reality
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:49,279	| IOT095 |	And kind of decorate your view of that will physical world
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:51,327	| IOT095 |	Important digital information
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:52,863	| IOT095 |	AR is less
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:45:03,359	| IOT095 |	Service technician
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:06,175	| IOT095 |	I think we're where the early days of AR
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,455	| IOT095 |	Screwing
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:11,807	| IOT095 |	Do this a scam
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:14,623	| IOT095 |	The big thing now is the digital eyewear
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:17,183	| IOT095 |	As the July where becomes better
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:19,231	| IOT095 |	And a little more ubiquitous
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:24,095	| IOT095 |	That will unleash a wave they are
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,119	| IOT095 |	And we need to explain it
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:28,191	| IOT095 |	And there's no better way than to make it visual
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:31,263	| IOT095 |	Linda put it in context of the physical world
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:35,103	| IOT095 |	So I think we're we're at the edge of the big toe
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:40,223	| IOT095 |	There is substantial breakthroughs happening with digital eyewear I mean the Microsoft hololens
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:42,271	| IOT095 |	Unbelievable
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:46,111	| IOT095 |	Snapchat spectacles
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:50,719	| IOT095 |	What we need is this going to be something like this smartphone which
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| IOT095 |	Super spring in
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,815	| IOT095 |	Technology
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,863	| IOT095 |	Industrial-grade
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:03,263	| IOT095 |	She just heading to consumer-grade pretty quickly I think Microsoft is targeting
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,687	| IOT095 |	What's happening right now as consumers are using
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:12,223	| IOT095 |	Phones and tablets
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,015	| IOT095 |	As a proxy
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:14,783	| IOT095 |	4 spyglass
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:18,879	| IOT095 |	Do you actually get the same experience the downfall is it ties up your hands
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:21,183	| IOT095 |	Social service technician
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:24,255	| IOT095 |	Can I use a tablet or a phone to see what they need to see
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,191	| IOT095 |	They were just work
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:33,471	| IOT095 |	Fluidly
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:35,007	| IOT095 |	Without interruption because their hands
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:38,079	| IOT095 |	So in a sense I'm going to go crazy
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:40,127	| IOT095 |	Voice for the iot
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,967	| IOT095 |	Is Kai.
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:48,575	| IOT095 |	Telling you information for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:50,367	| IOT095 |	You're saying vision
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:53,183	| IOT095 |	Computer generated AR is going to
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:00,863	| IOT095 |	I like it
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:04,447	| IOT095 |	That brings up another point which is if the pictures on in contacts
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:07,007	| IOT095 |	Can you have to do a mental mapping
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:13,407	| IOT095 |	Is what happens to you in the car all the time when your navigation system in your dashboard says turn left on this street
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:14,175	| IOT095 |	Play was it
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:18,271	| IOT095 |	You look down to the windshield
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:21,087	| IOT095 |	And it's a
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,623	| IOT095 |	Process requires a fair amount of
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:25,183	| IOT095 |	And then if I could
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:30,559	| IOT095 |	You know hemispherical view of the world where I can look up down left right
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:34,399	| IOT095 |	So basically I'm saying is if we can figure out with smart glasses
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:36,191	| IOT095 |	How to decorate the world
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,727	| IOT095 |	Your aunt's room you're in
EDL	00:47:37,727	00:47:39,519	| IOT095 |	What information do you need to know about the
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:44,639	| IOT095 |	Your ability to ingest that information
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:45,407	| IOT095 |	Literally
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:48,991	| IOT095 |	It would be to read it off
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:50,271	| IOT095 |	Screen of your phone
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:54,111	| IOT095 |	It's a big idea of iot
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:56,671	| IOT095 |	Chris so much data so much knowledge
EDL	00:47:56,671	00:47:58,463	| IOT095 |	Physical world that you can't see
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:02,559	| IOT095 |	You look at it in the computer and then mentally map it
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:05,119	| IOT095 |	We just want to decorate what you see
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:05,887	| IOT095 |	What you need to know
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:08,959	| IOT095 |	So that feels like we need some sort of standard
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:13,311	| IOT095 |	14 Mattapan
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:24,575	| IOT095 |	I'm not a hundred percent sure if it needs to be a standard but I think we definitely need techniques
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:26,879	| IOT095 |	What did you think about
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:30,463	| IOT095 |	User interface development on computers
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:36,095	| IOT095 |	Microsoft has a set of techniques apple has a slightly different set of techniques and other vendor might be slightly different
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:41,215	| IOT095 |	There are good practices for developing grassley's Renovators in bed rack
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:44,543	| IOT095 |	If we move down with the AR prices
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,847	| IOT095 |	It's just the wild west end
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:47,871	| IOT095 |	Definitely
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:51,199	| IOT095 |	State-of-the-art
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:52,991	| IOT095 |	This well
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:55,551	| IOT095 |	And hopefully using familiar paradigms
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:58,111	| IOT095 |	From one device to another
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:48:59,135	| IOT095 |	Like I can move from us
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:02,975	| IOT095 |	You don't Android phone to an Apple phone and they're not really that different
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:06,303	| IOT095 |	I can figure it out
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:06,815	| IOT095 |	Pretty quickly
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:12,703	| IOT095 |	Problems
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:16,543	| IOT095 |	Is the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:19,615	| IOT095 |	I like
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:28,319	| IOT095 |	I can only imagine that if I switch from
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:30,367	| IOT095 |	Is it is not as big a deal in industrial
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:40,351	| IOT095 |	I think the whole idea they are is to make information Visual and a coil
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:41,375	| IOT095 |	What to put in contacts
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:44,447	| IOT095 |	So that you can actually process it without thinking
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:50,335	| IOT095 |	Driving your car you pull up to a stop light
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:52,895	| IOT095 |	Stop look and say oh
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,431	| IOT095 |	That looks like a stoplight
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:55,711	| IOT095 |	Shred
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:57,247	| IOT095 |	Red means stop
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:50:00,319	| IOT095 |	Okay there for me to stop you just do it what are some
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:01,343	| IOT095 |	Mercy
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:06,975	| IOT095 |	Directions
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:10,047	| IOT095 |	I didn't receive last thing first of all it's a powerful idea
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:14,143	| IOT095 |	Many many demonstrations approve that
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:16,447	| IOT095 |	People are far more productive
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:17,983	| IOT095 |	And make mistakes
EDL	00:50:17,983	00:50:19,263	| IOT095 |	So I think there are
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:20,799	| IOT095 |	Mini case studies now
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:23,359	| IOT095 |	From PC and from various others the show
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:24,127	| IOT095 |	Norma
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:26,687	| IOT095 |	Reason I don't see they are Belong Together.
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:28,991	| IOT095 |	Because they are Death Race
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:30,015	| IOT095 |	Physical world
EDL	00:50:30,015	00:50:31,039	| IOT095 |	Decorated with what
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:34,623	| IOT095 |	We need information from the physical world
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:39,487	| IOT095 |	An understanding
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:41,791	| IOT095 |	What is the
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:42,559	| IOT095 |	Addition
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:44,863	| IOT095 |	What is the status what is the action you should take
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:47,423	| IOT095 |	How do I convey that status in
EDL	00:50:47,423	00:50:51,263	| IOT095 |	Addition to you and then how do I convey to you
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:53,311	| IOT095 |	Right because right now
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:56,639	| IOT095 |	Information
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:59,455	| IOT095 |	I can tell you how many steps I've taken I can tell you
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:02,783	| IOT095 |	The temperature
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:06,367	| IOT095 |	That does me no good without being a
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:07,391	| IOT095 |	I'll take any sort of
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:08,927	| IOT095 |	So
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:11,231	| IOT095 |	If you think back to driving a car
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:13,023	| IOT095 |	You have a navigation system
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:14,559	| IOT095 |	Can you have the music
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:20,191	| IOT095 |	And if I could cherry-pick the information for the navigation screen and give you a heads up display
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:20,959	| IOT095 |	On the windscreen
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:22,751	| IOT095 |	Not to say
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:25,055	| IOT095 |	There are three roads coming up and you should take the
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:25,823	| IOT095 |	The second one
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:29,151	| IOT095 |	What to actually say see this road right here
EDL	00:51:32,223	00:51:33,503	| IOT095 |	Of course if you think now
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:35,039	| IOT095 |	Fighter pilots have had
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:36,319	| IOT095 |	Heads up displays for a long time
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:42,975	| IOT095 |	So if we could
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:44,767	| IOT095 |	Ocean of the
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:45,791	| IOT095 |	Heads up display
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:47,583	| IOT095 |	Put it on everything
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:49,119	| IOT095 |	People
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:50,655	| IOT095 |	Furniture
EDL	00:51:50,655	00:51:52,191	| IOT095 |	Industrial objects Farm
EDL	00:51:52,703	00:51:58,591	| IOT095 |	Give you a heads-up display on everything simply by putting on her glasses and everything you interact with
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:02,431	| IOT095 |	Has a heads-up display optimized for interacting with that thing
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:04,223	| IOT095 |	I think it's a big part 1
EDL	00:52:04,735	00:52:06,527	| IOT095 |	Savannah would be like this is a person
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:11,647	| IOT095 |	Business
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:15,487	| IOT095 |	Oh we don't have enough standards we don't have it
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:16,255	| IOT095 |	Anythink
EDL	00:52:17,535	00:52:23,167	| IOT095 |	Okay if I engage you in a social context
EDL	00:52:24,191	00:52:28,287	| IOT095 |	If I'm your doctor I want to have a completely different perspective of Stacy
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:30,079	| IOT095 |	Even though I might
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:34,175	| IOT095 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:35,455	| IOT095 |	Security because
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:36,991	| IOT095 |	What we're talking about here
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:38,783	| IOT095 |	The number one reason
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:40,319	| IOT095 |	Companies say that they're not
EDL	00:52:46,975	00:52:47,743	| IOT095 |	What should baby
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:56,447	| IOT095 |	I think this notion of iot being a new set of security problem is wrong
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:52:59,263	| IOT095 |	It's the same security problems we have
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:02,079	| IOT095 |	It's just more things are computers
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:07,199	| IOT095 |	Right now and we're extending them to things that you didn't think of it
EDL	00:53:09,503	00:53:11,039	| IOT095 |	More and more
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:12,831	| IOT095 |	These things in our computers week
EDL	00:53:23,327	00:53:25,119	| IOT095 |	Play did you think of a power plant you know
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:27,423	| IOT095 |	Computer control
EDL	00:53:27,935	00:53:29,471	| IOT095 |	I think the security
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:35,103	| IOT095 |	There's no CIO that can save my data center is safer than it was 10 years ago
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:37,663	| IOT095 |	They just can't really say that
EDL	00:53:37,663	00:53:44,063	| IOT095 |	They might have invested a tremendous amount in technology and techniques and practices.
EDL	00:53:44,063	00:53:44,831	| IOT095 |	More secure
EDL	00:53:44,831	00:53:46,879	| IOT095 |	We just in an open-ended battle
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:48,415	| IOT095 |	What is going to be the big things
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:48,927	| IOT095 |	This year in a day
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:51,487	| IOT095 |	But I'm saying in our business is back
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:56,095	| IOT095 |	Has always been automated dirt or have been
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:58,655	| IOT095 |	What's happening now if people are saying
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:54:00,703	| IOT095 |	So much more
EDL	00:54:01,471	00:54:03,007	| IOT095 |	And get it so much more data
EDL	00:54:03,519	00:54:05,311	| IOT095 |	That would be useful in automation
EDL	00:54:05,311	00:54:06,335	| IOT095 |	And I could
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:11,711	| IOT095 |	Around what is this
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:12,223	| IOT095 |	Telling me
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:17,343	| IOT095 |	But I think I think what's happening is people are
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:22,207	| IOT095 |	Our business is going very well
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:27,071	| IOT095 |	And you ask what's driving most of that growth
EDL	00:54:28,095	00:54:29,375	| IOT095 |	Laser Pilots
EDL	00:54:29,375	00:54:34,495	| IOT095 |	Because people are just getting started a lot of the pilots are graduating
EDL	00:54:35,007	00:54:35,775	| IOT095 |	Into
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:40,127	| IOT095 |	Modified business you know real orders from real customers right now
EDL	00:54:40,127	00:54:43,967	| IOT095 |	I think I said that our last earnings call that last year half of our Revenue
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:50,111	| IOT095 |	Customers who were coming back for more
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:55:00,095	| IOT095 |	That's it for this week's show but please remember to join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:55:00,095	00:55:06,495	| IOT095 |	And thank you for listening also if you do what more information don't forget to go to Stacey on iot
