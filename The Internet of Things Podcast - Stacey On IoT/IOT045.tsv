EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:12,288	| IOT045 |	Welcome to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:13,056	| IOT045 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:25,856	| IOT045 |	Hi it's great to be here I have been such a fan in following
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:27,648	| IOT045 |	Your podcasting
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:31,232	| IOT045 |	Been on it before so it's great to be costing
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:36,608	| IOT045 |	And for those of you guys who are deeply concerned about Kevin tofel he will be back next week
EDL	00:00:36,608	00:00:37,120	| IOT045 |	This week
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:38,400	| IOT045 |	Man
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:39,168	| IOT045 |	We have hit
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:41,728	| IOT045 |	Because
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:43,264	| IOT045 |	Today
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:47,104	| IOT045 |	How to say Google but it's been so long since I've been spending Google
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:51,712	| IOT045 |	Andy Rubin who used to be and was the co-founder of
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:52,480	| IOT045 |	Danger
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:54,016	| IOT045 |	Which was bought by Google in
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:58,624	| IOT045 |	Turned into the Android platform has come out talkin about playground his
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:00:59,648	| IOT045 |	Hardware incubator
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:01,440	| IOT045 |	It sounds really exciting
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:04,000	| IOT045 |	Oh my gosh does it sound exciting
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:05,024	| IOT045 |	I can't even
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,072	| IOT045 |	Stop thinking about what the
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:07,840	| IOT045 |	Potential is
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,632	| IOT045 |	So I have to tell you guys first
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,424	| IOT045 |	Carla is a product designer who
EDL	00:01:11,424	00:01:12,192	| IOT045 |	Specialty is
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:13,216	| IOT045 |	Smartlogix
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:15,520	| IOT045 |	Actually pretty smart
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,056	| IOT045 |	Custom Sounds
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:20,896	| IOT045 |	So playground is basically Ruben is going to design
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:23,968	| IOT045 |	Books that are going to feed into neural network
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:27,552	| IOT045 |	So basically they're robots basically
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:29,088	| IOT045 |	I'm part of the board
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,368	| IOT045 |	I was calling at the Borg
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,904	| IOT045 |	I shouldn't
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:34,720	| IOT045 |	He's designing products that are hopefully a little bit more future Pro
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,512	| IOT045 |	It's kind of his idea
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:40,096	| IOT045 |	A hundred percent sure what exactly
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:40,864	| IOT045 |	Designing
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:46,496	| IOT045 |	One of the first things that they talked about in this article and we're sourcing this from a wired article that is really dumb.
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,032	| IOT045 |	Is a dash cam
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,056	| IOT045 |	Smart dash cam
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:52,896	| IOT045 |	So let's say you had a video camera in you
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:57,760	| IOT045 |	Your car for example and it will know the car's location
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:59,040	| IOT045 |	Automatically
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:01:59,808	| IOT045 |	Attract it
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,320	| IOT045 |	Footage
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,368	| IOT045 |	It will
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,160	| IOT045 |	Be able to know what's happening
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| IOT045 |	Driver as well as
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,952	| IOT045 |	What's happening
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:10,304	| IOT045 |	Around the world and if you then crowdsource all of that you can be
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,072	| IOT045 |	Recording
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,120	| IOT045 |	Everything that is happening
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:16,192	| IOT045 |	In an entire area and that will be
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,728	| IOT045 |	He also moving so
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,800	| IOT045 |	What's exciting about that is that that's any
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,848	| IOT045 |	Ugly Wicked thing to half
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,360	| IOT045 |	Build
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,152	| IOT045 |	In today's world
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,944	| IOT045 |	And what Andy is
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,528	| IOT045 |	Proposing with playground is to have one place
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,576	| IOT045 |	Where I somebody
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| IOT045 |	Wanted to develop
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,648	| IOT045 |	Like the dashcam
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,672	| IOT045 |	Could have
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,440	| IOT045 |	All those
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:37,952	| IOT045 |	Parts
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,256	| IOT045 |	Together so you know you need
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,024	| IOT045 |	GPS
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,560	| IOT045 |	Camera
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,328	| IOT045 |	And you need
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,864	| IOT045 |	Incredibly smart artificial
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,144	| IOT045 |	Intelligence to be able
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,424	| IOT045 |	How to recognize faces right
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,496	| IOT045 |	Recognize objects interface that with
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,800	| IOT045 |	Maps data for example
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:56,128	| IOT045 |	And then you also have all of that
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,152	| IOT045 |	Stuff communicate
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,456	| IOT045 |	Continuously
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:03,296	| IOT045 |	So we're talking about systems were talking about Hardware
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| IOT045 |	We're talking about
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| IOT045 |	A lot of processing
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:09,184	| IOT045 |	And he's proposing that wood playground somebody who want
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| IOT045 |	What about
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,744	| IOT045 |	Something like that could
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,024	| IOT045 |	Do it Under One Roof
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:19,680	| IOT045 |	Which is pretty cool cuz the only other place that I can think of there's like maybe four or five places where you could do that today in there
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,216	| IOT045 |	Google Microsoft
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,008	| IOT045 |	Amazon's 819
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,312	| IOT045 |	81926 labs
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,616	| IOT045 |	126
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,664	| IOT045 |	Amazon
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| IOT045 |	Amazon's lab effort
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,016	| IOT045 |	Maybe I am Samsung
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:40,416	| IOT045 |	Yeah so you really can't do that unless you're a big company and when I talked to startups that are trying to do crazy cool
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:43,488	| IOT045 |	Things
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:47,840	| IOT045 |	This wicked cool voice interface cloud
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:52,192	| IOT045 |	Facial recognition products
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,216	| IOT045 |	Awesome
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,544	| IOT045 |	And then you know that later I get it and I'm like
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| IOT045 |	Wow this is
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,080	| IOT045 |	It's not great
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,944	| IOT045 |	Six months after that Amazon sends you something like the echo in your life
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:05,504	| IOT045 |	This is what they
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| IOT045 |	And you're like sorry
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,088	| IOT045 |	Public playground this could all like
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,648	| IOT045 |	Maybe happen which is kind of cool
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,440	| IOT045 |	But it's probably likely
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,256	| IOT045 |	I don't know what do you think these guys might build this stuff and then
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,303	| IOT045 |	What are the big companies just coming in
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,399	| IOT045 |	Wow
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,935	| IOT045 |	Buy the thing to pay bill
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| IOT045 |	I think that
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,751	| IOT045 |	The playground part of it is
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| IOT045 |	Most exciting life
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,943	| IOT045 |	Like you said just the fact that they will all be facilitated Under One Roof cuz one of the biggest issues that we have
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,479	| IOT045 |	With everyone developing products
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,015	| IOT045 |	In the
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,063	| IOT045 |	We know we might call The Internet of Things
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,367	| IOT045 |	Robotics whatever you want to call it is that they don't
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,647	| IOT045 |	Play nicely with one
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,951	| IOT045 |	Another right they're all using different protocols and
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,791	| IOT045 |	They don't connect with user experience
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| IOT045 |	Which is what I really care about
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| IOT045 |	Is terrible
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| IOT045 |	So you know the idea of uniting forces
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,263	| IOT045 |	Has so much potential I think
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,823	| IOT045 |	For good hopefully they're not
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| IOT045 |	Things that are being
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,151	| IOT045 |	Bought by big companies but
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,711	| IOT045 |	You know I have I'm I'm such a Utopia
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,991	| IOT045 |	So I always have a fan
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,503	| IOT045 |	ICF
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,783	| IOT045 |	The next
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,343	| IOT045 |	Mom and Pop Shop being a
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,135	| IOT045 |	IRobot developer
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:21,535	| IOT045 |	Robot developers that are designing using protocols that will work together and maybe
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,559	| IOT045 |	Oliver
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,863	| IOT045 |	It's like the Android Robot developer
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| IOT045 |	Kind of concept
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,679	| IOT045 |	Yes okay
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,471	| IOT045 |	And I'm thinking of like the little like
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,263	| IOT045 |	Similar but different
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:36,127	| IOT045 |	Is that same that different what is the Android advertising slogan are you familiar with it
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,687	| IOT045 |	You don't have to do with it
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:42,271	| IOT045 |	You know what it's because I've been to the movies and I played it before all the movies I've been to lately
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,855	| IOT045 |	Surprisingly
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:50,207	| IOT045 |	I surprisingly don't have a lot of commercials in my life these days
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| IOT045 |	Cord-cutting
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,839	| IOT045 |	Okay so
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,911	| IOT045 |	As a practice
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT045 |	Kid stuff
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:04,287	| IOT045 |	Would you a Medusa sound like an idyllic kind of place to develop stuff for
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,311	| IOT045 |	Disesteem
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,103	| IOT045 |	What else would you like to see here
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,383	| IOT045 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,175	| IOT045 |	An extremely idyllic
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:15,295	| IOT045 |	Place to build stuff you know I think that there are so many ideas and like the story that you talked about
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:19,647	| IOT045 |	When you meet people who have a new product they're developing and then a year later
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:22,207	| IOT045 |	They run into so many roadblocks and I think
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,511	| IOT045 |	Those roadblocks can be solved by
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,863	| IOT045 |	In touch with the right people and being able to collaborate
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:32,703	| IOT045 |	Owen and recognizing where your knowledge ends
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,727	| IOT045 |	Someone else's knowledge
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:34,751	| IOT045 |	Begins
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,543	| IOT045 |	So I think that
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,823	| IOT045 |	What he's building
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:41,663	| IOT045 |	Is a way to take away so many of those roadblocks and
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,199	| IOT045 |	Really speed up
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,759	| IOT045 |	The process of having
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:48,063	| IOT045 |	Robots in our everyday lives right
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,599	| IOT045 |	Alright so
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,135	| IOT045 |	Should I fear the robots
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT045 |	In our everyday life
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,999	| IOT045 |	I'm not a fear the robot person I'ma love the robot
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| IOT045 |	All the robots that I've
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,631	| IOT045 |	Panino's very friendly and helpful
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,423	| IOT045 |	I've learned to do tasks
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,959	| IOT045 |	Clean up
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,727	| IOT045 |	Very polite
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,567	| IOT045 |	So I I don't I don't do that well I got it I'll do I have
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,103	| IOT045 |	How to say and everleigh I do a lot of
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,871	| IOT045 |	Talks
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:18,271	| IOT045 |	On robotics in our everyday lies and I inevitably get one question and every talk about you know the robots joining forces
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:18,783	| IOT045 |	Taking over
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,831	| IOT045 |	And what I think about that
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,599	| IOT045 |	I don't see that
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,927	| IOT045 |	So I'm less worried about the robots taking over
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,023	| IOT045 |	Some sort of malicious
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:31,327	| IOT045 |	I got a lot of Slack
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,863	| IOT045 |	The Nest is a robot
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,983	| IOT045 |	All these other Robots coming in and
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,007	| IOT045 |	Orchestrating my home
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:44,895	| IOT045 |	And I kind of help people I kind of shrug and I'm like yeah if the nest is a robot this is a robot
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,431	| IOT045 |	Tumi
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,711	| IOT045 |	Xiaomi smart home
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:54,623	| IOT045 |	If I'm going to bring a robot in and they're they're showing all these lovely little robots drive around with like a video camera that has facial recognition
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:55,903	| IOT045 |	Can do things
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:03,071	| IOT045 |	If it doesn't have arms so it can fold laundry or empty the dishwasher do something that like a little bit more functional if it's
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,351	| IOT045 |	Just like turning on lights in
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:13,055	| IOT045 |	I don't need an extra something running around my house tripping over things in life
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,127	| IOT045 |	Videos of walk the dog at the
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,919	| IOT045 |	Okay but other than that
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,199	| IOT045 |	What is your stance on Lake
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:24,831	| IOT045 |	Robots in the home that feel to me like a little superficial and I'm thinking about like Jibo or
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,671	| IOT045 |	I feel like they're on Kickstarter all the time I'm just blinking on some of the names
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,207	| IOT045 |	I know you see me
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,743	| IOT045 |	Sure yeah bro
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,791	| IOT045 |	I actually worked on
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,607	| IOT045 |	Very very early stages of Jibo consult
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,167	| IOT045 |	Dr. Cynthia breazeal
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,727	| IOT045 |	Up at MIT and
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,007	| IOT045 |	I am all about it
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,031	| IOT045 |	I actually
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,335	| IOT045 |	But I do think that we have to be
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| IOT045 |	Careful
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| IOT045 |	Because if
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,687	| IOT045 |	You have too many at your jeep has a character
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,991	| IOT045 |	Geebo is
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,783	| IOT045 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,855	| IOT045 |	Coming off of your shelf and expressing it
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,623	| IOT045 |	Itself physically
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,903	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,439	| IOT045 |	Yeah I think that
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,719	| IOT045 |	There's a lot of value in that
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,255	| IOT045 |	I think that
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| IOT045 |	You know there is
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,583	| IOT045 |	Value in getting rid of Art
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:11,679	| IOT045 |	Keyboards and mice that are going to be this vestige
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:12,959	| IOT045 |	Of the past
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,495	| IOT045 |	At some point
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,519	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,799	| IOT045 |	You know that
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,079	| IOT045 |	Jibo does by adding
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,895	| IOT045 |	Physically animated expression
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,175	| IOT045 |	Is is one more
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| IOT045 |	Step into
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,247	| IOT045 |	Helping us
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,783	| IOT045 |	Be able to just be
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:30,623	| IOT045 |	Humans and not have to learn machine language not have to learn which button sequel
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| IOT045 |	What is the price right
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,695	| IOT045 |	So I think it's very exciting but
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,743	| IOT045 |	Do you think that
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,791	| IOT045 |	Gebos
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:40,863	| IOT045 |	A really good example of an everything machine
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,143	| IOT045 |	That
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,447	| IOT045 |	It's going to help you
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:50,847	| IOT045 |	Do recipes in the kitchen and you know read stories and you know that's that's one thing that's very
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,615	| IOT045 |	Ambitious
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:55,967	| IOT045 |	That will will Grier and I have to see it's very very hard to do it everyday everything
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,759	| IOT045 |	Apple has
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,551	| IOT045 |	Master D everything machine
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,087	| IOT045 |	As has
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| IOT045 |	Android
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,671	| IOT045 |	But many many many other companies
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,695	| IOT045 |	Have Nots
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,743	| IOT045 |	But I think
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| IOT045 |	That
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,791	| IOT045 |	We have to be
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:12,095	| IOT045 |	Careful with all the things in our lives
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| IOT045 |	What's being too
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| IOT045 |	Too expressive
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,447	| IOT045 |	So you know
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:19,263	| IOT045 |	What's the role of the designer that's why I love this work
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,591	| IOT045 |	You know that's why I think it's so exciting is because we have to use that
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,871	| IOT045 |	Almost like it's it
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:27,199	| IOT045 |	It's a color or a material and you don't want to use
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,991	| IOT045 |	Too much you know
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,295	| IOT045 |	Shiny Orange
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,879	| IOT045 |	Stuff in your home you want to use that as an accent
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| IOT045 |	You should see my living room
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,183	| IOT045 |	There's a lot of Shanghai Orange
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,119	| IOT045 |	Remind it's true
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,543	| IOT045 |	When it does that plus my laundry machine
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| IOT045 |	Does the lake
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:04,063	| IOT045 |	Okay well let's let's get back on track just a little bit because
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,831	| IOT045 |	Last week
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,903	| IOT045 |	About a guy from Google named Max brod
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,415	| IOT045 |	Who built
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,207	| IOT045 |	A Google Now mirror
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:13,279	| IOT045 |	Everyone was like oh my God
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,583	| IOT045 |	Since you are designing actually
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,863	| IOT045 |	A smart coat rack
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,703	| IOT045 |	I love Google Now
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,471	| IOT045 |	Huge fan
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:21,983	| IOT045 |	I check it every more
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,287	| IOT045 |	I love the idea of putting it on my mirror
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:30,687	| IOT045 |	I love the idea of putting on the windshield of my car like the pattern is driver-side windshield so like what I got in my car it's like
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,991	| IOT045 |	What you got going on today
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,271	| IOT045 |	Don't forget you
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:34,783	| IOT045 |	Eric Ryback
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,087	| IOT045 |	So what do you think
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:42,719	| IOT045 |	Shall I think that Max bronze mirror is
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:48,095	| IOT045 |	Watch designer I think it's very beautiful there's something really lovely
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,607	| IOT045 |	About
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,655	| IOT045 |	Seeing information
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,167	| IOT045 |	Floating
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,983	| IOT045 |	You know something about the mirror house
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,775	| IOT045 |	Not seem like it
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,567	| IOT045 |	Especially the one that he has
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,359	| IOT045 |	Is an edgeless mirror right
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:11:59,871	| IOT045 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,943	| IOT045 |	It's just this kind of beautiful sheet of Ra
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,991	| IOT045 |	Reflection and mirrors also open up
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,527	| IOT045 |	The space so there's a lot a lot
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:07,807	| IOT045 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,319	| IOT045 |	Designery
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| IOT045 |	About it
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,135	| IOT045 |	And I think
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,671	| IOT045 |	You know it in the
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,207	| IOT045 |	Blog post where he
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:19,327	| IOT045 |	About his project he says the other lot of people have tried to do and it's been in the movies so
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,887	| IOT045 |	I think it's very cool because I have
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,935	| IOT045 |	Envision the mayor for sometime
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,775	| IOT045 |	And when I did my New York Times piece are walking talking
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:31,103	| IOT045 |	Objects invited me to do admittedly really
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| IOT045 |	I'm Tongan
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,199	| IOT045 |	She can play for slideshow and I have a mirror there
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,223	| IOT045 |	It's in the back
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,503	| IOT045 |	It's been something that I've been
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:40,575	| IOT045 |	Envisioning for some time and I was inspired by haven't gone to the MI
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,855	| IOT045 |	Medialab
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,415	| IOT045 |	And they had a mirror that could read my heart rate
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,183	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| IOT045 |	For me what's
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:46,975	| IOT045 |	You know
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,279	| IOT045 |	The potential of this I think Google Now
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,303	| IOT045 |	It's
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,583	| IOT045 |	Rate
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,119	| IOT045 |	To have
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,423	| IOT045 |	You know whether and your calendar stop at
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,959	| IOT045 |	It's another place where we have
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:00,799	| IOT045 |	Be careful especially in the bathroom so I teach a course called
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:04,895	| IOT045 |	Smart objects design of contemporary products at the University of Pennsylvania
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,711	| IOT045 |	And last year we had a group that was designing
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| IOT045 |	The bathroom we had
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:11,295	| IOT045 |	A lot of conversations about how the bat
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,831	| IOT045 |	Is one of the last
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,111	| IOT045 |	Tranquil spaces
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,903	| IOT045 |	That we have
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:16,415	| IOT045 |	In life
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,719	| IOT045 |	The bathroom and
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| IOT045 |	Used to have
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,279	| IOT045 |	The airplanes
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,583	| IOT045 |	Not so much anymore cuz we have
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,375	| IOT045 |	So now we have
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| IOT045 |	Right
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,215	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,519	| IOT045 |	Are you first walk with Max brought that like
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:33,311	| IOT045 |	I don't like I said is beautiful
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| IOT045 |	I'm so well X
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,383	| IOT045 |	Executed
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,151	| IOT045 |	Great
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,199	| IOT045 |	To give you I'm at a glance
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,967	| IOT045 |	Information
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:44,063	| IOT045 |	I think the potential for the future is to have
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:44,575	| IOT045 |	Health
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,111	| IOT045 |	I think a lot of the fish
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,647	| IOT045 |	The smart mirror
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:50,975	| IOT045 |	Is that it would be that the bathroom is a place where you
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:51,999	| IOT045 |	Think about your
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:57,119	| IOT045 |	So I had seen at MIT media lab actually
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,399	| IOT045 |	Has a camera in
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:58,911	| IOT045 |	In Arabic
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,215	| IOT045 |	See the color of your
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| IOT045 |	Skin and
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,263	| IOT045 |	Can actually
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:07,615	| IOT045 |	The nuances in color so that it knows when blood is rushing in a rushing out
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,639	| IOT045 |	And can read your heart rate
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,455	| IOT045 |	So I couldn't
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,271	| IOT045 |	The video camera in the Microsoft
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| IOT045 |	I think
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,207	| IOT045 |	It can get even more exciting
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,487	| IOT045 |	If you think about the
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| IOT045 |	Peripheral
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,023	| IOT045 |	That could
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:29,119	| IOT045 |	Plug into your Android phone that could maybe
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,631	| IOT045 |	2
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,935	| IOT045 |	You know heart rate or
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,727	| IOT045 |	Your temperature
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,239	| IOT045 |	I
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,031	| IOT045 |	Then
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| IOT045 |	I think about
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,615	| IOT045 |	Health in the bathroom
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,663	| IOT045 |	I like the idea of
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,687	| IOT045 |	Weather information
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| IOT045 |	This is a good segue because
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| IOT045 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,391	| IOT045 |	I was like that was a terrible song
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,999	| IOT045 |	In the hallway
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,511	| IOT045 |	Yeah right
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,791	| IOT045 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,863	| IOT045 |	So I am developing a smart coat rack
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,375	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,935	| IOT045 |	The idea behind that is
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:10,335	| IOT045 |	We don't need all the information everywhere we only need certain pieces of information
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,639	| IOT045 |	At the places of times with their most
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:18,271	| IOT045 |	Needed when you're just walking out the door is when you need to know
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| IOT045 |	To grab your coat
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,575	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:24,415	| IOT045 |	What I'm envisioning is this really intuitive
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,439	| IOT045 |	Split Second
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,975	| IOT045 |	Conversation that you have with
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| IOT045 |	Smart device
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,303	| IOT045 |	What's telling you
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,839	| IOT045 |	But then you're going okay
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,607	| IOT045 |	I'll take that ring
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,399	| IOT045 |	So you're developing
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:34,911	| IOT045 |	A coat rack
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,215	| IOT045 |	Somehow
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:42,079	| IOT045 |	Does it lift the coat how did it tell it what is division here that it has an API to the weather
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| IOT045 |	Channels or something
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:47,199	| IOT045 |	Yes yes so it hasn't epi2 AccuWeather and
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,479	| IOT045 |	Can
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,527	| IOT045 |	Light up can highlight the code
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,111	| IOT045 |	When you take it when you walk past it
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,671	| IOT045 |	I have to have that ring
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,183	| IOT045 |	Code on 140
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:04,351	| IOT045 |	Yeah so it does rely on user experience so that's part of what's in the works with
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,655	| IOT045 |	Design aspect of it so that's a good point
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,191	| IOT045 |	It relies on
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:12,543	| IOT045 |	You having I also have had this Vision I'm I'm one of them one of those designers
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,335	| IOT045 |	Designers I've always had a vision of Heaven
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,103	| IOT045 |	Days of the week on
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,407	| IOT045 |	On my hangers in
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:17,919	| IOT045 |	In the closet
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:25,087	| IOT045 |	You sent that exist Carla
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:26,879	| IOT045 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:35,071	| IOT045 |	No I'd love to have like the clock that actually the closet that you open it
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,839	| IOT045 |	It tells you what
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,351	| IOT045 |	How to wear baseball
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:39,423	| IOT045 |	You're a calendar you know
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,263	| IOT045 |	For a while
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:48,383	| IOT045 |	I had my hue light bulbs in my closet light up a different color for
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:51,455	| IOT045 |	Temperatures because I get dressed in the morning
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,479	| IOT045 |	To walk my dog
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,551	| IOT045 |	Benefits in the winter if it's below
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:03,743	| IOT045 |	I wanted to know because that's when that's a temperature at which I wanted ad long and
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,023	| IOT045 |	Underneath my pants
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| IOT045 |	I was like
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,375	| IOT045 |	I wanted it to light up blue
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,399	| IOT045 |	In the closet
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,167	| IOT045 |	So I have
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,447	| IOT045 |	Just one bulb in there
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:14,495	| IOT045 |	And I sat at using Lincoln if this and that
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,007	| IOT045 |	Recipe for you
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,055	| IOT045 |	It was great
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,103	| IOT045 |	Yeah I was wondering how it worked out
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,431	| IOT045 |	It was a challenge
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:26,015	| IOT045 |	Because they require
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,807	| IOT045 |	Because you couldn't turn out the light
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,343	| IOT045 |	Turn out the light then
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,159	| IOT045 |	It messed everything up but
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,927	| IOT045 |	It was kind of a
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| IOT045 |	It was not
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,719	| IOT045 |	And ideas
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| IOT045 |	Prototype
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,351	| IOT045 |	For this one
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,911	| IOT045 |	And we'll see how it goes I have a boyfriend
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:47,263	| IOT045 |	In the UK whose name is Brendan Dawes who also prototypes a lot of
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:53,663	| IOT045 |	These types of things and he's he's been doing some experiments in the closet and he's also been doing
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,943	| IOT045 |	Going to some very physical
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,735	| IOT045 |	Weather devices
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| IOT045 |	Flip around
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| IOT045 |	Let you know
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,343	| IOT045 |	What the weather is going to be so I've been taking inspiration
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,879	| IOT045 |	From that as well
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,159	| IOT045 |	As the ambient
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,671	| IOT045 |	Umbrella
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| IOT045 |	The weather so
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,815	| IOT045 |	Can I have the lights up
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:11,583	| IOT045 |	Write the Latino
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,887	| IOT045 |	I just think there's an
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,655	| IOT045 |	Dance to that
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,447	| IOT045 |	But I'm going to really have to think hard
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:23,359	| IOT045 |	About to cuz I've been relying on myself to put the right code on the right hook actually we will close out the
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,127	| IOT045 |	Episode with this
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| IOT045 |	Connected coat racks connected mirrors
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,783	| IOT045 |	Carla thanks for hosting
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,807	| IOT045 |	This week with me
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:36,159	| IOT045 |	And stay tuned you guys because my guest this week is Zach
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:38,975	| IOT045 |	Sepala who is the CEO of particle
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:45,375	| IOT045 |	We're going to talk about the electron which is awesome because it's bringing cellular connectivity to
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:51,519	| IOT045 |	Your things
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:54,079	| IOT045 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,615	| IOT045 |	Podcast
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,895	| IOT045 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,663	| IOT045 |	And today's
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,967	| IOT045 |	Guest is Zach's about he is the
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,527	| IOT045 |	CEO and co-founder of particle
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,831	| IOT045 |	Hey Zack thanks for joining us
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,599	| IOT045 |	Thanks for having me
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,695	| IOT045 |	Article is an iot dashboard
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:14,815	| IOT045 |	For the longest time it seems like everybody who I had on the show
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,327	| IOT045 |	Had one
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,607	| IOT045 |	I mean there were three
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| IOT045 |	And now they're much fewer
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:21,215	| IOT045 |	And you guys have
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:22,495	| IOT045 |	Special news because
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,031	| IOT045 |	You've done something that
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,871	| IOT045 |	Mad if you asked me five years ago I would have said this is
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,639	| IOT045 |	Impossible
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:33,247	| IOT045 |	You actually let me let you tell it because this is your Triumph
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,527	| IOT045 |	Band
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:40,927	| IOT045 |	New product of the electron the electron is our cellular development board so we have tools for people to build
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,719	| IOT045 |	Products that are connected to the internet
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:45,279	| IOT045 |	Through 2G and 3G Towers and with it
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,303	| IOT045 |	We're including
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,375	| IOT045 |	The hardware that you need and a SIM card in a data plan
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:52,703	| IOT045 |	And the cloud back in and so is all kind of included one box
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,263	| IOT045 |	But the big thing that
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:59,103	| IOT045 |	I think it's really exciting about it is taking hardware and combining it with
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,639	| IOT045 |	This Heart of Hope carrier side
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:05,759	| IOT045 |	So that our customers don't have to figure out where the SIM card comes from the data plan
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,063	| IOT045 |	We just hand it to them and they can get going
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,135	| IOT045 |	This is truly like
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,927	| IOT045 |	For those of you guys who have not
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,463	| IOT045 |	Slog through years of
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,767	| IOT045 |	The development of The Internet of Things
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,303	| IOT045 |	This is a big freaking deal
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| IOT045 |	Because
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:24,703	| IOT045 |	Forever if you wanted to do anything with the carrier you had to go to them
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,263	| IOT045 |	As a big name company and they would be like
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,311	| IOT045 |	Oh so you want to connect something
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,079	| IOT045 |	How many sentence
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,807	| IOT045 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,367	| IOT045 |	Exactly I mean they're they're set up to deal with
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:45,439	| IOT045 |	Customers that have millions of devices designed for smartphone
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,743	| IOT045 |	And so if your Samsung or
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,511	| IOT045 |	Apple
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,047	| IOT045 |	Or something along those lines
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:54,911	| IOT045 |	So easy to figure out how you engage with carrier cuz they want they want those, those contracts and if your
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,471	| IOT045 |	Not Samsung you could still be a big company
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,287	| IOT045 |	But still not but just not shipping millions of devices every year
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:03,359	| IOT045 |	It can be really hard to engage of the characters cuz there was not set up
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:08,479	| IOT045 |	And that can be really painful and slow and it can stop you from building
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,247	| IOT045 |	A product
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,551	| IOT045 |	That is actually a good idea
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:18,464	| IOT045 |	With a good business by propositions behind it because you just can't get through those barriers
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:21,280	| IOT045 |	Kindle launched it was difficult for them to get
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,072	| IOT045 |	For Amazon to actually
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,608	| IOT045 |	Build that with
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:30,752	| IOT045 |	Wireless built into it because they couldn't find a carrier partner it took a while for them to get to Sprint
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,080	| IOT045 |	And this was this was actually a known
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,104	| IOT045 |	The jet company
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:37,408	| IOT045 |	So imagine if you're like
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,224	| IOT045 |	Somebody who's who just experimenting with something
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,552	| IOT045 |	You know even if you're at like Procter & Gamble
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| IOT045 |	Or
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,088	| IOT045 |	Ghetto Halliburton
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| IOT045 |	It's still difficult
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:53,024	| IOT045 |	Exactly right
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:56,352	| IOT045 |	All right here
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,144	| IOT045 |	Pretty neat thank you
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:04,544	| IOT045 |	And yeah I mean it took us a year to get this together at 2 to negotiate that contract with carriers and we had to go through
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:06,336	| IOT045 |	The ups and downs of
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:11,456	| IOT045 |	Who's the right person at this organization I had a lot of phone calls where I'm talking to somebody who
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:17,856	| IOT045 |	Clearly was not the right person I talked to the wrong person at every carrier 20 times before I talk to the right person
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,184	| IOT045 |	I got hung up on at least one
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,976	| IOT045 |	You have someone who is
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:26,816	| IOT045 |	Upset that we weren't doing things the way that they said that we were supposed to do them
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:31,424	| IOT045 |	And it was got that figured out how we can pass it off for customers
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:36,544	| IOT045 |	You don't have to do all internet to go through all this pain you're not to do this yourself would just taking care of a cellular plan
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:43,200	| IOT045 |	And now you can go and it works everywhere and it's affordable and you can just ship your product and not worry about it
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,504	| IOT045 |	No one has to hang up on you guys
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:49,856	| IOT045 |	So you guys
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| IOT045 |	Started with a crowdfunding
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,440	| IOT045 |	For this product
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,232	| IOT045 |	We did did that help
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,000	| IOT045 |	Actually
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,816	| IOT045 |	I'm assuming that helps like get you to the right
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| IOT045 |	People initials
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:02,656	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,936	| IOT045 |	We spend
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,240	| IOT045 |	About a year
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,008	| IOT045 |	Talking
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:07,520	| IOT045 |	2
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,568	| IOT045 |	Carriers in the US
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,640	| IOT045 |	Trying to figure out who's the right partner to
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| IOT045 |	To do
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,176	| IOT045 |	This product
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,688	| IOT045 |	With
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,968	| IOT045 |	Let me talk to Oliver
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:16,992	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:21,088	| IOT045 |	Again we sometimes talk to the right person we sometimes talk to the wrong person
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,368	| IOT045 |	It's hard to figure out
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,928	| IOT045 |	Do you know who had some plan
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,976	| IOT045 |	Work for what we're trying to do
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,816	| IOT045 |	And we got to the point where we were ready the hardware was ready
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,608	| IOT045 |	And we had a plan from
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,376	| IOT045 |	Carrier
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,144	| IOT045 |	And it was
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,424	| IOT045 |	Good night
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,728	| IOT045 |	It's all time of our problems but not other problems
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,008	| IOT045 |	It was a starting point
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,800	| IOT045 |	And we said you know what
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:43,616	| IOT045 |	We're about to go on Kickstarter and launch this to the world
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:45,408	| IOT045 |	And we know from our previous experience
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,456	| IOT045 |	Doing Kickstarter campaign
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,480	| IOT045 |	Did you get a lot of visibility
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,760	| IOT045 |	Bed
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,272	| IOT045 |	Corporate
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,296	| IOT045 |	People
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:57,696	| IOT045 |	That you want to talk to are watching Kickstarter they're trying to see what's going on out there so we had this idea that maybe
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:59,488	| IOT045 |	Once we launched this campaign
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,560	| IOT045 |	Do we get phone calls from the right people at the right carriers
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,608	| IOT045 |	They can help us figure out the right
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| IOT045 |	Truss
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,424	| IOT045 |	We launched our Kickstarter campaign
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:10,240	| IOT045 |	And within the three days after launch
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,544	| IOT045 |	Every major carrier
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| IOT045 |	North American in Europe
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,360	| IOT045 |	In European called me
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,896	| IOT045 |	And said
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,432	| IOT045 |	We like to power this product
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:23,808	| IOT045 |	Until we're in a great position we got to negotiate with multiple carriers got to figure out who's the right partner
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,648	| IOT045 |	And we got to build a platform that gives us Global coverage around the world
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:32,000	| IOT045 |	I'm at an affordable rate because of the visibility that we got with that crowd funny
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,792	| IOT045 |	Okay and
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,888	| IOT045 |	I'll do this for you so you don't have to feel too hard that you
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,656	| IOT045 |	Have to pitch this but
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,192	| IOT045 |	Right now you've got
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,728	| IOT045 |	Coverage for this product
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,264	| IOT045 |	So if I if I did this
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,312	| IOT045 |	I want to build a product with
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,080	| IOT045 |	The electron
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,128	| IOT045 |	I've got a virgin over a hundred countries
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:53,504	| IOT045 |	Some of the carriers that you say are involved are telefonica AT&T T-Mobile
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,784	| IOT045 |	Most of those are names I've heard of
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,576	| IOT045 |	Yep
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,648	| IOT045 |	Maybe not
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,696	| IOT045 |	And this is a $39
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,488	| IOT045 |	Cantar board
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,256	| IOT045 |	Basically
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,024	| IOT045 |	Bertucci
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,560	| IOT045 |	$59 for 3-g
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,120	| IOT045 |	And I will say
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,680	| IOT045 |	What do you think the odds are of getting a
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,192	| IOT045 |	T4g
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,216	| IOT045 |	Version
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,264	| IOT045 |	Will get there
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,544	| IOT045 |	So right now
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:23,712	| IOT045 |	It's really interesting three spectrums that people are playing with you at 2G 3G 4G and of course there's the whole CDMA vs.
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,224	| IOT045 |	Gsmst
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:32,672	| IOT045 |	The types of applications that we support this is low bandwidth stuff so we're doing sensors and actuators a lot of a lot of times it's
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,720	| IOT045 |	Reading temperature data off of a sensor
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,792	| IOT045 |	Once a day and uploading it to the internet and so
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,584	| IOT045 |	I don't really care about band
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,632	| IOT045 |	2 G is plenty
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,168	| IOT045 |	But
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,472	| IOT045 |	2G has issues being sunset in the US
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,776	| IOT045 |	I was going to say 2 G is about to leave
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,080	| IOT045 |	Right and this is a this is a problem
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:52,640	| IOT045 |	It's very unfortunate for
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,408	| IOT045 |	Internet of Things
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:58,784	| IOT045 |	That teaches going away because most of us just need to cheat now it's not going away yeah in
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,088	| IOT045 |	Overseas in places like Europe
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,392	| IOT045 |	But that's a factor
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,952	| IOT045 |	SO3 G really only matters from
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,720	| IOT045 |	Perspective
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,280	| IOT045 |	Compatibility making sure that it works and will continue to work
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT045 |	4
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,560	| IOT045 |	Years
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:13,120	| IOT045 |	But of course then the whole world is going to hell
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:18,240	| IOT045 |	How to eat an LTE is the future but I'll see chips are ungodly expensive right
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:20,288	| IOT045 |	Even the ones that are designed for iot
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:26,688	| IOT045 |	I'm at least twice as expensive as the 3-g ones which are more than twice as expensive as the 2G ones
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,456	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:34,368	| IOT045 |	Right now we're focusing on 2G 3-g we're waiting for the chips to get cheap to do to do LTE and as soon as they're uh
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:37,184	| IOT045 |	Affordable we're going to make that leap and bring our customers with us
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,208	| IOT045 |	Baidu
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,744	| IOT045 |	Right now
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,536	| IOT045 |	LTE doesn't a lot of value
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:45,632	| IOT045 |	It just creates a lot of costing and so we're waiting to for that to change
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:47,680	| IOT045 |	Well let me ask you because
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,472	| IOT045 |	You know there's LTE
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:53,824	| IOT045 |	The current versions that we have right now that I use on my phone which
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,848	| IOT045 |	Maximizing
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,360	| IOT045 |	Capacity
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:59,456	| IOT045 |	Now everybody calls it something different so
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,272	| IOT045 |	There's lte-advanced
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:05,088	| IOT045 |	There's 5G
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:09,440	| IOT045 |	Version feltie design for the internet of things that would you
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:14,560	| IOT045 |	Skip kind of the current LTE that is in our phones for using those kind of chips
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:19,168	| IOT045 |	It depends it depends on how fast it happens because at the end of the day
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:20,448	| IOT045 |	We're about enabling
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| IOT045 |	People to go build products today
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:26,848	| IOT045 |	And I'm excited about a lot of the stuff is coming down the pipe and there are really good
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:29,152	| IOT045 |	New Solutions designed for
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,944	| IOT045 |	Lowering power consumption
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:34,016	| IOT045 |	For lowering lowering on the ship
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,040	| IOT045 |	Flooring
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,576	| IOT045 |	Bandwidth costs
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,088	| IOT045 |	But
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:41,696	| IOT045 |	There's multiple options we don't really know which of the variety of
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,720	| IOT045 |	Future
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,000	| IOT045 |	Protocols is going to win
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:48,096	| IOT045 |	LTE so much more complicated Spectrum it looks from the outside
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,400	| IOT045 |	And I think as a consumer you look at it and say
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:53,984	| IOT045 |	Before there was GSM and CDMA at least in the US
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:59,616	| IOT045 |	And now thank God we're on the same protocol LTE cuz now it that makes the world a lot simpler
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| IOT045 |	Behind the
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:04,480	| IOT045 |	3 letters LTE that a lot of complexity there's different bands
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,016	| IOT045 |	There's different categories
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:09,344	| IOT045 |	Categories generally are a band with sitting so hot like cat
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,392	| IOT045 |	Cat6 cat7
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:14,976	| IOT045 |	That's high-bandwidth cat 0 cat 1 that's that's low bandwidth
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,000	| IOT045 |	But so
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,304	| IOT045 |	There's pieces of Lte that are built
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:19,840	| IOT045 |	Best expensive
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:23,680	| IOT045 |	And the question is are those pieces that are built in to get cheaper
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,216	| IOT045 |	Before
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,008	| IOT045 |	The
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,312	| IOT045 |	Future protocol is designed for iot
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,360	| IOT045 |	Actually get
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,896	| IOT045 |	Completed and
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,688	| IOT045 |	Deployed and are usable
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:35,968	| IOT045 |	And so
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,528	| IOT045 |	Right now we're just basically saying
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,552	| IOT045 |	We're going to keep our eye on it
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,112	| IOT045 |	If you're doing a project today
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:47,232	| IOT045 |	It should probably be 3-g if it's in the US and 2G if it's in Europe
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:48,768	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,816	| IOT045 |	Just go for that and
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:54,912	| IOT045 |	We'll keep our eye on it and let everybody know when the next Generation stuff is ready for consumption
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,472	| IOT045 |	Okay question
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,752	| IOT045 |	Animal skit office
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,032	| IOT045 |	Esoteric
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:05,920	| IOT045 |	But I have to ask are you guys looking at any of the low power
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,200	| IOT045 |	Wide area network
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,736	| IOT045 |	Standards
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,504	| IOT045 |	Like
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:12,832	| IOT045 |	What's a foxes doing like Laura or any of those other things
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:16,160	| IOT045 |	We are and I think it's really interesting
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,696	| IOT045 |	I think that there is really great
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:20,512	| IOT045 |	Applications I'm really skeptical of national rollouts
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:24,864	| IOT045 |	So you know sigfox isn't has as well. In some countries in Europe
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:27,424	| IOT045 |	Laura is being rolled on some countries in Europe
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,704	| IOT045 |	And everybody
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:30,240	| IOT045 |	Looks at the US
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,008	| IOT045 |	As this
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:34,336	| IOT045 |	Giant country with a kind of empty middle
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:41,248	| IOT045 |	And also really exists really expensive to deploy new radios on to cell towers here because of the economic model
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,272	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:46,624	| IOT045 |	Everyone looks and says we're going to do National deployment I will get to us someday
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:49,952	| IOT045 |	And that's a problem has a huge market and
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:52,256	| IOT045 |	That's often where these products into played first so
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,048	| IOT045 |	I'm keeping my eye on it
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:57,888	| IOT045 |	For sure and I think that themselves the things like
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:02,752	| IOT045 |	Are really interesting regardless of whether they're deployed on a national networks they don't have to be
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:06,336	| IOT045 |	They can deploy with more of a DIY bring your own
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:08,384	| IOT045 |	Gateway Tower kind of
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:13,504	| IOT045 |	Deployment Racine that start to happen already so I am very interested in that I'm keeping my eye on it
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,528	| IOT045 |	As we think about our roadmap
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:17,088	| IOT045 |	Radios peruanas support in the future
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:19,136	| IOT045 |	Stephen something we're looking very hard at
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,928	| IOT045 |	Informa economics
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,440	| IOT045 |	Perspective
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,976	| IOT045 |	For your business
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:26,048	| IOT045 |	It doesn't necessarily you don't need to sell
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,120	| IOT045 |	Tens of millions of your product
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:31,424	| IOT045 |	Like for each radio you support
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:31,936	| IOT045 |	Yes or no
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:37,824	| IOT045 |	No I mean we we can make it work we can make our Economics work for any kind of
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,872	| IOT045 |	Any kind of radio is different
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:41,664	| IOT045 |	For sure that the way that we
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:44,992	| IOT045 |	Cellular has this bacon data plan
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,040	| IOT045 |	That makes the economics work in a certain way
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:49,088	| IOT045 |	And you have to buy data
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:51,136	| IOT045 |	Another soul
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:55,232	| IOT045 |	Redefines the the the economics of a cellular base product
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,768	| IOT045 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,560	| IOT045 |	Bialy
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,864	| IOT045 |	Zigbee thread
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,632	| IOT045 |	Laura
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,656	| IOT045 |	Sigfox
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,728	| IOT045 |	There's more flexibility that was more wiggle room
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,752	| IOT045 |	So you can
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:13,152	| IOT045 |	Decide to make different decisions about how you monetize those products
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,176	| IOT045 |	Totally sure how we would charge for
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,736	| IOT045 |	But
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| IOT045 |	Will figure it out
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,064	| IOT045 |	There we go alright
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,392	| IOT045 |	Let's move back to the electron which is the name of this product
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,416	| IOT045 |	But you're lunching
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,440	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:28,512	| IOT045 |	Let's talk about you got about 200 in the field
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,560	| IOT045 |	Expedia customer
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:31,840	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,864	| IOT045 |	What are people doing with it
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:36,448	| IOT045 |	It's a lot more industrial vet
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:38,240	| IOT045 |	Products we were exposed to previously
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,008	| IOT045 |	Sew weave
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,800	| IOT045 |	Had for a couple years now
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,360	| IOT045 |	Wifi-connected development platform
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,152	| IOT045 |	And that means the people are building
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:50,016	| IOT045 |	Consumer Home Products a lot of smart home pet toys gardening systems
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:52,576	| IOT045 |	Things that are consumer applications we had
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:58,208	| IOT045 |	I think 22 companies have now launched products on Kickstarter or Indiegogo that have been funded
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:01,792	| IOT045 |	Platform Figueroa yams
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,840	| IOT045 |	Mostly under NDA
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,376	| IOT045 |	That do
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:08,704	| IOT045 |	Appliances and security systems and things like that
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:09,984	| IOT045 |	But
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:11,776	| IOT045 |	With cellular
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:16,128	| IOT045 |	The customers are a lot more industrial so the types of things people are building our
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,688	| IOT045 |	Monitoring expensive equipment
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,736	| IOT045 |	On manufacturing lines
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,248	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,040	| IOT045 |	Oil rigs
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:24,576	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| IOT045 |	Controlling
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:29,184	| IOT045 |	Huge industrial water pumps and motors and
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:32,512	| IOT045 |	Irrigation systems on farms and
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:34,560	| IOT045 |	Distributed sensor Networks
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:36,096	| IOT045 |	Municipal applications
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,144	| IOT045 |	Garbage cans street lights
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:42,240	| IOT045 |	You know it's a huge array of products and very different
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,520	| IOT045 |	From what we saw on the
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,800	| IOT045 |	Wifi sign
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:49,408	| IOT045 |	And it's really only have 200 out there so
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:52,480	| IOT045 |	It's still pretty small number of applications were being exposed to
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:55,552	| IOT045 |	But now we have 10000 that are on their way to customers
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:56,576	| IOT045 |	Today
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:57,856	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:00,928	| IOT045 |	They will arrive and will have
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:07,328	| IOT045 |	Orders of magnitude more people building stuff over the next three months is winter really going to learn what are people doing
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,352	| IOT045 |	What do they need this for
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,144	| IOT045 |	Why are they doing it
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,424	| IOT045 |	And how can we help them be successful
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:13,984	| IOT045 |	Have you seen differences in
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:17,312	| IOT045 |	Data patterns over cellular vs wifi
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,080	| IOT045 |	Yeah
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:20,640	| IOT045 |	You're paying for every bite that you sent
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:23,200	| IOT045 |	And so it really changes the way that the
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:24,992	| IOT045 |	People think about sending messages
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:26,784	| IOT045 |	With Wi-Fi
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,832	| IOT045 |	If you have a limit
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:31,648	| IOT045 |	And we we we rate limit our devices to send messages 1
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,672	| IOT045 |	1 per second on average
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,720	| IOT045 |	So a lot of people just go straight up
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:39,584	| IOT045 |	Publishing a message once per second and their graphing that and that's totally fine
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,352	| IOT045 |	End
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,632	| IOT045 |	Good cost for
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:45,472	| IOT045 |	The inbound and outbound data into AWS will be to play our stuff it's
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,776	| IOT045 |	Yeah it's really not a big deal it's pretty cheap
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,824	| IOT045 |	Siler's expensive
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:50,592	| IOT045 |	And so
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:52,896	| IOT045 |	Lemons for the customer they have to
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,968	| IOT045 |	Think how often do I want this thing to actually send a receive
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:56,992	| IOT045 |	Receive messages
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,016	| IOT045 |	It's expensive for
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,576	| IOT045 |	Potato plants expensive for power
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,600	| IOT045 |	And so
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,928	| IOT045 |	We see a lot more applications where it's sleeping for a long time
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:11,328	| IOT045 |	Maybe waking up sending a message once a day going back to sleep so that it can last for months or with a small
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,120	| IOT045 |	Solar panel can last forever
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:14,912	| IOT045 |	And cost
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,192	| IOT045 |	Couple box per month
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:21,056	| IOT045 |	For really low bandwidth plans are the types of things we see people doing with cellular
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:25,152	| IOT045 |	And we've built a lot of stuff into a platform to make it easy to optimize so we've worked
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:27,200	| IOT045 |	Really hard to
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,736	| IOT045 |	Take down
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,784	| IOT045 |	The bandwidth
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,064	| IOT045 |	For encryption
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:35,392	| IOT045 |	So all of our messages are encryption secured is a huge part of what we do
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:41,792	| IOT045 |	We don't want customers to have to worry about whether something is encrypted or not but you pay for encryption it costs you money in van with v
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,560	| IOT045 |	Because
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,864	| IOT045 |	There's a handshake that has to happen there is
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,656	| IOT045 |	Keys that have to be sent
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,192	| IOT045 |	And those cost money
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:50,496	| IOT045 |	So we've done a lot of
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,776	| IOT045 |	Tweaks to our
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:52,288	| IOT045 |	Protocol
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:57,920	| IOT045 |	To reduce the overhead of conscription so you can have secure Communications but not pay more
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:00,224	| IOT045 |	Or not pay much more than you would if it were
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,736	| IOT045 |	Unsecured
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,016	| IOT045 |	Got it
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:06,112	| IOT045 |	Okay and then with these beta customers that you've had so far
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:10,720	| IOT045 |	I'm sure coming back and talking to you in a couple months would be really interesting
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:12,768	| IOT045 |	How to change from
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:16,864	| IOT045 |	Encryption but what else have you changed it
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:20,704	| IOT045 |	One of the other changes another
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:22,240	| IOT045 |	Efficiency trade-off
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:25,568	| IOT045 |	We changed our protocol from TCP to UDP in this is
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,616	| IOT045 |	Kind of esoteric that actually mean something
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,640	| IOT045 |	Important
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:32,224	| IOT045 |	TCP and UDP are two of the most commonly used
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:34,528	| IOT045 |	Basic Protocols of the web TCP is
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:39,136	| IOT045 |	Is it socket connection it means that we're we can confirm there were talking to one another
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:40,416	| IOT045 |	EDP soccer
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:43,744	| IOT045 |	You can come and go as more of a transient communication
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:49,120	| IOT045 |	And Eustis has been with because you don't have to acknowledge every message that sent you can just kind of
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,144	| IOT045 |	Type stuff out
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:52,960	| IOT045 |	If you think of web websites or use RC
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:54,240	| IOT045 |	Through TCP because
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,544	| IOT045 |	You ensure that all the data from the website gets to your
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:57,824	| IOT045 |	Browser
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,592	| IOT045 |	Skype
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:35:59,616	| IOT045 |	Is done over UDP
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,176	| IOT045 |	Because if you miss a couple bits here and there
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:02,944	| IOT045 |	You can
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:04,224	| IOT045 |	Take it on the back end
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,760	| IOT045 |	I'd like a stream of video or audio
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,040	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:13,184	| IOT045 |	We switched our protocol to use UDP to save on bandwidth but what that means is we used to tell people
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,208	| IOT045 |	Weather device
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,488	| IOT045 |	Online or offline
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:18,048	| IOT045 |	And with UDP that idea goes away
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:18,816	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:23,168	| IOT045 |	Is it online or offline right now is actually a hard question to answer
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,216	| IOT045 |	Because all you can really do is
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:27,008	| IOT045 |	Send a message to be like
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:32,384	| IOT045 |	Hey by the way are you still there is someone listening to this but that cost been with so you try not to send this message
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,920	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,992	| IOT045 |	We've had to change some of the ways we communicate
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,016	| IOT045 |	For customers
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,552	| IOT045 |	What's happening with your device
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:43,904	| IOT045 |	Because of this new world that were living and we were trying to save every penny
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:44,416	| IOT045 |	For them
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:46,976	| IOT045 |	Oh that's he that makes me feel like
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,000	| IOT045 |	Deeply sad feels
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:49,536	| IOT045 |	It feels so terrible that
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,328	| IOT045 |	It cost so much
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:54,912	| IOT045 |	It feels like you're giving up so much
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:56,192	| IOT045 |	Right
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,008	| IOT045 |	So I guess I want to talk to your customers
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,288	| IOT045 |	How do you deal with that
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,336	| IOT045 |	Cuz it feels like such a sacrifice
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:04,640	| IOT045 |	The products that make sense
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,432	| IOT045 |	They're more products that make sense
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:08,736	| IOT045 |	If the technology underneath it is cheaper
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:13,088	| IOT045 |	If it cost twenty bucks to connect a product the internet there's only so many things you can connect
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:17,696	| IOT045 |	If it's $10 to get a lot more interesting products it's $5 more so
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,464	| IOT045 |	$1
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:21,024	| IOT045 |	Now we start to get into world where everything
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:24,096	| IOT045 |	Things connected and of course Moore's laws pushing us there on the chip side
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,400	| IOT045 |	Matters to
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:27,936	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:32,032	| IOT045 |	It becomes an important trade-off when people are trying to build cool stuff
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:35,104	| IOT045 |	But they're paying for everything that happens
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:39,712	| IOT045 |	Applications might be economically infeasible
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| IOT045 |	If they're sending a certain amount of data
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:43,296	| IOT045 |	But
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:46,112	| IOT045 |	Feasible if they can get below that threshold
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:50,976	| IOT045 |	So we work hard to push people below the threshold as low as possible
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,512	| IOT045 |	Affordable as we can
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,304	| IOT045 |	Do more people access to the tech
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:56,352	| IOT045 |	Archie and to enable more products
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,656	| IOT045 |	No I get it I'm just like
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:01,728	| IOT045 |	Indesit this is one of those classic
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,288	| IOT045 |	This is one reason why I feel like
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,824	| IOT045 |	Low power
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:07,360	| IOT045 |	Wide area networks are going to be
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:12,992	| IOT045 |	I'm not a huge believer in them because I fundamentally believe that once you give people connectivity
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,808	| IOT045 |	And eventually the cost will go down
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:18,880	| IOT045 |	People are knocking at people to be like why
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:22,720	| IOT045 |	What is the value of a sensor that wakes up once a day and reports its shadow
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,024	| IOT045 |	When you could have something that wakes up
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,560	| IOT045 |	Five times a day
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,584	| IOT045 |	What's a test or
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:30,400	| IOT045 |	Report status + you know
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,960	| IOT045 |	Grabs this other day that it can
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,240	| IOT045 |	Also grab
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,520	| IOT045 |	You know and I'm just like
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:37,312	| IOT045 |	Or replace it once a second
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:38,080	| IOT045 |	Because I can't
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,360	| IOT045 |	So
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:41,664	| IOT045 |	That's that's just me cuz no one ever says
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,200	| IOT045 |	I got an update I think
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,296	| IOT045 |	True and I want this to work like
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:49,600	| IOT045 |	In my mind this works like a w a square
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,392	| IOT045 |	You just kind of the prices come down every year
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:55,488	| IOT045 |	And you just get an email from AWS once every 6 months that says hey Kyle cheaper
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:39:01,888	| IOT045 |	And now at this point anyone has deployed stuff on Amazon for the last couple years is just used to it if you don't get that email you get upset
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,680	| IOT045 |	Why didn't the price come down there
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:08,288	| IOT045 |	So I want this stuff to work that same way I want to be sending my customers emails
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:10,848	| IOT045 |	Are regular basis and saying
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:13,152	| IOT045 |	By the way this is cheaper now so you can do more.
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:15,712	| IOT045 |	I'm and I'm going to work very hard
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:16,480	| IOT045 |	2
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:19,808	| IOT045 |	Make sure that we're always offering the most affordable
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:20,576	| IOT045 |	Solution
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,880	| IOT045 |	So we can get more products
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,160	| IOT045 |	Connected to the internet
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:26,208	| IOT045 |	That comes through
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,744	| IOT045 |	Continuing to
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:30,048	| IOT045 |	Negotiate with carriers weather
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:32,864	| IOT045 |	Through further optimizations we make in our Tech stack
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:36,960	| IOT045 |	Through adopting new radio as they become available
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,752	| IOT045 |	Like future of Alta Vista
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,544	| IOT045 |	Low-power Wireless area networking
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,080	| IOT045 |	Whatever it might be
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,896	| IOT045 |	What's the sooner we can get to the world where connections are free
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,712	| IOT045 |	The more the internet of things really becomes a reality
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:51,552	| IOT045 |	I think Amazon gets to that because Jeff Bezos built his own
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,088	| IOT045 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,904	| IOT045 |	Civilian servers scattered around the world
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:58,464	| IOT045 |	If you want to get to that
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,000	| IOT045 |	Think
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:00,768	| IOT045 |	You need to
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:03,584	| IOT045 |	Telco Network or
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:07,424	| IOT045 |	I need to replace Randall Stephenson over at AT&T with someone else who
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,192	| IOT045 |	Has that same
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:11,520	| IOT045 |	Single and drive cuz I don't think he wakes up in the morning and
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:15,360	| IOT045 |	How can I lower the cost all of my customers
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:17,152	| IOT045 |	Write what you know
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:24,320	| IOT045 |	What starting to let us do those things is that we have the developers so we now have 60,000 developers in engine
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:27,904	| IOT045 |	Our community their building stuff on a platform that never gets bigger every day
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:29,696	| IOT045 |	And in this industry
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,512	| IOT045 |	Internet of things we have the most
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:38,656	| IOT045 |	People building stuff we've been most people who are on our forums with the most people building projects and sharing them with one another
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:40,192	| IOT045 |	And
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,728	| IOT045 |	That's becoming really powerful Leverage
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:48,896	| IOT045 |	In talking with carriers and having those negotiations it's fundamentally what allowed us to do this in the first place that's what made the electron
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,920	| IOT045 |	Work from the kickstarter
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:54,016	| IOT045 |	And now we have more and more people and we can go to the cares and say
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:57,088	| IOT045 |	Look at what I've got look at these developers that I can bring to you
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:01,952	| IOT045 |	Don't you want these people building products on your platform you need to work with me to get these rates down
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,000	| IOT045 |	I really
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,352	| IOT045 |	I really do
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:09,888	| IOT045 |	I want
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:15,776	| IOT045 |	More connected devices in more places and I want the coolest things and I know that they're going to build it on stuff like
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:18,080	| IOT045 |	I know they're going to build it on the electron
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:24,480	| IOT045 |	It's you know the power of the developer it's any you see it happening everywhere
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:26,016	| IOT045 |	Look at the investment that
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:28,064	| IOT045 |	Intel is making into
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:31,392	| IOT045 |	They're like 13 of the developer tools
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,928	| IOT045 |	Like the Addison Carey
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:36,000	| IOT045 |	Semiconductor companies telcos
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:38,048	| IOT045 |	All of the companies you look at his
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,584	| IOT045 |	Old-fashioned dinosaurs
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:43,680	| IOT045 |	Are waking up to the power of the developer and
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:47,776	| IOT045 |	It's just starting to happen but I think over the next couple years going to happen even more
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:49,312	| IOT045 |	Hope you're right
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,663	| IOT045 |	Thank you so much for coming on the picat
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,687	| IOT045 |	Today thanks for having me
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:42:03,647	| IOT045 |	Thank you for listening and please join us next week on the Internet of Things podcast
