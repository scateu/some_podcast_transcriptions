EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,672	| IOT155 |	Let's kick it off with
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,208	| IOT155 |	Qualcomm and broadcom
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,744	| IOT155 |	The deal
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,512	| IOT155 |	Is
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,280	| IOT155 |	Dead
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:13,376	| IOT155 |	It's done the deal is done but not in the way people expect
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| IOT155 |	Give it to me
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:16,960	| IOT155 |	So Kevin and I have actually been going back and forth
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,776	| IOT155 |	Before we record the show actually talked about it this week
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,288	| IOT155 |	I know
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:27,712	| IOT155 |	So we held off we talked about it when it first was announced back in November of last year
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:32,576	| IOT155 |	Because this was a huge consolidation of chipmaker's especially related to the
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,904	| IOT155 |	Broadcom makes the chip
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:36,928	| IOT155 |	In the Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,232	| IOT155 |	WiFi chips
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,768	| IOT155 |	Yes they also have networking
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| IOT155 |	Capability
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,560	| IOT155 |	He's a swell but
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,840	| IOT155 |	Our purposes
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,376	| IOT155 |	Broadcom iot
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,936	| IOT155 |	Qualcomm however has been getting
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT155 |	Into
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:54,080	| IOT155 |	The iot and most of its chips because they were focused on mobile for so long and
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:55,360	| IOT155 |	Did so well there
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,408	| IOT155 |	A lot of its ships have just been
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:02,784	| IOT155 |	Popped into iot devices are actually working really hard to make things like
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,832	| IOT155 |	Embedded module of snapdragon
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,136	| IOT155 |	The Snapdragon 820 that we talked about
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| IOT155 |	I think a few weeks back
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,720	| IOT155 |	This deal with
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| IOT155 |	Consolidated
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,512	| IOT155 |	A significant amount
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:16,352	| IOT155 |	I'm actually glad it didn't happen because broadcom is
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:20,960	| IOT155 |	Private Equity play they are just mooching together lots and lots of Chip companies in
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,240	| IOT155 |	Frankly
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| IOT155 |	I don't think
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,592	| IOT155 |	Did they have the focus on innovation
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,872	| IOT155 |	Qualcomm has had
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| IOT155 |	Forever
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:31,712	| IOT155 |	Broadcom used to have big focus on integration but
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| IOT155 |	That is
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| IOT155 |	Subsequently
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:40,928	| IOT155 |	Died the most of their I don't want synchros but I use it for lack of a better word has come from Acquisitions and
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,256	| IOT155 |	Just getting into different markets as opposed to developing
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,536	| IOT155 |	Existing markets
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:50,144	| IOT155 |	Such as IRT in Solana that just agree that electing qualcomm's no more innovative
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,424	| IOT155 |	Their mobile chips
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:56,032	| IOT155 |	I can prove that but those are too powerful to use too much battery for
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:01,920	| IOT155 |	A lot of IRT type devices and sensors so they need to re innovate in that area which they're doing
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,736	| IOT155 |	The whole reason we didn't even say why the deal is off is
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,248	| IOT155 |	Because
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:11,648	| IOT155 |	The u.s. president has said they would raise security concerns to have a Chinese company with that typos
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,464	| IOT155 |	Power in this particular segment
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,744	| IOT155 |	Yes which is ironic
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,559	| IOT155 |	Because prior to the deal being announced back in November
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:22,655	| IOT155 |	I believe is the end of October that President Trump actually met
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,215	| IOT155 |	With he appeared on the podium next to
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,495	| IOT155 |	Broadcom CEO
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:29,567	| IOT155 |	Hock tan and talk about jobs growth
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,103	| IOT155 |	Trump broadcom in the Uso
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,383	| IOT155 |	I'm sure
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:38,015	| IOT155 |	Right because this deal for cording to broadcom just you would have brought more jobs and because
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:41,343	| IOT155 |	And this is happening anyway broadcom is going to re
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,367	| IOT155 |	Established
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,927	| IOT155 |	Headquarters in the US which it had done about
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,231	| IOT155 |	Three two or three years ago and moved overseas
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,535	| IOT155 |	So it meanwhile
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,839	| IOT155 |	We should just introduced this meanwhile
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:52,863	| IOT155 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,167	| IOT155 |	He's still trying to buy nxp
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| IOT155 |	Major semiconductor
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:04,127	| IOT155 |	To get more it be more Automotive capabilities and that microcontroller
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,175	| IOT155 |	Welcome is current
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:15,391	| IOT155 |	Yeah there's an XPS billion NFC chips as well which I would use the most mobile devices use NX
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,927	| IOT155 |	P4 NFC
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| IOT155 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,743	| IOT155 |	Right
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,791	| IOT155 |	If that weren't crazy enough
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:33,823	| IOT155 |	Broadcom deal where to start looking serious and tell him I come in with a
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| IOT155 |	It's owned by iota
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,943	| IOT155 |	Which then begs the question of now that this is done
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,223	| IOT155 |	What happens
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,783	| IOT155 |	Intel is it content
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,575	| IOT155 |	Just sit there and say you know what we're good
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,879	| IOT155 |	We don't need any mobile chips
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,391	| IOT155 |	Because we're
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,439	| IOT155 |	I don't even know
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:55,071	| IOT155 |	Cuz we had those with exhale and we sold them off right before mobile phones came out
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,607	| IOT155 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:58,655	| IOT155 |	This deal
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,447	| IOT155 |	The broadcom Qualcomm deal
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,239	| IOT155 |	Not happening
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,519	| IOT155 |	Xvideo
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,543	| IOT155 |	Who knows
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,311	| IOT155 |	Intel
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,335	| IOT155 |	Also who knows
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,639	| IOT155 |	So we'll leave it at that and
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:09,919	| IOT155 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,551	| IOT155 |	I would also talk about anymore they store debate over should we talk about
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:16,831	| IOT155 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| IOT155 |	No more debate
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:18,623	| IOT155 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,183	| IOT155 |	So moving right along to
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,999	| IOT155 |	Oh this is a really fun story you guys
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:24,511	| IOT155 |	Except
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:25,791	| IOT155 |	Scary story
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,327	| IOT155 |	I shouldn't I shouldn't set you up
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,351	| IOT155 |	Like that
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,119	| IOT155 |	To worry
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,423	| IOT155 |	It's so scarier than we talked about before
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:31,935	| IOT155 |	It's true
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,775	| IOT155 |	All right I was reading in ABA Journal
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,823	| IOT155 |	Which is a business law publication
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,359	| IOT155 |	The panel occurred last week
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,895	| IOT155 |	And it was basically
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,663	| IOT155 |	It was called
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,223	| IOT155 |	Madam is this evidence
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,271	| IOT155 |	Savannah News madam
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,807	| IOT155 |	Mystery
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,647	| IOT155 |	Basically these guys talked about law cases
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,487	| IOT155 |	Where Internet of Things devices such as a Fitbit
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,023	| IOT155 |	Vitamin A and
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,839	| IOT155 |	Other things other connected devices were used
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:05,983	| IOT155 |	To Arsenal's personal devices insurance
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,519	| IOT155 |	Device in someone's car
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,055	| IOT155 |	It was used in
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,335	| IOT155 |	A murder trial
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:15,199	| IOT155 |	And this is a murder trial in Wisconsin the victim was a woman named Nicole vanderheyden
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,527	| IOT155 |	And her boyfriend was a suspect but
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:21,087	| IOT155 |	They looked at his Fitbit data and they decided that he didn't do it
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,879	| IOT155 |	However
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,183	| IOT155 |	They found this other guy who apparently
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:28,511	| IOT155 |	Was suspicious sending those data from his Google Dashboard
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,095	| IOT155 |	It placed him at relevant locations
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,119	| IOT155 |	Around her death
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,447	| IOT155 |	And they also looked at his search history which is not
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,983	| IOT155 |	New and
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,567	| IOT155 |	The woman who is murdered actually had snapshot which is
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| IOT155 |	Connected car devices
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,639	| IOT155 |	Progressive Insurance
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,663	| IOT155 |	And
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,943	| IOT155 |	They use that to
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,991	| IOT155 |	Please her whereabouts prior to the murder
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:52,063	| IOT155 |	The attorneys noted that this was not
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,831	| IOT155 |	Direct
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,623	| IOT155 |	Cooperative
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,135	| IOT155 |	In
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,951	| IOT155 |	Yeah but it's still a little scary so
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:03,071	| IOT155 |	Yeah it is scary. I will talk a bit later about some probative evidence that I gathered
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,863	| IOT155 |	For an issue at my house
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,631	| IOT155 |	But
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:11,263	| IOT155 |	You know we talked about how these types of devices that data goes into the cloud the
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| IOT155 |	Companies
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:17,663	| IOT155 |	Yeah that the Privacy policies but they're going to comply with local laws and and subpoenas and so on and so forth and
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:24,063	| IOT155 |	I don't think it's going to stop people from wearing smart watches fitbit's talk into their Echoes and so on
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:28,415	| IOT155 |	But we need to be aware we is as consumers need to be aware that
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:33,535	| IOT155 |	Even if you're not cortical giving up your privacy with these devices it still can be used against you
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:38,143	| IOT155 |	Yes and he suggested that lawyers actually asked
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:43,775	| IOT155 |	Consumers what iot devices they have when talking to them so they can understand the possibility of
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,847	| IOT155 |	Evidence basically what could you come out against you
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,687	| IOT155 |	And they also said that this might lead to a new class of
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,967	| IOT155 |	Expert Witnesses
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:57,855	| IOT155 |	Where people can be disputing like how accurate is the Fitbit data I don't know which that could be fun as well
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:04,511	| IOT155 |	That's a someone I don't plan on committing inverter anytime soon
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| IOT155 |	Whatever
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,583	| IOT155 |	Let's be clear
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:14,751	| IOT155 |	But it is a little disconcerting because as a journalist I'm not doing anything
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,311	| IOT155 |	Controversial now but what if I
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,335	| IOT155 |	Decided to get into some
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:22,687	| IOT155 |	Controversial I think my iot devices might be the first things out the window in that case
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,015	| IOT155 |	Keep this in mind privacy fans
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:31,391	| IOT155 |	We got a new type of edge Computing out there cloudflare which is a security company
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:34,975	| IOT155 |	They help protect against DDOS attacks that was there
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,743	| IOT155 |	Original
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,511	| IOT155 |	Incarnation
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,839	| IOT155 |	Now because they have such a massive network of
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| IOT155 |	Edge
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:47,007	| IOT155 |	They call it Edge devices Edge servers there really more like Edge in the sense of a CDN being an edge they're not
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| IOT155 |	The edge
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,543	| IOT155 |	Of
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:53,919	| IOT155 |	Like a little tiny nose and sensors
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,711	| IOT155 |	But they're actually offering
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,991	| IOT155 |	Shooting
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,271	| IOT155 |	At their Edge
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,295	| IOT155 |	Which
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:03,647	| IOT155 |	Pretty compelling it'll be deployed at there at just called cloud
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| IOT155 |	Workers in
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:08,767	| IOT155 |	I bring this up mostly because it's a cool offering but
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:13,375	| IOT155 |	It really drives home the point that not everything is going to happen in the
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:16,191	| IOT155 |	Cloud when it comes to the Internet of Things
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,215	| IOT155 |	It can't
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:18,751	| IOT155 |	We talked about this a lot
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| IOT155 |	But it's worth bringing up
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| IOT155 |	One more time
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| IOT155 |	And this is also
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:27,455	| IOT155 |	Very similar to what the telcos are trying to offer with their Edge computing
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,503	| IOT155 |	Efforts which is at the edge of the telconet
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:33,343	| IOT155 |	So you can kind of look at those as parallels
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,111	| IOT155 |	And
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,135	| IOT155 |	You know I would
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:40,511	| IOT155 |	This is kind of interesting to me if I were a true developer I'm a newbie developer but
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| IOT155 |	I mean you
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:46,399	| IOT155 |	Mention CDN is just to further explain example like if you watching Netflix
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:50,751	| IOT155 |	You're not watching it from Netflix as main servers they've got servers all over
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,775	| IOT155 |	The world
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:55,103	| IOT155 |	That have the content so you're going to the closest server
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,407	| IOT155 |	What cloudflare is doing is they're putting
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,271	| IOT155 |	JavaScript processing at the edge kind of like Netflix does with its content
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,343	| IOT155 |	So if I'm developing an iot device
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,903	| IOT155 |	I can get to the closest Cloud Player
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,463	| IOT155 |	Server to process things
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,791	| IOT155 |	In a process sensory information in return a result or making action happen
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,607	| IOT155 |	And they claim you know that no latency is like
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:19,167	| IOT155 |	Practically not zero but pretty darn close it's much quicker
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:25,055	| IOT155 |	You don't have the processing on the device you don't have the processing at a centralized cloud storage place
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:28,895	| IOT155 |	But it's all over the place it's kind of interesting from a developer standpoint
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,663	| IOT155 |	I agree
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:33,247	| IOT155 |	It does look to be some smaller developers are complaining about the prices
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,295	| IOT155 |	Because there's a $5
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,623	| IOT155 |	Covers your first 10 million requests and its / domain
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,415	| IOT155 |	So I can see
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,975	| IOT155 |	Okay if you're going to if you're going to have
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,279	| IOT155 |	A massive user base
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:48,351	| IOT155 |	And devices that are doing something all the time with data I
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,911	| IOT155 |	Get that but it was I thought it was actually pretty cheap
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:54,751	| IOT155 |	I think some developed if you have multiple domains this could get
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,263	| IOT155 |	Crazy fast
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,287	| IOT155 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,823	| IOT155 |	So I think that
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| IOT155 |	That's the issue however
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| IOT155 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,479	| IOT155 |	Earth
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,783	| IOT155 |	Let's move to the home for a little bit
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| IOT155 |	Because
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,855	| IOT155 |	Google Assistant routines are now
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:17,279	| IOT155 |	They are live in the US and you may not see them yet I actually do not have an older version of routines in my Google
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:22,911	| IOT155 |	Just an app from what I've seen if you don't have it yet you can go to a Google support page that we are linking to in the show notes
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:29,055	| IOT155 |	I'm a little disappointed because it takes a lot of customization and flexibility out of it
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,847	| IOT155 |	The routines are really
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:36,479	| IOT155 |	Preset 6 different options such as good morning goodnight and so on and so forth
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| IOT155 |	When you configure these in your app
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:41,599	| IOT155 |	You have a set of checkboxes that you can choose from
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,879	| IOT155 |	Siri it's not like you can
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,671	| IOT155 |	Customize completely to your
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,975	| IOT155 |	Needs I don't know I haven't used it yet cuz I don't
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:53,375	| IOT155 |	Haven't yet but I'm a little disappointed by that but you raise a good point Stacy or just here for the show
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:56,959	| IOT155 |	The reason for this
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| IOT155 |	I mean
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| IOT155 |	One of the big
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,567	| IOT155 |	Complaints we've always had about
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:05,151	| IOT155 |	Programming your smartphone is oh my god it feels like programming your smart home
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,735	| IOT155 |	Checking off boxes is far easier than saying
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:12,831	| IOT155 |	Okay when this happens let what should my good night routine be
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,367	| IOT155 |	Is someone suggest things for
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,647	| IOT155 |	It's a lot
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,207	| IOT155 |	True very true
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,487	| IOT155 |	Now I don't have it
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,255	| IOT155 |	Either
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:24,607	| IOT155 |	And I will say if you want to do my suggestion to Kevin was if you want to do
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,143	| IOT155 |	Something super custom
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:29,215	| IOT155 |	Go with shortcuts which is the Google option where you
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,775	| IOT155 |	You say what you want to say and then you
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,799	| IOT155 |	Just tell it what you
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:33,823	| IOT155 |	Wanted to do
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,871	| IOT155 |	The downside there is
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:38,175	| IOT155 |	I have shortcuts that have never run it will never run
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,943	| IOT155 |	Because they don't work
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,991	| IOT155 |	Google doesn't actually tell you
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| IOT155 |	What does work about them
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,575	| IOT155 |	Fixing them is
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:52,511	| IOT155 |	Yeah well and hopefully they'll develop this further expand it no Google Iowa is coming up in May
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,047	| IOT155 |	I really do expect to see a lot of
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:58,399	| IOT155 |	New information features and functionalities on the IRT side from Google
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:00,447	| IOT155 |	I'm going to hope so because
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,471	| IOT155 |	Men Maybe
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,007	| IOT155 |	Maybe we'll get boring Google things
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,079	| IOT155 |	All right
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:12,991	| IOT155 |	Let's do some quick news events fitness app Strava has decided that maybe it shouldn't
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,271	| IOT155 |	Joe Whitesell
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:14,783	| IOT155 |	How much data
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| IOT155 |	You guys might remember
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,879	| IOT155 |	Couple months ago
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,695	| IOT155 |	Strava did is heatmap in
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:27,327	| IOT155 |	Suddenly everyone realize that military bases in other clandestine operations or kind of obvious
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:32,959	| IOT155 |	The areas where there weren't a lot of Strava users and
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,983	| IOT155 |	Yuka's in
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,287	| IOT155 |	Third world countries in the Middle East in
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,335	| IOT155 |	Suddenly you could see o
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:40,127	| IOT155 |	Here's a couple Strava users
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,151	| IOT155 |	Going right here
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,919	| IOT155 |	End
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,431	| IOT155 |	That was no good
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,711	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:45,503	| IOT155 |	Now they have a new version of the heat map
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:50,623	| IOT155 |	And in the bars access to street-level details to anyone except registered Strava users
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,439	| IOT155 |	Right and if you set your
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,487	| IOT155 |	You can do this in the app if you set your mapping to
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| IOT155 |	The private
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,303	| IOT155 |	What they'll do is they're going to wipe those
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| IOT155 |	Private
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:01,119	| IOT155 |	The private data every 30 days
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,959	| IOT155 |	So it won't be a long-term history of this type of information
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:10,079	| IOT155 |	Yes and Roads and trails with little activity will not show up on the revised map until several
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,871	| IOT155 |	Current users upload workouts in that area
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,663	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,175	| IOT155 |	Pretty good
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,199	| IOT155 |	And
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,223	| IOT155 |	It's a step
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,759	| IOT155 |	Latest Apple series
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| IOT155 |	We'll see what happens
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:22,623	| IOT155 |	And you know in the meantime I think the military kind of
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,903	| IOT155 |	Came to a wake up call
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,207	| IOT155 |	Maybe we should check with RP
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,719	| IOT155 |	People are using
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:33,631	| IOT155 |	That would be a shame and very ironic if we got better privacy thanks to
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,143	| IOT155 |	The military
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| IOT155 |	For iot device
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,007	| IOT155 |	Alright other news
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,543	| IOT155 |	Samsung SmartThings
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:41,823	| IOT155 |	Hoof
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,711	| IOT155 |	And well I think it was only in North America so this was not worldwide
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:53,343	| IOT155 |	But it was earlier this week around 2 p.m. eastern time and it lasted
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,135	| IOT155 |	Depends on who you ask
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,951	| IOT155 |	Sun and obviously different users in different areas might have
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,975	| IOT155 |	Experience the
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,023	| IOT155 |	Issuing While others did not as it was being fixed
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,863	| IOT155 |	But to me it looks like the last about 18ich hours and
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:11,263	| IOT155 |	I mean if this happens if I get it there outages for every cloud Base Service
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| IOT155 |	Known to man
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,359	| IOT155 |	People were complaining about Samsung's transparency
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,919	| IOT155 |	The other issue this raises is
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:23,551	| IOT155 |	You know with everything being done not everything but a lot of things being done in the cloud for iot
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,855	| IOT155 |	That's a chokepoint that's a problem and
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,647	| IOT155 |	SmartThings outside some local
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,207	| IOT155 |	Things that can run Onyx Hub as does wink
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| IOT155 |	But it really
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,279	| IOT155 |	Priests of the question
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:36,863	| IOT155 |	To me of you do we need hugs and why I think we do
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:40,447	| IOT155 |	And I made a case for Google to actually make its own Hub earlier in the week
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,495	| IOT155 |	I got some interesting responses from that
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,799	| IOT155 |	Some people said hubs are just hacks because
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:48,127	| IOT155 |	That you know people are using standards but I don't I don't agree with that at
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,663	| IOT155 |	Hubs will help
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:53,247	| IOT155 |	Bridge different radio protocols for examples that are using standard
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:57,855	| IOT155 |	I hope so also have the processing power and stores to actually
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,879	| IOT155 |	Store your
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,391	| IOT155 |	Automation
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:05,023	| IOT155 |	Things like that and when I said that's the cloud for that and I said
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,559	| IOT155 |	So well that works so
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,351	| IOT155 |	I think we still need hubs
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:11,423	| IOT155 |	I don't know what you think Stacy but I think is a good example of why
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:14,495	| IOT155 |	I think it's ironic that you of all people
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,775	| IOT155 |	To hate hugs
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,287	| IOT155 |	In bridges
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,567	| IOT155 |	Baidu
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,591	| IOT155 |	Blackmore hubs
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,895	| IOT155 |	But no I only want one
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,967	| IOT155 |	That's the thing I don't want multiple hubs
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,807	| IOT155 |	I'm happy with what I've got a wink of I'm happy with having one
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:30,111	| IOT155 |	1 is fine as long as it works with all my devices
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| IOT155 |	But
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:35,487	| IOT155 |	To get rid of it completely there are ways to do that but it's a challenge
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:39,839	| IOT155 |	I am I in the conversations I have with people on this is all on Twitter and Google Plus I said
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:43,167	| IOT155 |	So you want every device available talk to every device
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:46,239	| IOT155 |	How does one device know what devices I have in the house
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,519	| IOT155 |	Does every developer
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:53,151	| IOT155 |	How to know about all these other devices that are on the market because once I add one has to talk to that one
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,943	| IOT155 |	So that's a challenge
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,735	| IOT155 |	I think a hub can do the work
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,087	| IOT155 |	I agree I think the challenge we've come up with is
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,135	| IOT155 |	We never built
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,415	| IOT155 |	Standards for the internet
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:09,791	| IOT155 |	We have yet to do it everyone instead decided to build their own standard
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:15,167	| IOT155 |	And so what we've got are these little silos of information works with programs and
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:18,495	| IOT155 |	We will be there for probably all of time is my feeling
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,031	| IOT155 |	I don't know baby I'm just
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,847	| IOT155 |	Pessimistic so we will need a hug
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| IOT155 |	Given the way the world
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,151	| IOT155 |	His evolved
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,919	| IOT155 |	Didn't have to evolve
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| IOT155 |	Chopra
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:34,111	| IOT155 |	Here we are all right should we talk about all the new toys out on the market yeah let's do that I'll take the first one
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,671	| IOT155 |	Because I got me excited there's a new Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,439	| IOT155 |	Pi
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,255	| IOT155 |	The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:44,351	| IOT155 |	It is on sale for $35 which of the same price as the old
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| IOT155 |	Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,143	| IOT155 |	3B
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:52,287	| IOT155 |	What's new here is Nevada dual band wireless so you have a tour to 11 AC
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:56,383	| IOT155 |	Both in 2.4 and 5 gigahertz you got Bluetooth 4.2
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,151	| IOT155 |	You've got
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,431	| IOT155 |	Gigabit Ethernet
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:03,295	| IOT155 |	Now and also if you add on a module I don't want the prices going to be
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,111	| IOT155 |	You will get power over ethernet support
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,391	| IOT155 |	What you want to ask about a second
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,463	| IOT155 |	What else do they have I think those are the main things
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:12,255	| IOT155 |	So I guess I'll just ask her right now
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:18,399	| IOT155 |	Power-over-ethernet why should people be excited over that way this Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,679	| IOT155 |	Pro community
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,983	| IOT155 |	Power-over-ethernet is something
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,055	| IOT155 |	That Pro installers of consumer electronics
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,847	| IOT155 |	Usually ask for
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:28,639	| IOT155 |	Because it's more reliable
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,967	| IOT155 |	Get your doorbell cam it's faster
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,735	| IOT155 |	Until
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,759	| IOT155 |	Cameras
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,831	| IOT155 |	Doorbell cams those are kind of the things that end up going on
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,647	| IOT155 |	Also alarm type systems
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,207	| IOT155 |	So I would think that if you were
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,999	| IOT155 |	Interested in building
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,535	| IOT155 |	Something custom
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:51,423	| IOT155 |	That has that kind of reliability this would be an awesome thing for you so I think it's actually a really interesting
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,191	| IOT155 |	Option for
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,215	| IOT155 |	People who are interested but smart
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,263	| IOT155 |	I agree
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,799	| IOT155 |	So that is the new
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,895	| IOT155 |	Which by the way we are recording this on Wednesday which is Pi Day
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:03,199	| IOT155 |	Yes it is Happy Pi Day
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,783	| IOT155 |	Next item
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,063	| IOT155 |	Is actually one of our
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| IOT155 |	Listeners
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:11,647	| IOT155 |	Brought this to my attention it is the Abode
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,927	| IOT155 |	Iota
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,487	| IOT155 |	And this is a
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,279	| IOT155 |	I'm just going to call it a canary like device that
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,815	| IOT155 |	Is built for the Abode
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:22,143	| IOT155 |	System so upload is a security system
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,703	| IOT155 |	I've had several people
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:27,263	| IOT155 |	Talk to me about this and they love their boat systems
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:31,871	| IOT155 |	It's about a $300 initial install it's a Gateway and sensors and all this other
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,175	| IOT155 |	It's super easy to use
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,455	| IOT155 |	What they've done now
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,735	| IOT155 |	Is they've created a
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,759	| IOT155 |	Camera device
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:41,087	| IOT155 |	With sensors that you just plug in and it acts as a gateway
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,903	| IOT155 |	You can use it with your existing about stuff
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,719	| IOT155 |	But I think this is actually to get to the
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:51,583	| IOT155 |	The rental market the layperson who's like
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,863	| IOT155 |	Checking out something fancier
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:56,191	| IOT155 |	Involved so this is like hey there's a camera
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,959	| IOT155 |	Funk it down
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,287	| IOT155 |	If you want to get fancy or you can start buying some sensors
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,359	| IOT155 |	Works with zigbee Z-Wave
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,127	| IOT155 |	And
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,663	| IOT155 |	I'm actually kind of excited
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,455	| IOT155 |	It's $329 which is Kai
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,015	| IOT155 |	Anniversary
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,551	| IOT155 |	It's not out yet
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,087	| IOT155 |	It will ship sometime
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,879	| IOT155 |	They say the first quarter of 2018
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,159	| IOT155 |	No matches
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,048	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:26,656	| IOT155 |	Yeah I just thought this was a really interesting device I may actually try to
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,424	| IOT155 |	Pick one up to play with
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:31,520	| IOT155 |	I wanted to try out the original Abode security
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| IOT155 |	Based on all the positive feedback that I have gotten about it
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| IOT155 |	But I never did
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:38,176	| IOT155 |	Security systems are not sending a
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,248	| IOT155 |	I'm probably boring these
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,016	| IOT155 |	Chunk it down
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:42,528	| IOT155 |	Forget about it
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:50,464	| IOT155 |	It's some folks might be excited about this as opposed to the canary because this has a MicroSD card slot as well.
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,488	| IOT155 |	Presumably
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:55,328	| IOT155 |	Not everything has to go to the cloud or could be at least retrieve and stored
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,352	| IOT155 |	Locally so
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,400	| IOT155 |	That may be of interest to folks
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,424	| IOT155 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,704	| IOT155 |	All right
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:04,800	| IOT155 |	There's also a brand new light switch out
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,312	| IOT155 |	Switch
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| IOT155 |	It has
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,152	| IOT155 |	A motion sensor and Madame a
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:11,456	| IOT155 |	You guys are probably familiar with ecobee
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,224	| IOT155 |	Cuz
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,248	| IOT155 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,528	| IOT155 |	It makes a thermostat
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:15,808	| IOT155 |	Including one
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,856	| IOT155 |	Now it's just moving into light switch
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:19,136	| IOT155 |	Send I have a theory is
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:20,672	| IOT155 |	Would you like
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,464	| IOT155 |	I would I would love to hear
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,744	| IOT155 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:28,864	| IOT155 |	Light switches are ubiquitous in your room if you want to get good presence detection
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,912	| IOT155 |	Having a light switch with a motion sensor
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,192	| IOT155 |	And
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,216	| IOT155 |	T-shirt matamata
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:35,520	| IOT155 |	Great is a great way to go about
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,544	| IOT155 |	Because
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:38,592	| IOT155 |	Again light switches every room
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,616	| IOT155 |	They have power
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:44,992	| IOT155 |	They are in a compact form factor so if you really hate the idea
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,504	| IOT155 |	You don't have a nose
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,040	| IOT155 |	Hockey pucks everywhere
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| IOT155 |	You don't have to
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,088	| IOT155 |	Just be like
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:54,208	| IOT155 |	I am getting one to review so I'll let you know things like hay
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,000	| IOT155 |	Does it really work
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,048	| IOT155 |	Something in your wall and talking to it
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,584	| IOT155 |	And getting response
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT155 |	Dancer
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,632	| IOT155 |	May surprise us
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,656	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:08,288	| IOT155 |	I thought this was interesting ecobee did just recently get 61 million dollars in funding including
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,056	| IOT155 |	More from the
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,848	| IOT155 |	Man of a fund
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:11,872	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:12,896	| IOT155 |	This makes a lot of
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:18,528	| IOT155 |	Yeah interesting although matinee has built-in as one would expect since they built into the
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,320	| IOT155 |	Tend to their last thermostat
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:23,648	| IOT155 |	Just like the ecobees recent visit work with homekit
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:26,720	| IOT155 |	Also works with Google Assistant SmartThings and
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,488	| IOT155 |	EFT
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:33,120	| IOT155 |	So it's don't feel like it's an Amazon only kind of thing that you could
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,656	| IOT155 |	Use this if your
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,704	| IOT155 |	Not using Echoes for example
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,752	| IOT155 |	Yes now it is $99
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,288	| IOT155 |	Switch has a lot to pay for a light
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:47,456	| IOT155 |	Well you're getting a light switch getting motion sensor that can automatically activate that light and you're also getting
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,992	| IOT155 |	If it's important
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,528	| IOT155 |	And you can have that in every room
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:52,576	| IOT155 |	And this fact when I saw this
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,112	| IOT155 |	It reminded me
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,648	| IOT155 |	Again to harp on this
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,976	| IOT155 |	When is NVIDIA coming out with their little
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:05,376	| IOT155 |	Google Assistant microphone and speakers that you just supposed to plug in every room of your house that was to see Elsa's ago
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,424	| IOT155 |	14 months ago
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,448	| IOT155 |	Another
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:12,032	| IOT155 |	Cuz that's what this does is that in the speaker and the microphone to every room
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,080	| IOT155 |	Maybe they're busy
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,104	| IOT155 |	Making chips
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,920	| IOT155 |	It's for cryptocurrency mining I don't know
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,712	| IOT155 |	But that's probably more profitable
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:21,504	| IOT155 |	All of the market sound but still
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:27,136	| IOT155 |	I'm very upset that there's been no news on that but so this appeals to me for the same reasons actually and I'm not a light switch
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| IOT155 |	Guy on my balls
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,208	| IOT155 |	But I am interested
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,256	| IOT155 |	Maybe I should send a
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,840	| IOT155 |	I should also mention that it does.
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,656	| IOT155 |	And humidity relief
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,496	| IOT155 |	There are some
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,032	| IOT155 |	Constraints to this one
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| IOT155 |	It will not work
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,640	| IOT155 |	The 3 way switches which means wherever you have
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,664	| IOT155 |	Multiple switches that
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,432	| IOT155 |	Control
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:53,504	| IOT155 |	One light will also need a neutral wire
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:03,232	| IOT155 |	Shop and it works with LED and CFL lights and also
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:03,744	| IOT155 |	At work with that
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,048	| IOT155 |	And then it works with incandescent light
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,864	| IOT155 |	There you go
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,376	| IOT155 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,424	| IOT155 |	I'm looking to see if it's a dimmer
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:15,520	| IOT155 |	Because it works with CFLs I wonder
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:20,896	| IOT155 |	Yeah I don't see that it's it doesn't say that it's a dimmer I just see on off so it may not be a dimmer
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| IOT155 |	And if that's the case
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| IOT155 |	That may or may not
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,552	| IOT155 |	Right
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:30,112	| IOT155 |	And we have this week
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,392	| IOT155 |	It is
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,416	| IOT155 |	The rachio
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,464	| IOT155 |	3rd generation
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:34,976	| IOT155 |	Sprinkler
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:38,304	| IOT155 |	And rachio smart Sprinkler Company
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,608	| IOT155 |	You actually install this at your
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,912	| IOT155 |	Where your sprinkler brains live
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:47,008	| IOT155 |	And it controls things and you can control stuff from your phone
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:50,848	| IOT155 |	They had talked about adding soil moisture sensors
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:53,920	| IOT155 |	That process is still incredibly complicated so I
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:26:01,088	| IOT155 |	Now they have the rachio 3 smart sprinkler controller and rachio 3 wireless flow meter
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,368	| IOT155 |	And fees
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:04,928	| IOT155 |	Will sell for 249
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:07,488	| IOT155 |	The irrigation of things is not cheap
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:13,120	| IOT155 |	Nowell the actually I think the second generation was about that much
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:17,728	| IOT155 |	Much my father-in-law actually installed one and has it and he loves it
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,264	| IOT155 |	He thinks it's just fantastic
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| IOT155 |	AC is not
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:23,360	| IOT155 |	He is not perhaps the most sophisticated smart
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,384	| IOT155 |	We did
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,944	| IOT155 |	Tie it to a Nifty integration for
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,480	| IOT155 |	For weather but that was about it
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,760	| IOT155 |	And he was just kind of
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,552	| IOT155 |	I think I made it
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:37,696	| IOT155 |	Now the insulation of supposedly easier there's 5 gigahertz wireless
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,720	| IOT155 |	Compatibility and
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:44,096	| IOT155 |	A new long-range radio to connect with the first-ever residential wireless flow meter
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:47,936	| IOT155 |	So basically this tells you how much water is being
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:51,264	| IOT155 |	Used and it will detect when leaks happen
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,544	| IOT155 |	And it shuts down your water supply
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:56,896	| IOT155 |	This is really important cuz sprinkler leaks happen all the darn time
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,176	| IOT155 |	And you don't know about it
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:01,760	| IOT155 |	And you're just like unless you get a swampy patch on your ground to your like
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| IOT155 |	So this is really important
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:10,208	| IOT155 |	Is fits within roggio's whole we want to save the Earth by using less water effort
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,976	| IOT155 |	And
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,256	| IOT155 |	Also I mean
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:15,072	| IOT155 |	I helped them install it the second generation
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:15,840	| IOT155 |	It was easy
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:20,448	| IOT155 |	The biggest challenge actually for us was getting wifi to the garage
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:23,264	| IOT155 |	And once that was taken care of we were all good
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,592	| IOT155 |	Pre-order
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,896	| IOT155 |	And like I said it was 249
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,664	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:31,200	| IOT155 |	249 99
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,480	| IOT155 |	Hookah
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,808	| IOT155 |	That is all the new toys out this week
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,600	| IOT155 |	Well it may not be all of them
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,880	| IOT155 |	Those are the ones we saw
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:39,904	| IOT155 |	And got excited
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:43,744	| IOT155 |	Yeah one of my old toys actually help me out big-time this week
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,792	| IOT155 |	Tell me more Kevin
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:49,888	| IOT155 |	So I won't get into all the details but essentially we woke up
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,680	| IOT155 |	Late last week
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:56,800	| IOT155 |	I guess was Friday and my wife went to her car which is parked on the street and our townhouses complex
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,592	| IOT155 |	Inside big tent
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,128	| IOT155 |	And scrape in her vehicle
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:05,760	| IOT155 |	And lots of Parts all over the ground not from our car but obviously from another car
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:09,088	| IOT155 |	And nobody left a note or anything but somebody hit the car
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:15,488	| IOT155 |	So I went back and scoured all of my Nest cam footage cuz I have an indoor Nest cam
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:18,304	| IOT155 |	Winking Outdoors since we're not allowed to have outdoor cameras
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,840	| IOT155 |	And sure enough
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:23,680	| IOT155 |	At 6:11 p.m. the night before
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,728	| IOT155 |	We saw a neighbor pull out of their driveway Quest
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:29,056	| IOT155 |	Street and back into our car so I got the evidence
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:34,176	| IOT155 |	I work with the local authorities and talked to the neighbor who isn't really
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:34,944	| IOT155 |	Sure that she
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,224	| IOT155 |	AR car
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:38,272	| IOT155 |	She thinks somebody hit her car but
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:38,784	| IOT155 |	Saturday
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,320	| IOT155 |	Whatever hot
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,368	| IOT155 |	No big deal she doesn't have video and I do so
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:48,768	| IOT155 |	Yeah we're using that Nest video footage with the police and also our insurance agency so big help right there
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,560	| IOT155 |	Well there you go and
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,656	| IOT155 |	Clear desk purchase has
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:59,776	| IOT155 |	If they claim is covered by their insurance company
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,288	| IOT155 |	And then some
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,104	| IOT155 |	Okay and Kevin
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:07,968	| IOT155 |	Kevin took a trip on the dark side we were talking about it this morning
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:11,040	| IOT155 |	About this the story I'm sure many of you saw it
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:13,344	| IOT155 |	But it was MIT technology review
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:13,856	| IOT155 |	Road about
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,160	| IOT155 |	Is a y combinator startup
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:18,720	| IOT155 |	Can you upload your
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,512	| IOT155 |	Yourself
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:23,328	| IOT155 |	But it is 100% fatal and
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:29,728	| IOT155 |	This is Freaky Deaky what the heck does this have to do with the internet of things other than
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:32,032	| IOT155 |	You're right other than its
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,592	| IOT155 |	Just to clarify the startup
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:39,712	| IOT155 |	Is preserving brains for the moment that's what they're going to do with the hopes of actually
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:42,272	| IOT155 |	Being able to upload all of them
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,576	| IOT155 |	All of you in the future
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| IOT155 |	And the reason they
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,184	| IOT155 |	This is fatal is because they have to keep your brain Preserve
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,256	| IOT155 |	And alive so to speak so you kind of pretty much got to be dead
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:53,792	| IOT155 |	That's one
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,328	| IOT155 |	Whole freaking out about it but
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,632	| IOT155 |	Normally I wouldn't even brought this up
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:58,912	| IOT155 |	But
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:04,288	| IOT155 |	You said something pretty profound once before on the show how many times but in particular
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:09,152	| IOT155 |	You would said once your data is uploaded to the cloud or company etcetera
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,712	| IOT155 |	You don't control what they do with it
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:14,784	| IOT155 |	And I thought about that as it applies to this and if
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:19,648	| IOT155 |	Date this company actually does succeed and I'm not saying they will but what if they did
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:23,488	| IOT155 |	My entire brain data would be
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,768	| IOT155 |	In their hands
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:28,352	| IOT155 |	What would be done with it I got no control over cuz I'm already
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,120	| IOT155 |	Ted
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,400	| IOT155 |	And that's really scary
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,192	| IOT155 |	Yep
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:34,240	| IOT155 |	Alright so now none of us are going to sleep tonight
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:40,128	| IOT155 |	And I'm sorry
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:40,640	| IOT155 |	I lied to
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,688	| IOT155 |	Because we're actually going to end the note
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,456	| IOT155 |	On one of our

EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,072	| IOT155 |	We do get lots of email question
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,352	| IOT155 |	So we took one of those
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:04,960	| IOT155 |	Fantasy podcast listener hotline is brought to you by Schlage maker of electronic

EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:20,064	| IOT155 |	Email
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:20,832	| IOT155 |	Not hot
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:24,416	| IOT155 |	Michael
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:24,928	| IOT155 |	Ask
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:31,840	| IOT155 |	What are the best books to read are other forms of information I can learn from for someone who is new to the world of iOS
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,864	| IOT155 |	Multi sensors
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:37,728	| IOT155 |	1 Starter book would be great but also a few follow-up resources that will take me from learning the basics
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,264	| IOT155 |	Like an introductory book
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,312	| IOT155 |	To having a good understanding would be
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,920	| IOT155 |	Depends on what you want to do I think
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,968	| IOT155 |	And I say that because if you
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:53,088	| IOT155 |	The center that you can purchase today that work with iot hubs and such
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:57,440	| IOT155 |	Are pretty easy to use pretty easy to install and so on so forth
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:02,304	| IOT155 |	However do you want to learn how these things work and make them work yourself
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| IOT155 |	I would do one of
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:07,168	| IOT155 |	Two things I know you got some recommendation Stacey but
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:10,496	| IOT155 |	I would get an Arduino kit and some sensors
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,264	| IOT155 |	Very simple
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:13,056	| IOT155 |	Sensors could even be buttons
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,872	| IOT155 |	And walk through some of the
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:17,920	| IOT155 |	Step by step instructions on how to make them work
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,200	| IOT155 |	Literally
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:23,808	| IOT155 |	Make magazine is a great resource and actually have a book it's a little dated
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:27,648	| IOT155 |	But they have a book from 2011 called getting started with the Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:33,280	| IOT155 |	And they will walk you through either using a pi or Arduino board and some sensors to
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:37,632	| IOT155 |	Literally make events trigger events and make things happen so that's that's
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,912	| IOT155 |	One thing I would look at
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:42,240	| IOT155 |	Do you have any other thoughts depending on how
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:44,288	| IOT155 |	How advanced you want to
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:47,616	| IOT155 |	Just to get a feel for this if you have sensors
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:53,248	| IOT155 |	I always agree this is actually what I do with my own daughter is I just take sensors and light bulbs
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,528	| IOT155 |	And I
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:56,576	| IOT155 |	Hook them up together via if
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:33:00,416	| IOT155 |	Or via the SmartThings Hub gift is beneficial because it's it does
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,184	| IOT155 |	Does it cost money
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:03,488	| IOT155 |	We just show what happens when you trigger thing
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,024	| IOT155 |	Thanks right so that's
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:09,120	| IOT155 |	One option the other option is if you want to get a little fancier this actually works
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,656	| IOT155 |	4 kids and I'm not trying to insult you
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,472	| IOT155 |	I actually use it this way to is little bit
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:15,776	| IOT155 |	If you buy a little bit
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,056	| IOT155 |	Can you get
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:20,640	| IOT155 |	A lot of sense or so if the idea of an Arduino scares you and it should
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:24,224	| IOT155 |	Some people do get scared with arduinos
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:26,272	| IOT155 |	Start with a little bit skid and
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,808	| IOT155 |	You can do it meme
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:30,624	| IOT155 |	You can pick them thermostats with those things
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:34,208	| IOT155 |	They're very capable devices starter sets of devices absolutely
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:38,048	| IOT155 |	And the other resource I would offer to you is 8A fruits website
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:40,608	| IOT155 |	So it's a d a f r
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,376	| IOT155 |	Uit
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:45,728	| IOT155 |	And they have if you go into their learn section
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:48,800	| IOT155 |	You will see so many
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:52,384	| IOT155 |	Products and they're really what the lessons that they have
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,920	| IOT155 |	Explain what's happening
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:56,224	| IOT155 |	Explain how to do it and you can buy like
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,504	| IOT155 |	The kit to get started
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,296	| IOT155 |	So this is a great way
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,576	| IOT155 |	To just
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,856	| IOT155 |	Start playing with Hardware
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,136	| IOT155 |	If that's
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:03,904	| IOT155 |	What's interesting
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,440	| IOT155 |	So sensors is a huge cat
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:07,488	| IOT155 |	Like I don't know if he wants
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:12,352	| IOT155 |	Like Arduino level stuff or if he's just like hey I want to play with my life
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:18,240	| IOT155 |	So this should get you started I wish I wish there were like a book that was really compelling but
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,520	| IOT155 |	I so far haven't really
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| IOT155 |	Found one
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:20,800	| IOT155 |	So
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,336	| IOT155 |	I would say
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,616	| IOT155 |	Start with those kind
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,152	| IOT155 |	Those are good resources to start
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,432	| IOT155 |	I agree
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:28,480	| IOT155 |	Okay and now
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,504	| IOT155 |	We shall
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:32,832	| IOT155 |	Hear message from our sponsor and then go to our
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:35,392	| IOT155 |	Guest this week's guest is Toby Mena
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,160	| IOT155 |	From
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,464	| IOT155 |	Bayer Ag and we're talkin about
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,280	| IOT155 |	Agriculture in The Internet of Things in
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:45,120	| IOT155 |	He's got some great startups that he talks about he talks about
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,704	| IOT155 |	Building a new business model for iot and he talks about using lighter
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,496	| IOT155 |	What attract insects
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:54,848	| IOT155 |	So you're going to want to stay tuned because it's pretty cool
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:35:00,992	| IOT155 |	Everyone we're taking a break from The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor sponsor is Samsung
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:05,344	| IOT155 |	Can I have John Jefferies head of iot marketing for Samsung artik
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:07,904	| IOT155 |	How to talk to us about how they handle security
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,464	| IOT155 |	Remind us of what Samsung artik does
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:10,976	| IOT155 |	To focus on
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,280	| IOT155 |	Samsung artik provides
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,816	| IOT155 |	Comprehensive security
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:15,840	| IOT155 |	From the edge
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:16,608	| IOT155 |	To the cloud
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,632	| IOT155 |	R modules
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,912	| IOT155 |	Numerous
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:21,216	| IOT155 |	Security and safety features built into them
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:26,080	| IOT155 |	And they are also tied to the SmartThings passed through mutual Authentication
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,872	| IOT155 |	Last week we talked about as much
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:32,736	| IOT155 |	Trustmark for iot devices
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:36,320	| IOT155 |	That idea comes from both the work that
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,856	| IOT155 |	Underwriters lab is doing
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:44,000	| IOT155 |	And what I saw at CES I noticed at CES this year many of the OT devices were sporting
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:47,072	| IOT155 |	Works with Alexa
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:49,888	| IOT155 |	Under boxes I think that consumers would benefit
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:54,240	| IOT155 |	By looking at the boxes if the devices that they're buying where infection cure
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,288	| IOT155 |	And one of the things you talked about was
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,824	| IOT155 |	Securing over the air update
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,616	| IOT155 |	Why is this important
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:04,224	| IOT155 |	Well Stacy this is important to me because the very first iot devices I bought
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:07,296	| IOT155 |	I've thrown away because they were not upgradeable
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,064	| IOT155 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:08,832	| IOT155 |	And
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,368	| IOT155 |	With over the air updates
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:12,160	| IOT155 |	What do you need to do to make sure that there's
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:18,304	| IOT155 |	Daisy over there updates are more complicated than they sound soccer package itself needs to be created sign
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,840	| IOT155 |	Protected by the manufacturer
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,120	| IOT155 |	Send a message to be sent
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:24,704	| IOT155 |	Received in a secure Manner and once it's finally deliver to the device
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,008	| IOT155 |	The device itself needs to verify
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:29,312	| IOT155 |	That it was signed by an aesthetic
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,848	| IOT155 |	Creator of a software
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,128	| IOT155 |	The manufacturer that device
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:36,224	| IOT155 |	Let's say an OTF isn't secure what are the risks that that
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:39,040	| IOT155 |	Until what are several points of risk
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:39,808	| IOT155 |	Stacy
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,832	| IOT155 |	Even when the
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:42,112	| IOT155 |	Software packages in motion
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:46,208	| IOT155 |	If the implementation of SSL or TLS
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:49,792	| IOT155 |	Doesn't include for privacy ideas lesson 1.2
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:52,608	| IOT155 |	It's acceptable to eavesdropping it by man in Middle attack
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:57,216	| IOT155 |	So in addition to the concerns about authenticity and integrity of the software package
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,520	| IOT155 |	There's also risk of a downgrade attack
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:03,104	| IOT155 |	When older authenticated software update can be rolled back
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:08,224	| IOT155 |	Enabling vulnerable versions of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth protocols
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:08,992	| IOT155 |	That were
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:10,272	| IOT155 |	Officially sign
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,064	| IOT155 |	Yet are still vulnerable
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,600	| IOT155 |	At a fundamental level
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:16,416	| IOT155 |	Manufacturers should ensure the authenticity and integrity of
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:19,744	| IOT155 |	If there's no way to verify that there's no way of
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,256	| IOT155 |	Verifying
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:22,304	| IOT155 |	Sadness after you received
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:25,888	| IOT155 |	And just upgraded your new iot device to is in fact
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:26,656	| IOT155 |	Genuine
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:27,424	| IOT155 |	And created by the Minnesota
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,752	| IOT155 |	That all sounds great and a little scary so
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:34,848	| IOT155 |	If you want to learn more about what Samsung are takes doing on the security

EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:24,224	| IOT155 |	Turn out to be more strict than we expected because depending on what incited
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,528	| IOT155 |	Frequency is slightly changing
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:30,624	| IOT155 |	To Ephrata Library
