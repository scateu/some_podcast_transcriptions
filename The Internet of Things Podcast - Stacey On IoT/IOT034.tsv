EDL	00:00:17,920	00:00:18,688	| IOT034 |	End
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:24,832	| IOT034 |	Today we have actually a lot of news we have a brand new smart home from Lowe's we have an update to the Bluetooth
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:28,672	| IOT034 |	And we have some fun kind of new devices on sale in
EDL	00:00:29,184	00:00:32,512	| IOT034 |	In various places including a new night light so
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:34,816	| IOT034 |	Let's get started we'll start with d
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:37,632	| IOT034 |	The launch of the second generation Lowe's
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:38,656	| IOT034 |	Iris
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:40,704	| IOT034 |	Which
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:44,288	| IOT034 |	To be honest I have yet to try out because I'm actually heading
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:46,592	| IOT034 |	I guess I should say I'm heading out of town because by the time
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:48,640	| IOT034 |	Y'all hear this I will be almost back
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:52,224	| IOT034 |	And I hadn't had a chance to try it out yet so I was like
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:53,248	| IOT034 |	Like hold a review for a minute
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:56,832	| IOT034 |	Did want to talk about it because Lowe's
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:57,856	| IOT034 |	Has actually been
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:00,416	| IOT034 |	Really prescient in the space
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:06,816	| IOT034 |	DIY retailer you guys are probably familiar with it they launched the iris platform back in 20
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:07,584	| IOT034 |	12
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:10,400	| IOT034 |	Which is way before you know smart things and
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:13,472	| IOT034 |	Revolve if you guys remember the revolve home automation hub
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:15,008	| IOT034 |	And other things rather
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,800	| IOT034 |	It was ahead of its time
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,080	| IOT034 |	For what it offered at the time
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:22,176	| IOT034 |	It did and when I reviewed the original Iris I dinged it because
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:24,736	| IOT034 |	Cuz it had well a couple reasons it had it
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:27,040	| IOT034 |	First off it came with a
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:28,064	| IOT034 |	Premium
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:29,856	| IOT034 |	And another it came with it
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,624	| IOT034 |	Three-tiered
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:33,440	| IOT034 |	Subscription plans I had a free version
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| IOT034 |	A
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,488	| IOT034 |	Medium version and then
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:36,768	| IOT034 |	Premium version
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:39,072	| IOT034 |	The new version has
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,096	| IOT034 |	A two-tier plan which
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:40,608	| IOT034 |	What is Friant
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:44,448	| IOT034 |	I didn't like the idea of having a DIY system that also had a
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,216	| IOT034 |	Subscription fee
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:45,984	| IOT034 |	But you know what
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,544	| IOT034 |	That's the bottle everyone is actually turning to
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:55,712	| IOT034 |	The other thing it had its hub actually had both a backup battery at the time and the option to
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,992	| IOT034 |	Papa cellular modem in
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,320	| IOT034 |	Which is something that SmartThings is actually doing now
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,880	| IOT034 |	But I expect to see that for a lot of other
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:06,464	| IOT034 |	Hubs to make the best of it more resilient the SmartThings option is
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,048	| IOT034 |	It's an integrated option I assume you don't put in a plug in a modem or anything
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,584	| IOT034 |	I believe you actually
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,608	| IOT034 |	2/2
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:17,216	| IOT034 |	The original SmartThings didn't have the backup battery out
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:21,056	| IOT034 |	Which is important
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:23,104	| IOT034 |	I don't recall it what the original price
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:26,688	| IOT034 |	Of the iris Hub was but now I think it's $59
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,224	| IOT034 |	The original price was $99
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:33,088	| IOT034 |	Current price for the new version is 5999
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| IOT034 |	Which puts it
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,928	| IOT034 |	Very close just $10 more than the wink hub
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,976	| IOT034 |	Which is what those rifle
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,280	| IOT034 |	So
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,304	| IOT034 |	The other thing
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,328	| IOT034 |	The big difference
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,864	| IOT034 |	For the lowest version
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,888	| IOT034 |	Github
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,936	| IOT034 |	I guess so kind of will lay it out for you
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:50,240	| IOT034 |	The Lowe's how is controlled
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,264	| IOT034 |	Bi-Lo's so
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:54,080	| IOT034 |	Lowe's hosts all of it in the
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:56,896	| IOT034 |	In Microsoft Azure so it's hosted by Lowe's
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:59,456	| IOT034 |	They control everything they offer support for it
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,272	| IOT034 |	So this is not like wink was actually
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,552	| IOT034 |	Africa company in
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,088	| IOT034 |	Now it's
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,368	| IOT034 |	Since work is bankrupt
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,648	| IOT034 |	Minkus on the market
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:11,744	| IOT034 |	Flextronics is offered to buy it will stay at the bankruptcy court allows it to
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,048	| IOT034 |	It's a little different setup than most of the other
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,584	| IOT034 |	Jobs out there
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,144	| IOT034 |	So lows also
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,936	| IOT034 |	Has its own branded Gadget
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,472	| IOT034 |	Cats that are Iris branded gacha
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,008	| IOT034 |	Step work with the eye
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,336	| IOT034 |	Lowe's does not bring in
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:27,616	| IOT034 |	Hue light bulb
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:35,040	| IOT034 |	That's what I was going to ask because I've already looked at the new Iris by Lowe's website which does have the new Hub and
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,320	| IOT034 |	Looks like there's a
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:40,160	| IOT034 |	A starter pack for $249 with a bunch of Gadgets in there
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,720	| IOT034 |	But all I see are Iris Brandon
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,792	| IOT034 |	Devices for that so is it not as open as some others
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,096	| IOT034 |	It is not now I
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,400	| IOT034 |	Lowe's does work with
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,192	| IOT034 |	Established vendors to make
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| IOT034 |	Lowe's
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,472	| IOT034 |	Stranded
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| IOT034 |	Versions
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,520	| IOT034 |	Of their products
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,824	| IOT034 |	You're not going to see a Lowe's Brandon Ness
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:02,176	| IOT034 |	But you know they work with centralite they work with
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,248	| IOT034 |	Aaon Tech they work with a lot of these other
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| IOT034 |	Kind of companies that make
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,600	| IOT034 |	You notice the motion sensors that things like that
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:10,880	| IOT034 |	They have connect
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,160	| IOT034 |	Do pet doors connect
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| IOT034 |	Garage door openers
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| IOT034 |	Cameras
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,280	| IOT034 |	A lot of the things you're going to
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,559	| IOT034 |	Want they just
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| IOT034 |	Brandon Iris and then they sell them
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,399	| IOT034 |	For your kind of customer is a few
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,983	| IOT034 |	Play so this isn't for someone who's shopping on Indiegogo or
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| IOT034 |	Kickstarter and
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,055	| IOT034 |	I can't wait to buy the latest gadget
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,359	| IOT034 |	This is for someone who's like
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,687	| IOT034 |	Perusing the aisles of lausanne is like I really want to automate my house
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| IOT034 |	Hey
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:36,479	| IOT034 |	Connected Outlets
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| IOT034 |	Great I'll buy them
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| IOT034 |	Will too limiting for me I think
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,903	| IOT034 |	Is this is probably not for you and I but
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,719	| IOT034 |	If you're like an insteon fan this
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,535	| IOT034 |	Insteon limits you write in
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT034 |	Yeah baby
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,703	| IOT034 |	I got into insteon back in 2010 because there weren't many other options
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,751	| IOT034 |	Since then I got to wait for him because it's not as
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:03,615	| IOT034 |	Open and passed away in current or some other hubs and such so
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| IOT034 |	So so yeah so this is for those
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:10,783	| IOT034 |	So once I have a chance to get it get it in my hands and review it I will say that
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,599	| IOT034 |	One of the other complaints I have when I did the original
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| IOT034 |	Lowe's Iris
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| IOT034 |	Was that it was
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| IOT034 |	Web-based
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,255	| IOT034 |	So they had a web portal
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:25,375	| IOT034 |	But I couldn't do things on my mobile which was really weird to me at the time
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,191	| IOT034 |	Now it seems like they have switched based on
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,751	| IOT034 |	Well they better than iOS
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| IOT034 |	Send Android app
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,335	| IOT034 |	I knew that going in but based on a review that you found cat
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| IOT034 |	It sounds like they may
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,967	| IOT034 |	Gone completely away from their web version
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:46,367	| IOT034 |	That's what it looks like and it's just according to One customer review so you know I can't validate it by any means I don't know
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| IOT034 |	I don't have the
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,927	| IOT034 |	The devices and such here
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,207	| IOT034 |	He had
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:54,303	| IOT034 |	A number of complaints but I'm not going to think it's fair to go through the living that
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,095	| IOT034 |	Is a sub even available yet
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,863	| IOT034 |	Or I guess
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,887	| IOT034 |	They have this available now
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,191	| IOT034 |	As of month
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:03,775	| IOT034 |	I almost don't feel right talking about 1 review but okay
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,359	| IOT034 |	It just you never know it could be one person's experience
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,919	| IOT034 |	I will say that it concerned me that he said
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:12,991	| IOT034 |	It couldn't as a pair of any Z-Wave devices but as we just said
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,271	| IOT034 |	You know
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,831	| IOT034 |	It's the iris ecosystem so
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,415	| IOT034 |	Maybe it's even trying to take non Iris devices
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,183	| IOT034 |	I don't know
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:25,791	| IOT034 |	His version one key fob isn't working with the new version to HUB as well so
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:29,375	| IOT034 |	You know that there's going to be transitional paying for people that probably the first
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,935	| IOT034 |	Version of this everybody else maybe not
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:37,823	| IOT034 |	You know what I will say I do like this cuz I mean I know I sound like I'm the hating on it a little bit here with
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,871	| IOT034 |	I do like if you go to the website
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:44,991	| IOT034 |	And they show you all the different things you can do you know when the activities in the devices
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,551	| IOT034 |	Codify them by saying
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:52,415	| IOT034 |	Is this one simple to install this is a moderate project to install this one's involved
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,463	| IOT034 |	This one is free this one is premium
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:58,047	| IOT034 |	It's really nice how they actually show all that's very consumer-friendly in terms of presentation
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| IOT034 |	There you go
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:04,191	| IOT034 |	And iiii will remain like when I tested the original Iris it was very
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,751	| IOT034 |	Consumer-friendly like
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,775	| IOT034 |	When you
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,823	| IOT034 |	Pair to device The Hub actually beat
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,615	| IOT034 |	You didn't have to wait for like
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:18,527	| IOT034 |	The device to register on the screen or something to possibly flash a different color you just had a instant comp
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| IOT034 |	Information
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,367	| IOT034 |	And this was back at a time when you repairing things and
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,135	| IOT034 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| IOT034 |	You know
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,951	| IOT034 |	Your app would like timeout
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,511	| IOT034 |	Or fail and then you would be like I don't know did it work
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:32,095	| IOT034 |	And then you have to restart everything in poop there would be like magic and you like
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,655	| IOT034 |	And then you know
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,679	| IOT034 |	But you have no idea
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,447	| IOT034 |	So
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,495	| IOT034 |	You know they're there little things that make
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,031	| IOT034 |	A really big difference and that was like
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,383	| IOT034 |	I thought you know I didn't like the fees I didn't like some of the other things about it
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,663	| IOT034 |	DUI was only so
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,175	| IOT034 |	So so
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,015	| IOT034 |	You know it felt very consumer-friendly but it also felt blessed
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,343	| IOT034 |	But some of the more advanced things that I was testing
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,903	| IOT034 |	They totally didn't nail the basic
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| IOT034 |	Looks like Iris
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,231	| IOT034 |	The timers at Rita
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,767	| IOT034 |	So I can't wait to see what they've been
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| IOT034 |	So let's stay tuned for that
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,863	| IOT034 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,655	| IOT034 |	Let's think about
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,751	| IOT034 |	Let's see what are we thinking about let's talk about the new Bluetooth which by the way
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,823	| IOT034 |	Is one of the new radios that the Lowe's Iris Hub ads
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,103	| IOT034 |	Yay
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,639	| IOT034 |	That's cool
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,967	| IOT034 |	Oh yeah so so after our show last week
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,527	| IOT034 |	The Bluetooth special interest group the folks at
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,599	| IOT034 |	Promote the Bluetooth standards and help great Diamond songs
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,879	| IOT034 |	They
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:31,999	| IOT034 |	You're talkin about bluetooth smart devices next year that will be sending information farther and faster
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| IOT034 |	So that's a win-win
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:36,863	| IOT034 |	They said they shared some details of their 2016 road map
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,911	| IOT034 |	Telling us what to expect so
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,935	| IOT034 |	Weather sion
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,215	| IOT034 |	Assuming everything is accurate
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:46,335	| IOT034 |	On the road maps are saying the overall range of Bluetooth smart devices will expand four times over
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:50,431	| IOT034 |	And data transfer speeds will be doubled over today's Bluetooth devices
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| IOT034 |	So
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,503	| IOT034 |	What seems to be driving this
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| IOT034 |	Is IRT
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| IOT034 |	As soon as I can I guess
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| IOT034 |	I guess you can guess
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,647	| IOT034 |	But I know you would have said I was
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,671	| IOT034 |	Cuz everything
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,975	| IOT034 |	Hanson Brothers
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:10,143	| IOT034 |	So you know this is good even better though which I love I love I love this in this is actually a nice bit for iron
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:13,215	| IOT034 |	Bluetooth will support as of next year
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,983	| IOT034 |	Mesh
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| IOT034 |	Networking
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| IOT034 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,847	| IOT034 |	So here's where things get a little crazy though Kevin
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,615	| IOT034 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,639	| IOT034 |	I have talked
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,663	| IOT034 |	To SIM network
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT034 |	Engineers
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,479	| IOT034 |	And we have had
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| IOT034 |	Actually
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:29,855	| IOT034 |	I don't know if these are network Engineers are just radio nerds like in the chip industry so
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| IOT034 |	Weaknesses
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,903	| IOT034 |	These are the people I drink
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,463	| IOT034 |	We got to visit discussions about mesh Network
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,767	| IOT034 |	Am I understanding is
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,815	| IOT034 |	The way Bluetooth does its Mesh networking
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,095	| IOT034 |	Is
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,631	| IOT034 |	Inherently inefficient
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,191	| IOT034 |	Did they argue that Bluetooth
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,471	| IOT034 |	Mesh networking
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| IOT034 |	Is less efficient
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,567	| IOT034 |	And kind of can flood your network
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:54,175	| IOT034 |	Because the way it does it is it basically shouts out to all of the devices
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,223	| IOT034 |	Hey
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,271	| IOT034 |	Tell so-and-so dis
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:02,111	| IOT034 |	Hey tell so-and-so this so the more divide it tells every single device
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:08,511	| IOT034 |	As you increase the number of devices on your network it tends to flood the network
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,047	| IOT034 |	In Kabul
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,351	| IOT034 |	Now the way like
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| IOT034 |	And these are thread propone
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,959	| IOT034 |	So take all of this with a grain of salt because
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,799	| IOT034 |	I can't evaluate that these arguments I can only like
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,847	| IOT034 |	But this sounds
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,407	| IOT034 |	This is accurate like when I look at the
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,223	| IOT034 |	So this is not inaccurate
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,247	| IOT034 |	I just don't know
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,063	| IOT034 |	On the thread side
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,855	| IOT034 |	They're going to a proxy
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,415	| IOT034 |	So they go to one thing and they say hey
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,439	| IOT034 |	Tell this
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,999	| IOT034 |	You got your in charge of this message
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| IOT034 |	Tell the following
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,071	| IOT034 |	When someone checks
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,351	| IOT034 |	For this information
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,119	| IOT034 |	Tell them this
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| IOT034 |	Witches
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,935	| IOT034 |	More
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,959	| IOT034 |	Bandwidth efficient
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,543	| IOT034 |	Well you know I
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:55,359	| IOT034 |	The Bluetooth say didn't share all the technical details.
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,127	| IOT034 |	Supreme
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,407	| IOT034 |	Outline with a roadmap
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,943	| IOT034 |	Plans are
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,735	| IOT034 |	So the implementation on how it's going to work
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,527	| IOT034 |	I don't know and I don't
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,087	| IOT034 |	Unfortunately I don't go out and drink with radio nerds but
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,111	| IOT034 |	That is a
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:10,719	| IOT034 |	It is I know I believe I'm missing out trust me I haven't answered your question probably
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,999	| IOT034 |	So I just want to say
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,023	| IOT034 |	What I'm saying
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:16,607	| IOT034 |	Radio nerds if you were listening to the show like the Bluetooth
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,399	| IOT034 |	Tell me
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,447	| IOT034 |	Give me the answer to this like
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,983	| IOT034 |	Maybe the threat guys
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,591	| IOT034 |	Like you like yes that's true but the downside to the other way of doing Mesh networking is
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| IOT034 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,639	| IOT034 |	It's Radioactive
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:36,063	| IOT034 |	Let's hope not puppies are named in getting those proxy so
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,087	| IOT034 |	We'll stay tuned to hear that
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:43,743	| IOT034 |	Okay so that is that is the update on Bluetooth we we kind of knew that was coming because we did know that
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,071	| IOT034 |	You know the Bluetooth say was looking at mesh Network
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,839	| IOT034 |	Because
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,863	| IOT034 |	We do need
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,423	| IOT034 |	Better mesh networks this does in my mind
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,959	| IOT034 |	Weed to once again
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:58,079	| IOT034 |	Are we going to have Bluetooth or we going to have thread because they're it they're still setting themselves up for kind of a
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,639	| IOT034 |	The Showdown
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,943	| IOT034 |	There was a Clash of the Titans cuz both of these standards
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,223	| IOT034 |	Why can't I type
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,247	| IOT034 |	In terms of data
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,039	| IOT034 |	But
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,343	| IOT034 |	We'll see did you find out what the data rates
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,111	| IOT034 |	AR
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,879	| IOT034 |	With the 2x date
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| IOT034 |	That was one of the questions I had
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,207	| IOT034 |	And I didn't get any answer
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,255	| IOT034 |	No I do not know
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,303	| IOT034 |	Second question for the Bluetooth Sig people
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,839	| IOT034 |	Explain to us
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,935	| IOT034 |	Radio networking the new data rates
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,471	| IOT034 |	Because
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,239	| IOT034 |	That's important
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,799	| IOT034 |	And will will definitely update on that
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,847	| IOT034 |	So now
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,895	| IOT034 |	Before we sound like real idiots explaining
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,687	| IOT034 |	Something we don't know much about let's move on
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:39,807	| IOT034 |	We've got lissy a new retail channel for some more iot stuff in
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:45,183	| IOT034 |	I am super excited about this because I love being able to go and put my hands on more devices
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:48,511	| IOT034 |	Send the device is the Leo night light is now in Lowe's
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,047	| IOT034 |	Stores in Best Buy
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:54,399	| IOT034 |	Best Buys in Toledo NightLight is a
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:58,495	| IOT034 |	$99 smoke detector we actually might have talked about it last week
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,287	| IOT034 |	When we talked about the roost
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,847	| IOT034 |	We might have benches
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,639	| IOT034 |	It sounds familiar my TV on
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,431	| IOT034 |	Banana show way way way back
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,455	| IOT034 |	At one point in time
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,479	| IOT034 |	It's a
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:11,807	| IOT034 |	Plug-in night light that's connected and listens for smoke alarms
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:15,135	| IOT034 |	So what it does is it listens for your smoke detector
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,695	| IOT034 |	And then it tells you basically
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:20,255	| IOT034 |	It tries to figure out where
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:23,583	| IOT034 |	The smoke detector is coming from and is like hey and then it
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,095	| IOT034 |	A Pikachu
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:28,703	| IOT034 |	So I can send alerts
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:34,335	| IOT034 |	Retrofitting your smoke detectors without buying the $100 desk in as many rooms as yes
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:40,479	| IOT034 |	So it's kind of a nice option that night light isn't LED that changes colors my my daughter loved it when we tried it
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| IOT034 |	It's very
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,527	| IOT034 |	You know it's fun
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:47,135	| IOT034 |	So you could use one of these to monitor several smoke detectors which is worth the cost savings
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,927	| IOT034 |	Exactly
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| IOT034 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| IOT034 |	Annie's early
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,279	| IOT034 |	Gotcha is there a monthly fee or anything
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,655	| IOT034 |	Back in the day it was $99 I believe it is still 99
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,447	| IOT034 |	So
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,215	| IOT034 |	200
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| IOT034 |	Sketchy your whole house
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:07,359	| IOT034 |	It will not tell you though when your smoke alarm is out of battery
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,895	| IOT034 |	So you stuck in the 3 a.m.
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,943	| IOT034 |	Unless you buy what we talked about
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,479	| IOT034 |	The roost
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:12,991	| IOT034 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| IOT034 |	So
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,039	| IOT034 |	There you have it
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,087	| IOT034 |	What's interesting about Leo is
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:21,183	| IOT034 |	Back in June they actually did a layoff or they laid off a couple
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| IOT034 |	People
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:25,279	| IOT034 |	And lo and behold there still like it we were all kind of worried we're like
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,815	| IOT034 |	There is a lot of money
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,607	| IOT034 |	They are doing layoffs
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,655	| IOT034 |	Going to be a sad sad story
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,215	| IOT034 |	Do you know if this is their only product right now
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,055	| IOT034 |	I believe it is their only shipping product they are
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,359	| IOT034 |	Planning to make a wide array of Prada
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:41,919	| IOT034 |	Text Leo is interesting because they have a global
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,943	| IOT034 |	They want to be global
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,783	| IOT034 |	They're very focused on making products for
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,831	| IOT034 |	Specific Geographic areas
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| IOT034 |	So yeah
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,951	| IOT034 |	Oh you know what we haven't talked about by the way
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,719	| IOT034 |	No
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,767	| IOT034 |	With all of our Smartwatch moves
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,559	| IOT034 |	Fossil
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| IOT034 |	Buy misfit
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,143	| IOT034 |	Route 206
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| IOT034 |	60 million dollars
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:09,567	| IOT034 |	Yes yes yes yes Misfit the folks with the make the shine the shine the really pretty tiny live
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:13,663	| IOT034 |	Tracker tracker
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,687	| IOT034 |	They make
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,991	| IOT034 |	Connect to light bulbs take to make the bolt
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,551	| IOT034 |	Connected light bulbs something that I always forget
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:23,391	| IOT034 |	I have not tried the bolt I have not tried them either because I'm like
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,671	| IOT034 |	Random products
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,719	| IOT034 |	Fat people
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:29,791	| IOT034 |	But I wanted to get your take on that news because
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,839	| IOT034 |	I was kind of it first like
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| IOT034 |	Why is this house
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:39,775	| IOT034 |	Fossil people do not think of fossil when it comes to smart watches and I'm not going to say that people
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| IOT034 |	Are thinking
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:44,127	| IOT034 |	A lot about smart watches right now but when they do they're not paying me fossil
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,199	| IOT034 |	They should because fossil has been involved in the store
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| IOT034 |	Smartwatch
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,015	| IOT034 |	Business for well over a decade
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| IOT034 |	Penny helps make
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,855	| IOT034 |	The first Microsoft spot watch 2004
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,391	| IOT034 |	The Abacus I still have one
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,927	| IOT034 |	So they
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| IOT034 |	Try this before
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:01,279	| IOT034 |	And didn't work ahead of its time
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,095	| IOT034 |	They're now making their own smart watches
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:08,447	| IOT034 |	And now by adding Misfit what they can do is make traditional type watches
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,983	| IOT034 |	At low cost with fossils not a
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,543	| IOT034 |	You know there is some $1,000 brand easily
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,103	| IOT034 |	You know they're not they're not Rolex then
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| IOT034 |	Tag are in a week
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,407	| IOT034 |	Talk about them
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,431	| IOT034 |	So it's
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:25,087	| IOT034 |	I don't say that inexpensive way but it's a a way to get in better integrated into the activity scene with watches
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:30,207	| IOT034 |	The people who may not want a true Smartwatch for notifications and Bluetooth and
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,999	| IOT034 |	Music and call so
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:36,863	| IOT034 |	I don't think it's a bad purchase I mean I'm not a financial analyst I don't know if it was if it made sense financially
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,167	| IOT034 |	But I do like the idea of him
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:41,983	| IOT034 |	This is a unexpected move but
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,775	| IOT034 |	Once it happened like I'll be up that make sense to me
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,591	| IOT034 |	Okay and you know I will say that
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,615	| IOT034 |	I'm looking at
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,919	| IOT034 |	Fossil had done a deal with Intel or they
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:52,735	| IOT034 |	Akon on stage at IDF with Intel
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:55,039	| IOT034 |	Doing an Android Wear SmartWatch 2
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:58,111	| IOT034 |	And fossil CEO I'm not going to butcher his name
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,903	| IOT034 |	Costa car
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| IOT034 |	Sodus
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,463	| IOT034 |	Cardinal Terrace
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:06,047	| IOT034 |	He had said back in August during earnings call
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,583	| IOT034 |	That
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:10,911	| IOT034 |	He thought the most significant long-term devices would be
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,447	| IOT034 |	Quote-unquote smarter watches
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,519	| IOT034 |	It's just adding chips and extra functionality
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,591	| IOT034 |	Not a full-fledged
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,687	| IOT034 |	Watch when operating system and so on like an Apple Watch run Android Wear watch
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:27,551	| IOT034 |	It's it's more of a transitionary kind of thing to the Inn in between product for people
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,831	| IOT034 |	You don't want to
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,367	| IOT034 |	Another Kiki watch on there
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,135	| IOT034 |	Brest but
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:33,951	| IOT034 |	A nice watch like that like the Y things activity
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,023	| IOT034 |	You know that's a nice analog watch
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:43,167	| IOT034 |	We can still track your steps and I'm leaving a Bluetooth now or they can shoot me information to an app and all that that Timmy is a smarter
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| IOT034 |	That's a good example
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:46,239	| IOT034 |	Yeah and I thought then
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:51,615	| IOT034 |	The purchase of Misfit makes sense because they've always had a very minimalistic design
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:54,431	| IOT034 |	And they've never been kind of about life
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:58,015	| IOT034 |	The watch there's no real like OS it's it's been very much about
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,319	| IOT034 |	Conveying information
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,135	| IOT034 |	What does little battery power is possible
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| IOT034 |	Flashy
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,791	| IOT034 |	So so it does make sense I kind of always thought
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,863	| IOT034 |	If your watchmaker and you were going to buy a watch
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,887	| IOT034 |	Company should buy pebble
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,167	| IOT034 |	Because you know
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,471	| IOT034 |	What's cross-platform it's got like
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,519	| IOT034 |	This open OS but
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:23,359	| IOT034 |	I guess if you're watchmaker you're probably in your thinking along those lines you like
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,455	| IOT034 |	Did you buy a computer I want to buy a watch
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,735	| IOT034 |	Smarter
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,759	| IOT034 |	So this follows along the
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:37,439	| IOT034 |	And to be honest with a company like a fossil or another traditional watchmaker that wants to do this could do what tigers
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,975	| IOT034 |	Just go with Android Wear
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,791	| IOT034 |	When it's available open they have to pay for it
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:45,375	| IOT034 |	So they could just do that the differences how do you stand out from the crowd of Android Wear watches
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:47,935	| IOT034 |	Fossil I don't think wants to do that
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| IOT034 |	I think they wanted
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| IOT034 |	Compete at the
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,519	| IOT034 |	As you said smarter watch
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,031	| IOT034 |	Area
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,591	| IOT034 |	Okay see you soon yeah
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,151	| IOT034 |	I can't believe we almost didn't talk about that I forgot about it
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,431	| IOT034 |	Terrible
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,247	| IOT034 |	We're building up this whole Smartwatch Galbraith
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,039	| IOT034 |	All right
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:05,599	| IOT034 |	We will skip ahead to our guests this week
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,367	| IOT034 |	Who is
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,183	| IOT034 |	I haven't talked to him yet guys so
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:12,255	| IOT034 |	I'm just going to punt on his last name until I talk to him
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:16,095	| IOT034 |	His name is Alex he's the CEO of Josh. AI
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:19,167	| IOT034 |	We're going to be talking about building intelligence for the Smart Home
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,727	| IOT034 |	And specifically Building open intelligence
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,239	| IOT034 |	Anti-police
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,519	| IOT034 |	So
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,287	| IOT034 |	It should be fine
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:30,431	| IOT034 |	Stick with me and just to be fair Stacy knows his last name is just the pronunciation is the trick
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:34,527	| IOT034 |	Yes I could spell it in a heartbeat this is what happens when you take a print journalist
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,063	| IOT034 |	And you give him a podcast
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,135	| IOT034 |	I'm not even going to risk
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,159	| IOT034 |	Until I talk to him
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,583	| IOT034 |	Yeah so alright well
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:49,631	| IOT034 |	Stay tuned for Alex

EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,544	| IOT034 |	And you talked about kind of
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,080	| IOT034 |	What the smartphone
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,848	| IOT034 |	Return from bat
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,944	| IOT034 |	Send it
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,968	| IOT034 |	You talked about kind of
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:43,040	| IOT034 |	Idealized Vision so I thought for you to kind of
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,064	| IOT034 |	Talk about
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,600	| IOT034 |	Your vision of the Smart Home
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,904	| IOT034 |	Even three years from now
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:51,232	| IOT034 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,512	| IOT034 |	Overseeding right now
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:57,120	| IOT034 |	The hardware that comes out of the companies are making their own app
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:03,520	| IOT034 |	Which means you have a whole collection apps on your phone
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,312	| IOT034 |	Think about it
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,104	| IOT034 |	Nothing
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,664	| IOT034 |	Turn on the lights and having lights go on his wonderful
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:14,784	| IOT034 |	Combination is more about Craig and Orchestra
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,064	| IOT034 |	Do
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,368	| IOT034 |	Magically based on the time of day
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:24,512	| IOT034 |	It's over the next three years we think it's coming
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:28,096	| IOT034 |	It's really truly realizing
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,376	| IOT034 |	Home automation
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,728	| IOT034 |	I really mean that contractors
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:36,800	| IOT034 |	There's a brain in the home the home
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:39,872	| IOT034 |	Is intuitive able to recommend
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,664	| IOT034 |	I just wanted to quit
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,504	| IOT034 |	We have
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:47,296	| IOT034 |	Number of Nest products at home
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:53,184	| IOT034 |	I know I'm not alone in saying it's extremely frustrating when they learn
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,720	| IOT034 |	What stinks are habits
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,512	| IOT034 |	And it turns out to be
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,536	| IOT034 |	Completely wrong
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,840	| IOT034 |	Los Angeles
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:06,240	| IOT034 |	Air conditioning really cooling the house down
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,008	| IOT034 |	Thomas Whitaker
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:13,408	| IOT034 |	Last night I set my thermostat to 72
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT034 |	64
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,504	| IOT034 |	And this was not trying to be too smart
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,136	| IOT034 |	Having the ability to automate but also
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,952	| IOT034 |	The intelligence to not do it in a bad way
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,720	| IOT034 |	Why voice
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:27,744	| IOT034 |	As the primary
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,280	| IOT034 |	And then we'll say
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,816	| IOT034 |	Why is it so important
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,608	| IOT034 |	I have this or how do you build a
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,144	| IOT034 |	Voice interaction
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,520	| IOT034 |	The first of which is
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| IOT034 |	I think it's really important.
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,592	| IOT034 |	Really just
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,640	| IOT034 |	Clearly Define
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,688	| IOT034 |	How were talking about artificial intelligence
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,992	| IOT034 |	And that really ties into a voice
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:55,136	| IOT034 |	As soon as Jerry came out and we have the ability to
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:57,184	| IOT034 |	Potter have a little bit of this
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:59,232	| IOT034 |	Almost Human like experience
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,280	| IOT034 |	Everyone started saying
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,096	| IOT034 |	Arise
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:08,960	| IOT034 |	Across the board in scrum
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,520	| IOT034 |	Quote unquote use artificial intelligence
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,312	| IOT034 |	It's really into
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:15,104	| IOT034 |	Important
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,152	| IOT034 |	Is that Siri really doesn't use
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,432	| IOT034 |	Any artificial intelligence
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,736	| IOT034 |	And a lot of what we see today
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,576	| IOT034 |	Is it true artificial
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| IOT034 |	Intelligent systems
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,904	| IOT034 |	Is behaving human-like
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:31,488	| IOT034 |	Human-like is free thinking
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,816	| IOT034 |	It's working with a system like you're working with the purse
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,912	| IOT034 |	Kylo Ren
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,936	| IOT034 |	Open this door
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,216	| IOT034 |	Turn this light on
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,776	| IOT034 |	That's a very easy thing to call me to do
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,824	| IOT034 |	To tell computer to do that
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,176	| IOT034 |	Today
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:55,552	| IOT034 |	Very flexible but in all reality
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,648	| IOT034 |	If you wanted to say something like
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:02,208	| IOT034 |	Send Stacey a text that I say hello
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,000	| IOT034 |	The system doesn't
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,024	| IOT034 |	Understand
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,328	| IOT034 |	The nuances of what you're saying
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,120	| IOT034 |	You're basically matching your words
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:14,752	| IOT034 |	And if it matches you get a response
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:16,288	| IOT034 |	Dirty South something like
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,824	| IOT034 |	Let me search the internet
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,104	| IOT034 |	Or some other answer that
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,968	| IOT034 |	In all reality it just doesn't know what you're saying
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,248	| IOT034 |	And then
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:28,832	| IOT034 |	Is very true but we see what Google Now
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:31,904	| IOT034 |	And even with the first version of Josh that we're working on
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| IOT034 |	It's
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:35,488	| IOT034 |	Fortunately or unfortunately
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,256	| IOT034 |	Artificial
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,840	| IOT034 |	And I think it's important to put that out there because
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,144	| IOT034 |	Restart reading about artificial intelligence
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,680	| IOT034 |	Skynet
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,216	| IOT034 |	Computer taking over
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:45,984	| IOT034 |	Consciousness
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,496	| IOT034 |	Free thinking
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,800	| IOT034 |	We're so far away from that
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:53,664	| IOT034 |	And so I want to make sure that people understand
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:56,224	| IOT034 |	Is really not a human-like smart
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:56,992	| IOT034 |	Computer
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,016	| IOT034 |	It's a
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:06,464	| IOT034 |	If you took something like the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,232	| IOT034 |	Or even
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,768	| IOT034 |	Apple Siri
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:11,328	| IOT034 |	If you want to say want this product to be all about
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:15,424	| IOT034 |	You realize you just have to figure out rooms around home
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:18,496	| IOT034 |	So how do you say the turn on and off the light
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:21,568	| IOT034 |	How do you say to lock and unlock the door
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,336	| IOT034 |	Music
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,128	| IOT034 |	You realize that this problem
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,664	| IOT034 |	Problems
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,224	| IOT034 |	I'm much more to sign then
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,760	| IOT034 |	General purpose AI
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,552	| IOT034 |	Google Now
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,904	| IOT034 |	Problems with AI
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,976	| IOT034 |	Mass market products
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,744	| IOT034 |	Is that
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:43,072	| IOT034 |	You don't know what to ask you systems because they
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:46,656	| IOT034 |	And that's something that we're very directly trying to
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:47,424	| IOT034 |	Opposed
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,192	| IOT034 |	Worst thing
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| IOT034 |	Dumbass costume
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,544	| IOT034 |	Make you feel better
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,080	| IOT034 |	All those things are
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,616	| IOT034 |	Possible
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:57,152	| IOT034 |	We want people to understand
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,432	| IOT034 |	Josh
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,736	| IOT034 |	Should be able to do anything
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,760	| IOT034 |	Therefore
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,296	| IOT034 |	If you can think of
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,088	| IOT034 |	A way to explain his statement
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,952	| IOT034 |	We want to guarantee the job he's going to be able to do that
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:13,280	| IOT034 |	AI
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,328	| IOT034 |	In terms of natural language
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,352	| IOT034 |	Processing invoice
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| IOT034 |	So excited about this for a couple
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:24,544	| IOT034 |	The first insight
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,568	| IOT034 |	Beautiful products
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:28,640	| IOT034 |	Experiences.
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:30,944	| IOT034 |	What's Soca
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,992	| IOT034 |	Confusing
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,296	| IOT034 |	Is that these products are often
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,320	| IOT034 |	Complicated
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,344	| IOT034 |	You're confusing
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,904	| IOT034 |	Just have to learn multiple systems that don't
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:44,512	| IOT034 |	Talk to one another they don't work together
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,560	| IOT034 |	Are building around a graphical user
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,352	| IOT034 |	Lola's voice everything
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,888	| IOT034 |	So
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,960	| IOT034 |	How are you going to work with these companies
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:57,568	| IOT034 |	Is I mean right now one of the big challenge in creating these cuz I actually can create
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,848	| IOT034 |	I have so many
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,384	| IOT034 |	Devices in my home
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:03,712	| IOT034 |	Play the song so I can create a lot of things right now
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:10,368	| IOT034 |	How do you plan to do it because the big problem for a lot of these companies is just Manpower in integrating
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:13,696	| IOT034 |	All of these connected devices together
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,512	| IOT034 |	So how do you plan to kind of address that it's
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,840	| IOT034 |	Not an easy problem to solve and it takes a lot of group
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:23,936	| IOT034 |	A number to Hardware companies
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:26,240	| IOT034 |	Very beginning did not want to talk to
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:36,736	| IOT034 |	And I will be in touch later and the only reason by the way
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:38,784	| IOT034 |	Is it they don't already have a public API
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,624	| IOT034 |	Does only have a public API
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,928	| IOT034 |	We're off to take me to get furniture
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:47,488	| IOT034 |	Rather than dealing with the echo
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,328	| IOT034 |	You're the federal rules that we work with
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,632	| IOT034 |	Hardware companies
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:56,704	| IOT034 |	Porcine
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,008	| IOT034 |	And we're going to do it with
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,032	| IOT034 |	The products that are
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,544	| IOT034 |	Customer service
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:03,616	| IOT034 |	Disregard creative ways to make it work anyway because
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,152	| IOT034 |	Quite frankly Anderson
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,712	| IOT034 |	Airbus
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:11,040	| IOT034 |	There's almost no Securities most iron
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:11,808	| IOT034 |	Network
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:15,392	| IOT034 |	It's what that means is we can gain access to almost everything
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:17,184	| IOT034 |	If we're on the local network
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:19,488	| IOT034 |	That's the way Josh Gordon
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,304	| IOT034 |	So we're basically taking the hard
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:22,816	| IOT034 |	Approach
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:26,656	| IOT034 |	To building the stuff out ourselves the most
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:29,472	| IOT034 |	I'm in other cases you're working with companies
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,752	| IOT034 |	Better provider
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,032	| IOT034 |	Just hi
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:35,104	| IOT034 |	Dana 80 or
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,896	| IOT034 |	In the building Engineers working with us
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,712	| IOT034 |	Often times it will find you
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:43,040	| IOT034 |	We say our customers need this product
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,112	| IOT034 |	We're going to make it work one way or another and you just figure it out
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:49,184	| IOT034 |	Okay so that is very much the kind of SmartThings approach
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,976	| IOT034 |	Quite a while
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,000	| IOT034 |	So you mentioned
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:53,024	| IOT034 |	Security
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,560	| IOT034 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:56,608	| IOT034 |	And privacy
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,376	| IOT034 |	Because
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,656	| IOT034 |	AI is built on
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:29:59,936	| IOT034 |	Training sets a
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,216	| IOT034 |	Basically
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,032	| IOT034 |	And using that data to train neural network
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:04,800	| IOT034 |	Parks and
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,080	| IOT034 |	One of the things that
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:08,128	| IOT034 |	I'm fascinated by this is the fact that
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,920	| IOT034 |	You know you can't
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,456	| IOT034 |	Develop gradle
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:13,504	| IOT034 |	Credible kind of models for them
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:16,576	| IOT034 |	Without lots and lots of data
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,624	| IOT034 |	So how do you guys look at
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,416	| IOT034 |	Being able to hit like
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,184	| IOT034 |	Train
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:24,512	| IOT034 |	Your algorithms and train your models for this
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,048	| IOT034 |	How do you kind of reconcile that with
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:29,376	| IOT034 |	The Privacy policies that you're thinking about her saying
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:33,472	| IOT034 |	Got a couple things going on
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:37,056	| IOT034 |	Understand that you mentioned that a lot of a eyes book
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,104	| IOT034 |	That's perfectly true
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,200	| IOT034 |	I'm in the way that neural networks work
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:47,040	| IOT034 |	You essentially are training a large system of data on
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:52,160	| IOT034 |	Neural Nets are very well
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:52,928	| IOT034 |	Established
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,584	| IOT034 |	I can recognize cat photograph
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:03,168	| IOT034 |	I'm going to do is I'm going to load in a million photos
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:05,216	| IOT034 |	And therefore when I show a photo if there
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,616	| IOT034 |	With language however it's very very
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| IOT034 |	System
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| IOT034 |	And that's really the only case
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,224	| IOT034 |	You need now
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,504	| IOT034 |	In terms of what word
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,672	| IOT034 |	Voice
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,952	| IOT034 |	They're basically three components
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,256	| IOT034 |	First there's the speech-to-text
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:32,352	| IOT034 |	Someone is going to speak into the microphone
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:35,424	| IOT034 |	And this isn't going to convert that speech tax
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,520	| IOT034 |	Once you
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:42,336	| IOT034 |	Send you a text to text translation
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,872	| IOT034 |	And this is really where the brain
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,200	| IOT034 |	The text that says
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,992	| IOT034 |	Turn the lights on in the kitchen
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:52,064	| IOT034 |	And it interprets that means this action
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,624	| IOT034 |	That's going to connect to this device and then it's going to generate
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:59,488	| IOT034 |	The responsive generates
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,280	| IOT034 |	Steps converted back to speech
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,448	| IOT034 |	That might be what you hear is just
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,472	| IOT034 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:14,592	| IOT034 |	Turn the lights on that happened in
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:18,176	| IOT034 |	So what you doing
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:18,688	| IOT034 |	Perspective
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:23,040	| IOT034 |	You're actually have to explain all three of those and understand that they're different
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,600	| IOT034 |	When you're looking at the last adventure
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,368	| IOT034 |	Text to speech
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:32,256	| IOT034 |	Open source technology
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:35,584	| IOT034 |	Apple Google Microsoft products
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,656	| IOT034 |	Something that we've been able to use you
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:48,128	| IOT034 |	That's something that a lot of really really smart people
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,896	| IOT034 |	Stunning
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,688	| IOT034 |	Jackie Chan
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:53,504	| IOT034 |	Word the benefactors of a lot of that
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,040	| IOT034 |	However it's not
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,856	| IOT034 |	There's no product on the market in my opinion.
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:59,904	| IOT034 |	Good enough to just taken worth it
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:02,464	| IOT034 |	We still have to do a lot of creative engineering around that
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,000	| IOT034 |	That's what I mean
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,792	| IOT034 |	If you were to say something like
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,608	| IOT034 |	Play Netflix on the TV
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:12,448	| IOT034 |	If Netflix is not understood word in the vocabulary
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,520	| IOT034 |	It's not going to pregnant
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:19,104	| IOT034 |	Computer
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,896	| IOT034 |	It's never going to spell anything wrong
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:22,688	| IOT034 |	It is what it is
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,968	| IOT034 |	Try to not snore
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:27,040	| IOT034 |	Dictionary
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,136	| IOT034 |	How to make salmon Grill
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:38,304	| IOT034 |	But then she just jump into the middle layer which is really where
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:41,632	| IOT034 |	This is what we need
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,168	| IOT034 |	We
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:49,312	| IOT034 |	You think about how many ways can you say that
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,336	| IOT034 |	Turn the lights on
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:53,408	| IOT034 |	Turn on the lights turn on the lights
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:55,200	| IOT034 |	Please turn the lights on
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,992	| IOT034 |	All sound very similar ones
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,552	| IOT034 |	Computer
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,624	| IOT034 |	Instead of what we have on one level
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,160	| IOT034 |	Is there a flexible
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,208	| IOT034 |	Basically programming language
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:08,000	| IOT034 |	That can handle
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:10,304	| IOT034 |	Do you have to language processing element
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:12,864	| IOT034 |	What was Santa's house
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:16,192	| IOT034 |	If something says what we don't match Google directly
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:17,728	| IOT034 |	What we try to do
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,776	| IOT034 |	Figure out what you might be saying
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,104	| IOT034 |	The other thing that we do
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:26,176	| IOT034 |	When you say something that a system doesn't
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,968	| IOT034 |	Your natural response
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:28,992	| IOT034 |	You try to say it again
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:37,696	| IOT034 |	So what we have in our system has something comes in
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:42,048	| IOT034 |	Would like to check did not match rule did not generate
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:42,816	| IOT034 |	Response
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,608	| IOT034 |	Later than usual
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,144	| IOT034 |	Something else
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:49,984	| IOT034 |	That's it soccer system that those two things might be
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,800	| IOT034 |	They might be trying to stay the same thing in a different way
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:55,104	| IOT034 |	And so there's some areas that we actually
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:56,640	| IOT034 |	Extended dialogue
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,432	| IOT034 |	Basically
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,992	| IOT034 |	Recommendations to human engineer II review
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,808	| IOT034 |	Another cases with system tries to auto-update
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,344	| IOT034 |	I'm basically get smarter on its own
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:06,368	| IOT034 |	Anime
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:11,232	| IOT034 |	Give me the date of what users are saying but
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:13,280	| IOT034 |	Really the context around who sang it
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:21,216	| IOT034 |	If you are Stripes can you something and Josh doesn't do it it doesn't understand it
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:24,032	| IOT034 |	You're able to do that action another why
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,568	| IOT034 |	Next time you go to stay that
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,592	| IOT034 |	Same thing
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,872	| IOT034 |	We should make sure we do it right
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:28,896	| IOT034 |	Got it
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:31,200	| IOT034 |	All right well on that note
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:33,248	| IOT034 |	Alex I really appreciate
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,272	| IOT034 |	You coming on the show
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:36,576	| IOT034 |	And I look forward to 3 months or so
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,112	| IOT034 |	Not being able to
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:40,672	| IOT034 |	Test out trash. In my own home
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,952	| IOT034 |	Thank you for coming on the show
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,720	| IOT034 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:49,120	| IOT034 |	And that concludes this week show thank you so much for listening and we'll see you next week
