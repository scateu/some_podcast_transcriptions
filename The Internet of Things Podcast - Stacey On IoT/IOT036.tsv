EDL	00:00:03,840	00:00:10,240	| IOT036 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the end
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:14,336	| IOT036 |	Internet of Things podcast I'm your host Stacey Higginbotham and here is your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:15,616	| IOT036 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,384	00:00:17,664	| IOT036 |	Had today we have got
EDL	00:00:17,664	00:00:18,176	| IOT036 |	Lots of
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:20,992	| IOT036 |	I was going to say we have lots of security news for you
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:23,296	| IOT036 |	But actually it's insecurity news
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:29,184	| IOT036 |	We almost were in unison there
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:36,096	| IOT036 |	That was not planned either know nothing about our show is plant has
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:38,912	| IOT036 |	As most people. They probably can tell Kevin
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:39,936	| IOT036 |	Pretty obvious
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:40,704	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:46,592	| IOT036 |	As a parent both of us probably had the same reaction to the news this week that Packers
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:48,896	| IOT036 |	8Ball actually not hackers a single hacker
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:54,016	| IOT036 |	And this is a person who actually isn't selling the date or doing anything with it but just
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:55,552	| IOT036 |	Just to see that if he could
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:58,880	| IOT036 |	Got into vtext servers and
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:01,696	| IOT036 |	Basically got access to the tally is now
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:04,768	| IOT036 |	6 million data on six million children
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:10,912	| IOT036 |	It is at 6.3 million children and 4.8 million parent account so obviously
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:13,472	| IOT036 |	Some of those parents have multiple kids using VTech products
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:16,800	| IOT036 |	And this this is just a tragedy I mean yes
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,872	| IOT036 |	Brass parents but just in general this is terrible
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:24,736	| IOT036 |	I mean there are photos of these kids chat logs all kinds of things and it's
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:28,320	| IOT036 |	It's it's just such a shame in VTEC
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:34,208	| IOT036 |	VTech is said it admits the database was not as secure as it should have been what was your first clue folks
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,280	| IOT036 |	Sorry
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:40,864	| IOT036 |	No no this is this is this is bad I wouldn't
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:44,448	| IOT036 |	I wouldn't call it a tragedy I mean there's there's not a loss of life here
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:47,008	| IOT036 |	This is a Taxco this is more of a
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:50,336	| IOT036 |	HS something hack is opposed to a
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:53,664	| IOT036 |	What we call it a actual breach stats
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,456	| IOT036 |	You know design to show your data
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,480	| IOT036 |	Hurt
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,248	| IOT036 |	Cause actual harm
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:00,832	| IOT036 |	The VTech makes a variety of toys they make a
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,904	| IOT036 |	Connected tablets for kids they make
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,672	| IOT036 |	What else do they make
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,440	| IOT036 |	Etsy
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:09,792	| IOT036 |	Some of them have you know I have some smarts to them and displays and obviously some have cameras
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:13,376	| IOT036 |	It's a wide range of of kids toys
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:15,424	| IOT036 |	And basically what happened
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,448	| IOT036 |	Is
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:21,056	| IOT036 |	Behavior performed basically he didn't SQL injection hack
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:23,872	| IOT036 |	And this is this is kind of a Brute Force attack
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,408	| IOT036 |	Have they they
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:28,480	| IOT036 |	Insert malicious commands into the websites forms
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,248	| IOT036 |	Tent
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,528	| IOT036 |	Trickett to get
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| IOT036 |	Other data
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:34,112	| IOT036 |	Database access database access
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,392	| IOT036 |	Once I had database access
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,208	| IOT036 |	What they discovered was that the
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,232	| IOT036 |	Passwords
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,048	| IOT036 |	Were not stored
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:45,632	| IOT036 |	Well they were stored securely but they weren't hashed correct
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,936	| IOT036 |	The passwords were hashed
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,984	| IOT036 |	They were protected so they weren't
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:50,752	| IOT036 |	Like that's not
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:54,592	| IOT036 |	It's not like they were in plain text and so on so are you know
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:58,944	| IOT036 |	I don't want to backtrack when I said to be check is obviously they realize they have an issue but
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,992	| IOT036 |	At least they were not in any
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,016	| IOT036 |	Plain text passwords
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:06,112	| IOT036 |	Yeah cuz we ever we've seen actually a lot of hacks recently and
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,672	| IOT036 |	Basically what happens is they get into the database
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| IOT036 |	Boom
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,976	| IOT036 |	Your passwords
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,512	| IOT036 |	All right there
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,024	| IOT036 |	Exteriors
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,072	| IOT036 |	So okay
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:18,400	| IOT036 |	But what the heck are did discover is that
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,960	| IOT036 |	They could actually tie the information about
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:25,824	| IOT036 |	The kids so they had the kids names ages that sort of thing in the nick of time it back to the parents
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,360	| IOT036 |	Which then
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,944	| IOT036 |	Had the parents names and their addresses so they had the kids
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,528	| IOT036 |	Tied to their parents which gave them the kids
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,552	| IOT036 |	Names
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,600	| IOT036 |	Your address
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,136	| IOT036 |	Genders birthdates
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| IOT036 |	Photographs
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,440	| IOT036 |	Remove
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:41,952	| IOT036 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,232	| IOT036 |	It's not great
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:49,632	| IOT036 |	The chat logs that the audiophiles cuz you can do audio chat on some of these devices they are encrypted by AAS
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,400	| IOT036 |	128
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,448	| IOT036 |	Is according to vitek's
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:57,056	| IOT036 |	Public statement on on the topics princess chat logs are not encrypted
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,128	| IOT036 |	Okay so they couldn't hear your children but they could see what they were typing
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,456	| IOT036 |	That's correct no credit card information
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:09,344	| IOT036 |	Social Security numbers or any or driver's license numbers of parent that's not part of the profiles
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,904	| IOT036 |	So I mean it's just
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,256	| IOT036 |	Some identity information and a lot of it obviously is
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,559	| IOT036 |	Mimosa is is children
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,119	| IOT036 |	And so
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| IOT036 |	Again
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:25,215	| IOT036 |	I'll say it as a parent your fear here isn't
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,775	| IOT036 |	Is it a visceral fear of your kids
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,287	| IOT036 |	Picture
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,847	| IOT036 |	Interstate is like
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,151	| IOT036 |	It is kind of like a like a
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,175	| IOT036 |	One-Stop shopping
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,967	| IOT036 |	Pedophiles is basically
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:39,039	| IOT036 |	Skip that that's that's worst case I totally agree
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,599	| IOT036 |	It reality
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:47,231	| IOT036 |	This is probably more inflammatory because you know again that that root beer is pretty bad is
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,303	| IOT036 |	The parent you're like oh my gosh you know you're never supposed to put your
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:56,703	| IOT036 |	Kids picture online we do it all the time you know if if I'm looking at someone's Facebook page I could probably figure out where they live they got
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,983	| IOT036 |	Their kids picture up there
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,031	| IOT036 |	You know is it that hard
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,103	| IOT036 |	If I really wanted to get that in
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| IOT036 |	Information prop
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:09,503	| IOT036 |	It would be worse obviously if it was a true hack to get and either
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,063	| IOT036 |	Salwar
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:12,831	| IOT036 |	Give out
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:15,391	| IOT036 |	Information but that hacker did not do that this was a
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,207	| IOT036 |	A test of his abilities and their seeking VTech security
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,279	| IOT036 |	So from that perspective it it's it's a little
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,303	| IOT036 |	Better than it could have been
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| IOT036 |	I'm surprised the hacker didn't
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:28,703	| IOT036 |	I should say this way I'm surprised VTech didn't find out from the hacker
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,031	| IOT036 |	That's what I would have preferred to see happen in this situation
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:35,615	| IOT036 |	However when asked what have you checked on that about the Bridget said they
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,151	| IOT036 |	That they received an email
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,991	| IOT036 |	From a Canadian journalist asking about the incident on November 23rd
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,039	| IOT036 |	So they found out not from the hacker
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,319	| IOT036 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,087	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,647	| IOT036 |	It's been all around I mean it's
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,719	| IOT036 |	There's nothing good here and
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:58,399	| IOT036 |	There is going to be something good, and that is there going to be f***** there are protocols on how they handle
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,167	| IOT036 |	The state
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:01,471	| IOT036 |	So going forward you would hope that
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,263	| IOT036 |	The odds of this happening again are far less
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:06,079	| IOT036 |	So if there's a silver lining that's what it is
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,847	| IOT036 |	Maybe
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:10,175	| IOT036 |	Yes I mean that is the Silver Lining it also I think
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,991	| IOT036 |	Guitar necks point which is
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:13,759	| IOT036 |	Yikes
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,343	| IOT036 |	A lot of stuff that we have right now
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,367	| IOT036 |	Redis connected
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,183	| IOT036 |	Why the information companies are asking for
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,487	| IOT036 |	We really should
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,767	| IOT036 |	Be asking to them
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,327	| IOT036 |	Do they need this and how are they storing
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,887	| IOT036 |	And I think the fact that this is
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,423	| IOT036 |	Information about children
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:34,495	| IOT036 |	Which right now under our laws are
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:37,823	| IOT036 |	Kind of a protected class in a way because of the
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,103	| IOT036 |	Additional
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:41,151	| IOT036 |	I always forget the name of this law
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,175	| IOT036 |	BMI
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:46,783	| IOT036 |	Digital Millennium Information Act maybe Digital Millennium Copyright Act
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,295	| IOT036 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| IOT036 |	It's an act
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:54,719	| IOT036 |	It's always Lucy
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| IOT036 |	However
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| IOT036 |	Basically
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,279	| IOT036 |	Say that
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,583	| IOT036 |	You can't collect information about
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,399	| IOT036 |	Kids under the age of 13
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:05,727	| IOT036 |	I'm getting you can advertise to them rather is kind of
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,775	| IOT036 |	The actual link are the
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,079	| IOT036 |	Issues at stake here
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,359	| IOT036 |	VTech obviously wasn't
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| IOT036 |	Advertising to these children
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,735	| IOT036 |	It you can actually collect information about them
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT036 |	But
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,831	| IOT036 |	The fact that it puts this data at risk like that
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,367	| IOT036 |	And puts his children at risk
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,903	| IOT036 |	Kind of all kinds of things
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,951	| IOT036 |	Nobody in Congress is
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:29,535	| IOT036 |	Is going to be thrilled about this which means the FTC is probably going to be like
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,839	| IOT036 |	Oh hellos VTech
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,887	| IOT036 |	What is talk about your data storage racks
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,935	| IOT036 |	Perhaps well
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT036 |	Step Up
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:41,823	| IOT036 |	Yeah and if I'm not mistaken VTech is based in Hong Kong
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,151	| IOT036 |	Yeah but if you want to sell your product
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,455	| IOT036 |	In the United States
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| IOT036 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:48,991	| IOT036 |	Totally agree
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,855	| IOT036 |	So hand you know as you can see in the list of where these
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:55,135	| IOT036 |	Accounts were
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,183	| IOT036 |	The US has a rather large Market
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| IOT036 |	4
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,231	| IOT036 |	PTAC
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:04,351	| IOT036 |	Based on the fact that 2.2 million of the parent accounts are here in two point
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,167	| IOT036 |	Yeah almost 50% of the parent accounts
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| IOT036 |	We're from the US
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,311	| IOT036 |	Sidebar
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,407	| IOT036 |	Third to a half of the child profiles were from the USA value
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,431	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,735	| IOT036 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:27,903	| IOT036 |	Also so that that's our hope is maybe maybe now Will get less of a hands-off laissez-faire approach to
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| IOT036 |	How
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| IOT036 |	Not only just
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:34,047	| IOT036 |	Giving us lip service to privacy around their data in
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,583	| IOT036 |	Companies needing to
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,631	| IOT036 |	Be kind of car does it have this but actually
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:41,983	| IOT036 |	Okay maybe we need to start setting some baseline standards about
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:47,615	| IOT036 |	How did he needs to be stored and it may be that VTEC would be following those minimum standards but
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,151	| IOT036 |	Hey let's get them in place
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,967	| IOT036 |	You know I I wonder though if it's
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:56,575	| IOT036 |	If companies have put standards in place but having evolved them with the times
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| IOT036 |	I think right now
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,903	| IOT036 |	We should
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,207	| IOT036 |	Set some standards
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:06,815	| IOT036 |	And I'd like to see outcome be standards as opposed to just like
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:13,215	| IOT036 |	Thou shalt store your databases are passwords and hashed insulted her with his hashed insult
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,751	| IOT036 |	How to databases
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,311	| IOT036 |	Ouch ouch
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,335	| IOT036 |	You know
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,687	| IOT036 |	Maintain and then I guess this is this is kind of one of those things
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:25,503	| IOT036 |	Top Shop perform audits on your database
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,015	| IOT036 |	Udo
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| IOT036 |	Password
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:30,111	| IOT036 |	Where you store your passwords
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,183	| IOT036 |	You know every 6 months and you don't
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| IOT036 |	Make sure that
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,791	| IOT036 |	A hacker with this level of skill Kant
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:41,375	| IOT036 |	You know spending X number of hours on it can't get past it
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,423	| IOT036 |	Maybe that's a way to think about it
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,007	| IOT036 |	Much more outcome is opposed to prescriptive
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,311	| IOT036 |	Because that feels like
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:55,199	| IOT036 |	It may be a wiser way to deal with security especially since things just Arkansas
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,735	| IOT036 |	Circling to continually evolve
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,039	| IOT036 |	Yeah that the trick is that
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:03,903	| IOT036 |	Security was always important it's just now it's important for far more
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,439	| IOT036 |	Devices
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:09,023	| IOT036 |	And industries then it was say you can just five or 10 years ago
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:12,863	| IOT036 |	Every every industry is now impacted by
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,423	| IOT036 |	Data or big data and therefore leads to
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| IOT036 |	Have security measures in place
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| IOT036 |	Yeah and maybe
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,799	| IOT036 |	Maybe there's a
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,359	| IOT036 |	The way that we should be thinking about you know
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,151	| IOT036 |	Baby
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,455	| IOT036 |	Not every company needs to handle their own security
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,015	| IOT036 |	Maybe there should be
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,295	| IOT036 |	Escrow I mean
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:37,183	| IOT036 |	In a way that's kind of one of the services that a lot of the big cloud providers offer is they store your data for you
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,231	| IOT036 |	And some of them are
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,767	| IOT036 |	Better at it than others
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:45,887	| IOT036 |	I don't know I mean that kind of creates a booming industry for like an IBM Iran AWS
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,703	| IOT036 |	And then you get into who's watching the Watchers
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,751	| IOT036 |	It's it's there's no easy answer
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| IOT036 |	There isn't
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:58,943	| IOT036 |	But being able to shrug your shoulders and say that's a hard problem I'm not going to deal with that I was going to offer kids a connected to
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,735	| IOT036 |	Glitter I'm just going to offer
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:05,343	| IOT036 |	A you know connected cooking stove that's going to pull up a bunch of data that
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,927	| IOT036 |	We may want some day doesn't seem to be the right thing to do
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,207	| IOT036 |	Here
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,487	| IOT036 |	Hagrid
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:11,999	| IOT036 |	Angry
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,047	| IOT036 |	We can't just walk away because
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,559	| IOT036 |	It's hard
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,119	| IOT036 |	So speaking of security
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,631	| IOT036 |	Or
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,983	| IOT036 |	Practices that maybe we should think about might not be the best
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:28,639	| IOT036 |	We saw the sea who was it who published this survey
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,151	| IOT036 |	That is
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,455	| IOT036 |	OLCC consult
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,015	| IOT036 |	Yes SEC consult
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:38,111	| IOT036 |	This this was worth mentioning it was a
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,463	| IOT036 |	Is a survey that was published on Wednesday right before Thanksgiving
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,767	| IOT036 |	Not the greatest I mean I got to say but
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:47,327	| IOT036 |	You know I picked it up and I'm glad they did
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| IOT036 |	Because
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,143	| IOT036 |	These guys
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,703	| IOT036 |	Analyzed firmware from more than
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,751	| IOT036 |	4000 embedded devices
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,775	| IOT036 |	From 70 vendors
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,823	| IOT036 |	And it looked at them and they said
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,615	| IOT036 |	Holy cow these devices
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,687	| IOT036 |	Use a remarkably similar number of
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:06,527	| IOT036 |	SSH host keys because they're all using the same
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,807	| IOT036 |	Software
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,367	| IOT036 |	Development kits from these vendors
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| IOT036 |	Time in Saudi
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:16,255	| IOT036 |	This is akin to basically what would it be like Kevin
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:21,119	| IOT036 |	Do you like yeah you know out of a hundred of us 50 of us are using the same password and
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,911	| IOT036 |	We all know what that password is
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,191	| IOT036 |	Exactly
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,799	| IOT036 |	How did you know that I use that
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,591	| IOT036 |	Oh Manuel
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,127	| IOT036 |	Just tell her 50 closest friend
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,431	| IOT036 |	What are the odds
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:40,831	| IOT036 |	So basically we're all using password which would be great if everyone's as trustworthy is Kevin and I that you know
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:45,951	| IOT036 |	Sometimes we have friends who aren't as trustworthy and they might use password and since they know we use password
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,511	| IOT036 |	They're just going to pop on in and be like
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:55,167	| IOT036 |	Hey I bet Kevin and Stacey are also using password and I really want access to their device let me see if they're using it to
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:04,639	| IOT036 |	You never talked about this a little bit before the show even started and we're trying to figure out why this situation actually exists and I think you hit a
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,407	| IOT036 |	On the key point
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:11,551	| IOT036 |	Cuz I thought was it a technical issue how difficult is it to generate a different key or whatever
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,879	| IOT036 |	And you said no it's probably pretty easy and it's
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,415	| IOT036 |	Got kind of a matter of laziness
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:23,327	| IOT036 |	It is not laziness out of maliciousness no no no it's just laziness because up until now you've
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,375	| IOT036 |	Never really had to think about this before because
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:29,983	| IOT036 |	You know who's really mucking around with SDK on some random sensor
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,543	| IOT036 |	Connected dog collar right and that's
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,127	| IOT036 |	You know these things have been used in like these weird and better
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:40,735	| IOT036 |	Projects for a while but now that they're getting an stuck in like consumer devices
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,063	| IOT036 |	Is there becoming kind of interesting
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:44,831	| IOT036 |	Targets
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,623	| IOT036 |	We may not even be that attractive
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:50,975	| IOT036 |	Honestly but when you're like it Blackadder doing something you know they're they're certainly like
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,767	| IOT036 |	Celebratory targets
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,815	| IOT036 |	I just acted toilet
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,095	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,911	| IOT036 |	I think what happened is suddenly people in like
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,007	| IOT036 |	Oh shoot now I got to close the back door
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,031	| IOT036 |	Yep
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,943	| IOT036 |	So that's what this is and we'll put the link to the survey for people who want to you know I don't know security people like to see
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,479	| IOT036 |	The stuff they like to argue with it
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:17,599	| IOT036 |	Whether there's a lot of good day to here and in particular I was looking at the vendors and products that were affected
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:21,439	| IOT036 |	They said they were more than 900 products from 50 vendors to be vulnerable
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:25,023	| IOT036 |	Based on just their limited survey and there are big names in this list
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:28,351	| IOT036 |	Oh yeah I'm going to go pick 3
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,655	| IOT036 |	What do you want
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:33,983	| IOT036 |	Take 5 I don't I don't care there's MN
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,543	| IOT036 |	People will know these names this is not you know
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| IOT036 |	Small companies
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:41,919	| IOT036 |	Okay so these are I mean these are the CD link
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,431	| IOT036 |	Netgear
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,479	| IOT036 |	Western Digital
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:44,991	| IOT036 |	Cisco
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,783	| IOT036 |	Ride time
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| IOT036 |	GE
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| IOT036 |	Phillips
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,367	| IOT036 |	Motorola
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,391	| IOT036 |	Pirelli they make tires
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:56,511	| IOT036 |	Maybe the tire sensors the air pressure sensors or something I don't know
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,887	| IOT036 |	Sierra Wireless Seagate
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,679	| IOT036 |	Yeah Ubiquiti Network
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:10,591	| IOT036 |	Oh yeah it's nothing against these companies that's not why I brought this up I'm just wanted people to understand the
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,871	| IOT036 |	Breadth and scope of
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:16,223	| IOT036 |	Of what in a way this problem actually is it's it's pretty widespread
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,527	| IOT036 |	I mean these are yet these are not
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,831	| IOT036 |	Do not these are not kickstarter's
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,647	| IOT036 |	These are yeah and these are in this is not by any
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,463	| IOT036 |	This is not by any stretch of the imagination like a
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:32,863	| IOT036 |	Idea here is there using things like broadcom's sdks and there
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,167	| IOT036 |	You know they're basically just
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:38,495	| IOT036 |	Using the keys that came with it and there's no stopping that code and they're like
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,055	| IOT036 |	Now it's Anarchy no
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,567	| IOT036 |	Because
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:44,639	| IOT036 |	Because they've always done it and I've haven't had to think about it
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,943	| IOT036 |	They could get away with it before but
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:50,271	| IOT036 |	Given the way that iot the outer market and
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:56,159	| IOT036 |	Mainstream consumers getting into smart devices you can't get away with that anymore
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| IOT036 |	Yasso
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,743	| IOT036 |	So this is this is pretty cool
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,279	| IOT036 |	Cool in the sense that like
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,559	| IOT036 |	Yikes
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:06,911	| IOT036 |	And cool that this research is out there and has been done so
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,983	| IOT036 |	I'm going to encourage you guys if you're interested in it take a look at it
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| IOT036 |	A scary but also
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:19,199	| IOT036 |	We're looking at got to be informed and this is this is the first step to actually doing something about it so
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,503	| IOT036 |	Let's make it happen
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,575	| IOT036 |	So that was the scary part of our podcast
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,647	| IOT036 |	Let's move on to something exciting times happy times
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,975	| IOT036 |	Let's talk about should we talk about
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,791	| IOT036 |	The latest Pi zero or should we talk about making
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,559	| IOT036 |	Christmas
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,839	| IOT036 |	Iot enabled
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,911	| IOT036 |	Let's go with the pi zero because
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:43,775	| IOT036 |	You know this is a time where everything is low-cost cuz it's on sale for the holidays
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:48,639	| IOT036 |	But this is low-cost all the time five bucks it's brand new
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,967	| IOT036 |	On Thanksgiving here in the US Senate
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,015	| IOT036 |	Not on Thanksgiving in the UK
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:57,599	| IOT036 |	The Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the pi zero which is a
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,391	| IOT036 |	Chip chip chip
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| IOT036 |	Bored
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,719	| IOT036 |	Containing a 1 gigahertz arm
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| IOT036 |	11 processor
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,303	| IOT036 |	It's got an SD card and
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:11,423	| IOT036 |	I'm not going to go too much into this because our guest today is Eben Upton
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:15,263	| IOT036 |	Who is the creator of the Raspberry Pi and we're going to talk a lot about it
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,591	| IOT036 |	I'm it's a shame Kevin wasn't here for this because he in
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,383	| IOT036 |	Get Evan could have had a great time
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,151	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:27,295	| IOT036 |	Stay tuned podcast because Evan is going to talk to us about like what you can use it for how it differs from like the other pies
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| IOT036 |	Why cheap
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:35,999	| IOT036 |	Besides being cheap yes we talked about it and we can talk about that earlier if we actually get kind of crazy detailed so
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:39,071	| IOT036 |	Yeah we talked about pin counts manso
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,607	| IOT036 |	Those who don't care about pin count
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:41,887	| IOT036 |	Just bare with us
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:45,727	| IOT036 |	Yeah you know it's what's crazy about this $5
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,007	| IOT036 |	Card sized computer
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:50,335	| IOT036 |	They're saying it's half the size of the model A+ What would
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,615	| IOT036 |	Twice the utility
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,639	| IOT036 |	They didn't just
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,175	| IOT036 |	Take all the components in
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:58,527	| IOT036 |	You know downsizing Alex still has 1080p 60 frames per second
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,319	| IOT036 |	HDMI out for example
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:03,647	| IOT036 |	I literally am thinking about getting one to turn into a home media server
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,183	| IOT036 |	Current for streaming online content
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| IOT036 |	So you can't get one now.
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:10,815	| IOT036 |	Because I know it's sold out there only making $10,000 a week
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:14,655	| IOT036 |	So you may have to wait a little bit don't call anybody just just wait
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:19,007	| IOT036 |	But in the meantime you can maybe order the the chip
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:22,591	| IOT036 |	Which is a $9 computer that also went on sale on Cyber Monday
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:26,431	| IOT036 |	Which was November 28th November 30th
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,479	| IOT036 |	I mean that's for the next thing Co
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:28,991	| IOT036 |	And that
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,807	| IOT036 |	Also I believe has
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,111	| IOT036 |	A 1 gigahertz processor
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,159	| IOT036 |	I don't know it's
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,183	| IOT036 |	Scrap Escape
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,207	| IOT036 |	Abilities
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,487	| IOT036 |	But
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,255	| IOT036 |	Also cheap
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:47,167	| IOT036 |	Skip pretty cool. Great for tanker and little computer projects learning teaching kids program
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,959	| IOT036 |	Learning how to use Linux I mean
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,263	| IOT036 |	There's so many things you can do with a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,543	| IOT036 |	There are
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,567	| IOT036 |	And will will
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,591	| IOT036 |	We'll come back to that
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,383	| IOT036 |	Later on in the show
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| IOT036 |	But
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,455	| IOT036 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,223	| IOT036 |	Yes
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,503	| IOT036 |	Because we have to
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:04,319	| IOT036 |	Let's talk about Christmas
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:07,647	| IOT036 |	Because you guys might be getting your holiday decorations out
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,183	| IOT036 |	And I have some
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,719	| IOT036 |	Some ideas and thoughts for you
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,255	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,815	| IOT036 |	If you were listening to the show last year around this time
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,655	| IOT036 |	Have you may have heard that I bought a pair of connected lights
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,471	| IOT036 |	These were the itwinkle lights from GE
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,263	| IOT036 |	And I have to tell you
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:27,103	| IOT036 |	But I brought him out again they still work after
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,639	| IOT036 |	A year in
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:32,479	| IOT036 |	And I brought him out actually for two holidays cuz you can turn the lights a bunch of different colors
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,575	| IOT036 |	I'm still in the market for a slightly better connected light
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,879	| IOT036 |	These are bluetooth-connected so
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:41,439	| IOT036 |	In actually the updates to that make them better
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,511	| IOT036 |	So they can connect both to the IOS and Android phone
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,815	| IOT036 |	And they play music
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:48,607	| IOT036 |	Free connected pair of
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:55,007	| IOT036 |	Lights the cost about 50 bucks I think they're on sale at Home Depot so it was it's 25 lights
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:20:00,639	| IOT036 |	Teaching yoga to strands of 25 lights their huge ginormous Globes you can also buy
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,455	| IOT036 |	Smaller versions of these for your tree
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:07,295	| IOT036 |	I would like for them to be a little bit more customizable
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:12,927	| IOT036 |	But basically I can't get the lights to do much of anything except be all one color
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:15,743	| IOT036 |	Unless I'm also playing music which my neighbors
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,255	| IOT036 |	Would kill me if
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,047	| IOT036 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,607	| IOT036 |	That's the downside of
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| IOT036 |	Desperate
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,143	| IOT036 |	Particular brand of light
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:26,239	| IOT036 |	If the Philips light strips work outdoors I wouldn't get those at heart
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,823	| IOT036 |	If they look nice we've all actually has a
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,103	| IOT036 |	Set of outdoor light strip
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:33,151	| IOT036 |	Outdoor lights
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,479	| IOT036 |	Think might be colored
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,063	| IOT036 |	I'm going to try to get some of those and see what
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT036 |	How they work
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:46,463	| IOT036 |	I'm a little funeral Erie of the WeMo software experience but it is Christmas
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,767	| IOT036 |	I wish that I was thinking the
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,535	| IOT036 |	WeMo
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:53,375	| IOT036 |	Switch my work outside is probably not the weather resistant unfortunately
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:59,007	| IOT036 |	Old standby policy Jasco Z-Wave
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,591	| IOT036 |	Sorry it's the GE Jasco
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:08,735	| IOT036 |	Z-Wave outdoor switch it is connected to my SmartThings Hub you could also
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,271	| IOT036 |	Dear wingcup
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:14,111	| IOT036 |	It is pricey I think it's about 40 bucks right now
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:20,256	| IOT036 |	Hot Home Depot you're going to pay more for something that's weather resistant no that's fine I have four of them
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| IOT036 |	Those guys
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:25,120	| IOT036 |	I know I buy I buy more every year cuz my my light show at
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,144	| IOT036 |	And every year
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,680	| IOT036 |	But this year
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:31,008	| IOT036 |	New new tweak on that old design
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,824	| IOT036 |	Because I got it blows on SmartThings
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,848	| IOT036 |	Or you could do it on me
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:39,456	| IOT036 |	You can group them under a setting on your Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:42,784	| IOT036 |	Now if I say to she who shall not be named
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| IOT036 |	Christmas
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,368	| IOT036 |	Turn Christmas on
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:46,880	| IOT036 |	Boom
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,672	| IOT036 |	Are you outside lights are on
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,208	| IOT036 |	All might well actually I
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:50,720	| IOT036 |	Put it up into
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,536	| IOT036 |	Show all Christmas comes on
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| IOT036 |	What's a scene
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,608	| IOT036 |	It's ass eating baby
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:59,680	| IOT036 |	Wow it's pretty freaking awesome
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,192	| IOT036 |	Nice
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:05,568	| IOT036 |	It is nice and if I could actually get my Sonos has to reliably work
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,104	| IOT036 |	Actually make it so late
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,384	| IOT036 |	Music
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,712	| IOT036 |	Which kind of amazing
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:17,600	| IOT036 |	You have to give tours of your helmet that point Christmas tours
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:21,184	| IOT036 |	Yeah but just the whole voice command thing the kids would love it
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,000	| IOT036 |	Music on the lights go on
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,792	| IOT036 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,304	| IOT036 |	Dance
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:31,680	| IOT036 |	I did see in the Wall Street Journal Gregory Fowler they're kind of personal device columnist
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:33,216	| IOT036 |	Yep has a
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:36,288	| IOT036 |	He actually used some little bits to make ornaments for his tree
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,568	| IOT036 |	Smart
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,360	| IOT036 |	So I'm actually going to
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:44,736	| IOT036 |	Can I see how that works out for us because I hadn't thought of that and I thought that was a really light up ornaments
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,272	| IOT036 |	Pretty slick idea yeah
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,552	| IOT036 |	Yes yes very nice
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:51,136	| IOT036 |	So that's what I'm going to try out I'm going to try out some
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,696	| IOT036 |	See if I can't score some
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,976	| IOT036 |	Different outdoor lights
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:57,024	| IOT036 |	If you're if you're in the market for him
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:00,608	| IOT036 |	See if you can't find the I twinkle lights on sale they're pretty good
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,728	| IOT036 |	Of all the ones that are out there
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:10,080	| IOT036 |	They were the best we tried another brand I can't remember right now and
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,640	| IOT036 |	Last year
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,968	| IOT036 |	I'm surprised actually that the lighting technology has knotted
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| IOT036 |	Willits
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:24,928	| IOT036 |	It's not cheap for one thing and I think with the lighting companies are doing is focusing on
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,512	| IOT036 |	Lowest paying for most bang for buck and that's indoors
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,792	| IOT036 |	You know traditional lighting
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,072	| IOT036 |	Christmas
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,632	| IOT036 |	People spend a lot of money on Christmas
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:39,520	| IOT036 |	People spend $60 on their pets but they're not putting lights on them so I don't know about that I think
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| IOT036 |	They're spending the money where they
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,592	| IOT036 |	See the biggest thing
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:47,968	| IOT036 |	You could do
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,480	| IOT036 |	Youku
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,504	| IOT036 |	Holiday poop
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,832	| IOT036 |	All right I think you bought something cool you want to talk about it
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:56,416	| IOT036 |	I do want to talk about it but I can't talk about it because
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,952	| IOT036 |	Much because I don't have it yet
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:03,072	| IOT036 |	Don't know I don't know I want to share the news at least
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,352	| IOT036 |	The news is
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,120	| IOT036 |	That
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,632	| IOT036 |	And this is
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:08,192	| IOT036 |	Not all this is brand new news
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:12,800	| IOT036 |	Back when Amazon came out with this new Fire TV which I think was September
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,592	| IOT036 |	It said that it didn't work with
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,384	| IOT036 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,200	| IOT036 |	And it did but now
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:24,064	| IOT036 |	And I can't give you the exact date because Amazon doesn't updated support pages with dates
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:29,952	| IOT036 |	But this week I saw that the Fire TV now works with the echo specifically to control Smart devices
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,744	| IOT036 |	So you know what
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,792	| IOT036 |	$25 off with this
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:38,144	| IOT036 |	Cyber Monday deal I ordered a Fire TV actually needed a streaming stick anyway
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:41,216	| IOT036 |	I order Fire TV with the voice remote
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| IOT036 |	And the voice remote
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,008	| IOT036 |	Will be
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,312	| IOT036 |	I'll be able to control things around my house
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,872	| IOT036 |	Through the Fire TV remote to the echo
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,152	| IOT036 |	A very roundabout way
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:52,480	| IOT036 |	But that's a good thing because we only have the one Echo and it's
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,784	| IOT036 |	Second floor of our house my home office
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,088	| IOT036 |	Where is mostly watch TV downstairs
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,880	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,160	| IOT036 |	For watching TV on the
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,976	| IOT036 |	Fire TV we can still turn off lights
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:07,072	| IOT036 |	You can still get information from Alexa and actually I don't know if you knew this station
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:11,424	| IOT036 |	The information pops up on the screen almost on like like giant cards
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,728	| IOT036 |	So if you want to Wikipedia entry
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,520	| IOT036 |	Our traffic or weather
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:18,848	| IOT036 |	It'll actually visit visually show that on firetv I did not know that
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:24,736	| IOT036 |	Oh man I wish I had known that cuz I would have gotten the Fire TV cuz it was on sale for Black Friday
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,528	| IOT036 |	That's what it was
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:30,880	| IOT036 |	Cyber Monday 2 and might still be on sale I don't know how much did you buy it for
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:33,184	| IOT036 |	$75 of the voice remote
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,536	| IOT036 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,048	| IOT036 |	Well
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:45,216	| IOT036 |	He was it's okay it's interesting thing the voice remote looks like the same voice remote you use for an Echo
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:52,128	| IOT036 |	They just pictures Bluetooth. I suspected the Fire TV and it looks like the identical products and maybe didn't even need to buy The Voice remote
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,432	| IOT036 |	How much is it without the voice real
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,992	| IOT036 |	We can just get a Fire TV stick
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,808	| IOT036 |	First low well over the holidays it was $25
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,344	| IOT036 |	That does the same thing
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,624	| IOT036 |	The same thing as my Chrome
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,208	| IOT036 |	Basically yeah yeah if you have a
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:10,816	| IOT036 |	A voice remote for your Echo you could probably Bluetooth connected to the
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,120	| IOT036 |	TV stick and use that in lieu of
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:14,656	| IOT036 |	Chemically speaking to the echo
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,936	| IOT036 |	I do have
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,216	| IOT036 |	Voice remote for the echo
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,240	| IOT036 |	We could see if they work together
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:22,336	| IOT036 |	It's 3999 for TV stick now
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:25,408	| IOT036 |	Papa
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,480	| IOT036 |	Killer all the sea in the cards up cuz
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,272	| IOT036 |	One of the things we actually do
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:32,576	| IOT036 |	With the echo is my daughter
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:35,648	| IOT036 |	Isn't a Spanish Immersion program in so
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:40,512	| IOT036 |	We ask the echo what something is in Spanish and she sends the translation
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:41,792	| IOT036 |	To the cards
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,608	| IOT036 |	But it would be kind of neat
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:49,216	| IOT036 |	To send it to the TV instead of to my phone cuz then what happens is my daughter takes my phone
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,312	| IOT036 |	Well the full price Fire TV is 99
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,872	| IOT036 |	With a voice remote the Fire TV stick
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,408	| IOT036 |	Does not come with a voice remote
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,456	| IOT036 |	It's $40
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,784	| IOT036 |	But you could probably use your existing is my guess
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:04,832	| IOT036 |	Well
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:09,440	| IOT036 |	It's something to think about maybe maybe I'll just wait for the Fire TV stick to go on sale again
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,208	| IOT036 |	Hey go
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,976	| IOT036 |	All right
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,000	| IOT036 |	Will awesome
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:15,328	| IOT036 |	Let us not take much more time on our section of the show because
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:19,424	| IOT036 |	I want us to get to heaven so he can talk to us more about
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,704	| IOT036 |	The pi zero
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:23,520	| IOT036 |	And he's also going to give us some advice which
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,824	| IOT036 |	I want to spoil it for you guys but
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,616	| IOT036 |	I'd inspire me
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:30,688	| IOT036 |	Actually fulfill my New Year's resolution from
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,456	| IOT036 |	This last year
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:33,248	| IOT036 |	And it was
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:40,160	| IOT036 |	But if I told you it would say would tell you was the advice so you're at your
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,184	| IOT036 |	So stay tuned
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:47,584	| IOT036 |	We are fat
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:50,400	| IOT036 |	Did the holiday break with an awesome guest
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,168	| IOT036 |	This is
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,704	| IOT036 |	Evan Upton
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,728	| IOT036 |	Who is
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,008	| IOT036 |	Oh gosh
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,824	| IOT036 |	I don't know the head of the Raspberry Pi Foundation
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,360	| IOT036 |	Make a little generic here because
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,432	| IOT036 |	What is your actual title
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:09,600	| IOT036 |	And so I'm one of the founders of the foundation and I'm currently the chief executive of Ralphie Pike Trading
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:13,952	| IOT036 |	Which is the for the foundations of Charity and it has a
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,512	| IOT036 |	Have a surgery
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,304	| IOT036 |	Restart the engineering and marketing
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,120	| IOT036 |	Got it
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:21,632	| IOT036 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,912	| IOT036 |	So you know
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,240	| IOT036 |	It's a longer arm so maybe then then you will look
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:27,520	| IOT036 |	New
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| IOT036 |	The most accurate
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,616	| IOT036 |	I'm always looking for the most accurate and
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| IOT036 |	That's what we want
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:36,224	| IOT036 |	Alright so you guys had big news on on Thanksgiving day here
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,016	| IOT036 |	In America and
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,064	| IOT036 |	November
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:43,648	| IOT036 |	26 / the UK you guys released the
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| IOT036 |	Pi zero
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:45,952	| IOT036 |	Tell us about the
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:47,744	| IOT036 |	$5 Pi zero
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,840	| IOT036 |	Let's let me think
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,632	| IOT036 |	0 is
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,400	| IOT036 |	Cheapest
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:57,984	| IOT036 |	Raspberry Pi tonight so when we been around for about
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,496	| IOT036 |	3 + 1/2
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:03,104	| IOT036 |	We kind of kicked off with this $25 the idea building
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,432	| IOT036 |	$25
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:09,504	| IOT036 |	Answer most of our existence we had a
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:12,832	| IOT036 |	2520 $25 entry level product
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:15,136	| IOT036 |	$35 Deluxe products
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:21,536	| IOT036 |	Product ads
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,072	| IOT036 |	Reasonable person
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:27,680	| IOT036 |	I'm sorry I should
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:31,264	| IOT036 |	For people who don't know what the pie is it's a linux-based computer
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:34,592	| IOT036 |	Kevin actually has one and he uses it to run a
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:41,248	| IOT036 |	Actually runs a server off of his router that I think he uses a printer or some sort of thing in his house
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,528	| IOT036 |	But you can use this to do
EDL	00:29:43,296	00:29:45,088	| IOT036 |	Any number of things you can
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:48,416	| IOT036 |	I actually had one for a while and I didn't use it for much
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,744	| IOT036 |	Cuz I'm more of a nerd
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:57,888	| IOT036 |	Shame on me no I have a
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:06,336	| IOT036 |	You can now if it is telling us what the pi zero is I just want to people
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,640	| IOT036 |	Delicious
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:17,344	| IOT036 |	Can we build a little credit card-sized computer that cost about 25 bucks
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,416	| IOT036 |	About the same amount you
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,696	| IOT036 |	Tie for a school textbook
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:23,744	| IOT036 |	Can we make a
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:27,840	| IOT036 |	Can we make a little PC for kids a little program located kids
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,864	| IOT036 |	They cost
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:33,728	| IOT036 |	I'm so weeping we three and a half years now we've been selling
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:35,520	| IOT036 |	Several iterations of
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,288	| IOT036 |	This product
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:40,896	| IOT036 |	Priceless
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,456	| IOT036 |	It's going really well we sold
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,016	| IOT036 |	787 million

EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,024	| IOT036 |	And prosper
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,168	| IOT036 |	But that we still keep meeting people
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:05,216	| IOT036 |	So who who say things like
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:08,288	| IOT036 |	Yeah you know I'm interested in getting in
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,848	| IOT036 |	Getting involved in in Computing and programming
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,200	| IOT036 |	I'm Point taking the plunge
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| IOT036 |	It's
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,784	| IOT036 |	It becomes apparent to us
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:20,576	| IOT036 |	Reno
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,624	| IOT036 |	$25 35
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:26,720	| IOT036 |	It's a significant amount of money is enough money
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,000	| IOT036 |	You might choose not to spend
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:28,512	| IOT036 |	Michuzi
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:31,328	| IOT036 |	So over the Lost year what week
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:39,264	| IOT036 |	Trying to figure out how we can make something for people who care about this sort of thing this is a 1 gigahertz
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,032	| IOT036 |	Processor with
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,848	| IOT036 |	512 megabytes of RAM
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,384	| IOT036 |	Right now
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,968	| IOT036 |	You got to warm get pressure ulcer

EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,528	| IOT036 |	So I've got this
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:07,296	| IOT036 |	Spend
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:08,064	| IOT036 |	You know

EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:19,328	| IOT036 |	INE time I see cool cheap Computing devices and you know the pie Community is
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,864	| IOT036 |	Amazing
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:24,448	| IOT036 |	I mean people people build supercomputers with the sayings they're just a bunch
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:29,312	| IOT036 |	I love them through the nuttiest people in the face of the planet and they talked about what they're doing and they're really helpful
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,592	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,640	| IOT036 |	What do you think
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:36,480	| IOT036 |	For the people out there who are listening in her like I want to build with this is
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:38,784	| IOT036 |	Cheap and finding I can blow stuff up
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:41,344	| IOT036 |	Because I feel like that's kind of our listeners mindset sometime
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:45,184	| IOT036 |	Benign
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,048	| IOT036 |	Like I say
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:53,120	| IOT036 |	If you want to do iot tub stopper
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,656	| IOT036 |	What are you going to need to plug some soul

EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,128	| IOT036 |	Body so I would probably plug a
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,552	| IOT036 |	Attwifi
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:14,368	| IOT036 |	So I would be inclined to plug that into my single USB
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,632	| IOT036 |	An Eddy Max
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,936	| IOT036 |	USB Wi-Fi dongle
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:28,960	| IOT036 |	Take it out of its case
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,496	| IOT036 |	I've wrapped it up in concert
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,800	| IOT036 |	I've been sold an adult in the back
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,384	| IOT036 |	The pants only

EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:43,040	| IOT036 |	Wi-Fi adapter
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:46,880	| IOT036 |	Update on the Eric
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:52,000	| IOT036 |	Slightly
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:58,144	| IOT036 |	Not waived in Wi-Fi
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:58,912	| IOT036 |	I just got
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,936	| IOT036 |	You're not going to come up with
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:03,008	| IOT036 |	So why of getting Wi-Fi conceivably Bluetooth
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,568	| IOT036 |	I'm on to that and that's going to be there
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,408	| IOT036 |	Yeah cuz I feel like I've got like a $15 Bluetooth
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,712	| IOT036 |	Kind of radio that's just a straight-up
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:15,040	| IOT036 |	E90 little Bluetooth radio size of like maybe
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,368	| IOT036 |	I mean it's like a little like a nickel
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,416	| IOT036 |	So if I stuck this with the
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,440	| IOT036 |	Computer
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:27,840	| IOT036 |	That I could actually make some of my presents that I can give my presence detectors a little bit more intelligence that I've been kind of blue
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,352	| IOT036 |	Looking for
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:30,144	| IOT036 |	Outside of the
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,656	| IOT036 |	Proprietary
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,776	| IOT036 |	So that
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,336	| IOT036 |	This wonderful thing about usb
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:41,920	| IOT036 |	You know USPS is going to lowest common denominator
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:43,712	| IOT036 |	Stand up for collecting stuff together
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:44,736	| IOT036 |	If you go on
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:46,272	| IOT036 |	If you go on eBay
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,064	| IOT036 |	Amazon
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:50,880	| IOT036 |	You'll find
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:56,512	| IOT036 |	Really really really really cheap wireless USB dongle for every conceivable Wallace
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,584	| IOT036 |	That's why we picked
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:01,632	| IOT036 |	The wife
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:06,752	| IOT036 |	Because it just means you just got buy things for a dollar
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,312	| IOT036 |	And it'll give you some kind of right here
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:13,152	| IOT036 |	Which is providing the brights
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,968	| IOT036 |	I think we can run Linux
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:18,272	| IOT036 |	I'm a man
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:24,928	| IOT036 |	So the people that want to use it for a little hunger it peyote project

EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:31,584	| IOT036 |	Effectively the weekend
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:35,424	| IOT036 |	Okay and how long it take for a power consumption perspective
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,960	| IOT036 |	What am I looking at
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:39,008	| IOT036 |	At the power consumption for this board
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,312	| IOT036 |	And can you talk to me in terms of like battery life
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,848	| IOT036 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:47,712	| IOT036 |	So ya like it well
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:49,504	| IOT036 |	Starting off from the vault
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:53,344	| IOT036 |	Outside the thing drawers
EDL	00:39:55,392	00:39:57,696	| IOT036 |	Something like that
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,256	| IOT036 |	It's something like
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:03,328	| IOT036 |	Between 150 million
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:12,544	| IOT036 |	Actually
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:18,944	| IOT036 |	USB device compatibility
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,736	| IOT036 |	G303 vs Rey
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,320	| IOT036 |	It sits on the
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,088	| IOT036 |	You're without doing any
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,136	| IOT036 |	It's
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:27,648	| IOT036 |	Under Hawthorne
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:30,976	| IOT036 |	Consumption
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:31,488	| IOT036 |	Keep this thing
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:35,072	| IOT036 |	Just running for a very nice on seeing the bowl light
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:45,056	| IOT036 |	You know 45 hours
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:51,712	| IOT036 |	Something like that particular lady
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:55,552	| IOT036 |	You know it really yeah
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,320	| IOT036 |	It'll keep going
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:59,392	| IOT036 |	I need you prepared to do
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,672	| IOT036 |	Clock speed
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:06,816	| IOT036 |	I stopped turning things off on the on the CPU on the device you can probably squeeze another older my vagine out of them
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:07,840	| IOT036 |	All right
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:10,656	| IOT036 |	So maybe I should look for someone to start squeezing
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:13,728	| IOT036 |	But doing the work for me cuz I am not
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,520	| IOT036 |	I'm not that kind of engineer
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,800	| IOT036 |	To like start turning things off of this
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:20,384	| IOT036 |	Pretty good about about the pie Community mentioned
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,272	| IOT036 |	Is that generally Google is your friend not right so
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,808	| IOT036 |	If you want if you want to

EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:32,928	| IOT036 |	I would guess the doodling
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:39,840	| IOT036 |	I want to reduce the packets option of my Raspberry Pi Bolton turn off $100 goals
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:46,496	| IOT036 |	A people who done these things already
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:50,080	| IOT036 |	People being that before you know Blaziken trial
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:51,616	| IOT036 |	United States
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:53,151	| IOT036 |	The stuff's going to work
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,199	| IOT036 |	How do you confirm we're here
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,247	| IOT036 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:58,271	| IOT036 |	This is awesome
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:00,063	| IOT036 |	So let's talk a little bit about
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:01,343	| IOT036 |	How did you
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,391	| IOT036 |	I read somewhere that
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:05,695	| IOT036 |	I believe was it
EDL	00:42:07,487	00:42:09,791	| IOT036 |	Did Eric Schmidt tell you to actually
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:12,863	| IOT036 |	Yeah yeah this is business advice from Eric
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:15,935	| IOT036 |	This is one of these this is one of these really weird,
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:25,151	| IOT036 |	But you know you see them
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,687	| IOT036 |	You seem to be very effective
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:29,759	| IOT036 |	And
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:33,343	| IOT036 |	Can be hard to tell when someone is effective because they
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,367	| IOT036 |	Fact beaker's lab
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:37,695	| IOT036 |	Over there if I could because I would like it
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,583	| IOT036 |	But I have it I decide to Charleston beach
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,095	| IOT036 |	America
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,655	| IOT036 |	About 3 years ago
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:47,679	| IOT036 |	Estados mm
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,727	| IOT036 |	Yeah II
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:53,055	| IOT036 |	Google Chrome
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:53,567	| IOT036 |	To distribute
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:58,175	| IOT036 |	I'm dumb
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:00,223	| IOT036 |	He was there at the announcement
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,807	| IOT036 |	Volume
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:06,367	| IOT036 |	I'll stay
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:07,647	| IOT036 |	Bealls me what are you doing
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:12,767	| IOT036 |	A bit more expensive
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:16,095	| IOT036 |	And he told me I was an idiot
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:19,167	| IOT036 |	That was absolutely the wrong thing to do and that I should try be cheap
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:20,959	| IOT036 |	But
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:24,287	| IOT036 |	That I should try to strive to find ways to make
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:26,079	| IOT036 |	The product
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,615	| IOT036 |	Closer to free
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:33,247	| IOT036 |	And so I went back to the end because
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:37,855	| IOT036 |	Because
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:39,391	| IOT036 |	Cheapness
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,415	| IOT036 |	Leads the volume
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,743	| IOT036 |	Volume leads to
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:45,279	| IOT036 |	Ubiquiti
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:46,815	| IOT036 |	Lately
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:51,935	| IOT036 |	So I went back to the office and I cancelled
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:54,239	| IOT036 |	Making more expensive
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:01,663	| IOT036 |	If we did all this
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:02,175	| IOT036 |	Eventually
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,367	| IOT036 |	If we take it late
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,903	| IOT036 |	Good morning Spencer
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:15,743	| IOT036 |	What we did was this
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:18,559	| IOT036 |	Tie-dye longer harder route
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:27,775	| IOT036 |	CrossPointe
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:31,615	| IOT036 |	Yellow
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:33,663	| IOT036 |	I was just thinking about how do we take
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:36,479	| IOT036 |	Speech about you know how do we make something cheaper
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,247	| IOT036 |	Halloween
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:40,575	| IOT036 |	You're welcome or you're welcome you remove from the pile
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,855	| IOT036 |	What compromises
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:48,767	| IOT036 |	Did to be cheaper the first fruits of that was his toward this reduction of all entry level price point from 25 to 20
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:49,279	| IOT036 |	You lost yet
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:54,143	| IOT036 |	Ultimate consequence of this
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,215	| IOT036 |	Nice all right
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:45:02,335	| IOT036 |	I've answered an interesting question which is there is Eric Schmidt small lucky
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:08,991	| IOT036 |	There is a 12 we'll see I mean so far you sold out
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:11,295	| IOT036 |	When can we expect
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:11,807	| IOT036 |	To be able to buy more
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,111	| IOT036 |	I'm so we made
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:16,159	| IOT036 |	Mm so the first post
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:19,231	| IOT036 |	Lawrence Municipal Dynamite couple thousand today
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:22,303	| IOT036 |	I would expect
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:24,863	| IOT036 |	These will make their way into channel in the neck
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:26,655	| IOT036 |	She dies
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:32,287	| IOT036 |	We actually need to
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:34,335	| IOT036 |	Front of a magazine
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:37,919	| IOT036 |	So we have our own magazine called the magpie
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,735	| IOT036 |	I'm we put on the front cover
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:47,135	| IOT036 |	We have some
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:47,903	| IOT036 |	You get up
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:49,439	| IOT036 |	You got free
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:51,743	| IOT036 |	La Frontera
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:58,399	| IOT036 |	And the rest will get put into reverse distribution channels in the UK in the US
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,031	| IOT036 |	Ten Thousand Fists
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,615	| IOT036 |	Which is actually quite slow for us
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,431	| IOT036 |	I mean in terms of the big product
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:11,711	| IOT036 |	Weebill
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:15,039	| IOT036 |	What would it be it would be
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,831	| IOT036 |	60 of 70000
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:20,159	| IOT036 |	Aquatis bowls calibration first of the month
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,719	| IOT036 |	Hard to wrap it up
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:26,047	| IOT036 |	Got it
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:28,351	| IOT036 |	All right and then in the spirit of a
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:30,143	| IOT036 |	In the spirit of Schmidt
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:34,495	| IOT036 |	What would your advice be to people who are listening and
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:35,263	| IOT036 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:40,895	| IOT036 |	Building their own product or even learning learning to code I mean there's lots of people
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,175	| IOT036 |	Who look up to you
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,479	| IOT036 |	Ucumberlands
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:49,087	| IOT036 |	You come across people who have
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,391	| IOT036 |	Like an idea you get these people who
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:57,791	| IOT036 |	I just need to find
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:00,863	| IOT036 |	I'm am
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:03,423	| IOT036 |	That's iron
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:09,823	| IOT036 |	You going to have a technical
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:15,967	| IOT036 |	Albertsons
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:18,271	| IOT036 |	This is probably going to want
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:20,575	| IOT036 |	Do you have
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:24,159	| IOT036 |	Technical capability comes
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:28,511	| IOT036 |	So down song Sometimes in terms of I set up
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:29,791	| IOT036 |	In terms of how I think about
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:31,327	| IOT036 |	Problems
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:33,887	| IOT036 |	I know what you think about

EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:47,359	| IOT036 |	So
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:49,919	| IOT036 |	Learn to code

EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:11,423	| IOT036 |	I'm at cliches because
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:12,703	| IOT036 |	Because
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,727	| IOT036 |	People ignore them
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:18,847	| IOT036 |	Things are well known to be

EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:27,039	| IOT036 |	Exactly I was going to say
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:29,343	| IOT036 |	I've been meaning to learn to code for you know
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:31,903	| IOT036 |	3 years now and
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:34,207	| IOT036 |	Still haven't so maybe this is this is the
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:37,279	| IOT036 |	It's like it's like those speed is broken
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:40,607	| IOT036 |	Turn off Bluetooth
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:44,447	| IOT036 |	Alright well thank you so much for coming on the show this week
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:46,495	| IOT036 |	And I'm excited to
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:48,543	| IOT036 |	Test out the pi zero
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:53,663	| IOT036 |	I get a chance to order wine
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:59,807	| IOT036 |	Hey thanks for listening and we'll see you next week
