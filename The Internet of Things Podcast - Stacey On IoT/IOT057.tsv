EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:03,744	| IOT057 |	Saw tons of pictures of this but
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:06,304	| IOT057 |	All the pictures that I saw I don't see any better backs
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,632	| IOT057 |	They did say that
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:13,728	| IOT057 |	The dress was so difficult for her to move around in it took her husband
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:15,776	| IOT057 |	And I think Zac Posen I don't know
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:17,568	| IOT057 |	The designer
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:18,592	| IOT057 |	To help her life
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:19,616	| IOT057 |	Maneuver
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:22,176	| IOT057 |	Yeah I think they built this around her
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:23,968	| IOT057 |	Panda
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:28,064	| IOT057 |	So for the most part I was really disappointed because all the celebrities were like
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:29,088	| IOT057 |	Hey
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:32,160	| IOT057 |	Fatima that fashion Gala which is held or the Met fashion
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| IOT057 |	Just how old

EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:47,520	| IOT057 |	Really awesome
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,104	| IOT057 |	Why not Kevin
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,384	| IOT057 |	Sheepadoodles
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:56,736	| IOT057 |	Which Beatles t-shirt but then again what day am I not wearing
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:05,184	| IOT057 |	So I thought hers was also because it look like clothing
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:07,488	| IOT057 |	But
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:11,072	| IOT057 |	Dress that did have some kind of tech associated with it
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,096	| IOT057 |	Who's Carolina
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| IOT057 |	Dakota
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,192	| IOT057 |	Wore this dress actually
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,704	| IOT057 |	Design
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:18,496	| IOT057 |	VnExpress
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:21,312	| IOT057 |	It was
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:24,896	| IOT057 |	White looking dress in this house little flowers embroidered on the train
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,456	| IOT057 |	And they responded apparent
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:32,832	| IOT057 |	You know it's funny you say that I didn't know about Carolina's dress I was going to say it would have been cool if
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:39,232	| IOT057 |	Claire Danes dress had some type of connectivity in it so the colors change based on maybe where she was in the room
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,768	| IOT057 |	Close to or someone
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:43,072	| IOT057 |	But now karolina stress had some kind of
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,864	| IOT057 |	Connectivity Tech in it
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:47,424	| IOT057 |	Yes so her dress was designed by is it March
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,216	| IOT057 |	Marchesa marchesa
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:53,568	| IOT057 |	I haven't watch Project Runway in a while but I think
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,848	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:58,944	| IOT057 |	Marchesa design this and it had a hundred fifty LED connected flowers
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:03,808	| IOT057 |	What they did is the
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,880	| IOT057 |	Sojoy patients excitement encouragement curiosity
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,536	| IOT057 |	Colortool
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,120	| IOT057 |	That uses color psychology to match emotions
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,936	| IOT057 |	So what's and shows colors
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,496	| IOT057 |	Also aligned with Marquez
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,264	| IOT057 |	Brandt
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,800	| IOT057 |	Of course
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,200	| IOT057 |	Mark s Allen
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,576	| IOT057 |	That actually on address because
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:37,344	| IOT057 |	A yellow dress
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,440	| IOT057 |	Your LEDs were like lighting up red
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,376	| IOT057 |	If you did a tweet tagged Met Gala or
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,680	| IOT057 |	That would change
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,704	| IOT057 |	Colors on
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:58,592	| IOT057 |	See that's the part I like I mean other people have influence over what happens that's pretty wicked
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,384	| IOT057 |	They say even the fabric
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,408	| IOT057 |	Which was tool
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,176	| IOT057 |	Was chosen through
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,552	| IOT057 |	People think would look good on this dress
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,368	| IOT057 |	Why don't we why don't we just say thinking now except cognitive
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,952	| IOT057 |	Those two were my favorite dresses
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,000	| IOT057 |	Is there a couple of nice dresses but
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,815	| IOT057 |	Overall for the sea
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,327	| IOT057 |	Maps
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,351	| IOT057 |	Immaculate
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,399	| IOT057 |	Man and machine
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:25,215	| IOT057 |	There was
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,263	| IOT057 |	Blade Runner
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| IOT057 |	You know
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,055	| IOT057 |	Metal
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:31,871	| IOT057 |	Silver
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:38,783	| IOT057 |	Yeah that's that's that movies from the 80s 90s and so on but now you take a look at some of the more recent movies
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,575	| IOT057 |	There is no physical
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,623	| IOT057 |	Body you think of her
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:47,743	| IOT057 |	At work ex machina which you couldn't even eventually tell it was a
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:48,255	| IOT057 |	Android
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,863	| IOT057 |	So if we go with fashion from her all I remember is
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,375	| IOT057 |	Ridiculous pants
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,167	| IOT057 |	Well
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:00,543	| IOT057 |	That's that wasn't the best view of the future at least I hope not keep my Beatles shirts thank you
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,823	| IOT057 |	So right now
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,359	| IOT057 |	When fashion meets
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,639	| IOT057 |	Tech
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,943	| IOT057 |	I have to say that fashion is doing a terrible job
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,015	| IOT057 |	Yeah those two dresses were
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,039	| IOT057 |	Fine
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:16,927	| IOT057 |	I would love to see actually some people you know Adafruit always that the
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,463	| IOT057 |	Company in Brooklyn that sells kind of
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:18,975	| IOT057 |	Connected gadgets
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:24,863	| IOT057 |	They actually have some really cool designs I've run across some cool designs on their blog before
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,143	| IOT057 |	Things like
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,935	| IOT057 |	Clothes that interact with
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,823	| IOT057 |	The lights on the skirt with a round in the
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,103	| IOT057 |	Motion of the ISS
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,663	| IOT057 |	Which is kind of a fun way to
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,991	| IOT057 |	Right right
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,575	| IOT057 |	Think about it
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,671	| IOT057 |	Estimate does a similar theme wish they won't
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,207	| IOT057 |	I expect better
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| IOT057 |	All right
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,511	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| IOT057 |	After my foray the fashion there
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:55,839	| IOT057 |	Where everybody at
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,703	| IOT057 |	I'm not going to talk about
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:04,543	| IOT057 |	I have been promising you guys a review of this little
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,359	| IOT057 |	Pebblebee Stone
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,639	| IOT057 |	Which is
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,175	| IOT057 |	Two things
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,711	| IOT057 |	It's a Bluetooth tracker
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,759	| IOT057 |	Much like tile
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,855	| IOT057 |	And it is also a one button pressed
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,951	| IOT057 |	Do a couple things associated with your phone and theoretically
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,719	| IOT057 |	Also can I
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,487	| IOT057 |	Who is this
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,791	| IOT057 |	Send that programmable button
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,583	| IOT057 |	Nice
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,911	| IOT057 |	The size of a quarter
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,703	| IOT057 |	It cost about $30
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,215	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,519	| IOT057 |	It works as a Tracker
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,287	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:39,615	| IOT057 |	That's pretty easy it has a nice little nap in her face on it that you
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:42,175	| IOT057 |	If you press the map so it's not even making them up all the time
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,735	| IOT057 |	Depressant
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,343	| IOT057 |	Much to my chagrin
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,391	| IOT057 |	I could not get the if this then that
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:51,903	| IOT057 |	Functionality
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,487	| IOT057 |	You get to options
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:55,999	| IOT057 |	What does program
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,535	| IOT057 |	Press
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,071	| IOT057 |	And a long press
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,863	| IOT057 |	So I've done
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,471	| IOT057 |	Quick press being call my husband so
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,055	| IOT057 |	I don't know if I'm feeling lazy or attacked
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,823	| IOT057 |	I'll call my husband
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,639	| IOT057 |	Or you can have it ring an alarm on your phone
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,967	| IOT057 |	Which is nice if you're looking for your phone and you have the same type
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,735	| IOT057 |	Yorkies or something
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| IOT057 |	And you can also use it to
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,063	| IOT057 |	Take picture
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:25,695	| IOT057 |	Which I was playing with before the show where if I did a long press it would open up the camera on my phone and
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:31,327	| IOT057 |	I was wondering
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,095	| IOT057 |	Yes
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,607	| IOT057 |	It was great
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,911	| IOT057 |	Glamour Shots
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:35,935	| IOT057 |	Be quiet
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| IOT057 |	Busted
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,287	| IOT057 |	This is not a wearable device this is something you might
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,079	| IOT057 |	Clip to something or stick to something
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,591	| IOT057 |	Kind of like
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,127	| IOT057 |	It's like a little keychain thing
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,663	| IOT057 |	Yeah I guess
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:52,063	| IOT057 |	Sure these little plastic covers so
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,343	| IOT057 |	My plastic covers came
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| IOT057 |	Blue white
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:08:01,535	| IOT057 |	Remind me of the Amazon Dash buttons only you have more control over obviously what
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:06,655	| IOT057 |	It can do if you want to hook it up with this pissed on that and also works as tracker and so on so
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:09,471	| IOT057 |	But the concept is is essential the same
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,751	| IOT057 |	Yes it is in
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,055	| IOT057 |	I kind of liked it because there
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:17,407	| IOT057 |	Really small and relatively inexpensive
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,431	| IOT057 |	Your home if you wanted
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,199	| IOT057 |	But
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,967	| IOT057 |	Here's the butt
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT057 |	I could not get it
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,807	| IOT057 |	Connect with my assistant
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:28,415	| IOT057 |	Account I verified it a whole bunch of times and even made recipes and if thinks it's verified but
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,767	| IOT057 |	Keystone doesn't so none of my if this and that recipes
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,535	| IOT057 |	It's work yet
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,839	| IOT057 |	So I'm kind of sad cuz I'm
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,655	| IOT057 |	I think it'd be kind of fun to have on my keychain
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:44,799	| IOT057 |	So I never lose my keys but then I'm also able to
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,823	| IOT057 |	Close at my house routine
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:49,407	| IOT057 |	Or if you're if you're cold
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,479	| IOT057 |	Just a one touch press and boom on your nest thermostat
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| IOT057 |	I have is true it is limited
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,599	| IOT057 |	Information
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,695	| IOT057 |	Picture of a whole bunch of buttons
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| IOT057 |	Buttons everywhere
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:11,935	| IOT057 |	It looks like I have some additional sensors in there because I'm seeing you can get notifications not just based on the Bluetooth range but also
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,215	| IOT057 |	Temperature in motion
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:22,175	| IOT057 |	So like like an example they're using you put in your car and maybe you want to know how warm it is in your
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,943	| IOT057 |	Your car
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:26,271	| IOT057 |	The baby want to remotely open the windows or something to cool it off I don't know but
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:29,855	| IOT057 |	You can put it somewhere and get notifications based on temperature in motion
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,439	| IOT057 |	There you go
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| IOT057 |	I like this
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:38,303	| IOT057 |	Doing a press and hold to share your GPS location with someone
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,583	| IOT057 |	Since it's on your
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| IOT057 |	You could actually have the one in your keyring
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,983	| IOT057 |	You can program the
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,031	| IOT057 |	Button press to be like
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,311	| IOT057 |	This is where I am
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,847	| IOT057 |	And you can only send it to one person
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,639	| IOT057 |	Right now where you at
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,015	| IOT057 |	550
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,551	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| IOT057 |	You know
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,879	| IOT057 |	Yes no no no
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| IOT057 |	Bakery
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,463	| IOT057 |	So that is
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,767	| IOT057 |	Sofar impression
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| IOT057 |	Applebee's
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,583	| IOT057 |	End
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,095	| IOT057 |	Have been
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:19,519	| IOT057 |	I have a man that's because I don't think this happened till after the last
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,543	| IOT057 |	Show son
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,567	| IOT057 |	Disgusted but
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:26,687	| IOT057 |	Google onhub just got if this then that support a few days ago
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,783	| IOT057 |	Which is good news so basically anytime you
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:33,087	| IOT057 |	Connect a device to your onhub router
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:36,159	| IOT057 |	You could fire something off through if this then that
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,695	| IOT057 |	I will say this
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:43,583	| IOT057 |	Tried it a couple times once on Sundays over the weekend and then again just before the show
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,399	| IOT057 |	And I'm not sure where the issue is but it's
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,703	| IOT057 |	Not working a hundred percent for me and
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:54,079	| IOT057 |	I will keep digging to see what the issue is cuz it could be at any number things could be Beyond hub
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:57,663	| IOT057 |	Cashing what devices are still connected versus Western what isn't
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:01,503	| IOT057 |	It could be as I've set it up to use the wrong device who knows
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:04,319	| IOT057 |	But I thought hey this would be great when I come home
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:07,135	| IOT057 |	Nighttime can I use this as a proximity to
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,207	| IOT057 |	I get home I'm still in the driveway driving into the garage
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:12,767	| IOT057 |	But my phone will connect to the onhub so why not
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:16,863	| IOT057 |	Use if this then that that says hey if my phone connects to the onhub then
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,911	| IOT057 |	Runaway shortcut that turns on a light
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:23,519	| IOT057 |	Interior that sounds good I tried about four or five times and it's really only work one time
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,311	| IOT057 |	And it was
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,591	| IOT057 |	Very delayed
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,639	| IOT057 |	Is at least 30 seconds till 8 so I
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,431	| IOT057 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:30,943	| IOT057 |	Surprise
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| IOT057 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:37,343	| IOT057 |	So I keep looking behind here we try to just before the show and I keep expecting the light to turn on 30 minutes later
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,415	| IOT057 |	The good news is there's if it's the nest
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,463	| IOT057 |	Support and it could be something maybe with
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| IOT057 |	In a wink
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,279	| IOT057 |	Could be like I said with the onhub
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,047	| IOT057 |	Table
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:51,423	| IOT057 |	Could be me I don't know but it's not quite working well enough for me yet so I'm going to continue to play with
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,983	| IOT057 |	All right I should also bring up
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| IOT057 |	Because this happened after we recorded our last show.
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| IOT057 |	This
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,871	| IOT057 |	Is a big project
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,919	| IOT057 |	Did you see the guy who hacked
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| IOT057 |	Tesla with the Amazon
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:08,063	| IOT057 |	I did not exist it would be starting with the echo
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,599	| IOT057 |	Even better
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:13,951	| IOT057 |	Actually connected his Tesla
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,743	| IOT057 |	To the echo
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,559	| IOT057 |	He
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| IOT057 |	Is Tesla
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,887	| IOT057 |	Leave the garage
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,167	| IOT057 |	Ice Christian Park itself
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:32,639	| IOT057 |	This was actually a really neat video and I had a bunch of people send it to me like
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:36,991	| IOT057 |	What does
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:40,063	| IOT057 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:44,159	| IOT057 |	The keyword
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,183	| IOT057 |	What was the name of the car in Knight Rider
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,143	| IOT057 |	What's the resulting event
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,215	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| IOT057 |	2
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,775	| IOT057 |	Connect to his Tesla
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,103	| IOT057 |	Echo Dot
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,663	| IOT057 |	10 called an unofficial Tesla API
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| IOT057 |	Trigger the car.
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,711	| IOT057 |	Take action
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,015	| IOT057 |	So what it is
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,783	| IOT057 |	In the car
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,319	| IOT057 |	It open the car
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:12,831	| IOT057 |	His homeland
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,367	| IOT057 |	Tesla
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:20,255	| IOT057 |	Automatically open your garage
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,791	| IOT057 |	Summon commands that is on the
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,815	| IOT057 |	Trustable
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,839	| IOT057 |	Work on the Newark
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,375	| IOT057 |	Roku
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,007	| IOT057 |	It is a very cool hack
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:38,431	| IOT057 |	Yeah not for the faint-of-heart obviously if you're going to want to be a developer to really take advantage of this but
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,479	| IOT057 |	Also kind of scary
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,527	| IOT057 |	I think it shows a lot of promise
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,807	| IOT057 |	Although if you
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,087	| IOT057 |	If you imagine walking by the
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:45,855	| IOT057 |	Disguise house
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,367	| IOT057 |	You're like
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| IOT057 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,999	| IOT057 |	Chicago come pick you up
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| IOT057 |	You like nice
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,559	| IOT057 |	I like that you remember to open
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,071	| IOT057 |	Garage door
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:00,703	| IOT057 |	It's all in the flow you know he probably flow chart of the whole thing out
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,239	| IOT057 |	Garage door open yes no
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,311	| IOT057 |	Which brings up a good point
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,127	| IOT057 |	When you were programming things for the connected home
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:14,527	| IOT057 |	More complicated
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,551	| IOT057 |	But let you get
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:18,879	| IOT057 |	Really complicated and even things like wink will let you build these robots
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,439	| IOT057 |	Have several actions taken
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:24,767	| IOT057 |	Place it's actually worthwhile to think before you actually
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,047	| IOT057 |	Program
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,351	| IOT057 |	Clean the stuff out because
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,655	| IOT057 |	Not historically done that and I found myself
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,423	| IOT057 |	Encountering things
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,215	| IOT057 |	Retrospect
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,751	| IOT057 |	I probably should have thought about
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:35,775	| IOT057 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| IOT057 |	So all right
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,591	| IOT057 |	Back to
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,359	| IOT057 |	Things
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,431	| IOT057 |	About things that don't work well
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,735	| IOT057 |	Survivor still on things
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,015	| IOT057 |	Which one would you like to have
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:49,343	| IOT057 |	Oh let's go with SmartThings
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:52,671	| IOT057 |	It's another show another week and where
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:53,951	| IOT057 |	Talking about
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:58,303	| IOT057 |	In fairness anywhere not making it up it's not like we're sitting here
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:08,287	| IOT057 |	We're not making this stuff up I mean this is news that is being reported and and we're sharing it and sharing our opinions on it so
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:11,359	| IOT057 |	I don't want people to think all these guys just bashed
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,895	| IOT057 |	It's not our fault if
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,175	| IOT057 |	Things keep happening in this
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,223	| IOT057 |	Most handsome
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,503	| IOT057 |	Some proof of concept
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,783	| IOT057 |	Exploit
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,087	| IOT057 |	Is letting hackers basically
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,623	| IOT057 |	Packing your house through SmartThings
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| IOT057 |	Yes and
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,975	| IOT057 |	Basically the gist of it is
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:30,559	| IOT057 |	That because SmartThings has a developer program
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,607	| IOT057 |	And has to approve apps
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,655	| IOT057 |	You could sneak a nap in that
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,959	| IOT057 |	Police malicious code
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:42,335	| IOT057 |	SmartThings is at
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:45,151	| IOT057 |	But this hasn't resulted in any problems for our users
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,199	| IOT057 |	So where we're at
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,223	| IOT057 |	Working on this
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,039	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:54,367	| IOT057 |	In this actually ties into something else
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,647	| IOT057 |	Which was that it has
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,695	| IOT057 |	Hired a director of engineering
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:58,975	| IOT057 |	Amazon
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:04,095	| IOT057 |	So in part of what they were talking about in this with this hiring
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,655	| IOT057 |	Is Robert Parker
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:13,311	| IOT057 |	In an interview that Parker did with the Verge he talked about actually establishing
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,103	| IOT057 |	Guard rails is was his term for it
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,383	| IOT057 |	In SmartThings
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,943	| IOT057 |	Improve the user experience
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,479	| IOT057 |	What is part of that
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:23,551	| IOT057 |	I think what we'll see is also ways that
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,623	| IOT057 |	You wouldn't have quite as much openness around as being able to
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:27,647	| IOT057 |	Deposit
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:32,255	| IOT057 |	Rich in the good news here is at the basis of this
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:32,767	| IOT057 |	Exploit
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:36,095	| IOT057 |	Really has to do with the Privileges that the smart app
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,631	| IOT057 |	Smartthing apps
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,911	| IOT057 |	Are given
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,447	| IOT057 |	This is something Samsung
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,215	| IOT057 |	Fix I mean
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,287	| IOT057 |	Take a look at the ARs Technica story that
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:47,871	| IOT057 |	55% of the 499 smart apps available during
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT057 |	The research
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,175	| IOT057 |	Call fighting over privileged
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:54,015	| IOT057 |	So you got to violating a core security tenant notice Pekingese
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:58,879	| IOT057 |	Privilege principle developers may not even be aware that their SmartThings apps
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,415	| IOT057 |	Have too much privilege
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:03,743	| IOT057 |	You know it's not like the developers are creating this stuff to do
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:08,351	| IOT057 |	Malicious things problem is I guess in the SDK or whatever
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:11,167	| IOT057 |	To ask just have too much power
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,679	| IOT057 |	So to speak
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:14,751	| IOT057 |	It's like when you don't give your teens a curfew
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:18,847	| IOT057 |	And you just let them run amok
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,615	| IOT057 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,895	| IOT057 |	Over-privileged
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,943	| IOT057 |	Going out at 3 a.m. nothing
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| IOT057 |	What happened to you
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,135	| IOT057 |	That's basically what this is about
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,023	| IOT057 |	Alex Hawkinson on the show to talk about this
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:37,791	| IOT057 |	Because
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,583	| IOT057 |	They had so many issues lately
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,375	| IOT057 |	I know that
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,519	| IOT057 |	They're really trying hard what they're trying to do in terms of being super open
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| IOT057 |	To challenge I agree
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,359	| IOT057 |	We hopefully will hear back
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,711	| IOT057 |	SmartThings
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,503	| IOT057 |	Met Gala
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,039	| IOT057 |	Onhub
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:03,391	| IOT057 |	We should probably talk really fast because we've got some corporate news
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,159	| IOT057 |	In the acquisition
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:11,071	| IOT057 |	So Microsoft acquired an Italian company called Solaire
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,143	| IOT057 |	I'm assuming that's how you call it it's Solair
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:17,983	| IOT057 |	Is it's about 5 years old
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,055	| IOT057 |	Which is provided
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:24,127	| IOT057 |	Device management
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,943	| IOT057 |	Device lifecycle management kind of stuff in the cloud
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:33,599	| IOT057 |	It really struck me that Microsoft with its Azure iot platform is going to go up real heavily against
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,367	| IOT057 |	PTC
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,695	| IOT057 |	Which I don't know if you guys remember
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,719	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,255	| IOT057 |	A rant
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,791	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,327	| IOT057 |	The idea is
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,375	| IOT057 |	Manufacturer
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:46,655	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:49,727	| IOT057 |	Say hey
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:53,567	| IOT057 |	Handle all the connectivity side of it and then
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,847	| IOT057 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| IOT057 |	Adoption center
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,175	| IOT057 |	This company I mean they're not
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:04,575	| IOT057 |	I did not hear them prior to but I do see that they've work with the Italian espresso machine manufacturer rent Zillow
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,855	| IOT057 |	That's correct
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:09,183	| IOT057 |	And also a food processing Machine Company Minerva
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,207	| IOT057 |	Make a group so
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,535	| IOT057 |	I said PTC acquired
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:14,559	| IOT057 |	A ranch
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:15,839	| IOT057 |	Which is wrong
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,631	| IOT057 |	Acquired
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,471	| IOT057 |	Stacy you're over privileged
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,495	| IOT057 |	I'm over privileged
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:25,567	| IOT057 |	As I was saying and I was like wait a second that's not right
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,615	| IOT057 |	All right PTC acquired
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:30,943	| IOT057 |	That was back at the end of 2014
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,479	| IOT057 |	It provides Cloud platform for
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:37,599	| IOT057 |	So as yours actually going up against these guys
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:39,647	| IOT057 |	Which is kind of cool
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,927	| IOT057 |	Different model
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| IOT057 |	Really focusing on both
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| IOT057 |	Truant
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,023	| IOT057 |	Industrial
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,559	| IOT057 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,327	| IOT057 |	Enterprise
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:53,215	| IOT057 |	So there's that
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:53,983	| IOT057 |	Power
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,263	| IOT057 |	Which
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| IOT057 |	Power
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:20:00,383	| IOT057 |	Used to provide energy management software for utilities and they kind of have been
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,687	| IOT057 |	How to say pivoting
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,527	| IOT057 |	Because I haven't done a full pivot but they kind of switch there
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,807	| IOT057 |	Way of being
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:12,415	| IOT057 |	They started out with kind of demand response and now they're trying
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:12,927	| IOT057 |	Provide light
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,975	| IOT057 |	Data services
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,279	| IOT057 |	Boston this week
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,583	| IOT057 |	For 532 million
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| IOT057 |	Great deal
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,935	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:27,519	| IOT057 |	You can see this working for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,591	| IOT057 |	The vertical Focus that a lot of the big companies that
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,615	| IOT057 |	I need to get
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,127	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,407	| IOT057 |	We should look for
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,967	| IOT057 |	Demtech wire specific expert
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,991	| IOT057 |	Batis in like
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:39,295	| IOT057 |	Manufacturing the internet
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,575	| IOT057 |	Utilities
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:42,623	| IOT057 |	Maybe medical devices in healthcare
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:45,183	| IOT057 |	So that was kind of my quit take from there
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,327	| IOT057 |	Now I will say
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:55,679	| IOT057 |	The oracles offer was half of our powers IPO price in 2014 so
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| IOT057 |	This was not like
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,007	| IOT057 |	Possibly the best outcome
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,543	| IOT057 |	I think it was
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,823	| IOT057 |	Still at a premium
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:04,127	| IOT057 |	30% of the stock at the time
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,151	| IOT057 |	Escalate the deal
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,271	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,855	| IOT057 |	If I don't talk about is
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:14,879	| IOT057 |	Google
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,928	| IOT057 |	And the return of Rick
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,464	| IOT057 |	Rick osterloh
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,488	| IOT057 |	Osterloh yes
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:26,144	| IOT057 |	What a great guy in my standard disclosure being that I can I work for Google I don't know anyting
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,936	| IOT057 |	About this other than what's been reported
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,728	| IOT057 |	Just to be clear
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,776	| IOT057 |	But I do know Rick osterloh
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,800	| IOT057 |	Great guy
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| IOT057 |	Ahi
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:37,152	| IOT057 |	Ran Motorola for quite a while the device is over there
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:43,040	| IOT057 |	When Motorola went to from Google to Lenovo he went along for the ride
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:49,696	| IOT057 |	And according to recode and it says it was it's been confirmed by Google spokesperson I don't know who that was
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,464	| IOT057 |	Whatever but
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,000	| IOT057 |	He's coming back
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,792	| IOT057 |	And whooping charges like
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,816	| IOT057 |	Everything
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,632	| IOT057 |	Consumer Hardware e44 Google
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:01,216	| IOT057 |	Yeah so some of the new divisions according to recodar
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,008	| IOT057 |	Connexus
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,776	| IOT057 |	Tablets
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,288	| IOT057 |	Chromecast
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:09,152	| IOT057 |	Consumer Hardware which includes Chromebook laptops and the new pixel C devices
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,432	| IOT057 |	Onhub
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,504	| IOT057 |	8 app
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| IOT057 |	Which is the advanced technology
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:21,952	| IOT057 |	Yes and that's what good thing did the I forget what it stands for 2 but they did the modular
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,560	| IOT057 |	. they do some really cool stuff
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,328	| IOT057 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,096	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,376	| IOT057 |	Actually lost
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:29,888	| IOT057 |	The head of that
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:31,936	| IOT057 |	Facebook
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| IOT057 |	Regina Dugan
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,056	| IOT057 |	Advanced technology and projects
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:47,040	| IOT057 |	That division was one of the very few that
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,576	| IOT057 |	Google did not sell
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,904	| IOT057 |	Telenovela when Motorola was Villanova
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,184	| IOT057 |	And there's
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,952	| IOT057 |	Class
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,720	| IOT057 |	Which
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,000	| IOT057 |	We must all remember from
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,792	| IOT057 |	2014
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,840	| IOT057 |	Glass
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:04,704	| IOT057 |	It might have been 13 but the 14-year that sounds about right somewhere in there
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:10,080	| IOT057 |	Was given charge that's the CEO of nest
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,176	| IOT057 |	Was given charge of glass but
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:18,016	| IOT057 |	Apparently now it is he staying on his
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:21,344	| IOT057 |	This is not going to be
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,720	| IOT057 |	So we can take a lot of things from this
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,304	| IOT057 |	Just so Kevin doesn't feel uncomfortable I'll just start
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:30,816	| IOT057 |	Taking things
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,120	| IOT057 |	Which is
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,448	| IOT057 |	This is what a slap in the face for
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:36,960	| IOT057 |	Tony fadell
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,496	| IOT057 |	Because
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:41,312	| IOT057 |	They were the consumer Hardware
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:41,824	| IOT057 |	Definition
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,128	| IOT057 |	For Google in a lot of ways
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,408	| IOT057 |	And it sounds like
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,176	| IOT057 |	Google is
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,992	| IOT057 |	Limiting his fiefdom tremendously to
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,784	| IOT057 |	Possibly what they
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| IOT057 |	They have
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:53,088	| IOT057 |	Seen elsewhere that like
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,624	| IOT057 |	Some of the
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:57,184	| IOT057 |	Reported projects such as Google's
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,744	| IOT057 |	Echo like device and
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,304	| IOT057 |	Other stuff that's developing
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,864	| IOT057 |	For the smart home might come under
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,656	| IOT057 |	This is well so
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:11,776	| IOT057 |	That's good because Australia was a good guy
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:13,568	| IOT057 |	It's bad for desk
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:17,664	| IOT057 |	Antenna makes me wonder how long that's going to be like what happens with that
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,176	| IOT057 |	Going down the road
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,992	| IOT057 |	Yeah well I will say this I mean
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,552	| IOT057 |	I guess you could say that Tony fadell was
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:26,624	| IOT057 |	Like the face of consumer Hardware but really
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:30,464	| IOT057 |	He had nothing to do with the Nexus program Chromecast
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,232	| IOT057 |	Chromebook
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:32,768	| IOT057 |	Tablets
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,048	| IOT057 |	And all that so
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,144	| IOT057 |	I wouldn't want to overstate what he had he had
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,424	| IOT057 |	The Nest group in
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,960	| IOT057 |	Glasses
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,984	| IOT057 |	Apparently so
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,288	| IOT057 |	Well there we go
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:44,800	| IOT057 |	Kevin doesn't
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,408	| IOT057 |	Retro
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,456	| IOT057 |	I'll be alone
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:55,808	| IOT057 |	I'm alright well I think that's pretty much it
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| IOT057 |	Podcast
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,112	| IOT057 |	I will say that our guest
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:58,880	| IOT057 |	Coming up
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,416	| IOT057 |	Is Pike whites
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,976	| IOT057 |	Who is the head of openhab
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:07,328	| IOT057 |	I'm pretty sure that's an open source
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,632	| IOT057 |	Home automation can a software code
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:16,032	| IOT057 |	And we'll talk about what you can do with it why it exists and what happens when
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,824	| IOT057 |	Companies don't want to share their API how
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| IOT057 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,176	| IOT057 |	It's going to be fun
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:29,088	| IOT057 |	Hi this is Stacy breaking into the iot podcast to tell you two things the first is that have launched a weekly

EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:51,616	| IOT057 |	So if you were interested please email Andrew at iot podcast. Calm and now back to the show
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,832	| IOT057 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,880	| IOT057 |	This is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:06,464	| IOT057 |	And today's guest is Kai quite sure who is the founder of
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:06,976	| IOT057 |	Open house
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| IOT057 |	Hi how are you doing today
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:12,096	| IOT057 |	Fine thanks how about you
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,168	| IOT057 |	I am super well so it is late at night where you are
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,704	| IOT057 |	Or later at night
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:20,800	| IOT057 |	So I appreciate you doing this show let's first get into
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,824	| IOT057 |	What is openhab
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:26,944	| IOT057 |	Because a lot of the project people might know about it I doubt like the regular users do
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:31,040	| IOT057 |	Open up is an open source software
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,808	| IOT057 |	4
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,576	| IOT057 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,600	| IOT057 |	Butt smelly
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| IOT057 |	Target Salinas
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,720	| IOT057 |	DIY user so text every people
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,512	| IOT057 |	Who want to integrate
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,024	| IOT057 |	A lot of things
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:47,936	| IOT057 |	Alright so I will tell you guys that open have is even a little dirtier than than I am comfortable with
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,448	| IOT057 |	Because
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,544	| IOT057 |	What is basically is as you can put this on a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,824	| IOT057 |	Or
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:57,152	| IOT057 |	We were talking about a couple shows ago on the pine64
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:03,552	| IOT057 |	And it's cool because in the reason cuz on the show is because this is a completely different model for building
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,832	| IOT057 |	Alta connected home
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,344	| IOT057 |	Which is
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,880	| IOT057 |	YouTube
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,672	| IOT057 |	In the open have guys
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,232	| IOT057 |	Their whole effort is around
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:14,560	| IOT057 |	Truly creating an open kind of home automation platform
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:20,960	| IOT057 |	Walk me through how we got to this place and why you thought the world needed open now
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:28,128	| IOT057 |	All started about six years ago when they started
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,456	| IOT057 |	Build a house on my own or for my family
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:39,648	| IOT057 |	I was really interested in automating stuff for already since childhood to answer for me
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:42,720	| IOT057 |	I have to build a house from scratch because I can put
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,512	| IOT057 |	Cables anywhere I like
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:45,792	| IOT057 |	And start really
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,328	| IOT057 |	Put in
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:51,424	| IOT057 |	Switchable lights are shutters or Energy Systems
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:56,544	| IOT057 |	A lot of Hardware was in there but I was somehow liking
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,312	| IOT057 |	Good software
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,104	| IOT057 |	And some
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:03,968	| IOT057 |	The problem for me was that I wanted to try some software where I can
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| IOT057 |	Shorts
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,272	| IOT057 |	Future proof that I can
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,832	| IOT057 |	Extended even in the few decades
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,344	| IOT057 |	It's from now
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:13,440	| IOT057 |	And so for me it was pretty clear that's it
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:18,560	| IOT057 |	Must not depend on single vendor and their system at the business strategy
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:21,632	| IOT057 |	But that I'm really free
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:24,704	| IOT057 |	And open to Extended or four
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,472	| IOT057 |	Whatever comes up
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,520	| IOT057 |	Okay
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:30,336	| IOT057 |	And so you guys have built this
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,384	| IOT057 |	To make this work with any device out there
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,200	| IOT057 |	You guys just need access to
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,504	| IOT057 |	To an SDK or an API
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:38,784	| IOT057 |	How does that work
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:46,208	| IOT057 |	Yeah so it's pretty open up is running on the home Gateway as he said on a Raspberry Pi or some more
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:46,976	| IOT057 |	Capable of
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,488	| IOT057 |	Computer
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:54,656	| IOT057 |	And the integration are to the end devices Astin in whatever radio
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,192	| IOT057 |	And devices so quiet
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:56,960	| IOT057 |	Success
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:02,080	| IOT057 |	So there are f****** in many of the violence protocols like seawave CT
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:08,480	| IOT057 |	An ocean and others so are you having a USB dongle and so are you then integrate that's at school.
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:11,296	| IOT057 |	This supposed to call other devices have four
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:16,160	| IOT057 |	Normal ethernet to WiFi connection
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,464	| IOT057 |	And so they might have
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,256	| IOT057 |	Maybe I'll
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,792	| IOT057 |	Barry Austin.
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,328	| IOT057 |	Criteria API
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,096	| IOT057 |	Truck side steps
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:30,752	| IOT057 |	Answer for the mothers you might also have to go to school reverse engineering is he report call or whatever
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:34,592	| IOT057 |	In order to be able to communicate with these devices
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:39,200	| IOT057 |	Okay see you lost like half the people right now and it's a pretty tech-savvy Adi
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,480	| IOT057 |	But still I think they're like
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,528	| IOT057 |	Reverse engineering
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,808	| IOT057 |	The others are like yes
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:45,856	| IOT057 |	But
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,648	| IOT057 |	Commercially
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,416	| IOT057 |	Is this
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:54,816	| IOT057 |	Reasonable I mean or is what I mean is it going to break down that the smart home is really going to be only open in future
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:57,120	| IOT057 |	Approved for people who are able to you know
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,936	| IOT057 |	Reverse-engineer the data flow from their device
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:03,776	| IOT057 |	I think it's really the best
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,824	| IOT057 |	Best option for the Texans
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,616	| IOT057 |	People
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:12,736	| IOT057 |	It is so Technical and she or you have to know little bit what about you doing there
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:18,112	| IOT057 |	So it's nothing that you that you buy off the shelf and it's simply DirecTV
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,208	| IOT057 |	The good thing there is that this openness and
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,768	| IOT057 |	Freedom and Independence Aralia
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,048	| IOT057 |	Gives you
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,328	| IOT057 |	The chance to
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:31,680	| IOT057 |	App to be open in all the directions so as soon as you
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,776	| IOT057 |	Do a commercial product out of that Co
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,312	| IOT057 |	Getting into some
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:40,128	| IOT057 |	Business Direction than where you might
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:44,736	| IOT057 |	Disable okay maybe I only want to partner with that company but not ready
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,504	| IOT057 |	Competitor
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,040	| IOT057 |	And you're
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:53,952	| IOT057 |	Automatically getting not as open as you would be if you're really completely free of any commercial
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,464	| IOT057 |	Pinterest
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:31:01,632	| IOT057 |	And so I think that's really one of the year the major strong points of her open her up and
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,728	| IOT057 |	Something that I really want to keep like that for the future
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,752	| IOT057 |	But what about
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| IOT057 |	Usability
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,824	| IOT057 |	Because I think I feel like that
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,360	| IOT057 |	Is
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:14,176	| IOT057 |	Not just about like business practices which it can be
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:19,040	| IOT057 |	There's nothing better than building your own and making your own thing work for you
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:21,344	| IOT057 |	To avoid somebody clutching her data or
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,368	| IOT057 |	Or pers
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,416	| IOT057 |	What about
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,464	| IOT057 |	Figuring out how to do something
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,792	| IOT057 |	And then keeping it is open as possible like
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:32,352	| IOT057 |	Have you found companies that are doing
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:35,424	| IOT057 |	Dissonant in a good user friendly format or
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:40,288	| IOT057 |	Yeah I wouldn't say that's open app is not user-friendly
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:46,688	| IOT057 |	Looking into that direction as well so there are a lot of new functionality is currently
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,456	| IOT057 |	Isn't there
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:53,600	| IOT057 |	That's like something to do or to Discovery so it's automatically scanning your network is checking what
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:57,952	| IOT057 |	Are USB sticks or you might have been there answer really
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,768	| IOT057 |	Discovered the devices that you have in place and
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,304	| IOT057 |	Make it
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,328	| IOT057 |	Very easy
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,120	| IOT057 |	Uber user interface to
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:06,656	| IOT057 |	Set up all your stuff
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,168	| IOT057 |	All together
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,216	| IOT057 |	So I think we're we're
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,496	| IOT057 |	Havoline
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,264	| IOT057 |	Increasing
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,800	| IOT057 |	The target audience their butt
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:15,104	| IOT057 |	At the same time
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,152	| IOT057 |	This is also the year the tricky part
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,688	| IOT057 |	Because as soon as you are
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:20,480	| IOT057 |	Making it more user-friendly
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:24,320	| IOT057 |	You also have four more people who
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:27,136	| IOT057 |	Can't help themselves if they come across problems
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:34,304	| IOT057 |	And so the more support you actually have to do on your standards or
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,328	| IOT057 |	You was a spatula
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:38,400	| IOT057 |	Not develop a sense, can look into things
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:43,776	| IOT057 |	Some how are you you have to balance or your time on such an open source project
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,544	| IOT057 |	How much
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:47,616	| IOT057 |	Sporty want to do for community members that
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,640	| IOT057 |	Joy uses
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:55,296	| IOT057 |	And how much time do we actually invest in after other are evolving the project answer pregnant for
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:58,880	| IOT057 |	And that's definitely something we're
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,160	| IOT057 |	Non-commercial project
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:03,232	| IOT057 |	Has its limits because
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,024	| IOT057 |	Then the time is Maria
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,328	| IOT057 |	Sky sunset
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,864	| IOT057 |	Jump the people
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:11,168	| IOT057 |	Working on it so I usually doing it for
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,984	| IOT057 |	The only use Kaiser so down
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,288	| IOT057 |	Happy as soon as it works for them
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:21,152	| IOT057 |	Is there any possibility that we could see this project go commercial
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,176	| IOT057 |	And have
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:25,504	| IOT057 |	Actual real best support or maybe more robust support
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,552	| IOT057 |	As for me
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,088	| IOT057 |	One of the strong process
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:29,856	| IOT057 |	That it's
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,160	| IOT057 |	Not, to the projects
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:32,672	| IOT057 |	Excel
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,208	| IOT057 |	But I'm currently
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:39,328	| IOT057 |	Doing this to create an organization actually a non-for-profit organization
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:39,840	| IOT057 |	Surrounded
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,888	| IOT057 |	Where it's at
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:46,496	| IOT057 |	Easier to organize people around that and maybe also then
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,288	| IOT057 |	Companies who actually
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:50,848	| IOT057 |	Do open hop installations for living
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,896	| IOT057 |	Capital of Turkey
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,176	| IOT057 |	Commercial companies out there
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,712	| IOT057 |	That's
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:34:02,112	| IOT057 |	I like open up so much that they recommended it to their friends and they are the immortalists.
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,648	| IOT057 |	Getting into
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:07,744	| IOT057 |	Business All-Star installing that and supporting it says that a job
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:12,352	| IOT057 |	And I think that says definitely a Direction Where We could build a kind of
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,888	| IOT057 |	Marketplace odoo network
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,704	| IOT057 |	For Professional Services
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:23,872	| IOT057 |	Person that puts us right back into like the x10 or proprietary kind of system days for the end-user because
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:26,176	| IOT057 |	Cuz you're still going to be at this place for like
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,552	| IOT057 |	4 light bulbs in daylight savings time
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:33,600	| IOT057 |	My program mysidia program
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,904	| IOT057 |	Wework Miami
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:36,416	| IOT057 |	My interest
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:41,024	| IOT057 |	I think the big difference is that it is mainly about
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,072	| IOT057 |	Consultancy Institute
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,352	| IOT057 |	Teach people body
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:47,168	| IOT057 |	As possible what can they do answer to
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:50,496	| IOT057 |	Besides OK what might be the best to devices
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,032	| IOT057 |	Stubai how to set them up and
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:58,944	| IOT057 |	If you consider or smart home technology is not only the consumer electronic parts but really also the
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,224	| IOT057 |	Classical home automation
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:04,832	| IOT057 |	You have to deal with heating systems and
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,136	| IOT057 |	Shutters
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,416	| IOT057 |	Docker automated
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:12,768	| IOT057 |	There's actually no way around having your electrician involved in that
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:15,328	| IOT057 |	Usually only for the initial setup
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:18,144	| IOT057 |	All the programming or
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:20,960	| IOT057 |	Let's not call it programming course that's too technical
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:27,616	| IOT057 |	But some lady automation Oklahoma cancer detection customisation
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:29,408	| IOT057 |	That can be done by the end she was herself
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,688	| IOT057 |	Got it
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,712	| IOT057 |	With this project
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:37,600	| IOT057 |	What are people doing with it that's neat cuz we got a lot of people who've asked us to talk more about
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,904	| IOT057 |	How to use in cool stuff that
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,696	| IOT057 |	People dance I'd love to hear
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,256	| IOT057 |	What's some of the people using open have have used it
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:49,632	| IOT057 |	I see many people doing a lots of energy
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:55,520	| IOT057 |	Efficiencies so they have for example solar panels that the heating systems and they they really optimize
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,312	| IOT057 |	This together
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:58,592	| IOT057 |	With
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:01,920	| IOT057 |	You was doing the
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:06,272	| IOT057 |	That might be interesting for you with the Tesla integration so they have actually
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,320	| IOT057 |	Electric vehicle charging stations
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:12,416	| IOT057 |	Directly talking to open Harper and Syrah
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,208	| IOT057 |	Holding 2 tesladin also
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,744	| IOT057 |	For the
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:18,048	| IOT057 |	Charging of the battery until alarm
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,072	| IOT057 |	Thanks all you can eat
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,888	| IOT057 |	Honk the horn if you like her to open up
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,936	| IOT057 |	I can honk the horn to the app
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,984	| IOT057 |	So in that situation
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:29,312	| IOT057 |	Tamir rice
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:33,920	| IOT057 |	You're right I can't I don't have the horn honking like
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:35,968	| IOT057 |	It would be kind of fun to have the horn honk
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:40,576	| IOT057 |	Extended security system
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:43,136	| IOT057 |	Someone someone breaks into my house
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,160	| IOT057 |	The garage that.
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:44,672	| IOT057 |	Tesla hangzhou
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:47,232	| IOT057 |	In that situation
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:53,632	| IOT057 |	Let's break it down for people I would need to hook my Tesla up to my home security system using open
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:56,192	| IOT057 |	Have I would need something running openhab
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,984	| IOT057 |	I would also need
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:02,336	| IOT057 |	The Folsom software that lets it talk to my Tesla do I need to have
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,896	| IOT057 |	Openhab the software running on my Tesla software
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,432	| IOT057 |	No sew
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,456	| IOT057 |	Open up itself
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:09,504	| IOT057 |	Comes with so-called binding
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:12,320	| IOT057 |	Set the bindings out then doing the integration to the
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:15,392	| IOT057 |	Different systems and testosterall
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:22,048	| IOT057 |	You would need us to install the Tesla binding on the open up so on the plants before for example
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,608	| IOT057 |	And this will
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:28,448	| IOT057 |	In the case of the Tesla or go to the Tesla cloud service
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:32,032	| IOT057 |	And connect to their so that's no local integration
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:34,336	| IOT057 |	That's about sums integration
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,104	| IOT057 |	Got it
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:37,920	| IOT057 |	And how would it work on a local immigration looks so
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:40,224	| IOT057 |	I'm trying to think of any of the local stuff I have
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,528	| IOT057 |	I'm totally failing since
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,576	| IOT057 |	Most things are actually not
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,112	| IOT057 |	They're mostly in the cloud
EDL	00:37:46,624	00:37:47,648	| IOT057 |	But how would that look
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,952	| IOT057 |	If I had an IP camera that was served
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:50,464	| IOT057 |	For my house
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:54,560	| IOT057 |	The local integration is the
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:55,840	| IOT057 |	Most important
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:58,656	| IOT057 |	Future open up in that respect because some
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:01,472	| IOT057 |	Only if you're having local integration
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,544	| IOT057 |	You can be pretty sure that your other independent
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,056	| IOT057 |	Of things
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,872	| IOT057 |	Just seen the case with the
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:20,928	| IOT057 |	Exactly the scenario that we want to avoid but open house sober ever possible
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,720	| IOT057 |	It should be local integration
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,256	| IOT057 |	Yes that's Farm
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,792	| IOT057 |	Most devices actually
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,072	| IOT057 |	Available seoul
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:28,352	| IOT057 |	All the stuff
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:31,168	| IOT057 |	It's installed locally you hook it up to your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:35,776	| IOT057 |	Stuff like Phillips you would like a Sonos speakers like
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,312	| IOT057 |	Lifx bulb
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:38,848	| IOT057 |	Bike
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,896	| IOT057 |	Logitech Harmony Harbor and saw
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:44,224	| IOT057 |	All these things are local and they have
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:45,248	| IOT057 |	Some kind of API
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:52,928	| IOT057 |	That was a much nicer because they are turkey discoverable for UPnP you to go to call
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,208	| IOT057 |	And
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:56,512	| IOT057 |	Really make sense
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:00,096	| IOT057 |	Possible to travel very reliable setopati together
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:02,912	| IOT057 |	What about security because
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:05,472	| IOT057 |	I'm trying and I'm thinking like as a user
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:06,752	| IOT057 |	SA
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:07,776	| IOT057 |	Less than
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,056	| IOT057 |	Technically Savvy user
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,104	| IOT057 |	If I build myself
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:12,128	| IOT057 |	The openhab
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,688	| IOT057 |	I'm going to be like yeah I'm so amazing
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:21,088	| IOT057 |	And I'm going to hook it up today that was awesome and I'm going to leave it alone for the rest of the bike Until It Breaks right
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:25,696	| IOT057 |	So how do you handle things like changing security protocols
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:30,816	| IOT057 |	I'm hacks fit univ older abilities that may get reported afterwards in need
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:31,328	| IOT057 |	Updates
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,144	| IOT057 |	How do you communicate that to users because that's
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:36,960	| IOT057 |	It doesn't feel like that would be part of your core function is
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:37,728	| IOT057 |	It's kind of a bunch of hobbies
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:42,848	| IOT057 |	Yeah well if they are willing to work with Latisse All Rights
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:48,480	| IOT057 |	Definitely fixed in the in the cold but we don't have an automatic update management
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:52,064	| IOT057 |	Inform people who have set up an instance
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:54,624	| IOT057 |	But they need to update
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:40:00,000	| IOT057 |	So that's definitely currently up with the users to make sure that they
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:03,328	| IOT057 |	Do regular crate so it is possible to just say
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:09,728	| IOT057 |	You have an older installation until you get the latest version without losing all your data and just set up
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:12,544	| IOT057 |	So that's something to be perfectly possible
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:16,384	| IOT057 |	Got it so where are we in the evolution of the Smart Home
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,664	| IOT057 |	Where we come where we going
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:19,200	| IOT057 |	In your your opinion
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,528	| IOT057 |	Smart home Technologies believe
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,320	| IOT057 |	Pretty old soul
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:30,720	| IOT057 |	I know it since at least two tickets I think we are still in a very early face
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:31,744	| IOT057 |	On the market
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:37,120	| IOT057 |	So I see you the the the marketing people saying since about
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,400	| IOT057 |	5 years at least.
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,168	| IOT057 |	Now
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:39,936	| IOT057 |	The big breakthrough
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,728	| IOT057 |	But some
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:43,520	| IOT057 |	If I look at
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:45,056	| IOT057 |	Their house
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,336	| IOT057 |	Easily breakable
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:48,128	| IOT057 |	Pink Salon Tower
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:52,480	| IOT057 |	Difficult it is for Relief beginners to learn to get started
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:52,992	| IOT057 |	Stuff
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,528	| IOT057 |	I think it will
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,064	| IOT057 |	Take a while
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,088	| IOT057 |	And some
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:41:01,440	| IOT057 |	I'm not saying that's the soccer part of the problem
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,720	| IOT057 |	Still
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:06,560	| IOT057 |	On the on the starting point of having really
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:09,888	| IOT057 |	Reliable protocol is Reliable Hardware
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,936	| IOT057 |	And saw
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,960	| IOT057 |	Thanks for the
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:14,496	| IOT057 |	Break too easily and
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,800	| IOT057 |	Communication is not not stable enough
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,568	| IOT057 |	And stuff like that
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,128	| IOT057 |	So that's pretty as to
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:20,896	| IOT057 |	Become
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,176	| IOT057 |	Better over the next year's
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,736	| IOT057 |	Software perspectives
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:31,136	| IOT057 |	I also think that there's a lot of hype around artificial intelligence and sore having smart home being
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:37,536	| IOT057 |	Your assistant at home that's a really knows what you want the traffic looks on Blue come out
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,072	| IOT057 |	El mencho favorite music playing
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:42,400	| IOT057 |	I really don't believe in that so becoming
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:44,192	| IOT057 |	True
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:45,472	| IOT057 |	Anytime soon
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,264	| IOT057 |	Because
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:52,128	| IOT057 |	It's really you need to laugh so much contextual information in order to
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:55,199	| IOT057 |	Levi's decision says an automated system
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:55,967	| IOT057 |	That's
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:58,527	| IOT057 |	All the possible sensors that
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:01,087	| IOT057 |	We haven't play snow already know.
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,879	| IOT057 |	Not enough to have that
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:10,047	| IOT057 |	Get the mood of somebody to get the whole circumstances in which something is happening
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:11,583	| IOT057 |	To troll the right
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,351	| IOT057 |	Cancel.
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:15,423	| IOT057 |	And I wasn't completely sure for you really
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:20,543	| IOT057 |	Wants to go the way to Atmore Center Center stop
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:21,823	| IOT057 |	Tool to make that contact
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:26,687	| IOT057 |	Available to the machines because that's then again also privacy issue
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:29,503	| IOT057 |	Assurance people might not feel
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,271	| IOT057 |	Compatible
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:35,391	| IOT057 |	So you might snow the analogy about The Uncanny Valley
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:40,255	| IOT057 |	And so I think this very much applies to artificial intelligence in the
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:45,887	| IOT057 |	Smart home as well for the listeners who are not familiar with that
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:48,191	| IOT057 |	20 minutes.
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:50,751	| IOT057 |	Or robots on automatic system
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:53,823	| IOT057 |	Fusible rear sensor
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:57,663	| IOT057 |	People are not compatible with that
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:59,711	| IOT057 |	As long as it's not perfect
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:01,759	| IOT057 |	I was at the actors in The Polar
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:03,295	| IOT057 |	Express they were just sold
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,575	| IOT057 |	Freaky Deadeye lookin
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:08,415	| IOT057 |	Dividers
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:13,279	| IOT057 |	3D version of The Polar Express from a couple years back that is The Uncanny Valley
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:15,071	| IOT057 |	Applied to your favorite Christmas book
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,119	| IOT057 |	I like this
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:17,887	| IOT057 |	So then what
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:19,423	| IOT057 |	Reasonably should we expect
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:20,191	| IOT057 |	I mean
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:24,287	| IOT057 |	Most people when they automate their homes if they're buying into this they're like
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:30,687	| IOT057 |	I want all this to happen right that's what they're kind of working towards both as an industry and even consumers is
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,711	| IOT057 |	What kind of work being sold
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:33,247	| IOT057 |	So
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:35,295	| IOT057 |	What do you think is a more realistic
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,319	| IOT057 |	Vision to sell consume
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:42,719	| IOT057 |	I think as long as the artificial intelligence that's just said wherever notes on the
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:43,743	| IOT057 |	Trophic level
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:47,839	| IOT057 |	You really have to go into programming and somebody else the only
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,911	| IOT057 |	Signal that I see there is
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,703	| IOT057 |	That you you make it
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,727	| IOT057 |	Easy to have
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:56,287	| IOT057 |	Complex logic setup for the user
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:59,871	| IOT057 |	So one day we were trying to drive that in
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:06,015	| IOT057 |	Open Office to a sable you have automation who was which is a piece of a logic that's execute
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:07,551	| IOT057 |	Butts
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:08,319	| IOT057 |	The
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:11,647	| IOT057 |	Normal user itself doesn't have to implement its butt
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,927	| IOT057 |	Can be a developer
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:13,951	| IOT057 |	Repair phone that
EDL	00:44:14,463	00:44:17,791	| IOT057 |	And the usertrust to configure SATA and
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:20,863	| IOT057 |	Customizes it's for his own purposes
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:25,727	| IOT057 |	So you can think of that a little bit like the Apes this man that approached
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:29,311	| IOT057 |	Where you have to use recipes with
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:32,383	| IOT057 |	So you hate that's a you case you want to use it at your
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,919	| IOT057 |	Creating this recipe
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:36,735	| IOT057 |	Using an X configuring it to your own
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,527	| IOT057 |	Set up
EDL	00:44:38,527	00:44:40,319	| IOT057 |	That's really what what is the
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:42,623	| IOT057 |	Most realistic way forward for the MoMA
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:47,231	| IOT057 |	And that's something you guys are implementing so in does that look like
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,583	| IOT057 |	You can do or it's automatically
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:52,095	| IOT057 |	Populated
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:59,007	| IOT057 |	The smallest a dream but definitely the interaction we're heading there so we're
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:02,079	| IOT057 |	Implemented the new rule engine that is
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:06,943	| IOT057 |	Capable off for having sex and play this week all that stuff all the rules
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:13,855	| IOT057 |	And strive for a user interface where I can easily instantiate the stuff
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:14,879	| IOT057 |	For coming on the show today
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:21,535	| IOT057 |	I cannot wait to try this out and if I if I actually do this
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:24,351	| IOT057 |	Which I feel it will be very empowering
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,119	| IOT057 |	40
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:25,631	| IOT057 |	And Kevin will laugh
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:29,215	| IOT057 |	I wish you much on offense
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:31,007	| IOT057 |	Thanks for having me on the show
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:31,775	| IOT057 |	Thank you for coming
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:41,247	| IOT057 |	Well that's it for this week's show thanks for listening and we'll see you back next week
