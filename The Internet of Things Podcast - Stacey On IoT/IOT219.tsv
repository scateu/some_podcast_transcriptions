EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,800	| IOT219 |	I love doing the show
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,080	| IOT219 |	Except it's kind of hard on it
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:57,504	| IOT219 |	There's a lots of great questions that we get him since we only do one voicemail question.
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,040	| IOT219 |	During the regular weekly show
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:02,368	| IOT219 |	This lets us catch up in a sense and get back to everybody else who might have caught
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:05,952	| IOT219 |	I should mention that throughout this year
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:09,280	| IOT219 |	We have to voicemail sponsors but the show one is Schlage
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,560	| IOT219 |	Which makes

EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:17,728	| IOT219 |	And a pharaoh which is an iot development platform
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:22,848	| IOT219 |	And you hear about them almost every other episode on the show so
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,408	| IOT219 |	You probably know about them but we do want to give a big shout-out
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,176	| IOT219 |	Since this is
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,480	| IOT219 |	All brought to you

EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,856	| IOT219 |	Yay
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,672	| IOT219 |	Alright let's kick it off with a message
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,464	| IOT219 |	Jeremy
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,000	| IOT219 |	I believe it
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:41,792	| IOT219 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,840	| IOT219 |	Hi this is Jerry from Little Rock
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:47,168	| IOT219 |	I'm looking for something for the educational Market
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,704	| IOT219 |	That would help induce
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,984	| IOT219 |	Students to AI
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:53,056	| IOT219 |	We've tinkered with chatbots and like
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| IOT219 |	To incorporate this
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| IOT219 |	Into working with
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,408	| IOT219 |	Skills from anime or Google home
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,944	| IOT219 |	Are you serious
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,968	| IOT219 |	These devices have
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,296	| IOT219 |	So the question is
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,344	| IOT219 |	Is this the best around
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:08,160	| IOT219 |	To go and if so do you have ideas on how to get this
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,952	| IOT219 |	Happier in educational Market
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,000	| IOT219 |	Perhaps the bigger question
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,560	| IOT219 |	Do you have an opinion of a better route to go to inter
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| IOT219 |	AI
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,632	| IOT219 |	Thanks in advance love you show
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| IOT219 |	Oh
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,216	| IOT219 |	Jeremy I like you so much for being a caring smart
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,752	| IOT219 |	Exciting teacher I wish I were in your class
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:30,176	| IOT219 |	Yes and it's ironic that Jeremy is asking this question because in my comp sci class at my local community
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:30,688	| IOT219 |	College
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,248	| IOT219 |	We ran into the same issue
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,552	| IOT219 |	Esl older students probably
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:41,184	| IOT219 |	We couldn't get access to the student emails
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,256	| IOT219 |	Through the Google cloud and other things we wanted to use
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,048	| IOT219 |	So I had to use my own personal
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,096	| IOT219 |	Account for all of our API calls in one
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,632	| IOT219 |	So I totally get it
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,168	| IOT219 |	And even more so because
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,008	| IOT219 |	This is really tricky if the students were the kids are under 13
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,824	| IOT219 |	Because in most cases then they can't have an account
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| IOT219 |	Well they can have one but it
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,640	| IOT219 |	Tied to their
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:07,296	| IOT219 |	Yeah it's it's just Anna and I don't even know if that kind of account I am not going to call it a sub account
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,856	| IOT219 |	But Google has school-related
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| IOT219 |	Accounts
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,672	| IOT219 |	I haven't seen
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,696	| IOT219 |	Assistant
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,000	| IOT219 |	In-home devices attached to
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:16,768	| IOT219 |	Nearby
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,047	| IOT219 |	Right and they would need
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,399	| IOT219 |	An account that kind of works with assistant if they want to Tinker with the apis that Google provides
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,191	| IOT219 |	This kind of stuff on Google not the only one
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:27,519	| IOT219 |	Amazon and Microsoft and many many other
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,567	| IOT219 |	Companies have apis Atwood
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| IOT219 |	Be useful for what Jeremy's looking for
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,895	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,943	| IOT219 |	I hate to say it. I have a couple options
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,503	| IOT219 |	This one is to do what I asked you what I just did
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:40,319	| IOT219 |	I register my account for different API services
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:43,647	| IOT219 |	Somewhere for Google summer for lifx
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,415	| IOT219 |	Etc
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,695	| IOT219 |	To get an API
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,207	| IOT219 |	Key
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,047	| IOT219 |	And once you have the API key if you can do any kind of like coding
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:53,887	| IOT219 |	You can just let the students and the kids use that API key to
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,423	| IOT219 |	Access
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,191	| IOT219 |	Any
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| IOT219 |	Cloud type
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,007	| IOT219 |	Air ml services
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:04:59,775	| IOT219 |	So that's one option
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,567	| IOT219 |	There are a couple of
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:05,151	| IOT219 |	Things out there some products one is relatively new because it
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,247	| IOT219 |	Kickstarter right now in fact it's Mike Elgan
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:09,759	| IOT219 |	Sun
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,623	| IOT219 |	Mike Elgan we don't know he does the used to do that
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:17,439	| IOT219 |	This week in Google show you talk to me for Stacy right now am I
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,231	| IOT219 |	Oh yeah I know
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,255	| IOT219 |	Mike is a smart fella
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:24,095	| IOT219 |	And his son is a very smart fellow too because he has a Kickstarter right now
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,399	| IOT219 |	That already met its goals already funded
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,679	| IOT219 |	It's called The Chatterbox
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:30,751	| IOT219 |	And it's a DIY smart speaker that
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,543	| IOT219 |	He says anyone can program
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,335	| IOT219 |	And the reason this is really
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,615	| IOT219 |	Geared towards kids
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,383	| IOT219 |	Is that
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,407	| IOT219 |	It all
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,711	| IOT219 |	Happens everything happens on the device
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:41,503	| IOT219 |	She don't even need any accounts
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:46,623	| IOT219 |	There might be some parents out there who are like I don't want my kids voice in the cloud I don't know
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:52,255	| IOT219 |	It's a it's a thing but it's a this is a little smart speaker sad Power by Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,791	| IOT219 |	As I got
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,839	| IOT219 |	Cute little cardboard
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,399	| IOT219 |	Teasing that the kids create what makes it look like a standing up
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,959	| IOT219 |	Robot foxy but still kind of cute
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| IOT219 |	Additionally
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,031	| IOT219 |	You can
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| IOT219 |	Program it
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,847	| IOT219 |	It looks like it's blocked lie to me
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,639	| IOT219 |	Which is like a dragon drop kind of
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,663	| IOT219 |	Programming language
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:13,503	| IOT219 |	So it's not like too complex for the kids to play with the boys services on the
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,039	| IOT219 |	So that's an option
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,575	| IOT219 |	What age range
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,599	| IOT219 |	For those kind of kids for that
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,183	| IOT219 |	Honestly I mean you can
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,207	| IOT219 |	Probably go
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,255	| IOT219 |	Could I would say down to age
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:29,631	| IOT219 |	It's a six or seven with supervision okay and how much is it
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:33,983	| IOT219 |	So this started out at $99 and all the backers
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:37,567	| IOT219 |	Eat that up and then went to 109 and ate that up to
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:41,151	| IOT219 |	So I don't see how you can order it just yet
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,431	| IOT219 |	Because
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,711	| IOT219 |	The kickstarter is over
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,271	| IOT219 |	So what I would say is Go to the
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,039	| IOT219 |	Kickstarter website
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:50,623	| IOT219 |	Follow along what's going on because they make us for sale
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| IOT219 |	I'm sure they'll tell you where you can get at that point
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,231	| IOT219 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,535	| IOT219 |	And you said you had one other option
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:01,631	| IOT219 |	I do Google actually make something very similar called their Vision kit
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,935	| IOT219 |	That's the aiy projects
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:08,031	| IOT219 |	Start with google.com site where you can buy The Voice kid or
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| IOT219 |	Nhtp you if you want but
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,103	| IOT219 |	Specifically the vision kit
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,175	| IOT219 |	I looked through there if you want to get into AI with
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,711	| IOT219 |	Computer vision
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:18,271	| IOT219 |	I don't see any requirement on that
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,087	| IOT219 |	That says you need a Google account
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:23,135	| IOT219 |	I do see it for The Voice Kids
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:27,231	| IOT219 |	So I believe it's like pre-configured to like use a test
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,511	| IOT219 |	Account
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,303	| IOT219 |	To access the Vision Services service
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,351	| IOT219 |	In which case
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,119	| IOT219 |	You don't need
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,631	| IOT219 |	To worry about
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:34,911	| IOT219 |	Tranchulas and such
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,751	| IOT219 |	Okay so you could just get this and
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:42,847	| IOT219 |	Unauthorised computer vision
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:44,895	| IOT219 |	Not traceable trackable etcetera
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,199	| IOT219 |	There we go
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:51,039	| IOT219 |	Okay so Jeremy hopefully some of that helps you
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| IOT219 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,135	| IOT219 |	You have the budget to do some of this with your kids at
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,415	| IOT219 |	Sounds like a lot of fun
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,439	| IOT219 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:00,255	| IOT219 |	Next up we have a question from Keith
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,559	| IOT219 |	Who is just checking up on me
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,583	| IOT219 |	Thanks Keith
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,095	| IOT219 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,631	| IOT219 |	Play Susan Kevin
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,423	| IOT219 |	Is Keith from going to Arizona
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,215	| IOT219 |	Pico question CCU
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:12,543	| IOT219 |	Let's begin the year you mentioned that you're going to move everything over to Google
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,567	| IOT219 |	Home versus
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,847	| IOT219 |	Using Alexa products
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| IOT219 |	Anime
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| IOT219 |	So kind of curious
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,687	| IOT219 |	That is going
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,967	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| IOT219 |	Do you want to go back
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,271	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,855	| IOT219 |	I'd like to get your experience but that what you like and dislike
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,903	| IOT219 |	And if you do go back
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,415	| IOT219 |	Why you going
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,719	| IOT219 |	Keith
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,999	| IOT219 |	This is really
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| IOT219 |	A sad sad
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:33,791	| IOT219 |	Story
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,583	| IOT219 |	I switched everything to Google
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| IOT219 |	You're correct
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:42,495	| IOT219 |	I loved it and actually my family loves the Google smart display that we have we have two 10-inch Lenovo smart display
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,543	| IOT219 |	And then I threw
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,591	| IOT219 |	Add a Google home in a couple minutes running
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,639	| IOT219 |	I can tell you that
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,199	| IOT219 |	Everything was unplugged Within
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,991	| IOT219 |	Probably two weeks
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,807	| IOT219 |	And the reason was I had
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,343	| IOT219 |	Done the voice match
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,647	| IOT219 |	And with voice match
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| IOT219 |	Which wasn't
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,695	| IOT219 |	2 strong
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:09,631	| IOT219 |	Couldn't recognize my voice probably half of
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:15,263	| IOT219 |	It did great with my husband's voice but at first he was kind of hacked off because he had to go train it
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,335	| IOT219 |	And so is this
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| IOT219 |	And then
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,687	| IOT219 |	It didn't recognize my daughter at all
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:28,319	| IOT219 |	And get her voice match on there because she wasn't using a phone with a Google account on it
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,903	| IOT219 |	Because she was under 13 and technically can't have one
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| IOT219 |	Was a whole thing
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT219 |	That we just did not do
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,255	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,839	| IOT219 |	It was awesome in theory that I could be like
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:44,447	| IOT219 |	Hey what's on my calendar my husband gets a call Mom and it would call his mom is opposed to my mom
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| IOT219 |	But
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,495	| IOT219 |	We had to turn that off
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,543	| IOT219 |	But before we turned it off
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,615	| IOT219 |	Basically everyone in my house whenever back to madam
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,151	| IOT219 |	Because they were kind of trained to use
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,199	| IOT219 |	And we kept
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,759	| IOT219 |	The main Google home hub plugged in
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,575	| IOT219 |	And once we turned off The Voice
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT219 |	Recognition
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,111	| IOT219 |	Capability
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,415	| IOT219 |	People used it sometimes
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,183	| IOT219 |	But again
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,975	| IOT219 |	4 most basic
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,743	| IOT219 |	Commands
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| IOT219 |	It didn't work as well
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:09,791	| IOT219 |	Also
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,559	| IOT219 |	When we die
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,095	| IOT219 |	Sports turn on the television
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:18,239	| IOT219 |	Sometimes it would be able to do it sometimes it wouldn't and then if it didn't we that say okay ask Harmony Wichita
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,775	| IOT219 |	Because we're using Logitech Harmony
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,543	| IOT219 |	Turn on the television
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,335	| IOT219 |	Then it would do it but
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,615	| IOT219 |	It was a little hit or miss
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,175	| IOT219 |	My daughter didn't like using it
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,687	| IOT219 |	Because
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:31,295	| IOT219 |	Google still doesn't play the same thing she wants to play with Spotify
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:37,695	| IOT219 |	Their Spotify integration is still a little wonky so sometimes it still plays the karaoke versions of popular songs
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,255	| IOT219 |	Instead of the actual song
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,023	| IOT219 |	Where is
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,071	| IOT219 |	Madam is like oh
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:45,375	| IOT219 |	You want to hear Blank Space by Taylor Swift
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,167	| IOT219 |	I got that she plays that right
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:51,263	| IOT219 |	Google sometimes would play an instrumental version
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:51,775	| IOT219 |	And you be like
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:52,799	| IOT219 |	Why Google
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,103	| IOT219 |	Is that really what people want to hear
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,151	| IOT219 |	That's kind of held out when
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,943	| IOT219 |	We still have
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:04,319	| IOT219 |	The display and we love it because it's showing photos and that's super vine Everyone likes that
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,111	| IOT219 |	And we use it to
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,647	| IOT219 |	Settled
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:12,255	| IOT219 |	I called my room argument there really is no supper table arguments where we're sitting down at dinner in
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| IOT219 |	We're having. Like why is it this way
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,375	| IOT219 |	So we do tend to ask Google more questions
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:23,007	| IOT219 |	I mean I had the matinee and plug for maybe a week before my Family Feud need
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,775	| IOT219 |	Whatever like
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,287	| IOT219 |	No
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,079	| IOT219 |	This is terrible
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,871	| IOT219 |	So when you end up
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,919	| IOT219 |	And your final destination in Seattle
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,711	| IOT219 |	I assume you're going to
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| IOT219 |	Put madhumeh back in everywhere
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,575	| IOT219 |	Yeah it's matinee all the way although
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:40,415	| IOT219 |	This is it now this will be a challenge because of the whole nest
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,951	| IOT219 |	Deprecation kind of issue
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:45,535	| IOT219 |	We do like the smart doorbell of choice for me is the nest
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,095	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,655	| IOT219 |	Its entirety have the Google display should I
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:55,007	| IOT219 |	You know use that display to show us who's at the door like when we're in the kitchen
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| IOT219 |	It already shows us
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,823	| IOT219 |	Video from
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,663	| IOT219 |	I mean since we have it we're probably going to just use the net
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| IOT219 |	Bright that makes sense
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,991	| IOT219 |	It's interesting my experience
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,039	| IOT219 |	Not that I moved or anything and
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:10,623	| IOT219 |	And not that Keith cares about my house
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,439	| IOT219 |	At my experience is very different and we're all Google
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,231	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:19,071	| IOT219 |	The difference by The Voice match
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:25,215	| IOT219 |	We don't use the voice match because if I want personal information I just use my phone for that and everybody else uses their phone for
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| IOT219 |	They're not
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,775	| IOT219 |	Big into sitting around the
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,591	| IOT219 |	Kitchen table and then asking the smartest by what's next on our calendar
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,871	| IOT219 |	Cuz
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,895	| IOT219 |	They just use their phones
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,479	| IOT219 |	Just a difference in how they use it that's fine
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| IOT219 |	So no voice match
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,063	| IOT219 |	And they don't really use either
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,343	| IOT219 |	Of the smart speaker
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,135	| IOT219 |	Platforms that much at all by
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,159	| IOT219 |	Comparison to me
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,439	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT219 |	They Don't Really Care as much
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:51,583	| IOT219 |	This is how much we use it in my house no lyric that's where you're actually
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,351	| IOT219 |	Like we're packed
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,399	| IOT219 |	By the time you guys
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,679	| IOT219 |	Hear this I'll have been in Co
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,775	| IOT219 |	But we're like the idea of living for 2 weeks out of a suitcase
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,847	| IOT219 |	We still had to keep one Amazon Echo.
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,615	| IOT219 |	Device
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:08,991	| IOT219 |	You guys use it for music as this do I nobody else in my house listen to music with me but you guys
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:12,831	| IOT219 |	You used the services that come with these devices far more than my family.
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,647	| IOT219 |	Music timers
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| IOT219 |	Yeah like my husband
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| IOT219 |	It is like
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,487	| IOT219 |	We have the echo in my daughter's room
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:23,839	| IOT219 |	So she can you set his alarm clock but every night before he goes to bed my husband's like
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,863	| IOT219 |	Anime
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,655	| IOT219 |	Set up
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:27,679	| IOT219 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,775	| IOT219 |	I mean I'll use a voice assistant to preheat the June oven for example
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,591	| IOT219 |	That's awesome cuz you're like hands are all sticky
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,943	| IOT219 |	But my wife will
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:41,759	| IOT219 |	Walk out of the room go across the house
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,527	| IOT219 |	Hit the button
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,807	| IOT219 |	Walk away back into town
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,087	| IOT219 |	I'm like why you doing that
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,927	| IOT219 |	She's way healthy
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,231	| IOT219 |	I'm actually using it to Adam
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,791	| IOT219 |	Data to my Fitbit now I know how much water I drink
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,583	| IOT219 |	So I'm like
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,351	| IOT219 |	Smart
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:56,863	| IOT219 |	So Keith
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,399	| IOT219 |	That is how I'm going
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,983	| IOT219 |	It's pretty much variable depends on your situation
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,055	| IOT219 |	You know what I'm all in on Google so I really wish it would
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,079	| IOT219 |	Work better for us
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,127	| IOT219 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,943	| IOT219 |	Let's see we have got
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,479	| IOT219 |	A question from no-name
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,295	| IOT219 |	An unnamed individual coming up
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:15,807	| IOT219 |	But
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,879	| IOT219 |	This is a question we've gotten a couple times
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,183	| IOT219 |	Kevin's actually tried to do this
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| IOT219 |	Couple different ways
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:22,975	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,791	| IOT219 |	This is all about making your washing machine smart
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:26,815	| IOT219 |	Let's listening
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,935	| IOT219 |	Quick question is regarding
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:36,031	| IOT219 |	You let my not smart washer and dryer machines
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:41,663	| IOT219 |	Unfortunately have plugs that do not work with normal
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,199	| IOT219 |	Outlets monitoring
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:47,039	| IOT219 |	So I haven't been able to just use energy
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,343	| IOT219 |	Laundry is finished
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,135	| IOT219 |	I was wondering if you guys had any others
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,183	| IOT219 |	Thank you
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:57,535	| IOT219 |	Yeah so we're right since we've gotten this we probably get this question like at least
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,071	| IOT219 |	Every two months
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:02,911	| IOT219 |	There's a lot of folks that want to know how to do this with the easiest way to do it
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:07,007	| IOT219 |	The thing is there's no truly easy way to do it the way I think
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,823	| IOT219 |	People would like it to work we have to kind of
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,615	| IOT219 |	There is one easy way
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,919	| IOT219 |	Easiest way to do this
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,199	| IOT219 |	Is Dubai
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT219 |	Connected washer
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,807	| IOT219 |	But if you don't want to buy a whole new washer dryer
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,319	| IOT219 |	And I don't blame you
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,599	| IOT219 |	Now
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,135	| IOT219 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,951	| IOT219 |	So there's there's your thousand-dollar option
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,559	| IOT219 |	Crazy I'll do it
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,679	| IOT219 |	I found a bunch of folks that have had success
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:40,031	| IOT219 |	With a SmartThings multi-sensor which measures vibration
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,311	| IOT219 |	I think it measures
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,847	| IOT219 |	Noise
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,175	| IOT219 |	Vibration temperature
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,711	| IOT219 |	Open close
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,991	| IOT219 |	Humidity
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,159	| IOT219 |	Yeah but space in their focus on the vibration
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:00,511	| IOT219 |	Because they attach this to their washer dryer and
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,071	| IOT219 |	Paisley set up a rule that says
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,119	| IOT219 |	Set an alarm if
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:09,215	| IOT219 |	It's not vibrating for X number of seconds or minutes
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,287	| IOT219 |	You need to set that there an actual there's like a skill for that
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:15,359	| IOT219 |	Cassette that you need to make sure because I was listening cycle through
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:19,455	| IOT219 |	The devices may stop vibrating for maybe 30 seconds 45 seconds Munoz
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,271	| IOT219 |	Maybe cuz it's refilling water in the washer Etc
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:26,623	| IOT219 |	You need to understand and adjust that for you in particular washer dryer but
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:29,183	| IOT219 |	That's what folks have been very happy with
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,463	| IOT219 |	Considering there just isn't
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,279	| IOT219 |	A great off-the-shelf option other than
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,815	| IOT219 |	As we said buying a home
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,327	| IOT219 |	Set of appliances
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:38,143	| IOT219 |	You could also make your own
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,959	| IOT219 |	I wouldn't say it's easier but it's an option for people that get tinker
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:47,103	| IOT219 |	We can put a link in the show notes to a Raspberry Pi Appliance Monitor and does the same thing with a vibration sense
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,943	| IOT219 |	If you don't feel like mine when you can make your own
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:53,759	| IOT219 |	In that scenario though I have to buy the pie
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:57,599	| IOT219 |	Play the program it for like do I have to download some sort of
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:01,951	| IOT219 |	Absolutely I recognition Okay and then I need to have a wireless component I need to get a
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,999	| IOT219 |	Shield or a hat
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,631	| IOT219 |	Whatever Wi-Fi and the pies are almost
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:15,007	| IOT219 |	All them, so you don't have to add any special radio frequencies or anything like that
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:20,639	| IOT219 |	But as far as downloading code know your absolute right and the link we have that car to a GitHub project
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,943	| IOT219 |	So the code is already there as well as the instructions so it's not
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:27,295	| IOT219 |	Terribly miss you a first time user could you just download the code
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,575	| IOT219 |	That is up on GitHub
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,111	| IOT219 |	To the Pines pretty much run at
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,415	| IOT219 |	But other options that
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,975	| IOT219 |	Some people do and I don't recommend
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,999	| IOT219 |	You can actually
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,327	| IOT219 |	Make a 220-volt outlet smart
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,375	| IOT219 |	But every time I've seen that it's
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,679	| IOT219 |	You have to hardwire your
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| IOT219 |	Appliance to this
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,751	| IOT219 |	Outlet
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,263	| IOT219 |	This plug
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,591	| IOT219 |	And that's not something I would at that point you might as well just go buy a new washer
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,383	| IOT219 |	Yeah you don't want to play with 200
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:57,503	| IOT219 |	Not so much
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,015	| IOT219 |	It's not a cool thing
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,039	| IOT219 |	Have happened in your
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,367	| IOT219 |	Okay so those are really good options
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:04,671	| IOT219 |	Let's pause for a moment and
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,439	| IOT219 |	Take a break
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| IOT219 |	Wear weave this week sponsor

EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:24,383	| IOT219 |	Hi Chris thanks for joining our podcast today
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,687	| IOT219 |	Can you tell us a little bit about yourself
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,735	| IOT219 |	Hi Stacy thanks for having
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,695	| IOT219 |	Digital film industry
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:43,071	| IOT219 |	So with your oil and gas background in data architecture and digital oilfield Solutions
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,863	| IOT219 |	Weird how have you seen oil and gas
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,703	| IOT219 |	Gas is very possible
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:50,495	| IOT219 |	Automation oriented
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,287	| IOT219 |	Dismiss
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:55,871	| IOT219 |	Four major areas of growth for it number one
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| IOT219 |	Stranded
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| IOT219 |	Number two is
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| IOT219 |	Capturing
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,247	| IOT219 |	Data increase velocity
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:06,367	| IOT219 |	Number three is actually providing more analytics and applications at the edge
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:08,671	| IOT219 |	What area that is really exploding
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:14,303	| IOT219 |	Is using non typical data types like video audio and graphic Imaging to do
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,095	| IOT219 |	Real-time operations analyst
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:23,519	| IOT219 |	Excellent so what are some of the key areas for companies to think about if they want to deliver successful iot
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| IOT219 |	Project specifically in oil
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,103	| IOT219 |	Number one
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,895	| IOT219 |	We have to remember its first
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,919	| IOT219 |	And foremost about this
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,455	| IOT219 |	How do you help the business
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:36,063	| IOT219 |	Be successful to increasing production
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:41,183	| IOT219 |	Specifically willful operation
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,951	| IOT219 |	Automation
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:49,119	| IOT219 |	Understand
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:55,263	| IOT219 |	Balsam it devices to make it better
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,871	| IOT219 |	Use with it and number three how to make
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,175	| IOT219 |	Consumers on that day that day scientist
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:05,247	| IOT219 |	What are you sedated and course-related back to business
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,527	| IOT219 |	Howling and users
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,599	| IOT219 |	And uses to integration and work less
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,487	| IOT219 |	And then we move differently there's three other key components
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,255	| IOT219 |	What's my connectivity
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,335	| IOT219 |	Put these things all together you
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| IOT219 |	Understand how they work
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:37,247	| IOT219 |	Together and you can make a really good business case and you can deliver a really successful project
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,343	| IOT219 |	So I understand data-driven production is coming up in
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,111	| IOT219 |	Houston

EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,640	| IOT219 |	Thanks a lot again love the show
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,664	| IOT219 |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:13,248	| IOT219 |	I'm glad you're thinking trying to take care of your family
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,784	| IOT219 |	I got a couple options for you
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:18,880	| IOT219 |	This is a weird space because people have built stuff for it
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:19,904	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:23,232	| IOT219 |	Then it didn't sell because a lot of these are very expensive
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,536	| IOT219 |	So we discovered one
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,584	| IOT219 |	Which is called Wallflower
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:33,728	| IOT219 |	And this is a device that will tell you that you have left your stove on it will not actually
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:34,752	| IOT219 |	Turn it off
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,824	| IOT219 |	Correct is just for notifications with food left it on
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:43,200	| IOT219 |	And the reason in this is an outlet so this is an outlet that you plug your stove into
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,968	| IOT219 |	It is
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:46,016	| IOT219 |	$150
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,552	| IOT219 |	It's called Wallflower Uke
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| IOT219 |	You can find it at Wallflower.
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:50,624	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:55,488	| IOT219 |	If your home is built before 1996 you're going to need one if it's billed after you're going to need it if
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,768	| IOT219 |	But
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,048	| IOT219 |	The option is
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,072	| IOT219 |	Easy
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:01,888	| IOT219 |	The reason why an egg is actually to some of the things
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| IOT219 |	Behind
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:03,936	| IOT219 |	Stoves
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:07,520	| IOT219 |	It's actually from a regulatory perspective turning them off
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:10,080	| IOT219 |	Is apparently a big deal
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:13,408	| IOT219 |	So everybody who's like I'm going to do this and I'm going to turn it off
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:16,736	| IOT219 |	They realize when they start getting through certification process that
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:21,088	| IOT219 |	UL process or some sort of like hey is this thing safe to eat
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:21,856	| IOT219 |	Put my house
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:27,744	| IOT219 |	The Regulators don't like them because they they don't know if it's 100% over Wi-Fi that you can like
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:31,328	| IOT219 |	Luther motor and something will definitely be turned off they don't feel comfort
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,376	| IOT219 |	But
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,936	| IOT219 |	That has not stopped people from trying
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,960	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,288	| IOT219 |	The current one and I've seen a lot of these and none of them have
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:44,128	| IOT219 |	But there is currently one called a nerve
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,664	| IOT219 |	Ini RV
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,736	| IOT219 |	And they are building a connected
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,504	| IOT219 |	Knob for your
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,320	| IOT219 |	Stove burner knobs
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,600	| IOT219 |	Western Gas and Electric
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,416	| IOT219 |	And what it does is you
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:00,000	| IOT219 |	Put these on and it has a sensor when your stove is on it will
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,768	| IOT219 |	Actually turn the knob
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,560	| IOT219 |	But
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,840	| IOT219 |	Here is the catch
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:06,656	| IOT219 |	They did a Kickstarter in 2017
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,192	| IOT219 |	It does not look like they've delivered on it
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,240	| IOT219 |	They were on Shark Tank
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,264	| IOT219 |	Can 2018
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,336	| IOT219 |	And just this year in February
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:17,408	| IOT219 |	They were part of the bsh techstars
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,456	| IOT219 |	Accelerator for the smart
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,248	| IOT219 |	What is this mean
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:24,064	| IOT219 |	It means that they've been promising a product for a long time
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:28,672	| IOT219 |	Only now do I feel like they have the backing they would need to actually
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,184	| IOT219 |	Get it done
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:33,024	| IOT219 |	The techstars bsh accelerator program makes me feel like
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,584	| IOT219 |	A little bit more confidence but
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,376	| IOT219 |	It's still not enough confidence that I'm like
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,168	| IOT219 |	This is really going to happen
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,680	| IOT219 |	But
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:42,240	| IOT219 |	You can go on their website and reserve it
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,520	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:44,544	| IOT219 |	It doesn't cost
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:48,640	| IOT219 |	True it will be nice to see if and when they deliver
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:51,712	| IOT219 |	They actually have a shipping date people know cuz I I love the idea of this
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,272	| IOT219 |	We have a gas stove
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,296	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,856	| IOT219 |	I'm also really would do SWAT for us
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:01,696	| IOT219 |	Shut off the igniters I guess but really do anything else
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:04,256	| IOT219 |	So this is something I would
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,304	| IOT219 |	Consider looking into or trying but
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,840	| IOT219 |	It just isn't there yet
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,912	| IOT219 |	Yeah in the starter kit for the inner earth
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,680	| IOT219 |	Is
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:18,080	| IOT219 |	One sensor plus one knob is a hundred in all the way up to 1 sensor and four knobs which most stoves have four
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,872	| IOT219 |	And that's 230.
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,408	| IOT219 |	That's a lot of money
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,968	| IOT219 |	So it's a lot of money for peace of mind
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:28,064	| IOT219 |	Yeah we are almost in the territory to spend the money on it can I get stove
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:31,904	| IOT219 |	Oh my gosh and now we're back to that Cheeto your old Appliance
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,696	| IOT219 |	That's our new motto
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,232	| IOT219 |	Kitchen Redo for everyone
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,328	| IOT219 |	All right moving along to a question from John
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,144	| IOT219 |	I will confess I've never thought of
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:42,912	| IOT219 |	This problem so
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,680	| IOT219 |	Kudos to you John
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:44,704	| IOT219 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:48,800	| IOT219 |	Swansea Illinois
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:52,128	| IOT219 |	Little bit concerned about
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:55,712	| IOT219 |	King Auto she devices throughout my home
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,552	| IOT219 |	Lightning strikes nearby
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,320	| IOT219 |	Power surges
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,624	| IOT219 |	Half power strips or
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,184	| IOT219 |	Interruptible power supplies for my computer
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| IOT219 |	How concerned should I be about my
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,936	| IOT219 |	I'll be honest I actually haven't thought of this either
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,472	| IOT219 |	And maybe I should have
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,496	| IOT219 |	Especially on my
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| IOT219 |	Higher price II
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| IOT219 |	Tea devices
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:23,104	| IOT219 |	Something like a Google home Mini
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,432	| IOT219 |	It's not like throw away money to go buy one
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,200	| IOT219 |	You're talking
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:28,992	| IOT219 |	Maybe 30 bucks on sale so
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:32,832	| IOT219 |	I wouldn't be too concerned with things like that but if you have
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,368	| IOT219 |	Spend and you have to
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,648	| IOT219 |	Pick this number
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,672	| IOT219 |	That suits your budget
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,208	| IOT219 |	For me anything
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,512	| IOT219 |	Cost me more than $50 to replace
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,792	| IOT219 |	It might be worth
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| IOT219 |	Getting
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,352	| IOT219 |	Surge protection for
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,376	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:49,728	| IOT219 |	Yeah baby webcam smart fit smart speakers hubs and so on so forth
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,032	| IOT219 |	I'm actually considering this now so I'm glad John
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,544	| IOT219 |	Assets
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:59,456	| IOT219 |	What I would say that there's tons if you go to Amazon there are tons of surge protector choices out there
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:04,064	| IOT219 |	I'm going to put one out because it's relatively inexpensive for what you're trying to
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:04,832	| IOT219 |	Protect
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:07,392	| IOT219 |	Basically under 15 bucks gets you
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,672	| IOT219 |	Surge protector
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:11,744	| IOT219 |	That you plug in over top of an existing
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| IOT219 |	Outlet
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:15,840	| IOT219 |	And it actually adds more Outlets as well as USB ports
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,632	| IOT219 |	But you also get surge protection by that
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:21,728	| IOT219 |	So we'll put a link in the shown us this one I think is 13 $14
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:27,360	| IOT219 |	There are Bunches of them out there so maybe look at this one and then see what the other ones the related items are
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,408	| IOT219 |	Choose the ones that look the best to you or have the
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,712	| IOT219 |	He doesn't number of outlets you want so on
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| IOT219 |	But for something
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,272	| IOT219 |	Inexpensive
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:37,600	| IOT219 |	Can I make a wyze cam I'm not going to put a surge protector on a wyzecam
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:40,928	| IOT219 |	It's almost as much money to put the surge protector on it cost me for the wyzecam so
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:44,000	| IOT219 |	That's my thought I don't know Stacey you may have a different opinion
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,072	| IOT219 |	I was just going to see if you wanted to
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:47,584	| IOT219 |	Brazy
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:51,680	| IOT219 |	This is maybe less for your smart home stuff also there some interesting options here
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,728	| IOT219 |	Get a smart surge protector
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:56,544	| IOT219 |	So there are definitely connected surge protectors out there but
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:00,128	| IOT219 |	If your homekit fan Eve has one called the energy strip
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:00,640	| IOT219 |	It is
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,200	| IOT219 |	Really pretty it works with Google Assistant
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:05,760	| IOT219 |	The reason you might want to do
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,784	| IOT219 |	Connected
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,296	| IOT219 |	Surge
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,368	| IOT219 |	Is actually two
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:12,160	| IOT219 |	Set rules around like
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:15,744	| IOT219 |	When your smart devices are on like your smart speaker is
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| IOT219 |	On or off
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,304	| IOT219 |	So you can maybe just
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:21,120	| IOT219 |	Not unplug it but basically
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,144	| IOT219 |	Turn it off
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,168	| IOT219 |	Completely
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:27,008	| IOT219 |	That might get old for the speaker some things will
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,336	| IOT219 |	Need to be reset if you turn them off for too long of a Time
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,872	| IOT219 |	But it's an interesting option
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,688	| IOT219 |	Or you if you're really worried about life
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,504	| IOT219 |	Like privacy or things like that some people are like
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:40,320	| IOT219 |	You can set it up so your smart camera adjust
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:43,136	| IOT219 |	Is totally not even getting power when you come home
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,440	| IOT219 |	Even if Lake
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:47,232	| IOT219 |	The worst case scenario where the
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:50,560	| IOT219 |	The company was like I am really nefarious I'm going to take over your camera and look at you
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,144	| IOT219 |	Nautica cologne
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,192	| IOT219 |	So that might be a reason to get it
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:02,080	| IOT219 |	Although if they really wanted to see you then they could hack your connected surge protector and then turn the camera back up at 6
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,920	| IOT219 |	There's just throwing that out there is another app
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:11,552	| IOT219 |	It would you put surge protectors on any of your things or says not all of your things
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:18,208	| IOT219 |	In some places like my office I have surge protectors already in place and things are plugged into that by default
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:19,488	| IOT219 |	Discussed at the outlets
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:20,768	| IOT219 |	The lake
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,792	| IOT219 |	In my kitchen
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:27,168	| IOT219 |	My smart display which is 200 my Echo Show which was another 200 I think
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:29,216	| IOT219 |	Those are plugged into just normal
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:34,592	| IOT219 |	They're GFI outlets but that's about it what about your June cuz that would not be a inexpensive trip
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:39,456	| IOT219 |	You know it is not plugged into surge protector but neither is my $800 coffee May
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:42,272	| IOT219 |	Make her so clearly I'm just not consistent and that's not smart
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:47,392	| IOT219 |	So it looks like John as well as you and I will be spending some money answers for Tech
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:48,672	| IOT219 |	Stacy
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:53,024	| IOT219 |	I'm just like I've got renters insurance or home insurance
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,864	| IOT219 |	Next up we've got a question that we also get
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,448	| IOT219 |	Aaron
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:00,960	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:04,800	| IOT219 |	And everybody else
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:09,408	| IOT219 |	Yeah if we were playing if we were playing Q&A Bingo this would be like the Center Square
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,200	| IOT219 |	ICC and Kevin
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:14,784	| IOT219 |	My name is Aaron
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:18,368	| IOT219 |	Viability of
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:22,208	| IOT219 |	Crispy Sunday have no current price coming out
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,232	| IOT219 |	Distracted
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,048	| IOT219 |	Suddenly disconnected doesn't work
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,608	| IOT219 |	Crysis 2
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:32,448	| IOT219 |	What you should transition to in the future or west bracket considered
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT219 |	Thank you and have a good day
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,080	| IOT219 |	I wish I had a better answer for you
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,128	| IOT219 |	Confer ferryman show
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,152	| IOT219 |	I sent wink
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,688	| IOT219 |	PR emails
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,504	| IOT219 |	I looked through Linkedin to see who I still do there
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,088	| IOT219 |	I sent another email to someone random that I
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:49,856	| IOT219 |	Was like
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,136	| IOT219 |	Third-degree connected to
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:54,976	| IOT219 |	I kid you not Stacy reaches out to these folks every couple weeks
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:57,280	| IOT219 |	And it's been going on for months it's not like
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,560	| IOT219 |	We have not tried to find out
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,864	| IOT219 |	But it's just a black hole
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,144	| IOT219 |	It is
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,424	| IOT219 |	So officially
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,448	| IOT219 |	I've got nothing
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,776	| IOT219 |	Unofficially I can tell you that the last update was
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:08,800	| IOT219 |	Sports
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:13,408	| IOT219 |	Feels like a long time ago I also haven't heard from wink yet on the deprecation of
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,176	| IOT219 |	Nest
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:17,504	| IOT219 |	Where is all of my other smart home devices have sent me email saying
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:20,576	| IOT219 |	Hey did you hear the Google
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,344	| IOT219 |	You know
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,136	| IOT219 |	Killing Nest another like
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:28,512	| IOT219 |	Google's not killing us quite the same way but it's still going to happen so here's what you need to do
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:30,048	| IOT219 |	So I feel like
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,840	| IOT219 |	I can't recommend wink anymore to pee
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,120	| IOT219 |	People if you have wink
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,888	| IOT219 |	It still works
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,192	| IOT219 |	I'm in the same boat
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:39,520	| IOT219 |	To be honest I kind of feel it was my go-to Hub recommendations
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:40,288	| IOT219 |	So long
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,336	| IOT219 |	Overtime as
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,104	| IOT219 |	Nothing has
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,664	| IOT219 |	Come to light of what's going on
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:49,248	| IOT219 |	I don't feel comfortable recommending it
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:52,320	| IOT219 |	I will save it on the Google Play Store that the
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:53,344	| IOT219 |	Wink folks are
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,136	| IOT219 |	Responding
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:58,976	| IOT219 |	2 reviews with questions as early as 3 weeks ago
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,744	| IOT219 |	So it's not like
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:05,120	| IOT219 |	The total black hole there are still people there they're still working the wink hubs as you said Stacy still work
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:09,216	| IOT219 |	I think people just like wondering where there be new products what's the lunk
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:13,056	| IOT219 |	Strategy is there a long term for weighing what's going on really
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:17,152	| IOT219 |	Don't buy it for people thinking that
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,712	| IOT219 |	It's going to be around forever but for now
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,992	| IOT219 |	It does still work if you have it
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,040	| IOT219 |	Yay
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:26,112	| IOT219 |	If you want another Hub option I would sell you SmartThings
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| IOT219 |	Carter
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,184	| IOT219 |	I would also tell you maybe you don't need a
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,488	| IOT219 |	I know and I get angry emails.
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,840	| IOT219 |	Maybe you don't need a hug
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,120	| IOT219 |	If you're not a superpower user
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:39,936	| IOT219 |	Maybe Amazon or Google is
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,960	| IOT219 |	Perfectly good help for you
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:41,984	| IOT219 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:48,896	| IOT219 |	Let's move on to another question these are these are questions when you guys are answering them all he
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:49,408	| IOT219 |	Here because
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,200	| IOT219 |	We don't want you to think
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:51,712	| IOT219 |	But we don't listen
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,504	| IOT219 |	So this one is from Jeff
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:56,576	| IOT219 |	And he has a question about the mail
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:57,856	| IOT219 |	Let's hear it
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:00,416	| IOT219 |	Ice Age and Kevin Love You show
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:01,952	| IOT219 |	A question
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,232	| IOT219 |	Battle Wi-Fi
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,512	| IOT219 |	Mailbox alert
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,816	| IOT219 |	Back in the day
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,656	| IOT219 |	I was wondering if
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,240	| IOT219 |	Either something I can listen to that song that I have
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,288	| IOT219 |	Or something
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,360	| IOT219 |	Mailbox door has been open
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,152	| IOT219 |	After you could coverage
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:24,992	| IOT219 |	Mailbox WiFi
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,808	| IOT219 |	Support your answer
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,904	| IOT219 |	As you said we get this question a lot
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,696	| IOT219 |	And that's actually a good thing
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:38,048	| IOT219 |	Sometimes get the same question over and over because new products come out new Solutions are available
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:42,656	| IOT219 |	And this is a solution that I don't think we've recommended before because it's relatively new
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,680	| IOT219 |	I have to say
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:48,032	| IOT219 |	Jeff is like major old school with that RadioShack Melgar. I mean that is
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:52,128	| IOT219 |	Proprietary it's a light sensor that goes in the mailbox and
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:56,224	| IOT219 |	Send a chime into his house and
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:34:02,368	| IOT219 |	It is but it's against proprietary and does his question how can I connect this to Wi-Fi
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:04,416	| IOT219 |	The short answer is you can't
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:05,952	| IOT219 |	Unfortunately not easily
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:09,024	| IOT219 |	But we may have an alternative that's not terribly expensive
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:12,096	| IOT219 |	What weight should we explain why WI-Fi is proper
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:13,376	| IOT219 |	Play not everyone's First Choice here
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:17,728	| IOT219 |	Well yes we should because most mailboxes are
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:21,312	| IOT219 |	Probably Faraday cages was really hard to get a signal out
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:25,664	| IOT219 |	But the proprietary frequencies are typically in the 900 megahertz range
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:28,224	| IOT219 |	Which can travel better through
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:31,296	| IOT219 |	The Trap better through metal in walls and they also travel further
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:38,208	| IOT219 |	Yeah Wi-Fi is a shorter wavelength frequency at 2.4 and an even shorter at 5
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,256	| IOT219 |	Yes and what's happening is
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,536	| IOT219 |	The Spectre
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:46,656	| IOT219 |	Can't make it through or it can't make it as far and then the other eye thing to think about there is
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:47,936	| IOT219 |	A lot of them
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,496	| IOT219 |	Wi-Fi sucks a lot of
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:51,264	| IOT219 |	Battery power
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,032	| IOT219 |	Exactly
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:52,800	| IOT219 |	However
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:55,360	| IOT219 |	Jeff says he has good
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:58,176	| IOT219 |	Wi-Fi range maybe the signals
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:01,248	| IOT219 |	The Wi-Fi device inside of the mailbox can get through
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,040	| IOT219 |	So what we're going to recommend
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,344	| IOT219 |	Is he considered one of the new
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,112	| IOT219 |	Blink
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:06,880	| IOT219 |	Cameras
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:10,208	| IOT219 |	That runs on the battery for up to two years is still Wi-Fi
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:14,048	| IOT219 |	You get a one camera system and async module
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,584	| IOT219 |	Two connected to
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:16,608	| IOT219 |	You are network for
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,632	| IOT219 |	$80
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,424	| IOT219 |	If you put that in the place of your Milgard
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:23,008	| IOT219 |	And you can get a signal from it through your mailbox
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,032	| IOT219 |	You're in good shape
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:28,640	| IOT219 |	There's no way we can guarantee that because we don't know the distance of your mailbox is your mailbox made of
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,176	| IOT219 |	Half-inch thick metal
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:33,248	| IOT219 |	Cardboard I have no idea
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:34,784	| IOT219 |	We don't know for sure
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,808	| IOT219 |	If it will work
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:38,880	| IOT219 |	This is probably the best option
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,416	| IOT219 |	I've seen in awhile for
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,440	| IOT219 |	Very specific
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:45,024	| IOT219 |	Circumstances wherever Wi-Fi monitoring system for a mailbox
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:45,536	| IOT219 |	Could work
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:46,560	| IOT219 |	Agreed
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:53,472	| IOT219 |	And we also tried the wise sensors I'll just throw this out here for you because they're cheap and 40 bucks get you
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:54,752	| IOT219 |	What you might need
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:59,104	| IOT219 |	We found that the Hub could not be located more than about
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:01,152	| IOT219 |	3240 ft
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:02,176	| IOT219 |	Through a front door
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,456	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,992	| IOT219 |	I don't know if that's going to work
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:09,856	| IOT219 |	But before the show Stacy marked outside of her house with her
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:10,880	| IOT219 |	License and
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,672	| IOT219 |	Measure
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:16,000	| IOT219 |	Open and closed it several times to see how far it would go
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:20,096	| IOT219 |	Chick that would be ideal because again that's low power battery and so on
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,912	| IOT219 |	It might work in Jeff's case again I don't know where his
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:25,216	| IOT219 |	Mailbox is it might be just outside is
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,752	| IOT219 |	Front door I don't know
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:32,128	| IOT219 |	Down if your cameras like right by your front window or something so the wireless is a little better cuz this was
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:38,528	| IOT219 |	Right this is sub gigahertz so somewhere in 900 maybe 4:15 gigahertz is what the why sensors are using
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,320	| IOT219 |	So you know
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,088	| IOT219 |	Might
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:41,600	| IOT219 |	Work
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:44,160	| IOT219 |	And is cheap if you want to try it so
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,952	| IOT219 |	Those are the options I wish I had like a
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:47,744	| IOT219 |	2 Cool Wi-Fi photo sensor that
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,536	| IOT219 |	Would be magically able to work but
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,584	| IOT219 |	That is not an option
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:53,120	| IOT219 |	All right
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:56,704	| IOT219 |	Moving right along with another question for Wi-Fi
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:58,496	| IOT219 |	Stem cell
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,288	| IOT219 |	This is from Daniel let's hear it
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:04,640	| IOT219 |	Hey guys I just want to say I really love the show about Amazon Echo
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,176	| IOT219 |	What a year ago
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,736	| IOT219 |	Can you guys the show I guess
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,296	| IOT219 |	11
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,320	| IOT219 |	1011
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,392	| IOT219 |	And I listen to every Thursday
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,184	| IOT219 |	My question is
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,720	| IOT219 |	What the best setup
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,512	| IOT219 |	For your Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:22,048	| IOT219 |	The safest setup
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:25,632	| IOT219 |	Some people say that of the land
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:29,216	| IOT219 |	Is the best I've heard other people say they like a guest network is the best
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,008	| IOT219 |	So I just wanted to ask
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:32,800	| IOT219 |	Canyon Honda
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,592	| IOT219 |	I don't have any
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:36,128	| IOT219 |	Zigbee or Z-Wave device
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,408	| IOT219 |	This is all my Google assist
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,200	| IOT219 |	Alexis
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:39,712	| IOT219 |	Cloudbase
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| IOT219 |	We get this question a lot
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,576	| IOT219 |	Today's router settings networks aren't meant
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| IOT219 |	Really to
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:49,184	| IOT219 |	Protect iot devices specifically at me never meant to protect
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,232	| IOT219 |	You from
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,024	| IOT219 |	The outside world getting in in general
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,096	| IOT219 |	Honestly you could use a guest Network
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:59,936	| IOT219 |	We talked about that before you can use the guest Network for all of your devices
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,728	| IOT219 |	That is an option
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:04,544	| IOT219 |	That's kind of locked on little bit more than say your
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:05,568	| IOT219 |	Standard Network
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:11,456	| IOT219 |	That you could look into their there certain products out there we looked into and talked about before the bitdefender Box
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:14,272	| IOT219 |	Is $199 at 6 behind your router
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:20,928	| IOT219 |	I'm supposed to help filter traffic and watch for suspicious network activity so maybe if your attitude devices are going out to someone
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,488	| IOT219 |	It might work
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,536	| IOT219 |	I guess we're not really big fans of that though because
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:28,096	| IOT219 |	We've never really seen detail testing
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,632	| IOT219 |	To show that it better
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:32,448	| IOT219 |	I've tried some of the stuff
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:32,960	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:35,264	| IOT219 |	It does work I just
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,544	| IOT219 |	I don't know if my life is
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:39,616	| IOT219 |	Yeah cuz I feel like right now I'm not
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,664	| IOT219 |	I should say that I'm not being attacked
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,736	| IOT219 |	So a part of this is you know part of your wrist Pro
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,808	| IOT219 |	I will say the nicest feature that I
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:52,160	| IOT219 |	I'd like to have and I think you should have it although I think it should be free personally
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,696	| IOT219 |	Is understanding
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,720	| IOT219 |	What devices are on your
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,536	| IOT219 |	And getting a notification with something
EDL	00:38:57,536	00:38:58,048	| IOT219 |	Get on your knees
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:38:59,840	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:03,424	| IOT219 |	Yeah which do you use I forgot to say gyro I have to Eero
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,448	| IOT219 |	Service
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,984	| IOT219 |	Soon I will be up in
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:09,824	| IOT219 |	Comcast service area and I'll try there is but like Eero does let me know it's like
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,872	| IOT219 |	This weird device has joined your dad
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:13,408	| IOT219 |	Cool thanks
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:15,200	| IOT219 |	Super weird device
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:20,064	| IOT219 |	Can I use Google Wi-Fi
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:26,464	| IOT219 |	You don't have to pay for that type of information but it's it's passive however you actually have to open the app and
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,000	| IOT219 |	See what devices are on your network
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:31,328	| IOT219 |	So it's not like it notifies you when something
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,864	| IOT219 |	Has joined it doesn't
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:39,776	| IOT219 |	Proactively tell you that there's a new device or any like that so I periodically go through that cuz sometimes I even find
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:40,544	| IOT219 |	Devices that we
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,336	| IOT219 |	Sold or recycled
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:46,176	| IOT219 |	Better still cortical attached to that we're going to clean those out
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:49,504	| IOT219 |	But there's nothing automatic about that notifications either
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:56,672	| IOT219 |	That's the one thing the other thing I would say is if I were doing this all again from scratch
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,440	| IOT219 |	And I will
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:59,744	| IOT219 |	I would set up
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:00,768	| IOT219 |	My network
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:06,400	| IOT219 |	And I would set up all my iot devices on that and I would also have my guest Network
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:10,240	| IOT219 |	And nobody but me and maybe my husband
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:11,008	| IOT219 |	Because I do travel
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,312	| IOT219 |	We'll get the password for the
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:14,592	| IOT219 |	The cornet
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:17,152	| IOT219 |	And everybody else including my child will be on the
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:22,528	| IOT219 |	And the reason I will do that is because my child is going to give out our guest Network
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,296	| IOT219 |	Password Oliver
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,064	| IOT219 |	Friends
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:27,136	| IOT219 |	Also because children download all kinds of weird stuff
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:32,000	| IOT219 |	I don't know where it's tough to but kids
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,280	| IOT219 |	Kids are like oh yeah
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,304	| IOT219 |	I totally need this
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:37,376	| IOT219 |	So no friends are coming over to your house when you move I got it
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:39,936	| IOT219 |	No no no they just get the guest Network
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:46,592	| IOT219 |	You know when you're buying a mesh wi-fi system make sure that it has easy Euro basically if I what I can
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:48,640	| IOT219 |	I just go into the app and I'm like
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:51,456	| IOT219 |	I said I can text you I can email you
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,736	| IOT219 |	I guess Network
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:57,344	| IOT219 |	Be kind of cool if I could show you a QR code on my phone and you just snap it and get on the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:58,880	| IOT219 |	Add that
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,672	| IOT219 |	Are you hearing me Eero
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:04,000	| IOT219 |	That's the other network Safeguard I would save
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:07,584	| IOT219 |	It's not necessarily the security products but it's just a nice best
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:09,632	| IOT219 |	And if anybody has
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,960	| IOT219 |	Purchased a device or a service
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:13,984	| IOT219 |	2
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:16,544	| IOT219 |	Help with this I would actually like to hear about the
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,056	| IOT219 |	The clothes back
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:19,616	| IOT219 |	We've had some people tell us what they do but
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:20,384	| IOT219 |	Again
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:24,480	| IOT219 |	They're always new Services new products coming out and it's been awhile since we've address this question
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:25,248	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:28,576	| IOT219 |	It could be that I have not been on the up-and-up with what's going on in this in this place
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,904	| IOT219 |	Kevin manno
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:32,928	| IOT219 |	All right
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:37,024	| IOT219 |	Our next color isn't actually a color it's someone who emails
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:37,536	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:41,120	| IOT219 |	Really felt uncomfortable leaving a voicemail so
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,008	| IOT219 |	Out loud
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:49,568	| IOT219 |	I wonder if you could help me find a solution to this scenario
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:55,711	| IOT219 |	I have a tablet that is always on connected to power and is showing a web page with actiontiles control
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:42:01,855	| IOT219 |	I want to be able to see the video for my ring Pro doorbell when there is motion or somebody presses the doorbell button
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:03,647	| IOT219 |	Or when I issue a voice command
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:04,415	| IOT219 |	Like
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:05,439	| IOT219 |	Anime
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:06,463	| IOT219 |	Show me the front door
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:12,863	| IOT219 |	Currently my tablet is not an Amazon Fire tablet but I would consider replacing it if the Fire tablet can do what I want
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:16,959	| IOT219 |	I know the Amazon show can display the video from The Ring
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:18,495	| IOT219 |	But I don't like the price of the show
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:23,103	| IOT219 |	Totally fair comment about the
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:25,919	| IOT219 |	Amazon show I'm just not a fan of that device in general
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:26,943	| IOT219 |	And not just cuz of the price
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:29,503	| IOT219 |	Baptist don't care for it even though I have some smart displays
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:31,039	| IOT219 |	Illusion
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,831	| IOT219 |	That's fine if you buy everything that
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,623	| IOT219 |	Amazon shows list you or whatever
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:36,415	| IOT219 |	That's all you
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:41,279	| IOT219 |	This was interesting to me because I didn't know about actiontiles which as Kira looks like as a web-based
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,327	| IOT219 |	Customizable
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:46,655	| IOT219 |	Bunch of tiles that would show a title for each one of your smart home devices
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:51,263	| IOT219 |	It's really made for SmartThings he didn't mention that I don't think it was anything else
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,543	| IOT219 |	So I'm assuming you a smart thing
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:56,895	| IOT219 |	Because it's web-based it works with just about any tablet or phone so you can even use an iPad
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:00,223	| IOT219 |	But that's not going to solve the problem
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:02,015	| IOT219 |	Backhero has posed to us
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:02,527	| IOT219 |	So
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,343	| IOT219 |	A Fire tablet I hate to say is
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,391	| IOT219 |	Probably the best at lowest cost
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,695	| IOT219 |	However
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:12,511	| IOT219 |	Lenovo actually makes a smart
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,559	| IOT219 |	Tab which is also an Android tablet
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:16,863	| IOT219 |	Comes in two sizes 8 or 10 in
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,399	| IOT219 |	And
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:20,191	| IOT219 |	Similar lucky Rose doing
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:23,007	| IOT219 |	Carol has his tablet always plugged in
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:25,311	| IOT219 |	This includes a speaker dock
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:28,127	| IOT219 |	And when you put the Smart Tab in the speaker dock
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:30,943	| IOT219 |	You essentially transform it into an Echo Show
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:33,247	| IOT219 |	And at that point you can ask
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,783	| IOT219 |	Madame A2
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:37,087	| IOT219 |	Show your ring or do whatever you need her to do
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:41,439	| IOT219 |	They start around 199 go up to 350 depending on the specs
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:46,815	| IOT219 |	So obviously much more expensive than your Fire HD is what you can get sometimes for 50 bucks
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:49,375	| IOT219 |	But if you want a decent tablet
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:55,007	| IOT219 |	That you can actually take out of a dog have a charge uses a tablet and then put it back in to use it as an Echo Show
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:55,775	| IOT219 |	It's a nice
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,543	| IOT219 |	Option
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,567	| IOT219 |	I will say
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:44:00,895	| IOT219 |	Because it's an Android tablet the native default
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:02,943	| IOT219 |	Assistant is Google
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:04,479	| IOT219 |	So when it is not.
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:08,319	| IOT219 |	If you ask it a question only Google is going to listen and answer
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,599	| IOT219 |	If you put it
