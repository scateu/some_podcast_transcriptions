EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:33,952	| IOT113 |	Let me know
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:35,232	| IOT113 |	We can meet up
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:36,256	| IOT113 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:36,768	| IOT113 |	Kevin
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:40,608	| IOT113 |	Let's get started shall we start with Google or should we just start with something
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,120	| IOT113 |	Easy like Ikea
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:46,240	| IOT113 |	I kind of feel like we should start with Google because the last
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:50,592	| IOT113 |	Show we did we recorded a couple hours before the Google IO Keynote
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:52,128	| IOT113 |	And there's so much stuff
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,664	| IOT113 |	That was discussed
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:54,432	| IOT113 |	There was
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,200	| IOT113 |	First
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| IOT113 |	Let's get
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,016	| IOT113 |	Your disclosure
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:03,648	| IOT113 |	Oh yes I work for Google as a full-time consultant not in there
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:07,232	| IOT113 |	Anything related to its smart home or iot or anything like that
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,000	| IOT113 |	Syria
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| IOT113 |	Now we know Kevin
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,816	| IOT113 |	You get my honest opinion
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,120	| IOT113 |	How old is so honest
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:17,984	| IOT113 |	Are you going back that should tell you everything
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,544	| IOT113 |	At the
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,312	| IOT113 |	Keynote
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:23,104	| IOT113 |	With Sundar pichai and
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,128	| IOT113 |	The assorted cast
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,152	| IOT113 |	Google favorites
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:29,760	| IOT113 |	There was a lot of people who are like
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,784	| IOT113 |	That is true
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| IOT113 |	I didn't think it was
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:32,832	| IOT113 |	Cuz there was a new
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,880	| IOT113 |	Processing unit
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:37,696	| IOT113 |	Really nothing gets me more excited than chips
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,232	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,256	| IOT113 |	Custom architecture
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,328	| IOT113 |	Fight for our audience
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:46,144	| IOT113 |	I went through and watched a lot of B
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,424	| IOT113 |	Presentations after
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,192	| IOT113 |	Edwards
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,984	| IOT113 |	I said I was super excited
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,776	| IOT113 |	This show is all about
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:55,360	| IOT113 |	Contacts so last year Google was all about artificial intelligence
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:58,176	| IOT113 |	And how that was going to be the foundation
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| IOT113 |	For everything that Google does
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:01,760	| IOT113 |	This year they put that to work
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:07,136	| IOT113 |	In ways that are pretty compelling so the idea is when you have Computing everywhere
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:10,464	| IOT113 |	And we as mere humans are like
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,232	| IOT113 |	Well
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:15,072	| IOT113 |	How can we interact with this stuff without giving complex commands
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,864	| IOT113 |	Things without screens
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,168	| IOT113 |	The answer to that is
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:24,288	| IOT113 |	How did the computers figure out where you are or what you're most likely to do in that situation and then
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,336	| IOT113 |	Present a more limited kind of choice.
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| IOT113 |	Is that a fair way of saying huge
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:32,224	| IOT113 |	I think it's a fair way saying that and I think
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,016	| IOT113 |	There were people that thought though
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:40,416	| IOT113 |	Keynote in the show itself was kind of boring because there were no devices and what those people I think have forgotten is that it's a devel
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| IOT113 |	Ella prevention
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:45,536	| IOT113 |	Granted there have been new products released at Google IO in the past
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,864	| IOT113 |	But like you said this was really all about
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:52,960	| IOT113 |	Advancing the contacts that type of information right place right time
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| IOT113 |	Kind of thing and
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,288	| IOT113 |	That's
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,568	| IOT113 |	Ingested
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:01,664	| IOT113 |	The future sokolov you were like other showing as a future that's always right around the corner
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:07,552	| IOT113 |	You got to start somewhere you know when you got to you got to put the platforms out there for the developers to take advantage of
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:12,160	| IOT113 |	In a sense they actually did really quite a bit so on a smartphone
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,976	| IOT113 |	I got really excited because they
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:18,047	| IOT113 |	Talk about how you can build apps easily
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,583	| IOT113 |	For Google Assistant
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:23,935	| IOT113 |	Which is the brains behind your phone it's
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:29,567	| IOT113 |	It might be in your car and it is most importantly the brains inside your Google home
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:33,151	| IOT113 |	A speaker that competes with the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| IOT113 |	What they've done
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,223	| IOT113 |	Apparently
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,759	| IOT113 |	They've created
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,551	| IOT113 |	Smart home apps
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,623	| IOT113 |	Which is on the actions on Google platform
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,439	| IOT113 |	Going to be a lot of words about to happen
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,743	| IOT113 |	Actions on Google is
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,023	| IOT113 |	The
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,815	| IOT113 |	It's the platform for building
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,327	| IOT113 |	Things for the
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,351	| IOT113 |	Google Assistant
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:54,399	| IOT113 |	Basically
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:57,727	| IOT113 |	Short version of this is hey it's really easy now to build
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,519	| IOT113 |	Google
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,287	| IOT113 |	Home app
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,567	| IOT113 |	Creations
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,103	| IOT113 |	And they said they
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,639	| IOT113 |	Have now 70
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:11,551	| IOT113 |	App integration so if you go to devices for your Google home you're going to see a lot more stuff and he said that in the last 6 weeks most
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,063	| IOT113 |	Those were at
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| IOT113 |	Which is amazing
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,623	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:18,975	| IOT113 |	Right now the Amazon Echo has over 10000 skills
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,511	| IOT113 |	Like / 200
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,815	| IOT113 |	20 of them are smart home related
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:26,143	| IOT113 |	And what I'm saying is like they're not there yet
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| IOT113 |	But holy cow
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,471	| IOT113 |	They just need a really easy to do it
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,239	| IOT113 |	And they have
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,543	| IOT113 |	Nothing about this is
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| IOT113 |	They've done it a couple different ways so they've got
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,127	| IOT113 |	Your device types
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,663	| IOT113 |	They got their overall structure
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,943	| IOT113 |	We just kind of like
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:44,063	| IOT113 |	What is this stick out the room they think of it in three ways so structure room into ice
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,599	| IOT113 |	Room is
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,903	| IOT113 |	A label you put on your device
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,695	| IOT113 |	And it knows what devices
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,719	| IOT113 |	In the quilting is
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:53,023	| IOT113 |	Devices are basically device schemas
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,791	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,839	| IOT113 |	What words will
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,863	| IOT113 |	Change this aspect
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:01,215	| IOT113 |	I said has trades that has state it has all of this information
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,775	| IOT113 |	And they got stuff for that already for lights
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,543	| IOT113 |	Thermostat
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,335	| IOT113 |	Cats and they're going to be adding a whole lot
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,455	| IOT113 |	Hopefully for locks too cuz I still can't see my locking
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:11,967	| IOT113 |	Google assist
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,247	| IOT113 |	Oh yeah you can
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,527	| IOT113 |	Isaac
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,319	| IOT113 |	Like I know
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:20,159	| IOT113 |	I asked the echo all the time and then
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,183	| IOT113 |	Same here
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:29,119	| IOT113 |	So this is really cool I really highly recommend you go check this out and
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:33,471	| IOT113 |	If your developer trying to build this stuff because it it almost looks so easy like I could do it
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,263	| IOT113 |	But probably not
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:38,591	| IOT113 |	And other nice thing is it's super easy to do this
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:43,711	| IOT113 |	But they also require you to send them a device but
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:44,991	| IOT113 |	Prove your
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,807	| IOT113 |	Integration and that's great cuz they're going to do
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:51,135	| IOT113 |	Lots of testing there testing for latency
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| IOT113 |	Adjusting that works
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,975	| IOT113 |	And that can be kind of like a certified
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,743	| IOT113 |	Vacation
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,255	| IOT113 |	Program there
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,791	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:02,655	| IOT113 |	It's not just two apps it's actually bring assistant putting assistant invoices third-party devices
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,935	| IOT113 |	So yes
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,471	| IOT113 |	Status status
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:05,983	| IOT113 |	What I was taught
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,519	| IOT113 |	But yes
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,335	| IOT113 |	That is also a thing they talked about you want to talk about that
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,895	| IOT113 |	Google Assistant SDK in other devices
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,711	| IOT113 |	I didn't watch
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:21,087	| IOT113 |	No I don't want
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:23,391	| IOT113 |	I didn't I didn't have to I was working during the
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,951	| IOT113 |	I did not see that
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| IOT113 |	I just knew about
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| IOT113 |	Guess
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:29,279	| IOT113 |	So yes
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,887	| IOT113 |	Much like Amazon
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,679	| IOT113 |	Adesa KC
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,799	| IOT113 |	Plus they actually have done something with their microphones
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,639	| IOT113 |	So they have a hardware reference design so you can build your own
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,919	| IOT113 |	Echo like device
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,199	| IOT113 |	Google has
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,759	| IOT113 |	Beliefs and SDK so you can put Google Assistant
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,295	| IOT113 |	Other things
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,575	| IOT113 |	Thanks right
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,415	| IOT113 |	There was a lot about
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,439	| IOT113 |	Android
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:01,791	| IOT113 |	And I'm still actually thinking about some of this and I'd love to talk.
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| IOT113 |	People so if you're working with Android pay
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,607	| IOT113 |	Come tell me
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,375	| IOT113 |	What you think
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,399	| IOT113 |	Because my goodness
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,935	| IOT113 |	There was a lot
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,215	| IOT113 |	And I
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,543	| IOT113 |	I didn't know if I should be excited about this
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| IOT113 |	Or if it was just another kind of
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,663	| IOT113 |	Bifurcated universe that I don't really want to
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,295	| IOT113 |	Google home cuz it's like we will work with everything
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,087	| IOT113 |	Even they are not Android
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,415	| IOT113 |	Although Android things does seem to offer some
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| IOT113 |	Ankle supports
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| IOT113 |	Nice secure
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,463	| IOT113 |	Dirty stuff
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,839	| IOT113 |	And speaking of Google home working with
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:40,959	| IOT113 |	Lots of things Google Assistant did come to IOS as had been rumored
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,775	| IOT113 |	That was announced and launched a Tayo
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,311	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,591	| IOT113 |	Get an iPhone
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:52,479	| IOT113 |	Have you can use Google Assistant with your school and I don't know if you saw this but just some basic updates to home
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| IOT113 |	Itself
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,063	| IOT113 |	Calendar appointments reminders
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,367	| IOT113 |	A proactive notifications are coming
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:05,279	| IOT113 |	Also interesting because we just talked about it for a week or two ago hands-free calls with Google home similar to what they are
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,047	| IOT113 |	Echo is doing
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,327	| IOT113 |	But like this
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:13,983	| IOT113 |	But I was going to save I think but better some could you could you could argue against that there's Simplicity in a
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,263	| IOT113 |	Echo to Echo
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,823	| IOT113 |	Video or voice call I get that
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:23,711	| IOT113 |	It's different than a phone call which Google home actually will do it will place a phone call
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:28,575	| IOT113 |	Hands-free to any of your contacts and you can choose to actually have your phone number
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,367	| IOT113 |	Sean today
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:34,207	| IOT113 |	Person before they pick up so you don't have to do that but that's always nice as well so
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,487	| IOT113 |	I would say it's better but
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:36,511	| IOT113 |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| IOT113 |	No I I saw that and
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,375	| IOT113 |	That's way cooler
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,727	| IOT113 |	I thought so end
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,055	| IOT113 |	You know how the Amazons Fire TV
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,847	| IOT113 |	Platform if you have a
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:54,687	| IOT113 |	How to hook up to a TV and you use the voice search features
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,223	| IOT113 |	It shows you cards on the screen
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:02,623	| IOT113 |	Assistant will do that on your TV with Chromecast later this year they're going to visual responses
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:06,463	| IOT113 |	So if you say what's the weather and it can actually show you the the weather cards on your
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,279	| IOT113 |	Screen via Chromecast
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,303	| IOT113 |	The Google home voice
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:10,815	| IOT113 |	Calling is
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:11,839	| IOT113 |	Later this year to
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,655	| IOT113 |	You are correct it's not
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,447	| IOT113 |	Out yet I think they showed it off
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:21,055	| IOT113 |	And some of the limitations it's going to be in the US or Canada
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,079	| IOT113 |	No cost
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,407	| IOT113 |	But you're right it in the coming months I'm looking at the official blog post now
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| IOT113 |	Okay I was like
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,455	| IOT113 |	I don't
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,479	| IOT113 |	I don't have it
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,807	| IOT113 |	Yeah. We like to try the echo calling
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:32,831	| IOT113 |	But you're right
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,367	| IOT113 |	That's coming
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,903	| IOT113 |	In
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,975	| IOT113 |	When the rumors happened with the Echo Show
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| IOT113 |	Which is the
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| IOT113 |	The video
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,071	| IOT113 |	Touch screen screen
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| IOT113 |	I said
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,423	| IOT113 |	I'm not super excited about
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:52,287	| IOT113 |	I bought one but I would be more excited if my echo screen
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,847	| IOT113 |	My Amazon Amazon released an echo
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,663	| IOT113 |	It had contextual awareness and sent
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,223	| IOT113 |	Data instead of to a dedicated screen
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| IOT113 |	To the nearest or most appropriate screening
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:06,367	| IOT113 |	House in a way that's kind of what Google did
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,903	| IOT113 |	So like if you ask it for
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:12,511	| IOT113 |	Commute times it will actually end you can or directions to a place
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,047	| IOT113 |	You can tell it to send it to
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,327	| IOT113 |	Your phone
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| IOT113 |	NFL
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:16,863	| IOT113 |	Which is
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,167	| IOT113 |	And same thing with the
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,983	| IOT113 |	Sending stuff to your TV
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| IOT113 |	You can tell it to send it to your teeth
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,567	| IOT113 |	So it's not as automatic
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,615	| IOT113 |	Write this is bestie
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:28,639	| IOT113 |	And that's that's why
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:33,759	| IOT113 |	What I thought was super cool and super powerful
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:40,927	| IOT113 |	Again going back to this idea of context the Google home device can recognize up to six different voices
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,487	| IOT113 |	It's so when I tell it to call Mom
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,047	| IOT113 |	It's going to call my mom from my
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,375	| IOT113 |	When my husband says call
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,423	| IOT113 |	It's going to do something to
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,775	| IOT113 |	That is the kind of
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:59,359	| IOT113 |	Powerful interactions that we're going to need and that's all based on
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| IOT113 |	Having
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,431	| IOT113 |	Contextual ability that they showed
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,479	| IOT113 |	This is the world guys that we
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,503	| IOT113 |	Waiting for
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| IOT113 |	This is the world
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:12,927	| IOT113 |	You and I and many listed my family see that's the whole thing if I
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,463	| IOT113 |	Thinking about getting a Google
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:20,351	| IOT113 |	What you described I think is an awesome feature that multiple people can recognize
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,143	| IOT113 |	But nobody will talk anything in my house
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,655	| IOT113 |	Except for me
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,215	| IOT113 |	It seems like a waste
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:29,567	| IOT113 |	You have it you have it
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,103	| IOT113 |	Teenage daughter
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,383	| IOT113 |	White
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:39,039	| IOT113 |	He's in college so yeah he's he comes and goes but yeah
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,063	| IOT113 |	Nobody talks anything
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:47,743	| IOT113 |	That doesn't the voice recognition is really good it's not that good yet
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| IOT113 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,279	| IOT113 |	Recognize wolf wolf
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,815	| IOT113 |	No
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,583	| IOT113 |	No
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,095	| IOT113 |	It's probably for the
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:59,007	| IOT113 |	Although I wonder I wonder what the the shortcuts feature in Google Assistant I wonder if I could
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,031	| IOT113 |	Train it to Tucson
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,567	| IOT113 |	Let's talk about shortcuts
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| IOT113 |	Yeah it's funny because
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,919	| IOT113 |	One of our listeners
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,991	| IOT113 |	Forwarded you I think the this information
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,295	| IOT113 |	And shame on me because I saw it about
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:15,647	| IOT113 |	Maybe week ago week and a half ago and I neglected to mention it
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| IOT113 |	Yeah this is
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:22,303	| IOT113 |	But yeah it was the middle of May
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:27,423	| IOT113 |	This actually showed up and assistant I don't remember a blog post or any news about it but
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:30,239	| IOT113 |	Basically if you do have the assistant app and you open it up
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:33,055	| IOT113 |	If you go into your settings
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,407	| IOT113 |	You can actually see a bunch of options in there the bottom option for me anyways
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:37,919	| IOT113 |	Shortcuts
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,735	| IOT113 |	And what you can do is create what it says
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,295	| IOT113 |	But you crave faster easy ways to do your favorite things
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,599	| IOT113 |	And make a bunch of recommendations
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,671	| IOT113 |	Hilton already and I like you can say stock update
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,183	| IOT113 |	And
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,975	| IOT113 |	You would literally tell
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:55,071	| IOT113 |	Google what to do with a certain should do if you see a stock update to it
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,095	| IOT113 |	In this case
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,399	| IOT113 |	Talk to CNBC about the markets
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:04,799	| IOT113 |	So it's it's Ukraine custom shortcuts and actions for those shortcuts so
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,567	| IOT113 |	I haven't used it yet
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:08,383	| IOT113 |	I don't have a home and I hadn't sought to do it in my system now
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:12,479	| IOT113 |	Halibut actually you could for four like voice commands to your
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,503	| IOT113 |	Your phone too
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| IOT113 |	Hi I just realized
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,647	| IOT113 |	So when this arrived I had broken my phone
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,439	| IOT113 |	So I haven't tried it
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,207	| IOT113 |	It out yet
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,791	| IOT113 |	Because I guess I should have downloaded I'm using an iPhone instead of my Android phone
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:28,863	| IOT113 |	But since I'm only using it for a couple days I did not download
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,703	| IOT113 |	All of my hundred and something out apps
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,287	| IOT113 |	I'm looking at the default
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:41,919	| IOT113 |	Shortcut examples that they give and maybe this is how I get my girls to start talking or something because they are
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:45,759	| IOT113 |	There always been watching Gilmore Girls I don't know why but they do
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:50,111	| IOT113 |	And one of the shortcuts in here is you know what to do and the action is
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,927	| IOT113 |	Start watching Gilmore Girls on Netflix on the TV
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,975	| IOT113 |	Yeah so it's kind of it look
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,487	| IOT113 |	Looks like a cut
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,511	| IOT113 |	The powerful
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,791	| IOT113 |	Malmo stringify app
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,327	| IOT113 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,607	| IOT113 |	Exactly what I was thinking
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:06,751	| IOT113 |	Example that Derek sent us was now he is asked it to
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,031	| IOT113 |	Stop saying ask
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,799	| IOT113 |	Harmony
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,359	| IOT113 |	To Transit that's not Logitech Harmony to turn on the
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| IOT113 |	MattyB
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,663	| IOT113 |	Sorry to change the volume
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,455	| IOT113 |	So now he can just say
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| IOT113 |	Turn down the TV
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,551	| IOT113 |	Turn down TV
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| IOT113 |	And
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,647	| IOT113 |	Turn down TV volume and all these other great things
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,183	| IOT113 |	Looks like he
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,951	| IOT113 |	Traded
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,487	| IOT113 |	Multiple ways to say it
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,023	| IOT113 |	To turn the volume down and
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,559	| IOT113 |	Cuz that's how you you
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,071	| IOT113 |	Usually asked
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,167	| IOT113 |	It's too loud is usually what happens
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,591	| IOT113 |	But there's a shortcut it's too loud
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,871	| IOT113 |	There you go
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,407	| IOT113 |	So I had to play with this once I get my
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:52,831	| IOT113 |	Exciting things will happen if I may have to get a Google home after all this now
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,879	| IOT113 |	Well you don't maybe you wait till
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,207	| IOT113 |	Maybe I don't
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,231	| IOT113 |	I'm not a waiter
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:06,399	| IOT113 |	Now you know again I feel like you should just be able to cruise through the Google offices
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:10,495	| IOT113 |	I see air fresheners all over there yeah
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,055	| IOT113 |	Now that's an interesting idea those in office environments
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| IOT113 |	I'm like that's that's a little
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:23,295	| IOT113 |	All right that's for the recognition of his speaking really comes into play otherwise you'll be running in the Halls setting up everybody
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,063	| IOT113 |	Google home
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,135	| IOT113 |	Google
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,511	| IOT113 |	My bad
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:39,935	| IOT113 |	Hopefully because it was whispered and because it didn't finish
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| IOT113 |	And I can do that to you
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,287	| IOT113 |	Other things so that's that's a lot of
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:45,823	| IOT113 |	La Taqueria
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,359	| IOT113 |	Let's move to
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| IOT113 |	Ikea
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,199	| IOT113 |	Yes
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:54,271	| IOT113 |	Google and we were so excited about Ikea and there's more
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:56,831	| IOT113 |	Chad fee
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,135	| IOT113 |	I was wondering how you say it
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,439	| IOT113 |	Oh did you not listen to my Ikea home dude
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| IOT113 |	I'm sorry I didn't
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:07,839	| IOT113 |	Stratford
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,447	| IOT113 |	That's the we also learned on that show that
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:12,959	| IOT113 |	They sell
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,519	| IOT113 |	2.9 Million
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,031	| IOT113 |	All today
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| IOT113 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,335	| IOT113 |	Tell me the biggest seller
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,663	| IOT113 |	Probably
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:24,223	| IOT113 |	Those products are going to work with
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,015	| IOT113 |	Gosh everything
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,807	| IOT113 |	If you don't talk to it it's going to work with it
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,319	| IOT113 |	So Echo
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,135	| IOT113 |	Are we should say
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,951	| IOT113 |	Before you ask that question
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:36,767	| IOT113 |	If you have Google assistant on your iPhone
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,327	| IOT113 |	You cannot talk to yourself without talking to
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,351	| IOT113 |	Siri
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,375	| IOT113 |	You just have to
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,679	| IOT113 |	That is correct
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| IOT113 |	That is correct so you can't
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:49,567	| IOT113 |	Unlike an Android phone where you could set it that always be listening for the hot word and
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,615	| IOT113 |	You know hands-free all day long
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,151	| IOT113 |	You got to actually open that that's correct
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,015	| IOT113 |	I'm still Pro using
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,343	| IOT113 |	Echo and Google home over the
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,367	| IOT113 |	Cat stuff I have
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,975	| IOT113 |	TNN alot of the news of
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| IOT113 |	Assistant
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,791	| IOT113 |	Coming iOS came out
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,559	| IOT113 |	I saw on a lot of
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,607	| IOT113 |	Sites that cover Apple stuff
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,911	| IOT113 |	I told her negativity that I
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,191	| IOT113 |	It's not going to be
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:19,007	| IOT113 |	It's not native you have to open it
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,799	| IOT113 |	You know it's not going to sauna catch on
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,639	| IOT113 |	I begged a differ because
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:28,991	| IOT113 |	If you look at what Google photos has accomplished on iOS in 2 years
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:34,879	| IOT113 |	I think it's is a 500 million users and like 1.2 billion photos a day
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,439	| IOT113 |	A lot of them from IOS I mean
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,743	| IOT113 |	I don't see it as a barrier
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:40,767	| IOT113 |	But we'll see
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,047	| IOT113 |	Well end
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:47,423	| IOT113 |	It's a great way to try it out and I think if you really like it and you want an always-on out
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,471	| IOT113 |	$129 which is
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,495	| IOT113 |	Cost of the Google home
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:51,775	| IOT113 |	That's not
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,311	| IOT113 |	Crazy
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,175	| IOT113 |	Especially if you've already linked stuff to your
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| IOT113 |	Right right right
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,367	| IOT113 |	So you were going to say something
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,671	| IOT113 |	I was going to ask you a question
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:12,767	| IOT113 |	How is this going to work with homekit is homekit certified
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,535	| IOT113 |	Well
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| IOT113 |	It must have
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:17,631	| IOT113 |	A special chip inside saucer chip
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,703	| IOT113 |	I don't recall seeing
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,727	| IOT113 |	On the
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,519	| IOT113 |	The device has a
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,335	| IOT113 |	That's where I'm going I don't
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:31,967	| IOT113 |	This just seems like this week news that I would be leading with this product if that was the case and yet
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,247	| IOT113 |	I'm not saying that
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,575	| IOT113 |	Any homekit device
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:42,719	| IOT113 |	Should have on the back of sticker that has like the little homekit logo and a number and that's what you used to actually hook it up
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:43,999	| IOT113 |	Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| IOT113 |	Alright so
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,095	| IOT113 |	I don't have a truck for you
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:51,679	| IOT113 |	Because Ikea is like an hour away from me and I haven't gotten out there yet
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,471	| IOT113 |	To pick one up
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:57,311	| IOT113 |	You don't look on the back of yours if you have one and
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,615	| IOT113 |	If you do then sure as homekit certified
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,663	| IOT113 |	I don't know Kevin
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:04,735	| IOT113 |	I'm at a loss I mean I rather
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:10,879	| IOT113 |	Official press release and then they allude to working but they say that it's going to work with the home app is going to work with Siri and they say
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,159	| IOT113 |	Home cats
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,951	| IOT113 |	But it's other
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,999	| IOT113 |	The wording is just odd to me
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,815	| IOT113 |	I just wonder are they going to have some kind of bridge device
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,095	| IOT113 |	Coming later
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,631	| IOT113 |	You know I'm a big
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,567	| IOT113 |	I felt so much better
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| IOT113 |	Once I bought the
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,943	| IOT113 |	Are actually Lutron sent me a smart
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,991	| IOT113 |	Home their Bridge which is at
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:37,503	| IOT113 |	Think $80
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,599	| IOT113 |	Cuz I had I have all these Lutron lights in
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,647	| IOT113 |	Having the bridge makes me feel like
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:50,047	| IOT113 |	They're very serious despite having a really awesome proprietary protocol about integrating with other products
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:55,167	| IOT113 |	So once I bought that I was like sweet now I can buy a whole bunch more Lutron lights
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,471	| IOT113 |	So that's just by thinking
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,263	| IOT113 |	So if I was going to go all in
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,823	| IOT113 |	Platform that wasn't using Wi-Fi or
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,335	| IOT113 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,663	| IOT113 |	Having that bridge I feel gives me a lot of
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:14,111	| IOT113 |	No it's okay I mean this but this is why I prefer like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on other devices you know
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:16,672	| IOT113 |	Yeah. I just gravitate towards them because I don't want
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,464	| IOT113 |	Bridges in the hub center lappin
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:23,584	| IOT113 |	Totally understand I'm really thinking they're going to offer some kind of bridge products by I just not clear
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,376	| IOT113 |	But coming this summer or Autumn Place
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,192	| IOT113 |	You'll be able to do this
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,032	| IOT113 |	Alright so other immigration
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,824	| IOT113 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,592	| IOT113 |	What is kinetic energy
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,872	| IOT113 |	Dish
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:41,248	| IOT113 |	I thought this was cool because it's going to be this sort of thing where you say
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,296	| IOT113 |	Hey
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,344	| IOT113 |	Change the channel to ESPN
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,160	| IOT113 |	Find The Big Bang Theory
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,976	| IOT113 |	And all of this is just going to happen
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,488	| IOT113 |	If you're disgusting
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,096	| IOT113 |	I would love to see
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,864	| IOT113 |	Every
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:03,008	| IOT113 |	Provider like Comcast has their Xfinity home and they have a speaking remote where you can talk to the remote and do this
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,800	| IOT113 |	Supposed to the echo
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,152	| IOT113 |	Why not
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:13,504	| IOT113 |	I think I should I should play a little bit more with the Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:16,576	| IOT113 |	Android TV that I use I don't use the voice kids
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:21,952	| IOT113 |	Well yeah sure I don't use the voice capabilities and part of the reason I bought it was because they were going to offer
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,976	| IOT113 |	They still plan to
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,768	| IOT113 |	A shield spot
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,792	| IOT113 |	$50 mic
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,560	| IOT113 |	Earphone
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:30,144	| IOT113 |	That basically let you talk to it like you talk to a Google home and then
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,168	| IOT113 |	Would interact
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,936	| IOT113 |	The TV
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:34,496	| IOT113 |	I just don't know if they're TV controls yet for any of that
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:35,520	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,336	| IOT113 |	I should
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:38,848	| IOT113 |	Does the Nvidia Shield
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:43,200	| IOT113 |	Well I don't know if I don't have a good one
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:47,552	| IOT113 |	I don't know what the remote itself has a microphone on it
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,088	| IOT113 |	Oh yeah that it does
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:53,440	| IOT113 |	Yeah yeah sure so I should use it more
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:56,768	| IOT113 |	To do list
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:02,656	| IOT113 |	Okay
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,168	| IOT113 |	Let's see
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,704	| IOT113 |	What else do l
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:05,984	| IOT113 |	If this then that
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:10,080	| IOT113 |	Every time I say that I do a mental
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,688	| IOT113 |	It's his lunch it's
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,456	| IOT113 |	Megaplex
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:21,344	| IOT113 |	And they were sponsoring the show a couple weeks ago and I actually used to make a platform to create the
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,648	| IOT113 |	Internet of Things podcast channel on if
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:24,928	| IOT113 |	Which
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,952	| IOT113 |	If you guys don't know
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:26,976	| IOT113 |	Is
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| IOT113 |	Available to you and you can get
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| IOT113 |	Things like
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:32,864	| IOT113 |	Save my articles on Stacey on iot
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,376	| IOT113 |	Or
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,704	| IOT113 |	You no send me send me a notification when
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,008	| IOT113 |	I think I have my lights hurting
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,568	| IOT113 |	Red in my living room window podcast publishes
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,616	| IOT113 |	Fun things
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,688	| IOT113 |	It's like it's like a red alert
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,200	| IOT113 |	Siri
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,760	| IOT113 |	Your podcast is life
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,272	| IOT113 |	I know
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,320	| IOT113 |	You know sometimes I don't
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:52,832	| IOT113 |	Question is always
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,672	| IOT113 |	Publish
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:58,464	| IOT113 |	There we go now we're thinking
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:02,304	| IOT113 |	And my hope is I'm trying to figure out how to
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:08,192	| IOT113 |	Launch a channel that actually will send you a notification if I mention in the tags a certain
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| IOT113 |	Hair product
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,264	| IOT113 |	Which everybody who's like
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,080	| IOT113 |	I really want to listen to it when you talk about you know
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,640	| IOT113 |	These light switches cuz he's are what I have in my house
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,920	| IOT113 |	Then that would be good for you
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:24,576	| IOT113 |	That was like a little ad within the show sorry I'll but
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,344	| IOT113 |	Ifft
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:29,696	| IOT113 |	Is doing its own maker Channel and this is kind of cool because a couple
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:33,536	| IOT113 |	Well I was a year ago a while back that they took out the ability to like
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,584	| IOT113 |	Publicly share
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,864	| IOT113 |	Applets that
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:40,960	| IOT113 |	Yeah late last year I think it was
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,472	| IOT113 |	Disappointed cuz I I
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,544	| IOT113 |	Stop
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,336	| IOT113 |	Hey don't bother me I'm making Annapolis
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,176	| IOT113 |	They took that away but now
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:55,296	| IOT113 |	New capabilities that used to be that you could only like tie two things together right which is fun
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:55,808	| IOT113 |	Yay
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:59,904	| IOT113 |	But now you can build applets with multiple actions
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:02,464	| IOT113 |	Turnt
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:05,024	| IOT113 |	And that's actually pretty exciting cuz you can do some of the
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,072	| IOT113 |	Some of the more
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,608	| IOT113 |	I don't know
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:11,424	| IOT113 |	When this happens turn off the lights and do this
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,472	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,240	| IOT113 |	That's going to be fun
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:15,520	| IOT113 |	Will be playing with that
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,056	| IOT113 |	And
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:22,944	| IOT113 |	One other feature that's probably interesting to you guys is you cannot create a tablets that work on any connected device
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,992	| IOT113 |	Even if you don't own it
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,528	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:29,088	| IOT113 |	It used to be that you had to link your device before you
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,112	| IOT113 |	Create an applet for it
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,392	| IOT113 |	Which
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,000	| IOT113 |	Sense but sometimes your wife you want to expect like for this show for example
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,280	| IOT113 |	We want to experiment with
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:41,376	| IOT113 |	Can I possibly do this if so I'd like to buy this device right
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,400	| IOT113 |	And so
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:44,192	| IOT113 |	This lets you see all the triggers and
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:45,728	| IOT113 |	Play with the
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,800	| IOT113 |	Full Outlet before you actually maybe go out and buy a device
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:50,336	| IOT113 |	You can see it it works for you
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:53,408	| IOT113 |	Can you actually test without device or no
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:53,920	| IOT113 |	It can run it
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,736	| IOT113 |	If it's like
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,040	| IOT113 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:03,136	| IOT113 |	But it's nice because there a couple times when I'm like
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,952	| IOT113 |	Oh I'm looking for a particular trigger like one
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:09,280	| IOT113 |	Popular thing that I like is I have a netatmo
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT113 |	Camera
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,376	| IOT113 |	And I can use that to see it recognizes people
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,912	| IOT113 |	Because it recognizes people
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:18,496	| IOT113 |	I was hoping to build something that was like basically
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,288	| IOT113 |	If you see the following people
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,312	| IOT113 |	Do this action
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:24,384	| IOT113 |	Right or if you haven't it more and more
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,176	| IOT113 |	Reliably I want to do if you haven't seen
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:26,688	| IOT113 |	The following
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,504	| IOT113 |	That wasn't actually a trigger
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,808	| IOT113 |	So that netatmo has it
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,576	| IOT113 |	Gift
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,344	| IOT113 |	Immigration
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:36,672	| IOT113 |	But it didn't actually include people recognition is what
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,696	| IOT113 |	By the trigger so it's like
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,464	| IOT113 |	Hummer
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,744	| IOT113 |	But I would have been able
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,256	| IOT113 |	Will see that nessus
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| IOT113 |	All right
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| IOT113 |	All right
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,352	| IOT113 |	That
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:45,632	| IOT113 |	Is that
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,168	| IOT113 |	And
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,192	| IOT113 |	If you make something really cool
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,264	| IOT113 |	A big name brand might pick up your applet and showcase it on there
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,848	| IOT113 |	Hey make something for the iot podcast
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,872	| IOT113 |	Maybe I'll publish that
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,896	| IOT113 |	Hey hey hey
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,944	| IOT113 |	That's about it on the issue
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,760	| IOT113 |	I don't know I feel like we've done
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,528	| IOT113 |	Hutong a good show today
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,600	| IOT113 |	Lots of news lots of nudity
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,880	| IOT113 |	Leinenkugel Lodge
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:11,744	| IOT113 |	WeMo dimmer Wi-Fi light switch
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| IOT113 |	It is
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,048	| IOT113 |	Pretty
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:15,328	| IOT113 |	But it's $80
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,888	| IOT113 |	Which is a life coach
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:21,472	| IOT113 |	Especially because I had just tested the Leviton
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,032	| IOT113 |	Wi-Fi light switch
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,056	| IOT113 |	Which was
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,080	| IOT113 |	I think it's like
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,128	| IOT113 |	It ranges between 45 and
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:30,176	| IOT113 |	$50 and that is both
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:35,040	| IOT113 |	Google home and Amazon Echo capable and it's got dimming functionality just like
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:41,184	| IOT113 |	This is why I go bulbs every chance I get not switches
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:43,744	| IOT113 |	Switch off I know you are
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,304	| IOT113 |	All right we're going to argue about that next show
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:51,680	| IOT113 |	Because I have his massive mapping projects where I'm actually swapping out lots of light switches
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,448	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,240	| IOT113 |	Real talk about what that means
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,520	| IOT113 |	And how much that costs
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,800	| IOT113 |	And either time or dollars
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,432	| IOT113 |	After that our guest
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,224	| IOT113 |	Michael Bell CEO Silver Springs
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,272	| IOT113 |	Who is going to talk about
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,344	| IOT113 |	The smart grid
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,672	| IOT113 |	And they have over 25 million devices
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:13,952	| IOT113 |	Added to their net worth
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,720	| IOT113 |	Which is a lot
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:24,960	| IOT113 |	Hey everybody we're taking a quick break in The Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:29,312	| IOT113 |	Eros and I have Evan whitelock who's a product marketing manager at Eros
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:35,200	| IOT113 |	How to talk to us about iot and Healthcare so Evan what is aris doing in health
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:42,112	| IOT113 |	As a connectivity been a connectivity management provider what we're really providing to a lot of customers that are there
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:46,976	| IOT113 |	New solution providers that are entering into the healthcare space are really how to fold I think
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:51,328	| IOT113 |	The first is at 4 customers that today have an unconnected product will there be
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:54,400	| IOT113 |	A sleep apnea machine or in-home medical device
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:56,448	| IOT113 |	They're moving from an unconnected product
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:00,032	| IOT113 |	QA connected service adding extra value of that service
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:03,616	| IOT113 |	Enable them to increase their revenue from the devices that are already selling
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:07,456	| IOT113 |	One of the challenges there is to keep those operational costs as low as possible
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:11,552	| IOT113 |	Given this new connectivity that there including into their product so the tools it
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:17,952	| IOT113 |	Customers are leveraging from our connectivity management platform really help them bring their operational costs to level to the lowest
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,232	| IOT113 |	Possible to ensure that
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:25,632	| IOT113 |	The margin that they're gaining from the other revenue on these new recurring Services it is great as possible and then second
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:30,240	| IOT113 |	We look Beyond into the larger scope of the iot world in and where these Solutions
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:31,776	| IOT113 |	Can become ocean pack for
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:37,664	| IOT113 |	We have a lot of partners that are working to bring Advanced Healthcare Solutions into the maybe some of the underdeveloped
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:40,736	| IOT113 |	Parts of the world for example sweet scent is a customer of ours
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:44,832	| IOT113 |	It is leveraging our Global connectivity to bring Water Treatment Solutions
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,880	| IOT113 |	Various parts of the world specifically in
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,672	| IOT113 |	In underdeveloped areas where
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:54,048	| IOT113 |	Where water quality is a very very large issue
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:30:01,216	| IOT113 |	I think when we look at what I can do for the healthcare space specifically it opens up exponential advancement
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:07,616	| IOT113 |	In-N-Out only the efficiency of Healthcare systems for example reference the ability to provide a connected Home Health Care
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:14,016	| IOT113 |	Solution for patients with chronic conditions can actually have a device that that allows them to communicate directly with their health care provide
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:20,416	| IOT113 |	Lighter instead of having to schedule trips and leave the house and oftentimes for patients with disabilities or chronic conditions that's amaze
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:24,512	| IOT113 |	Adopting iot by making it connected solution
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:30,912	| IOT113 |	They're able to provide a much more efficient solution for that customer I think what it also does is it enables healthcare provider
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:37,312	| IOT113 |	Riders equipment manufacturers to move from just selling Hardware to a recurring Revenue model opening up a
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:43,200	| IOT113 |	Brand new Revenue stream for their services that they provide what are the most rapidly growing markets
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:50,368	| IOT113 |	Beyond health care we see tremendous growth still in in the automotive Market even though that's been one of the drivers for
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:56,256	| IOT113 |	Form a society adoption with connected cars and consumer Automotive but as we moving towards a more autonomous
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:31:02,656	| IOT113 |	The world which is one of the buzzword there that's why we've invested a lot into the bleeding edge of autonomous and consumer
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:09,056	| IOT113 |	Technology but even beyond that we see a large possibility just about every vertical for every device that's previously been
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:15,456	| IOT113 |	Non-connected possibilities are really endless there for a Wiens who historically provided non-connected products to move
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,736	| IOT113 |	Toys that are connected world
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,272	| IOT113 |	If I want to learn more Evan
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,296	| IOT113 |	Where should I go
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:25,696	| IOT113 |	You should definitely head to our website eros.com that's a e r i s.com podcast
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:32,096	| IOT113 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:38,496	| IOT113 |	The Internet of Things podcast this is your host and today's guest is Mike Bell the CEO and president
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,776	| IOT113 |	End of Silver Spring Networks
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,568	| IOT113 |	Hi Mike how are you doing
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:47,456	| IOT113 |	Free Stacy how about yourself I am super well and I am excited to talk to you today about
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,992	| IOT113 |	The smart grid
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,040	| IOT113 |	Smart Energy
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:52,064	| IOT113 |	And
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,088	| IOT113 |	How you guys
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:55,904	| IOT113 |	Because you've been doing Smart Energy for so long
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| IOT113 |	Are more like
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:59,232	| IOT113 |	A top industrial iot company
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:01,792	| IOT113 |	This is the case you're going to try to make and you're also going to tell me about
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:03,584	| IOT113 |	Energy generator
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| IOT113 |	Nothing too hard
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:13,056	| IOT113 |	Alright so let's get started you guys have been doing this for a while and you told me you now have 25 million devices
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:13,824	| IOT113 |	In the field
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,592	| IOT113 |	Which is crazy
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,360	| IOT113 |	That's a lot
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:17,408	| IOT113 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:21,248	| IOT113 |	Cisco's predictions for Lake Tahoe
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,040	| IOT113 |	Exactly
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:27,392	| IOT113 |	Take me through kind of because this is I think a really good microcosm for iot
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,928	| IOT113 |	And where it can take
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:29,440	| IOT113 |	The rest of the world
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,232	| IOT113 |	Give me energy mark
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:36,608	| IOT113 |	Can you take me through what it was like in the late 90s then smartcric came out and then
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,376	| IOT113 |	Tell me where were
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:42,752	| IOT113 |	Mercury little people think about smart. And they're like oh you know you read my meter for me in
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,288	| IOT113 |	I sure that that's
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:50,432	| IOT113 |	Probably where it started you know it's it's easier to automate meter reading than sending armies of people on the field and
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,456	| IOT113 |	You can argue that it
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:53,248	| IOT113 |	Who's better for the consumer it was better for the
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,272	| IOT113 |	Utilities because it took
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:58,368	| IOT113 |	It made the process easy and it took you know trucks off the road and that was great
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:03,488	| IOT113 |	The really we're headed I can't imagine a modern utility right now
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:07,584	| IOT113 |	Without having a smartphone implementation I mean it would be like the Stone Age because
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:10,656	| IOT113 |	It's going so beyond your once-a-month reading meter
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:12,448	| IOT113 |	I mean if you live in a part of the country
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:15,520	| IOT113 |	It gets hot and experiences brownouts aureus
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:20,640	| IOT113 |	You live in a part of the country with bad weather I mean right now the smart grid is responsible
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,432	| IOT113 |	Keeping your lights on when things happen
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,968	| IOT113 |	Or keeping your lights on when
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:26,784	| IOT113 |	Electricity demand get so high to the otherwise
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,064	| IOT113 |	The blackout
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,576	| IOT113 |	Areas
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:35,488	| IOT113 |	Modern utility lives and dies by the data they get off their smart grid Network and that's how they're able to function
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:39,328	| IOT113 |	It's such a complex environment we have including things like
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:42,400	| IOT113 |	Micro generation from solar and other things in Electra
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,424	| IOT113 |	Vehicle charging I mean
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,472	| IOT113 |	Utilities have a really
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:50,336	| IOT113 |	How to deal with a lot of stuff since you know even even the past 20 years I'd say their job
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| IOT113 |	Keeping the lights on has become more and more
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:52,640	| IOT113 |	Complex
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:54,944	| IOT113 |	As we've added a lot of these new technologies
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:59,040	| IOT113 |	To what was otherwise a pretty stable kind of business for a hundred years
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,552	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:05,952	| IOT113 |	If I'm a utility and I'm looking at I'm using more of my data and my deploy more sensors like
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,488	| IOT113 |	It used to be smart meter
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,304	| IOT113 |	2 point x end
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,328	| IOT113 |	Now what are they playing
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,352	| IOT113 |	Wait a second
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:15,168	| IOT113 |	Yeah you know it's actually a couple things
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:21,056	| IOT113 |	So it turns out that your your smart meter is actually a sensory know and it and knows all the other information
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:25,152	| IOT113 |	And it's kind of like your people talk about crowdsourcing so I'll call it crowdsourcing for meters
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,200	| IOT113 |	When you're able to take a look
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:28,736	| IOT113 |	Look at the data coming off
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:35,136	| IOT113 |	Thousands or millions of beaters you can put together some really interesting information so you can tell whether you're properly balancing
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,928	| IOT113 |	Voltage across your distribution area
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:41,536	| IOT113 |	You can tell if there are trees on the line but they're about to take out the power lines
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,048	| IOT113 |	Ephrata area
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,328	| IOT113 |	You can't even tell
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:46,400	| IOT113 |	If the electric socket it's somebody's house is something
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:49,728	| IOT113 |	Call the hot socket so corrosion build up over time
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:56,128	| IOT113 |	Resistance goes up in Franklin you can actually have a fire because of the socket being dirty Based on data coming from the meat
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:57,664	| IOT113 |	Either you can actually tell us a problem
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,944	| IOT113 |	On top of that you can
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,224	| IOT113 |	Deploy other sensors
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:03,808	| IOT113 |	To take a look at it other areas of the grading and something even worse.
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,320	| IOT113 |	Mating
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:11,488	| IOT113 |	Call distribution automation we're essentially tell you this big electric grid and a storm happens that takes out part of the grid
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:14,048	| IOT113 |	The reason your lights flicker and come back on is
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,072	| IOT113 |	The electricity
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,352	| IOT113 |	Rerouted in a minute
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,376	| IOT113 |	Instant
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,168	| IOT113 |	The smart grid technology does
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:25,568	| IOT113 |	Only read your meter and tells you when things are going to go bad and by the way when storms happen
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,336	| IOT113 |	3 is what actually helps
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:31,712	| IOT113 |	All right but this is still despite the intelligence that is being deployed
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,992	| IOT113 |	Utility Networks
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:39,392	| IOT113 |	It's still a really tough business maybe a little bit boring how can this kind of intelligence start helping
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:43,488	| IOT113 |	Utilities maybe add new Services is that something they're interested in
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:46,048	| IOT113 |	Yeah you don't think so our Utility Partners
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:52,704	| IOT113 |	It turns out that they really do want to help the consumer figure out how to save energy although you know what that makes them look crazy but
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,496	| IOT113 |	They really do they really treat
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,568	| IOT113 |	Customers more as consumers and not repairs
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:00,384	| IOT113 |	So Princeton utility customers
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,152	| IOT113 |	Instead of reading
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,688	| IOT113 |	Kneaders once a month
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:09,600	| IOT113 |	15 minute turns out if you read the meter frequently enough there are a few startups out there they can take
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,624	| IOT113 |	Look at that data
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,184	| IOT113 |	And tell you exactly what's running in your house
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,208	| IOT113 |	So why your bill so high
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:14,976	| IOT113 |	So you
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:18,816	| IOT113 |	Call up your local utility and say in a why is my bill is $1,000 this month
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:22,656	| IOT113 |	If they've done the right thing with a smart meter they can say what with your permission I'll tell you why
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,680	| IOT113 |	And they can go in and say well
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:26,752	| IOT113 |	It looks like you have a old
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:29,056	| IOT113 |	Refrigerator from the 1960s
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:33,152	| IOT113 |	Someplace in your house and it looks like it uses about $250 worth of electricity a month
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,200	| IOT113 |	Spelling Magic
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:37,248	| IOT113 |	Promise of service marketing
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:38,784	| IOT113 |	People look like in that big data
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:43,136	| IOT113 |	It's real you know there's there's actually something if you have enough of this kind of day that you can
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,672	| IOT113 |	You can do things for the
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,696	| IOT113 |	Server that the same like that
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:50,816	| IOT113 |	So let's talk about demand response because this is an area that I think there's
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:56,448	| IOT113 |	I live in Austin so Texas has its own utility grid so worried of a special special
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:56,960	| IOT113 |	Case
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,520	| IOT113 |	It gets really hot
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,288	| IOT113 |	And
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:04,128	| IOT113 |	There plenty of times in the Summer where you know my Nest thermostat on eco B thermostat is low
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,408	| IOT113 |	Hey guess what
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,944	| IOT113 |	Utility is like
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:08,480	| IOT113 |	We're going to turn you up a notch
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,272	| IOT113 |	And I'm thinking about places where
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,576	| IOT113 |	God how can we make that
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,088	| IOT113 |	I don't know
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:15,136	| IOT113 |	Better more efficient
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:17,952	| IOT113 |	Maybe less disruptive cuz I notice
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,512	| IOT113 |	Almost immediately when my AC goes off at 4
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,816	| IOT113 |	You know summer day when it's a hundred and ten degree
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,864	| IOT113 |	But maybe I wouldn't notice like my water he
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:26,656	| IOT113 |	Shut off my dryer
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,216	| IOT113 |	For your pool pump
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:36,128	| IOT113 |	Silver Spring I demand response has always been an important part of what we've done and there's there's two really interesting things
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:39,200	| IOT113 |	News about it as you mentioned right the ideas that you shave off
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:42,528	| IOT113 |	Why is it important while the first thing is because
EDL	00:37:42,528	00:37:43,808	| IOT113 |	It's tops potentially up
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,088	| IOT113 |	Rolling blackout right
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:48,160	| IOT113 |	The other thing which is kind of cool For Those About to work in this space is
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:50,464	| IOT113 |	One of our big customers is Oklahoma Gas & Electric
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:55,584	| IOT113 |	Are they little they have the same issue gets really hot everybody comes home before they turn the record
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,400	| IOT113 |	Turn the air conditioner on
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:00,448	| IOT113 |	Quantify
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:05,824	| IOT113 |	They've been able to quantify that they have avoided building two new power plants by implementing grandeur
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:08,128	| IOT113 |	Cedar Point
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:10,944	| IOT113 |	There's no reason actually why you couldn't hook up
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:15,040	| IOT113 |	The same technology to a pool pump or to a hot water heater and in fact
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:20,672	| IOT113 |	It's one of the things we're advocating we could easily put this technology on your hot water heater or your pool pump it really just
EDL	00:38:20,672	00:38:22,464	| IOT113 |	Takes a utility to say hey we want to go do
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:27,840	| IOT113 |	Okay I was going to say how did what do we need to do to make this real because I had it you know
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,608	| IOT113 |	I Dubai
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:33,472	| IOT113 |	Do I need to buy connected washing machines or
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:37,568	| IOT113 |	Take me through the largest energy consuming products in a home
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:39,104	| IOT113 |	Tell pool pump Maybe
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:45,504	| IOT113 |	Yep pool pump you up to some extent washer and dryer that person hot water heater
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:47,808	| IOT113 |	Here for the most part it depends what you have gas or electric
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:51,648	| IOT113 |	But yes that's released a lot of electricity
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,696	| IOT113 |	Yo it's interesting so
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:57,792	| IOT113 |	The reasons man response is usually done with the thermostat is because it
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,328	| IOT113 |	Easy to talk to the thermostat
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:00,608	| IOT113 |	The thermostat controls
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:01,632	| IOT113 |	Thing that uses electricity
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:07,264	| IOT113 |	As you say if you had something like a pool pump or another device like a washing machine or something
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:10,592	| IOT113 |	You would have to actually you know have some way to control that but honestly
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:16,992	| IOT113 |	Technologies come to the point where you can pretty easily build a little box it's not that expensive that you know plugs in between
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:20,064	| IOT113 |	Device of the electric grid and that we turn it on and off
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:23,648	| IOT113 |	It's not really a matter of Technology at this point it's really a matter of just
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,160	| IOT113 |	Wanting to do it
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,464	| IOT113 |	Is it worth doing I mean
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:30,048	| IOT113 |	Obviously turning off my lights
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:30,816	| IOT113 |	Sephora
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:31,840	| IOT113 |	Even if they're on
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,864	| IOT113 |	Probably
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,424	| IOT113 |	Machiavelli Deez Nuts
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,752	| IOT113 |	In the fancy
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:45,408	| IOT113 |	Exactly so it's something like that or is it
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:48,736	| IOT113 |	Will you know I tell you
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:55,136	| IOT113 |	Certainly if if you live in one of those affected areas you are remembering in California some years back when you're having rolling blackouts rolling brownouts off
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,416	| IOT113 |	Samurai
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:56,928	| IOT113 |	Technology
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,976	| IOT113 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:04,608	| IOT113 |	I think it all depends if you take a look at that return it's a lot cheaper to roll something like this out than it is to build a power plant
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,120	| IOT113 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:07,936	| IOT113 |	And let's let's talk about two other challenge
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:08,448	| IOT113 |	Just that I can think of
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:10,496	| IOT113 |	1 is
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,776	| IOT113 |	Microgeneration oral
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,080	| IOT113 |	You know my solar panels on my roof
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,360	| IOT113 |	But if I did
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:16,640	| IOT113 |	Excited
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:20,736	| IOT113 |	How should we see like solar is becoming so cheap now
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,248	| IOT113 |	Now it's awesome
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,808	| IOT113 |	Jeff when we get more of this sign
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,856	| IOT113 |	How should we think about
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:28,160	| IOT113 |	How we've architected our Energy System
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:33,792	| IOT113 |	Cuz now it's like push out to the home as opposed to like the homes pushing up and maybe this isn't a deal I don't know
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:39,168	| IOT113 |	It's interesting solar generation in general is this points most
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:46,592	| IOT113 |	Presents the same sort of issues to it to utility reverse that they were talking about with the mannerist
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:48,384	| IOT113 |	Because imagine is safe
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,920	| IOT113 |	Sear in Hawaii
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| IOT113 |	Crazy penetration
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,528	| IOT113 |	Every day at UNO
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,064	| IOT113 |	7:40
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:58,112	| IOT113 |	3 the Sun goes behind a volcano and
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:41:00,160	| IOT113 |	It's like a light switch shopping so you have
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:04,000	| IOT113 |	All of this energy is being put on the grid solar power plants are kind of idling
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:08,608	| IOT113 |	Literally it's like somebody flipped a nice switch boom it's gone demand suddenly spikes
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:12,704	| IOT113 |	And suddenly that utility has to figure out how to jam enough
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,264	| IOT113 |	Energy generation from traditional sources of the grid
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:17,056	| IOT113 |	To prevent blackouts
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:17,824	| IOT113 |	Spell
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:21,664	| IOT113 |	Take a look at the kind of Technology we provide you know you could imagine a case where
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,968	| IOT113 |	Utility says I know that
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:25,760	| IOT113 |	Time
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,552	| IOT113 |	Today because we know what it is
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,088	| IOT113 |	A sense of going to happen
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:30,624	| IOT113 |	We will gracefully
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:33,184	| IOT113 |	Turn off some of people solar so it stops
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:34,464	| IOT113 |	Putting stuff on the grid
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:37,536	| IOT113 |	Double ramp up our production at a reasonable pace
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,840	| IOT113 |	So there's if not like this race
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,656	| IOT113 |	To see if you're under the grid fast enough to go get blackout so
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:49,056	| IOT113 |	Really you need a smart grid to manage the sources said his back for the same reason you viewing is smart grid
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:55,199	| IOT113 |	To manage the number of EV Chargers there going to be put on the grid over the next 5-10 years because those
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:56,735	| IOT113 |	Considerably more electricity
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,271	| IOT113 |	Send
EDL	00:41:58,271	00:42:02,879	| IOT113 |	That was my next question for you so I don't
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:04,927	| IOT113 |	Like 2 years ago I had
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:07,999	| IOT113 |	Power plant manager for Austin Energy
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:12,863	| IOT113 |	On my show and we talked about the coming EV electric vehicle crisis
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:13,631	| IOT113 |	And so
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,167	| IOT113 |	How does
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:15,935	| IOT113 |	Having
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| IOT113 |	Connected
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:17,727	| IOT113 |	Utility
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,263	| IOT113 |	Help with that
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:20,543	| IOT113 |	Mitigate some of that
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:23,615	| IOT113 |	Yes it was so having a connected utilities
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:24,639	| IOT113 |	EV charging
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:27,455	| IOT113 |	Really there are a couple ways to look at it the first one is
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:30,527	| IOT113 |	Able to quantify having the Chargers be connected
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:32,063	| IOT113 |	You know when they're coming on and off
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,343	| IOT113 |	So that the utility can
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:36,159	| IOT113 |	Balance the voltage or wrap up the power delivery or what have you
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,463	| IOT113 |	Is required to really provide
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,487	| IOT113 |	Seymour service
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:40,767	| IOT113 |	The people going to expect
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:44,351	| IOT113 |	But frankly there are places in here in the United States a lot of them
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:47,679	| IOT113 |	Set the current design really just
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:50,495	| IOT113 |	Going to handle the fact that you went over your neighbors
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:53,311	| IOT113 |	How would he be charged with it everyday at 6 you get on at home
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:56,895	| IOT113 |	Unplugging your supercharger and suddenly you know the demand
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:57,663	| IOT113 |	The Roots
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:00,991	| IOT113 |	I would argue that there probably in order to
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:03,039	| IOT113 |	Balance disease the needs of
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:07,135	| IOT113 |	All TVs that are becoming online or the next few years you're going to need to have these Chargers
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:07,647	| IOT113 |	Be smarter
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:08,927	| IOT113 |	It's height
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,695	| IOT113 |	Utilities
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:13,791	| IOT113 |	So that they can make sure that everyone gets their fair share of electricity and it doesn't create
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:16,095	| IOT113 |	Sir problems nearly tries to charge their car
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,935	| IOT113 |	What else do we need cuz you need more than just a smart grid
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:23,007	| IOT113 |	Or connectivity on the grid in these sensors
EDL	00:43:23,007	00:43:26,847	| IOT113 |	Or smart Chargers you also need some machine learning algorithms to understand
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,871	| IOT113 |	Habits
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:30,431	| IOT113 |	You need probably some business rules put in place so
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:32,991	| IOT113 |	Consumer can override it let's go beyond just
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,015	| IOT113 |	Activity on the grill
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:40,671	| IOT113 |	Utility used to work with us now they're all at the Silver Spring Network and the smart meter is in the
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,439	| IOT113 |	And the ways
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:44,255	| IOT113 |	Did the censors of quantify what's happening
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:47,839	| IOT113 |	The fascinating thing to me is you know everybody that there are two big buzzwords
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:49,887	| IOT113 |	These days right internet of things and Big Data
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:51,935	| IOT113 |	So if your Internet of Things Big Data company
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,447	| IOT113 |	You're flying high
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:54,495	| IOT113 |	I think there's a huge up
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:43:55,263	| IOT113 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,031	| IOT113 |	Four companies
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:58,335	| IOT113 |	Need to come in and apply machine learning
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:01,407	| IOT113 |	To the data generated by the utilities to really provide
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:03,455	| IOT113 |	Unique services and provide
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:06,527	| IOT113 |	Even services for the utilities themselves that'll really help make
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:13,183	| IOT113 |	He's probably just talked about much easier to deal with that I think it's a kind of a very lucrative space I think right now you know that
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:19,583	| IOT113 |	There are a few companies in the space but I think it's it's something that they really has been overlooked and it could be a fantastic business
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,351	| IOT113 |	For someone who
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| IOT113 |	You'll has a machine learning
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,655	| IOT113 |	Algorithm
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:24,447	| IOT113 |	Swift's attic
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:26,751	| IOT113 |	Keys to apply to something good boy
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,287	| IOT113 |	Really have a pretty big impact
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:30,591	| IOT113 |	But utilities make pretty lame customers
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:34,175	| IOT113 |	Your startup because they've got these incredibly long sales cycle
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:37,247	| IOT113 |	Obviously very risk-averse
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:38,783	| IOT113 |	Because you know you don't want to mess with somebody's life
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:45,183	| IOT113 |	What should a startup have how should they think about trying
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,719	| IOT113 |	How to get into the space even if
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,231	| IOT113 |	If they are
EDL	00:44:48,255	00:44:51,327	| IOT113 |	Well I tell you don't like her the horror stories of the utilities
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:57,471	| IOT113 |	And you know how slowly move it so on and so forth I have to tell you I think many of the kill he's certainly ones we work with have gotten the relay
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:58,495	| IOT113 |	And
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:44:59,775	| IOT113 |	We have
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:02,335	| IOT113 |	We're lucky enough to win ConEd
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:05,407	| IOT113 |	Building New York utility for for York City
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:06,687	| IOT113 |	This past year
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:08,223	| IOT113 |	And I tell you today are really
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:09,503	| IOT113 |	Pulling up
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:10,527	| IOT113 |	For pushing us
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:16,159	| IOT113 |	To come up with these carsolutions I just talked about it I mean they understand that they look at all the things we just
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:16,927	| IOT113 |	Disgust
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:21,535	| IOT113 |	And understand what their customers expect and understand the challenges going forward and
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:23,583	| IOT113 |	The fact that you know the generation
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:26,143	| IOT113 |	Is goody limited so they have to do more with
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:26,655	| IOT113 |	With what they have
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:28,191	| IOT113 |	Other believers
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:28,959	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:31,263	| IOT113 |	I would actually say that some of the more
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:34,847	| IOT113 |	For looking utilities are really right for this technology and immuno
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:40,223	| IOT113 |	We are actively looking to work with partners
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:43,039	| IOT113 |	Help create solutions that we can jointly go to market with
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:47,135	| IOT113 |	Let's shift the conversation just a little bit and talk about
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:48,159	| IOT113 |	What it takes
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:49,183	| IOT113 |	To deliver
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:51,231	| IOT113 |	More than 25 million connections
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:55,327	| IOT113 |	In an industry that is so risk-averse and so important to like
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:57,887	| IOT113 |	Our economic well-being and even our physical health
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:00,447	| IOT113 |	Electricity is the lifeblood of Industry
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:06,591	| IOT113 |	How do you think about issues like security resiliency
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:10,431	| IOT113 |	Walk me through some of the architecture and Technology decisions you guys have made
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:15,295	| IOT113 |	There's a couple things about the technology Silver Spring provides if that's kind of unique
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,831	| IOT113 |	We like to talk about
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:20,671	| IOT113 |	If you don't even called Smart Energy these days with sparkly Because The Internet of important things
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:24,511	| IOT113 |	As opposed to the internet if you know connected talkin
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,815	| IOT113 |	Animatronic dogs remember people
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:27,839	| IOT113 |	For selling these days
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,375	| IOT113 |	When it comes to
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,399	| IOT113 |	Wake up to something like
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,167	| IOT113 |	Smart grid
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:31,679	| IOT113 |	Security
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,983	| IOT113 |	Is Job 1 2 3 4 and 5
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:36,543	| IOT113 |	Yeah you can't just put stuff out there and you know
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:39,103	| IOT113 |	Was it help a couple months back were a bunch of
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:41,919	| IOT113 |	Security cameras with half the denial-of-service attacks I mean
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:44,479	| IOT113 |	You can imagine if that was a smart created with just being a
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,247	| IOT113 |	It would be
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:47,039	| IOT113 |	You just said so
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:47,551	| IOT113 |	For us
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:51,391	| IOT113 |	Do we have built multiple layers of security and it's not just
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,439	| IOT113 |	One thing that you start with
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:58,559	| IOT113 |	Secure hardware and secure software then you layer on top of that encryption that you layer on top of that
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:46:59,839	| IOT113 |	Medication
EDL	00:47:00,351	00:47:01,375	| IOT113 |	From the beginning
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:04,959	| IOT113 |	Our entire set of Technologies has been based on
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,727	| IOT113 |	Standards-based
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:08,543	| IOT113 |	Things that are the same technologies that the internet
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:09,823	| IOT113 |	Was created on
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,103	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:12,639	| IOT113 |	You know I love the joke that the
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:16,735	| IOT113 |	Graveyard of networking Technologies littered with the dead bodies of people
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:18,271	| IOT113 |	Thought they were smarter than the internet
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:22,111	| IOT113 |	We've taken with all the founders of the internet for together and we have essentially
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:25,183	| IOT113 |	Put them together into a very reliable very
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:25,951	| IOT113 |	Cure
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:27,487	| IOT113 |	Wyteria
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:29,791	| IOT113 |	So not only do we have this
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,327	| IOT113 |	Security layer we also
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:32,607	| IOT113 |	How to apology
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,911	| IOT113 |	That is different than most people be called a mesh Network
EDL	00:47:37,727	00:47:38,239	| IOT113 |	Essentially
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:42,335	| IOT113 |	So unlike your your cell tower yourself at work
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,359	| IOT113 |	Result hour goes down
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:44,383	| IOT113 |	You lose connectivity
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:47,711	| IOT113 |	Our devices all talk to each other and they talk to multiple
EDL	00:47:47,711	00:47:48,735	| IOT113 |	List all the facts
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,759	| IOT113 |	Points
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:53,087	| IOT113 |	So is anyone touring number of them goes down
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:55,135	| IOT113 |	Home network
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:57,183	| IOT113 |	Switches over and find a different way to communicate
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:00,767	| IOT113 |	It's a very lowest level we have this
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:01,791	| IOT113 |	Picture highly
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:02,815	| IOT113 |	Reliable
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:04,095	| IOT113 |	Way of communicating
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,887	| IOT113 |	Against all completely standard space
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:13,055	| IOT113 |	That sounds really good and it even sounds like it might be applicable beyond the smart grid and I think you guys are working
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:13,567	| IOT113 |	Ninesome
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,359	| IOT113 |	Optical smart cities
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:21,759	| IOT113 |	I hate PetSmart in front of everything but. Where else can you take what you guys
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:22,527	| IOT113 |	Size of done in
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,039	| IOT113 |	Utilities
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,855	| IOT113 |	Do you think about this so we've designed this
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:27,647	| IOT113 |	Highly secure
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:32,767	| IOT113 |	Highly reliable why your area always on networking technology that connects the most critical things on earth
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:37,887	| IOT113 |	Why not connect everything else we've made a big push into smart lighting we have
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:41,215	| IOT113 |	If you go to Paris all the streetlights in Paris are controlled by our hardware and soft
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:43,263	| IOT113 |	Many of the boroughs in London
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:45,311	| IOT113 |	I'm cooking in Glasgow Bristol
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:47,615	| IOT113 |	Closer to home like Florida
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:48,639	| IOT113 |	All right I like your good
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:50,431	| IOT113 |	Let's talk about more goodness
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:52,223	| IOT113 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:55,039	| IOT113 |	Actually the reason that I kind of got excited about talking to you
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:58,367	| IOT113 |	You guys have this really cool project town in Florida do you want to tell me a little
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:04,511	| IOT113 |	And I think you're referring to the story Which Wich know they love to tell which is kind of cool so they
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:08,351	| IOT113 |	The rolled out not only our smart Grid in our distribution Automation and
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:09,375	| IOT113 |	Everything else that we
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:10,143	| IOT113 |	We make
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:11,935	| IOT113 |	They rolled out our smart Street lighting
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:14,239	| IOT113 |	Every kind of tissue
EDL	00:49:14,239	00:49:17,823	| IOT113 |	We're apparently turtles hatch at some point of the year and
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:18,847	| IOT113 |	Before
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:22,175	| IOT113 |	We humans came around with lights the turtles hatch
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:23,967	| IOT113 |	See the moon and
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:24,735	| IOT113 |	And walk
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:26,271	| IOT113 |	Into the water and all would be good
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:29,087	| IOT113 |	And apparently what's been happening in parts
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:30,111	| IOT113 |	The Florida are
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:31,135	| IOT113 |	Turtles with hats
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:33,951	| IOT113 |	And see the street lights on the other side of a highway and walk across a
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,231	| IOT113 |	The end would be quite as good for them
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:36,511	| IOT113 |	So
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,791	| IOT113 |	You know you wouldn't put
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:40,351	| IOT113 |	A smart streetlight the Flaming out necessarily to
EDL	00:49:40,863	00:49:42,655	| IOT113 |	Safety rules alone chemical thing to do
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:44,191	| IOT113 |	Will be really expensive things
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:50,847	| IOT113 |	But it turns out you know one of the nice things about technology Is You U2 play a technology and then smart people kind of figure out
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,383	| IOT113 |	Really cool uses
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:53,407	| IOT113 |	And somebody said you know
EDL	00:49:53,919	00:49:57,247	| IOT113 |	Turtle hatching season we could turn those lights off between
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:59,807	| IOT113 |	Say 980m at 4 a.m.
EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:02,879	| IOT113 |	My gosh guess what happens but Turtles don't get squashed
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:08,255	| IOT113 |	So again it's just one of those unintended consequences of Technology you know you you find a great use for it
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:09,791	| IOT113 |	And smart people will find things to make and eat
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:13,119	| IOT113 |	That's why I'm really optimistic about the internet
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:14,911	| IOT113 |	Work
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:16,959	| IOT113 |	All of what we're doing here is
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:20,543	| IOT113 |	Once you add sensors and connectivity so sensors actuators
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:22,079	| IOT113 |	To the world
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:25,407	| IOT113 |	We start looking at that data we can actually start making some
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:26,431	| IOT113 |	Really cool things happen.
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:30,271	| IOT113 |	Either one of those things so I
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:34,367	| IOT113 |	Yo it's it's kind of funny at the other thing FGL did I just want to make sure this way quickly you know
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,391	| IOT113 |	Hurricane Matthew hit
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:38,207	| IOT113 |	Karbolyn this Devastation like that
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:41,535	| IOT113 |	The factory of the smart grid let them get the electricity back on
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:42,047	| IOT113 |	Record
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:43,839	| IOT113 |	You look at it when you
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:46,399	| IOT113 |	You just talked about you know I don't know what's going to happen when you
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:47,935	| IOT113 |	Suddenly have enough sensors
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:51,263	| IOT113 |	There are two environmental sensors tell you something
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:53,055	| IOT113 |	When you have hundreds or maybe
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:54,079	| IOT113 |	Thousands because it
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:54,847	| IOT113 |	It's easy enough to do that
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:56,895	| IOT113 |	I think we're going to start seeing
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:59,711	| IOT113 |	Do donuts have to be just can't picture today cuz
EDL	00:50:59,711	00:51:00,735	| IOT113 |	Your people just
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:02,015	| IOT113 |	Can't imagine
EDL	00:51:02,015	00:51:04,831	| IOT113 |	Yet what they can do when that kind of date is available
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:11,231	| IOT113 |	So optimistic that the enabling technology you know iot is getting table all these things that we just can't imagine kind of like
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:13,023	| IOT113 |	It would smartphones were first day out
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:16,607	| IOT113 |	I don't think people ever imagined because ecosystem the speedometer on that
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:18,399	| IOT113 |	I think you're going to see even
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:20,959	| IOT113 |	Yoga is great that I'd argue that maybe it isn't
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:24,287	| IOT113 |	Critical for life I think you'll iot could actually
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,847	| IOT113 |	Improve my little baby live backup of Steel
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:28,895	| IOT113 |	Some of the challenges that are coming with
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,711	| IOT113 |	All right Mike
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:32,735	| IOT113 |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:33,247	| IOT113 |	For coming on the show
