EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,312	| IOT117a |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,592	| IOT117a |	Here we go
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,384	| IOT117a |	Chips Ahoy
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| IOT117a |	Laxative news that's okay
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,200	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:56,992	| IOT117a |	It was Intel
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,040	| IOT117a |	They're going to discontinue their
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:01:59,552	| IOT117a |	Jewel
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:02,112	| IOT117a |	Edison and Galileo product
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,416	| IOT117a |	And for those big eyes were like what
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,208	| IOT117a |	Edison was there additional May
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,256	| IOT117a |	Bored Galileo was
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:08,768	| IOT117a |	Another one
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,072	| IOT117a |	And Jewel with the really
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:11,584	| IOT117a |	Anyone that you
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:16,192	| IOT117a |	No word on what's going to happen to that chip I did ask
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,008	| IOT117a |	Until did confirm that all of these products
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| IOT117a |	Are being disc
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,592	| IOT117a |	Set me a very nun
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:25,408	| IOT117a |	Exciting States
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| IOT117a |	Things
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:29,760	| IOT117a |	Theme statement as it stands
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,272	| IOT117a |	AR
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| IOT117a |	Iot remains an important
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,136	| IOT117a |	And we are committed to
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,416	| IOT117a |	To the iot market segment
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,720	| IOT117a |	Access analyze and share data
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,792	| IOT117a |	These include retail industrial automotive and video
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,560	| IOT117a |	All right
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:47,680	| IOT117a |	I would expect them to say that however however
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,240	| IOT117a |	That we should clarify all these
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,520	| IOT117a |	End-of-life by
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,568	| IOT117a |	The end of this calendar year from the mistaken
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| IOT117a |	Yes
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,128	| IOT117a |	They are ended
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,640	| IOT117a |	This calendar year
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,712	| IOT117a |	Yunnan discounts
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,784	| IOT117a |	You might see some discounts that put it in the right so the challenge here
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,088	| IOT117a |	In my
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| IOT117a |	My humble
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,136	| IOT117a |	Is that
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:12,512	| IOT117a |	Intel put a lot of money into these boards that you can actually fun to that TV show the Great
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,328	| IOT117a |	Movie show
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| IOT117a |	And
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,144	| IOT117a |	These boards were
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,656	| IOT117a |	Expensive
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:22,496	| IOT117a |	By comparison by comparison to things like the raspberry
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,008	| IOT117a |	Reply
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:28,128	| IOT117a |	Yep still because Galileo when it first came out with like $70
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,432	| IOT117a |	And then the version 2
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,200	| IOT117a |	Was $80
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,272	| IOT117a |	Yeah I'm in the other the competing boards
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,344	| IOT117a |	10 to go down in price while adding features and such
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,696	| IOT117a |	That's one issue but I suspect you're going to raise that but I think it's the second issue in a minute
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,464	| IOT117a |	Man they're hot
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,792	| IOT117a |	Bingo we have a winner
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,840	| IOT117a |	I was at a Maker Faire and you know
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,120	| IOT117a |	Of course I walked over to that
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,888	| IOT117a |	Intel Edison
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,168	| IOT117a |	Because it was Giant
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,680	| IOT117a |	So much marketing
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| IOT117a |	And
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| IOT117a |	You know I was I was
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,776	| IOT117a |	Feeling these
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,312	| IOT117a |	Boards that we're running these projects
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,592	| IOT117a |	Holy mackerel
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:03:59,872	| IOT117a |	Very warm
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:06,784	| IOT117a |	In fairness I will give until credit that they have really scale down the power performance why
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:09,856	| IOT117a |	What are the past couple years with their chips
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:13,184	| IOT117a |	They do have many fanless design winds right now
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,000	| IOT117a |	With core M3 and such so
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:21,375	| IOT117a |	That's a given credit there but they've been behind the 8-ball so catching it
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,167	| IOT117a |	It's a constant catching up battle
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:29,055	| IOT117a |	And they got to figure out when to stop trying to catch up you know and that's what I guess they're doing on these boards
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,847	| IOT117a |	It's just not worth it to them right
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,871	| IOT117a |	Exactly
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,151	| IOT117a |	They also have this
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:36,479	| IOT117a |	Problem last year when they discontinued their wearables
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,271	| IOT117a |	The bassist
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| IOT117a |	Purchase
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| IOT117a |	It was basis was the name of the
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:49,791	| IOT117a |	I think was peaked Peak was the company they bought in 2014 which was making the basis watch it
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| IOT117a |	One of the best
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| IOT117a |	Health tracking watches
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,887	| IOT117a |	I would say at the time
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:02,591	| IOT117a |	They discontinue that they got out of wearables in one thing that you're going to notice about the categories they're still in retail and
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,615	| IOT117a |	Industrial Automotive in video
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:04,895	| IOT117a |	Those are
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,175	| IOT117a |	All categories
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,455	| IOT117a |	Exception of automotive
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,759	| IOT117a |	That are going to require
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,271	| IOT117a |	A gateway
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,063	| IOT117a |	Device switch
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,087	| IOT117a |	Can pack a lot of computing
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,599	| IOT117a |	Empower into
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,159	| IOT117a |	It's going to be plugged in
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,439	| IOT117a |	You have to worry about
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,463	| IOT117a |	I'm too hot and
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,559	| IOT117a |	They're going to analyze and share data which
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,583	| IOT117a |	Again is great
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| IOT117a |	For the general
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:25,887	| IOT117a |	Computing that in
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:26,911	| IOT117a |	What does
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,447	| IOT117a |	So that's
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,983	| IOT117a |	Basically these are going to be computers
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,031	| IOT117a |	They're going to keep
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,799	| IOT117a |	Selling
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,311	| IOT117a |	Switch
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,103	| IOT117a |	But
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,663	| IOT117a |	In this world that were entering into
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| IOT117a |	That's going to become a smaller in
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,247	| IOT117a |	And smaller
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:41,759	| IOT117a |	Segment
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:48,415	| IOT117a |	And they're also catching competition on all sides now on the server side on the automotive side
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:54,047	| IOT117a |	Where are those they're still actually in wearables is that they're there in the tag are connected watch
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,351	| IOT117a |	But not many other watches right now
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:06:02,751	| IOT117a |	It's just the competition know when I look at an Invidia or something like somebody like that but it's just intensified for men
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,287	| IOT117a |	Honestly
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| IOT117a |	Coming out with a new service
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,919	| IOT117a |	You know I covered AMG for over a decade
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,199	| IOT117a |	Okay so I'm not going to like
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,295	| IOT117a |	I'm not going to count until out because AMD always know
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,063	| IOT117a |	Conciliating
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,855	| IOT117a |	Awesome designs
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:18,879	| IOT117a |	What you know
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:23,487	| IOT117a |	Snatching Victory from the
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,095	| IOT117a |	Also though in in this will give you some perspective alarm
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,631	| IOT117a |	Actually arm witch
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,679	| IOT117a |	Is a company that lets you license
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,703	| IOT117a |	Their design
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| IOT117a |	4 tiny tiny low-power chip
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| IOT117a |	Chips therein
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,543	| IOT117a |	Your phones
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,311	| IOT117a |	Wearables therefore
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| IOT117a |	They even have some
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,383	| IOT117a |	Powerful ones
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:40,895	| IOT117a |	They're trying to put the
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| IOT117a |	And they don't run is hot
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,807	| IOT117a |	Arm has expanded their design start
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,879	| IOT117a |	To include the arm cortex M3 processor
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,927	| IOT117a |	In addition to the cortex
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,439	| IOT117a |	In 04
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,999	| IOT117a |	If you guys are like what what is a really tiny
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,791	| IOT117a |	Tiny very very
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:06:59,839	| IOT117a |	Tips for where
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,519	| IOT117a |	But what this does is you don't have to pay a licensing
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,335	| IOT117a |	Fee to start tinkering and playing around with the design
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,407	| IOT117a |	This is really important for some of these markets where
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,455	| IOT117a |	Form factor
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:17,247	| IOT117a |	Matter so if you're designing a wearable
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,319	| IOT117a |	Being able to design your own SOC
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:20,831	| IOT117a |	Lets you
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:21,855	| IOT117a |	Hey
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,159	| IOT117a |	Reduce the surface area of
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| IOT117a |	Have your bored but it also let
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| IOT117a |	Lets you tweak
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| IOT117a |	Like designs to
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,511	| IOT117a |	Consume as little
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,023	| IOT117a |	Power is pasta
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,303	| IOT117a |	You can do this
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:37,727	| IOT117a |	Right until what you can do all that design work without paying any money but then if if you do bring a product
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:41,055	| IOT117a |	To market after many generations for free so to speak
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,615	| IOT117a |	Then you would pay your licensing fees per product
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,919	| IOT117a |	Yeah it's kind of like getting hooked on drugs
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:52,831	| IOT117a |	I'll take your word for it
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,367	| IOT117a |	You'll pay for ever
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,391	| IOT117a |	Alright so
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,183	| IOT117a |	Couple things to note here that I thought were
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,719	| IOT117a |	When was
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:07:59,999	| IOT117a |	These process
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,815	| IOT117a |	Have shipped more than 20 billion units
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,887	| IOT117a |	He's a pain in the last couple years
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,399	| IOT117a |	With the internet
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:07,935	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,983	| IOT117a |	Ye into
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| IOT117a |	Kevin you want to say
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| IOT117a |	Talk about what some of these
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:21,247	| IOT117a |	The m0 is more it's not powering a computer or a phone or anything like that this is really for my crooked
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| IOT117a |	Controllers
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,295	| IOT117a |	Atm3
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:29,183	| IOT117a |	Would be in something that I think everybody knows and that is the Apple A9 chip
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:34,559	| IOT117a |	Apple tweeted and they call it their M9 motion coprocessor so
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:40,703	| IOT117a |	I suspected him more than just like the black iPhones on such because you know iPads also use a chips and
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:41,983	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| IOT117a |	I don't know how many
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:49,151	| IOT117a |	Devices have an A9 but I mean it's couple probably a couple hundred million right off the bat
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:55,551	| IOT117a |	I'm also Samsung's Exodus their 7420 processor which isn't some of their phones also uses
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:59,391	| IOT117a |	The M3 so those are just two simple examples of the scope and reach of this
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,439	| IOT117a |	Yes and
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:05,791	| IOT117a |	It's not just for wearables I should tell you this because arm gives his lovely example
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,839	| IOT117a |	Industrial control application
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,399	| IOT117a |	So a company called S3 group
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,423	| IOT117a |	Developed an army base
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,983	| IOT117a |	Custom SO3 for that use case and
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,775	| IOT117a |	Cuz they were allowed to
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| IOT117a |	Mess around with
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:17,823	| IOT117a |	Hair Design
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| IOT117a |	They reduced
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,615	| IOT117a |	The power requirements
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,383	| IOT117a |	By 70%
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| IOT117a |	Custom parts
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,687	| IOT117a |	80%
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| IOT117a |	And the board size
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,735	| IOT117a |	Spice 75
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:28,063	| IOT117a |	Which in that was for a valve controller for the oil and gas in
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:29,855	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| IOT117a |	That's actually really
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,951	| IOT117a |	And it also gives
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,255	| IOT117a |	When you do a custom board that means
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,303	| IOT117a |	Harder for other companies to
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,119	| IOT117a |	Function
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,887	| IOT117a |	Competitive
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,399	| IOT117a |	Differentiator
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,423	| IOT117a |	So right
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:47,519	| IOT117a |	I know most of you guys especially if you're just here for the like doorbell review
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:50,079	| IOT117a |	Like I don't care but this is
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,175	| IOT117a |	I just noticed the Arduino due board
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,455	| IOT117a |	Due
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,247	| IOT117a |	I also has the cortex M3
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:00,319	| IOT117a |	At the it runs it runs in at MailChimp
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,879	| IOT117a |	For the soc but they integrated in cortex M3
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| IOT117a |	Get your maker on
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,719	| IOT117a |	And then
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,255	| IOT117a |	If you like what you've done
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| IOT117a |	You can start
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:09,535	| IOT117a |	Messing around
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,375	| IOT117a |	All right now that's a doorbell
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:15,935	| IOT117a |	Ring
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,727	| IOT117a |	There's actually two pieces of doorbell news
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| IOT117a |	Ring has
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:19,775	| IOT117a |	A
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,079	| IOT117a |	New doorbell video doorbell 2
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,663	| IOT117a |	It's basically a little bit bigger than the lower end
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,199	| IOT117a |	Welders
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| IOT117a |	It's 3 now
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:32,319	| IOT117a |	So the initial ring doorbell is still there it is notable because it is big
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,135	| IOT117a |	It is both wired and Battery powers
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,671	| IOT117a |	Either way
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,047	| IOT117a |	720p camera on that one that's one key difference
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,351	| IOT117a |	And then the
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,911	| IOT117a |	Ring Pro is a skinnier doorbell
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| IOT117a |	Patio doors
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:57,407	| IOT117a |	Right it's it's $250 as opposed to 179 and that get you full HD and it's hardwired
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| IOT117a |	Yes
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:04,063	| IOT117a |	So now we have this they're actually going to sell that for $200 Which is less than the
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,647	| IOT117a |	The big changes you can swap out
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,159	| IOT117a |	Your battery pack
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,719	| IOT117a |	Right so it's hardwired
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,791	| IOT117a |	Removable battery or rechargeable battery or recharge
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| IOT117a |	And it has 1080
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,655	| IOT117a |	Corral if you were going to buy the older version
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,447	| IOT117a |	You might as well just
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,471	| IOT117a |	By this is
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,287	| IOT117a |	20 bucks more
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,335	| IOT117a |	Also
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,359	| IOT117a |	The ring
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,383	| IOT117a |	Pro which is the
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| IOT117a |	$250 one
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:30,943	| IOT117a |	Is
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,735	| IOT117a |	Actually that
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,271	| IOT117a |	It's going to be home
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,367	| IOT117a |	So they either built ecert chip in there
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:39,391	| IOT117a |	Or
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,183	| IOT117a |	This is part of apples like
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:44,255	| IOT117a |	Cryptic remarks about making it easier to add
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,023	| IOT117a |	Products to hump
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,815	| IOT117a |	So I'm not sure what is going on
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| IOT117a |	What happened this won't happen
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| IOT117a |	Winter Shield
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,751	| IOT117a |	Harbor Gateway fire
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:58,591	| IOT117a |	That is a possibility that's one way to do it
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,615	| IOT117a |	Interesting
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:06,015	| IOT117a |	I'm leery my eyebrows up I know it already cannot see it but my eyebrows raised right now because
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:09,855	| IOT117a |	You come out with a new product and it's going to be homekit compatible
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,391	| IOT117a |	Well this is not the new product
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,439	| IOT117a |	Crow the existing
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:17,023	| IOT117a |	Well even so
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| IOT117a |	That makes the case even more
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| IOT117a |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:25,727	| IOT117a |	Unless there's a retrofit here just Papas little security shipping your doorbell now and you're okay compatible I don't think that's happening
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,263	| IOT117a |	No I don't think Apple wants a
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,591	| IOT117a |	William Security Agency
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:31,871	| IOT117a |	So if you have one
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,151	| IOT117a |	You know
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,431	| IOT117a |	Good news for next year
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,967	| IOT117a |	Also in doorbell news
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,503	| IOT117a |	This I'm just going to talk about briefly
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:38,783	| IOT117a |	Because
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,575	| IOT117a |	I have been testing for bells
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,599	| IOT117a |	For the longest time
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:45,439	| IOT117a |	And my doorbell transformer is not up to speed
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,463	| IOT117a |	So most homes come with a
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,487	| IOT117a |	18 volt
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:48,767	| IOT117a |	Doorbell
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,815	| IOT117a |	Between 16 and 24
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,399	| IOT117a |	My challenge was I was running to video doorbell
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,959	| IOT117a |	And experiencing some issues
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,519	| IOT117a |	So I upgraded my doorbell transformer
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| IOT117a |	24-volt
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,311	| IOT117a |	And now
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,615	| IOT117a |	Working like a charm
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:08,735	| IOT117a |	So I'm going to tell you that if you are interested in these video doorbells
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:09,759	| IOT117a |	Check
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| IOT117a |	Former
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,063	| IOT117a |	Especially if your admin
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,111	| IOT117a |	Warehouse a lot of them say 16.
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,159	| IOT117a |	And that's
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| IOT117a |	Willie Morris
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,695	| IOT117a |	Probably better in the
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| IOT117a |	Cuz I was I was having some
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,023	| IOT117a |	Real
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,071	| IOT117a |	Charging
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:32,031	| IOT117a |	And did you do the Transformer swap yourself electrician to come out
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,543	| IOT117a |	Located wiring
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,615	| IOT117a |	It was basically like while you're here
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:39,199	| IOT117a |	So it cost I think $35 plus the
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| IOT117a |	Cost of the trance
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,527	| IOT117a |	So it was not expensive
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,807	| IOT117a |	It is something you
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT117a |	You could do yourself
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,903	| IOT117a |	YouTube there plenty of instructions online I just
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,671	| IOT117a |	The guy was there and
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| IOT117a |	So that was
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:59,167	| IOT117a |	Just DIY project especially if you're experiencing troubles with your doorbell charging
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,447	| IOT117a |	And pulling up
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,495	| IOT117a |	Video really quickly that could
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:03,519	| IOT117a |	People to Wi-Fi but it might be
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,543	| IOT117a |	Our issue
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,079	| IOT117a |	So there you go
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,615	| IOT117a |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,383	| IOT117a |	Smartlab
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,199	| IOT117a |	Because we put this in the newsletter last week
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,247	| IOT117a |	But you didn't read that you don't know that
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:23,231	| IOT117a |	Yes a lot of people don't know the name smartlabs how much they do know insteon which has made
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,535	| IOT117a |	Iot Smart Home Products for years
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,071	| IOT117a |	I'm smart
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:33,215	| IOT117a |	Parent company of behind insteon and they also have a retail site called Smart Home
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:39,871	| IOT117a |	Which is where you can buy a lot of these insteon products so I use the many times before spending a great resource in a great site for
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:45,503	| IOT117a |	But you're right they have a new CEO Rob and I may get his name wrong willingness
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:50,623	| IOT117a |	He was the CEO of mideo systems that was later
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,903	| IOT117a |	Taking over by
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,695	| IOT117a |	Nokia's here group
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| IOT117a |	But he left
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:58,047	| IOT117a |	Mario and his purchase smartlabs
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:01,119	| IOT117a |	Gets insteon and smart home has as part of that deal
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:03,935	| IOT117a |	Looks like he work with a private investment firm
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:08,799	| IOT117a |	Richmond Capital which invested 7.3 million dollars in smartlabs
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:13,919	| IOT117a |	Which is based in Irvine always has been but now willingness is looking to
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,687	| IOT117a |	Make
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,991	| IOT117a |	A second presents in Seattle
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:21,855	| IOT117a |	Previously were from Microsoft so I'm not surprised he's going to be in the Seattle market so
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,695	| IOT117a |	New owner and CEO for all of the
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,719	| IOT117a |	Insteon products
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,767	| IOT117a |	So maybe we'll see some new
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,791	| IOT117a |	Products are made
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:32,351	| IOT117a |	Radiosai I don't know new things from insteon
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:39,263	| IOT117a |	I don't know I mean I guess he saw I don't know if he has plans to you no bills out the product line or
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:42,335	| IOT117a |	Tikahtnu directions and are not so we'll have to see
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:48,735	| IOT117a |	I mean there's a lot of people still use insteon it was at this one of the first batch of products are used when setting up my smart home
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,271	| IOT117a |	Back in 2010
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,063	| IOT117a |	Before I'm getting
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,879	| IOT117a |	All the other fun stuff we have today so
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:16:01,279	| IOT117a |	What I liked about insteon was it was a lot of do-it-yourself and you could you could have control when you didn't have to have a server in the cloud
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,815	| IOT117a |	Carolina service and such so
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,375	| IOT117a |	Baby troll control over the system which was nice
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| IOT117a |	Yay

EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:37,887	| IOT117a |	Traffic
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| IOT117a |	Trying to light up
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:43,007	| IOT117a |	This is an option it is a ambient white light
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:43,775	| IOT117a |	Light
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,079	| IOT117a |	And it is thirty bucks above which
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:48,639	| IOT117a |	I've got a chandelier that has nine bulbs in it
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,407	| IOT117a |	And I will not be
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| IOT117a |	Instead I can
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,711	| IOT117a |	Nextbit to AC
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,735	| IOT117a |	$5
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:53,759	| IOT117a |	$60
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,551	| IOT117a |	Lutron switch
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,063	| IOT117a |	And that
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,599	| IOT117a |	Can just fine
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:58,879	| IOT117a |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| IOT117a |	But
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,439	| IOT117a |	You know if you got
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,719	| IOT117a |	You know maybe some sconces
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| IOT117a |	Something exciting
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:08,351	| IOT117a |	And these lights will be available we don't know
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:13,983	| IOT117a |	They're available for pre-order now and I think I called them C12 and if I did there actually E12 lights
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,543	| IOT117a |	My bad if that indeed
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,103	| IOT117a |	All right moving right along
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,127	| IOT117a |	Other
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,175	| IOT117a |	Shall we talk about
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:29,343	| IOT117a |	Well yeah it's exciting not in a good way for Tesla they actually it hired away
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,879	| IOT117a |	Play somebody from Apple
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,439	| IOT117a |	Chris lattner about 6 months ago
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:38,559	| IOT117a |	And if you don't know the name Chris lattner that's understandable he's in a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff such as
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:42,399	| IOT117a |	Contributing to the xcode developer platform that
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:44,959	| IOT117a |	Used to develop Apple apps
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:51,103	| IOT117a |	But I also development companies Swift programming language so I mean this is yeah this is
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,383	| IOT117a |	The smart dude
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,663	| IOT117a |	And he went to Tesla
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,687	| IOT117a |	And January
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:59,295	| IOT117a |	And they made him the VP of autopilot software for the car company
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:03,647	| IOT117a |	And he just announced this week Twitter yesterday in fact
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:08,767	| IOT117a |	He's leaving his tweet says turns out Tesla isn't a good fit for me after all
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:13,119	| IOT117a |	I'm interested to hear about interesting rules for a seasoned engineering leader so
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:19,775	| IOT117a |	I don't know what that means for Tesla I mean obviously got other smart people they're working on their autopilot project
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:23,871	| IOT117a |	We was going to work on it before Chris lattner no continue working on it but
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:27,711	| IOT117a |	Now I don't know what the skinny is on that one why he left
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:30,271	| IOT117a |	Yeah that's pretty public waves
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,367	| IOT117a |	Lot of weirdness
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,903	| IOT117a |	I still have mine
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,671	| IOT117a |	Tessa I'm not worried
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,719	| IOT117a |	MattyB
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:43,071	| IOT117a |	The money and the frothiness around
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,607	| IOT117a |	AI in autopilot
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,887	| IOT117a |	Self-driving cars
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,679	| IOT117a |	Executives
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,191	| IOT117a |	To run it is
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,775	| IOT117a |	Small number of people have
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,543	| IOT117a |	Skills needed
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,407	| IOT117a |	So all right
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,199	| IOT117a |	Bayou Vista news
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:05,343	| IOT117a |	We can't do a show without talking about on Friday
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,391	| IOT117a |	What does tell you about that you know that already
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,207	| IOT117a |	I wrote a little thing about what I think it might mean for
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,743	| IOT117a |	Pursued I do realize that this is
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,279	| IOT117a |	All about
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,815	| IOT117a |	You know the last mile Disturbed
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,327	| IOT117a |	Navigation
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| IOT117a |	Amazon
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:18,655	| IOT117a |	But there really some cool options
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,935	| IOT117a |	How about one of those
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,703	| IOT117a |	Because
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:22,495	| IOT117a |	The Amazon Dash wand is back
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| IOT117a |	Its back
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:27,871	| IOT117a |	This is a tiny little $20 stick that can scan things
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,151	| IOT117a |	Your groceries
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,431	| IOT117a |	Talk to it and tell it what to
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:30,943	| IOT117a |	Put on your list
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,247	| IOT117a |	And if you're in an Amazon Fresh area
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:34,783	| IOT117a |	What are them for you
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,319	| IOT117a |	If you ask it to
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| IOT117a |	It also has
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,879	| IOT117a |	Natomas
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:45,791	| IOT117a |	She does speak bacteria so you can ask you could ask questions and such and I can play music on this thing
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:49,119	| IOT117a |	Honda this thing and whatever comes with like it does not play music
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,655	| IOT117a |	Looking at it it's like this tiny little
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:51,935	| IOT117a |	Metal wand
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,543	| IOT117a |	Not everything needs
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:01,407	| IOT117a |	No no did you order one
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:03,199	| IOT117a |	By the time I was in Costa Rica last week
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,735	| IOT117a |	Wake you guys and I was not ordering
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,575	| IOT117a |	Products sold by the time I ordered it it was on backorder so who knows when I'll get mine
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:12,927	| IOT117a |	I did see that the echo show is going to come
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,439	| IOT117a |	Next week
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:22,911	| IOT117a |	So you pay $20 cuz they're subsidizing this you paid $20 for it or you will pay 20
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:27,007	| IOT117a |	And then you'll get $20 back on your eligible for social purchase
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:33,407	| IOT117a |	She registered it so again just like the dash buttons and all its all subsidized
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,199	| IOT117a |	Runs on 2 AAA batteries
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:35,967	| IOT117a |	Convenient
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,479	| IOT117a |	I think
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:41,087	| IOT117a |	Yeah be tested something called the Haiku it was a grocery store product.
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,135	| IOT117a |	It was 2 years ago
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,415	| IOT117a |	And you know
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,695	| IOT117a |	I don't buy the groceries in my house
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,999	| IOT117a |	We had fun because
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,023	| IOT117a |	Press the button
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,071	| IOT117a |	What are bananas
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,095	| IOT117a |	Or
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,631	| IOT117a |	You can scan things
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,143	| IOT117a |	Scanner
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,191	| IOT117a |	My husband felt it
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:58,239	| IOT117a |	Sometimes it did not pull the right stuff
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,519	| IOT117a |	For the grocery
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,127	| IOT117a |	We also meal plan
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,407	| IOT117a |	And so
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,479	| IOT117a |	It was great for tracking stuff that
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,039	| IOT117a |	We ran out of but it was kind of
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,063	| IOT117a |	A pain to sit and talk
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,087	| IOT117a |	Order the grocer
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,367	| IOT117a |	We wanted to order
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,159	| IOT117a |	Basically
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,672	| IOT117a |	Ended up with two
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,720	| IOT117a |	Right right
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:24,608	| IOT117a |	Yeah that's not good so I wonder I mean it's obviously very early since this thing just came out
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:31,264	| IOT117a |	But I wonder if the response is positive and Amazon will know if it's positive cuz they have all the Analytics
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:36,896	| IOT117a |	I wonder if you start seeing this integrated into refrigerators in like a
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,944	| IOT117a |	Connecting pain kind of thing
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:42,272	| IOT117a |	Just like some of the dash buttons are in somebody appliances now
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,040	| IOT117a |	Yeah that would be
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,672	| IOT117a |	I don't want to talk to your fridge is opposed to your
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,440	| IOT117a |	Echo a lot of
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:49,952	| IOT117a |	Those are in the
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,256	| IOT117a |	Pusher
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,024	| IOT117a |	Let's do it
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,816	| IOT117a |	There's also trash can
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,584	| IOT117a |	Scanner
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,096	| IOT117a |	You can buy that
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,888	| IOT117a |	You know as you throw some
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,400	| IOT117a |	Take away
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,704	| IOT117a |	Barcode on it
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| IOT117a |	Clever
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,544	| IOT117a |	There's a lot of things out there
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,360	| IOT117a |	All right and now we have a surprise for both
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,384	| IOT117a |	The audience and myself
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:12,736	| IOT117a |	Yes cuz you don't know what my favorite new Amazon Echo skill is
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,272	| IOT117a |	I don't Kevin
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:20,416	| IOT117a |	What is it it's not that exciting but I'm excited I don't know maybe I'm the only one
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,720	| IOT117a |	But I remember saying multiple times
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:25,792	| IOT117a |	What are the reasons I wasn't too keen on getting in trust me this relates
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,608	| IOT117a |	Getting a Google home was that
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:31,424	| IOT117a |	It doesn't work with the music services that I subscribe to
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:38,336	| IOT117a |	And one of them is SiriusXM and sure enough there's a new SiriusXM skill as of yesterday so I can just
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:44,736	| IOT117a |	Tell my echo to play The Beatles channel on Sirius XM now when she link the accounts it's good to go
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,248	| IOT117a |	I'm so happy
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:50,368	| IOT117a |	Nice I didn't think people this actually gets Sirius XM out of the car to
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| IOT117a |	Which is probably do that for
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,208	| IOT117a |	I listen to
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:57,280	| IOT117a |	SiriusXM more out of the car than I do in the car
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:00,096	| IOT117a |	I pay extra for that it's an extra five bucks a month I think
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:00,864	| IOT117a |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:01,888	| IOT117a |	Awesome

EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:57,184	| IOT117a |	Small appliances hitting smart devices in the home think about us smart doorbells
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:59,488	| IOT117a |	Smoke detectors thermostats
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:04,352	| IOT117a |	We are working on a range of solutions for many of those types of products that involved
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:08,704	| IOT117a |	Three endings challenges much difference to us relations convention Association
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,776	| IOT117a |	Iqiyi within the conventional home appliances industry
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,592	| IOT117a |	Got it and you actually talk to me about some of these
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,384	| IOT117a |	Challenges he mentioned moving from
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,432	| IOT117a |	Iot 1.0
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,712	| IOT117a |	So now we're in iot
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:22,272	| IOT117a |	2.0 can you talk to me about what you meant by
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,344	| IOT117a |	Blake on iot 1.0
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:31,744	| IOT117a |	Consistency of Simply connection discreet devices to the very limited functionality you have made the ability to Country
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:38,144	| IOT117a |	Light switch and Appliance or other device through your phone to a calculation why that was interesting it was not really significant
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:42,496	| IOT117a |	However nowhere in treating what I'd like to call your TT 2.0
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:48,384	| IOT117a |	Brady Industries Inc ESPN a large part in the Essence alternative to the fundamental connectivity issues and challenges
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:53,760	| IOT117a |	We know a t e have the capability of combining json and unique ways

EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,264	| IOT117a |	So you mentioned some challenges
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,056	| IOT117a |	Associated with iot 2.0
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,104	| IOT117a |	How is TE Connectivity
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,896	| IOT117a |	Alvin companies adapt
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:27,040	| IOT117a |	In terms of challenges security is a very real concern for many of our customers
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:33,440	| IOT117a |	There's too many stories of device isn't a site being hacked with heard stories of video feeds and security cameras and baby monitors
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,208	| IOT117a |	Being hijacked
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:40,608	| IOT117a |	So she eats for taking great care to ensure all solutions we provide to our customers are making the strictest standards in the industry

EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,472	| IOT117a |	For like 4 or 5 years might remember Paul because he came on
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,056	| IOT117a |	To talk about
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,336	| IOT117a |	Building
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,384	| IOT117a |	Blockchain payment model
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:56,896	| IOT117a |	Pause for iot
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| IOT117a |	Yikes
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,760	| IOT117a |	Today we're not going to talk about that actually
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,296	| IOT117a |	Because
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,064	| IOT117a |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,624	| IOT117a |	Building a better world and
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:09,184	| IOT117a |	Building business models that work
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| IOT117a |	For consumer iot
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,280	| IOT117a |	Let's see where this goes
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,328	| IOT117a |	Paul Ekman
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| IOT117a |	What topics should we tackle first
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:20,960	| IOT117a |	Helix jump on this question of
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,264	| IOT117a |	How we build consumer models for iot
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:29,152	| IOT117a |	Promoted because I am feeling really down in the dumps I feel like we're about to see a lot of products
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,224	| IOT117a |	They'll get acquired are they won't be able to support
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,992	| IOT117a |	Their customers
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,016	| IOT117a |	Because they can't
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,552	| IOT117a |	Ongoing costs
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,088	| IOT117a |	Security
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,600	| IOT117a |	Software up
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,184	| IOT117a |	How do you spell that
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:45,792	| IOT117a |	Why don't know for sure how we completely solve it but I think this is actually
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:52,192	| IOT117a |	It's actually an amazingly not new problem and it I think it stems from from a couple of things one of them is it what I like
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,472	| IOT117a |	Make a call business model Envy
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,008	| IOT117a |	So a lot of companies in the space
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:58,336	| IOT117a |	Want to have a razor and Blades business model
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:01,408	| IOT117a |	And I think one of the problems they're having is an expectation
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:07,296	| IOT117a |	From consumers their hope of having a razor blades model is running smack into the desire of consumers
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:10,624	| IOT117a |	Not to have to pay a subscription fee to use their door locks
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:14,976	| IOT117a |	And so it's little things like that are in a mismatching expectation
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,024	| IOT117a |	Has meant that in general
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:21,632	| IOT117a |	Iot consumer it business models have had not as much revenue
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:23,168	| IOT117a |	On the one hand
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,192	| IOT117a |	If they had help
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:26,240	| IOT117a |	And on the other hand they're discovering
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,056	| IOT117a |	It's darned expensive to maintain
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:34,688	| IOT117a |	Over the long-term the software and the technology infrastructure required to support smart connected devices
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,248	| IOT117a |	Let's first talk about the subscription model
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| IOT117a |	Challenge
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,040	| IOT117a |	And then we'll get in
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,064	| IOT117a |	Check back in
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,856	| IOT117a |	Cuz there's there's different answers
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:42,880	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,440	| IOT117a |	When I think about subscription model
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| IOT117a |	If I'm a company
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,744	| IOT117a |	Trying to charge
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,512	| IOT117a |	People for
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,584	| IOT117a |	I don't know access to Cloud video storage is a
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,376	| IOT117a |	Another popular one might
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,424	| IOT117a |	Security or
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,448	| IOT117a |	Parental controls
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,472	| IOT117a |	Rules for like your router
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,032	| IOT117a |	Some of those seem like
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,544	| IOT117a |	Something I
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,080	| IOT117a |	Hey
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:04,384	| IOT117a |	So where do you think a company can get away with
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:04,896	| IOT117a |	Subscription
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:10,784	| IOT117a |	I think we're companies can get away with their subscription Melissa live they're providing something
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:12,064	| IOT117a |	That is
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:15,648	| IOT117a |	Meaningfully more valuable than the base functionality
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:22,560	| IOT117a |	I want to have a door lock and I want to have an electronic door locking that that's great there certain basic simple things that I want with the door lock
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:27,168	| IOT117a |	But then there's perhaps more advanced functionality does like to have as well
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:31,520	| IOT117a |	I think a freemium model works best where you don't have to be locked into it
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:37,920	| IOT117a |	And then to figure out what the additional services are right so a very simple model that just threw the allows
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,992	| IOT117a |	Unlock door with your phone and is electronic unless you replaced it
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:47,136	| IOT117a |	Physical key with a n d Marco Torres thumbprint maybe that's a no subscription model but if you want to have
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:51,488	| IOT117a |	A door lock that is directly connected to VRBO or
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:56,352	| IOT117a |	Allows you know ups and others to deliver packages and brought them inside your hallway
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,656	| IOT117a |	And record the video of them doing that
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,448	| IOT117a |	Then that's kind of a perfect
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:03,008	| IOT117a |	Example of where you could add some additional value
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:08,640	| IOT117a |	So I think one thing for opportunities for companies to think about what is the base functionality
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:15,040	| IOT117a |	But I'm going to provide for everybody and it's going to be simple and it's going to be a One-Shot deal you buy it you use it forever
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:21,184	| IOT117a |	What are the extra features that some subset the possibly pay for and that will help fund some of my ongoing up
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:26,816	| IOT117a |	Beyond devices I spend a lot of time thinking about
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| IOT117a |	What happens when everything be
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,120	| IOT117a |	Becomes a service
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:35,264	| IOT117a |	I actually kind of mean everything because right now I buy my music as a service I buy
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,312	| IOT117a |	All of my entertainment and television
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,104	| IOT117a |	I guess my book scitech
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:39,616	| IOT117a |	Download
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:40,896	| IOT117a |	Candles soap
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:44,224	| IOT117a |	Service but there is that Kindle reading service
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,016	| IOT117a |	And I look at that as we move out
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,296	| IOT117a |	The cars or
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,064	| IOT117a |	I don't know
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:52,160	| IOT117a |	Wells Fargo customer service for sure coming right in
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:56,512	| IOT117a |	Vacation rentals as a service all of these things anything that can be fractionalized
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,304	| IOT117a |	Is likely to become a service
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:02,400	| IOT117a |	So what does that mean for wealth creation and
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,168	| IOT117a |	How people
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,704	| IOT117a |	I just think about
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,752	| IOT117a |	It used to be if you bought your home
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,520	| IOT117a |	For example
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:09,056	| IOT117a |	That was a way to
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,360	| IOT117a |	Create wealth and now it feels like if I buy
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,664	| IOT117a |	Several homes I might be able to generate
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,176	| IOT117a |	Wealth rule
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:17,248	| IOT117a |	Airbnb or those kind of options
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:21,856	| IOT117a |	But for people who don't have that option it feels like it's just going to get wider and wider and they're going to be
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,136	| IOT117a |	Slowly like
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,952	| IOT117a |	Paying out all of their income and having no chance
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,976	| IOT117a |	Instasave just to me
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:27,744	| IOT117a |	The basic services
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:30,816	| IOT117a |	Really
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:31,840	| IOT117a |	Dystopian
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:32,864	| IOT117a |	I do think
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:40,288	| IOT117a |	So do I write I worried about that as well and I try to think about is there some Flipside benefit and I think
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:44,896	| IOT117a |	We are headed towards a world where there could be some significant benefits for people
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:50,784	| IOT117a |	Who are not in the top 1% right so the people who have ordinary incomes and have ordinary aspiration
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:55,904	| IOT117a |	And one of the ones that I think we're going to see most immediately is in fractional vehicle ownership
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,952	| IOT117a |	So today
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:03,840	| IOT117a |	We all need a card has won the most essential things you need especially if you live in the United States we don't have a lot of public transport
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,120	| IOT117a |	You have to have a card
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,144	| IOT117a |	To work
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:10,496	| IOT117a |	Today we'd be happy to buy cars but they actually sit idle most of the time
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:13,312	| IOT117a |	And so in the future when we have
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,080	| IOT117a |	Self-driving
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:16,384	| IOT117a |	Cars in that future is very close by
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:19,968	| IOT117a |	You know if we drive our cars on average 10% of the day
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:22,528	| IOT117a |	We only need about 10% of a car
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,576	| IOT117a |	But today we have to buy a whole car
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:30,720	| IOT117a |	Because it impractical to share your car on a daily basis you know sharing keys and stuff like that if you can't go in and out of
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,792	| IOT117a |	So what's fractional vehicle ownership
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:38,144	| IOT117a |	We can have self-driving cars to take us to work and then they go and they will they work for others
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,704	| IOT117a |	We believe and we're working very hard on that
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,984	| IOT117a |	It's fractional
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:47,360	| IOT117a |	Ownership of asset not only does it hugely reduce the cost that individual people have to pay
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:52,224	| IOT117a |	This is a very good application for blockchain technology where we can make these
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,296	| IOT117a |	Decentralized autonomous organization
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:57,088	| IOT117a |	The future could be full of
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| IOT117a |	Cooperative
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:04,256	| IOT117a |	Entities right nonprofit Cooperative that allow people to share assets very very fish
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,304	| IOT117a |	Okay now
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,096	| IOT117a |	I like that vision
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,376	| IOT117a |	It sounds really awesome
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:10,656	| IOT117a |	But I look at
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:11,424	| IOT117a |	Like things like I think
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,240	| IOT117a |	Tesla had a good example of this they had in there
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:15,520	| IOT117a |	Contract with
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,800	| IOT117a |	If you win do you buy the car
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:20,640	| IOT117a |	They don't want you driving that for anybody else except
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,176	| IOT117a |	For them and it's
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:25,760	| IOT117a |	Almost done clear if you would actually get the benefits
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:26,784	| IOT117a |	Of owning that Tess
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,296	| IOT117a |	Tesla or
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:28,576	| IOT117a |	If Tesla would
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,880	| IOT117a |	So it feels like there
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,928	| IOT117a |	Might be in the midst of this subscription
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,720	| IOT117a |	Subscription ization of every
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,512	| IOT117a |	Did the
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,048	| IOT117a |	Companies who are building these
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:38,560	| IOT117a |	Products
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,352	| IOT117a |	Might try to grab as much of
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:41,632	| IOT117a |	Revenue app
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:47,264	| IOT117a |	They're definitely going to and what's really interesting about this to me
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:49,824	| IOT117a |	Is that we are seeing a replay
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,920	| IOT117a |	Previous big industrial Transformations and I
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:34:00,320	| IOT117a |	I didn't study history at school but I become a bit of a history buff because I love looking at these past examples and what do they want
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:06,720	| IOT117a |	It was really interesting to me is that many people don't realize this is that United Airlines used to be the bow
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:09,536	| IOT117a |	Going consumer air Transport company
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:12,096	| IOT117a |	Right they used to be the passenger service Division and
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:15,936	| IOT117a |	There's a trend here that we see over and over again which is in times of
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:18,752	| IOT117a |	Significant transformational technology
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:23,360	| IOT117a |	Companies pursue high levels of vertical integration because they're capturing that value
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:26,688	| IOT117a |	And typically what happened in the past with antitrust authorities
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:30,528	| IOT117a |	Forest unbundling of those services to improve competition
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:34,112	| IOT117a |	And for sure I think we're not many years away
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:36,160	| IOT117a |	Potentially from some kind of
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:40,000	| IOT117a |	New antitrust Authority looking at those kind of digital integration
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:44,352	| IOT117a |	But we have something new and different that exist today which is
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,632	| IOT117a |	The open-source software
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:51,776	| IOT117a |	And even though Tesla for example is extremely far ahead of a lot of companies in this capability
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:56,640	| IOT117a |	Lots and lots of open-source activities going around around machine learning
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,968	| IOT117a |	And image recognition and autonomous vehicles
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,296	| IOT117a |	That I think maybe not right away but over time
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,576	| IOT117a |	Will empower
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,624	| IOT117a |	Consumers Cooperative
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:08,416	| IOT117a |	To build alternative
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:11,232	| IOT117a |	And to create the kind of it a new
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,816	| IOT117a |	Cooperative culture that's built on digital collaboration
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:18,144	| IOT117a |	Let's talk about what that needs and how that might
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,240	| IOT117a |	So I think
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,288	| IOT117a |	The Prototype the model for this
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,336	| IOT117a |	Is in the world of software
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:29,664	| IOT117a |	If you look at blocked and unblocked him is a really good example
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:36,064	| IOT117a |	Almost all the big Innovations in blockchain and all of the foundational capabilities have been built in an open sore
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:42,464	| IOT117a |	Forest Manor and open source technology is at the foundation of almost every major kind of digital technology
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,232	| IOT117a |	Platform
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,512	| IOT117a |	What's been missing
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,328	| IOT117a |	Is the translation of Open Source in a
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:52,192	| IOT117a |	Technology industry into open source and collaboration as a
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,728	| IOT117a |	Physical product
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:59,104	| IOT117a |	And I think that that is the next step in the next big opportunity for people
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:35:59,872	| IOT117a |	Is Frosty
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:06,016	| IOT117a |	Create a open-source collaborative or cooperative movement that brings it into the physical world
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:12,672	| IOT117a |	So with that look like my neighborhood Co-op we're like 50 of my closest friends and neighbors get together and we
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,208	| IOT117a |	I don't know
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,232	| IOT117a |	A car is an asset
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,304	| IOT117a |	Cars
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,352	| IOT117a |	The cars are good example trucks
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:24,704	| IOT117a |	Solar panels
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:28,544	| IOT117a |	So we creep is Co-op we all Buy in
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,336	| IOT117a |	We put our money into this and then
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,664	| IOT117a |	We would need to buy some sort of software or
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,224	| IOT117a |	I assume it's open source so we would then have to
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:36,736	| IOT117a |	The download
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,040	| IOT117a |	We would have to pay someone somehow
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,320	| IOT117a |	Management
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| IOT117a |	Attain this cuz that's a field
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,136	| IOT117a |	Not a lot of people
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:43,904	| IOT117a |	What have
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:44,672	| IOT117a |	And
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,184	| IOT117a |	Then
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,720	| IOT117a |	We would allocate
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:47,744	| IOT117a |	The resource
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,512	| IOT117a |	Watching like
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:52,608	| IOT117a |	So we could do a couple of things first of all we can raise the money
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,656	| IOT117a |	For this Cooperative venture
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:58,240	| IOT117a |	Through things like an initial coin offering right initial coin offering
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:04,640	| IOT117a |	We can talk about later and we're experiencing a little bit of a kind of an explosive bubble of excitement around them
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:08,480	| IOT117a |	They are a very cool blocking base way of crowdsourcing
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,504	| IOT117a |	New initiative
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:16,416	| IOT117a |	And so you could imagine raising the money for a community solar farm through an initial coin offering that pays for the solar farm
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:18,976	| IOT117a |	Farm and then you can imagine managing that
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:24,352	| IOT117a |	Through a blockchain based system that met that's attached to your home electricity meter
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:25,632	| IOT117a |	And so did.
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,656	| IOT117a |	From your bill
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:30,240	| IOT117a |	The amount that was generated by the solar farm at the time that you can
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:36,384	| IOT117a |	And that all of the software required to maintain that and manage that process is part of a
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:37,664	| IOT117a |	Open source
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:39,968	| IOT117a |	Community-supported software program
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:43,552	| IOT117a |	And chances are if you have something a very high volume
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,600	| IOT117a |	Like a community solar farm
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,648	| IOT117a |	Or a neighborhood car sharing service
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:54,048	| IOT117a |	You're going to have huge number people around the world and think it's a great and you know very rewarding about open source
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,560	| IOT117a |	Software
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:58,912	| IOT117a |	50 or 75 or a hundred collaborators around the world working together
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:01,984	| IOT117a |	Create infrastructure that's used by millions
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:03,776	| IOT117a |	And
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:06,848	| IOT117a |	That would be their job or do you think that's something they do in their spare time from
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:14,272	| IOT117a |	Many of these are supported by people who do work in their spare time you know are people at ey they do a ton of
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:16,320	| IOT117a |	Contributions to non-profit
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,600	| IOT117a |	And open stores
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:24,000	| IOT117a |	Communities we actually inform me when I hire developers one of the chief thinks that I look for is a track record
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:26,304	| IOT117a |	Contributing to open source environment
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:30,400	| IOT117a |	Because the standard of coding is high the level of inspection is high
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:36,800	| IOT117a |	And it kind of just the spirit of community involvement is a great signal that you know what you do with your spare time
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,336	| IOT117a |	Means a lot about how you approach your work
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,384	| IOT117a |	So now I got this
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,664	| IOT117a |	Managed that feels like
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,736	| IOT117a |	Model for sharing assets
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,784	| IOT117a |	Maybe a strike against
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,296	| IOT117a |	Stay
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:48,320	| IOT117a |	Scarier
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:51,392	| IOT117a |	Corporate-owned
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,440	| IOT117a |	Let us go back
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,464	| IOT117a |	2
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:57,792	| IOT117a |	Which was
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,328	| IOT117a |	How to build
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:01,376	| IOT117a |	Sustainable business models for a connected device
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:02,912	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,192	| IOT117a |	The first thing was
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,496	| IOT117a |	We talked about subscription but you also talked about
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:08,800	| IOT117a |	How do you build iot
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:10,080	| IOT117a |	In a way that makes
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:10,848	| IOT117a |	Cheaper Tumi
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:11,360	| IOT117a |	Maintain over
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,152	| IOT117a |	And I think we're going to get back to
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:20,576	| IOT117a |	We are and there's a bunch of key issues at the top of the list is first of all there's a cost of the infrastructure required to
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:22,368	| IOT117a |	To support this large-scale
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,904	| IOT117a |	And that infrastructure costs
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:25,952	| IOT117a |	Comes in a couple of ways first of all
EDL	00:39:25,952	00:39:28,768	| IOT117a |	You need data centers and CDN for Distributing content
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:32,352	| IOT117a |	And secondly overtime what's interesting is
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:34,400	| IOT117a |	As devices and asset age
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,704	| IOT117a |	One of the problems that that
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:43,104	| IOT117a |	You got if it's sometimes the infrastructure that supports them ages as well it may age faster than the devices in
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:43,872	| IOT117a |	In the field
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:47,200	| IOT117a |	So for sure we believe a big part of this is
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:49,504	| IOT117a |	As much software as you can
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,552	| IOT117a |	You should be building on open source
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:54,112	| IOT117a |	Especially if it's got a robust Community because then
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:57,696	| IOT117a |	All the cost of maintaining that software is not falling on your shoulders
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:40:00,512	| IOT117a |	And that's really important especially when it comes to security
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,792	| IOT117a |	You want a
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,584	| IOT117a |	Robust community
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:06,400	| IOT117a |	Are people who are looking for bugs and 0 day
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:09,216	| IOT117a |	When it comes to the
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:12,544	| IOT117a |	Infrastructure kind of cost in architecture as a whole
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:15,872	| IOT117a |	I think we're still architecting things in a way that's a little bit out of date
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,664	| IOT117a |	Retreating
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:23,040	| IOT117a |	Computing cost especially the edge of something that still cost money but actually it's basically free
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:27,648	| IOT117a |	And these devices that we have out of the ads are very very powerful today and they're not
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,208	| IOT117a |	Especially for ones that are sitting in a car
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:35,072	| IOT117a |	Bar connected to Mains power they have a lot of compute power and in many cases they have quite a bit of bandwidth
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:38,912	| IOT117a |	As well I'm a big believer in and one of my original interest in blockchain
EDL	00:40:39,424	00:40:41,472	| IOT117a |	Came around this idea of taking
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:42,752	| IOT117a |	The workload
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:49,152	| IOT117a |	That has traditionally been centralized in an expensive data center or through a CDN and distributing it out to the edges
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:54,016	| IOT117a |	The network as a blockchain based distributed computing infrastructure with peer-to-peer
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,296	| IOT117a |	IMessaging and transfer
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:41:02,720	| IOT117a |	That is a mouthful sorry yes but the bottom line kind of key bottom line that we found out with that
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:08,864	| IOT117a |	From an infrastructure standpoint it can be up to 99% less expensive to maintain a distributed infrastructure
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:11,936	| IOT117a |	Compared to a centralized Data Center
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:14,752	| IOT117a |	Now that's not all of your cost but it's a meaningful chunk
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,032	| IOT117a |	I feel like we're
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,056	| IOT117a |	Getting there
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:20,128	| IOT117a |	Perhaps maybe not in the consumer side as much but
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,408	| IOT117a |	I'm looking at things like
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:25,248	| IOT117a |	This month AWS just announced AWS Greengrass
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,296	| IOT117a |	And that's going to be pushing
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:28,832	| IOT117a |	Services to
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:29,856	| IOT117a |	A Gateway device
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:33,440	| IOT117a |	Microsoft has kind of iot at the edge there's a lot of cops
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:34,464	| IOT117a |	He's building the super
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:34,976	| IOT117a |	For powerful
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,512	| IOT117a |	Devices that
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,280	| IOT117a |	They're so it feels like
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:40,096	| IOT117a |	There's interest at the edge but it is not
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:40,608	| IOT117a |	Blockchain
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,912	| IOT117a |	So I'm kind of curious
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,448	| IOT117a |	If those two things
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:45,472	| IOT117a |	Might somehow
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:50,080	| IOT117a |	Are they will definitely meet if you look at all of the major players in this base
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:54,943	| IOT117a |	Every single one of them is in the process of experimenting with our thinking through
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:55,967	| IOT117a |	Blockchain technology
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:58,015	| IOT117a |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:03,903	| IOT117a |	I'm not sure that it matters so much what the technology is so long as we move some of the stuff out to the edge
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:08,767	| IOT117a |	What I can tell you is we had an interesting debate back when I was at IBM
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:14,399	| IOT117a |	As we started digging into the use of blockchain for iot and we kept asking ourselves
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:17,215	| IOT117a |	Do you say lots of different distributed computing Arkansas
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:23,615	| IOT117a |	Why do we care about blocking why we doing this are we just doing it because like every time you say Bitcoin somebody
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:25,663	| IOT117a |	DNR compliance Department freaks out and
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,687	| IOT117a |	Fun to watch that
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:29,503	| IOT117a |	Or is it because we have a better reason
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:32,831	| IOT117a |	And what we settled on the better reason that we settled on
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,111	| IOT117a |	And I think it's a good one is
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:36,159	| IOT117a |	It came back to this question
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:37,951	| IOT117a |	What is the internet of things for
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:42,559	| IOT117a |	And at the end of the day if it's not on the consumer side if it's one the business side
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:46,399	| IOT117a |	The Internet of Things if design some how to create economic value
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:49,215	| IOT117a |	And with need about blockchain as a
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:51,007	| IOT117a |	Distributed computing architecture
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,543	| IOT117a |	Is there Heritage in Bitcoin
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:55,615	| IOT117a |	Which is all about moving and storing value in a network
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,663	| IOT117a |	And at the end of the day
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:43:01,503	| IOT117a |	Whatever we do with with the are distributed iot infrastructure
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:07,647	| IOT117a |	We wanted somehow to be involved in generating money making payments and the economic exchange of value
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:09,183	| IOT117a |	And that's why
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:10,463	| IOT117a |	I think blockchain
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:14,559	| IOT117a |	Will become over time a very attractive choice for companies
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:17,631	| IOT117a |	That want to build high-value hbase empress
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:19,935	| IOT117a |	I like that that make sense
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:21,471	| IOT117a |	And now
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:26,847	| IOT117a |	Let us move Beyond value and subscriptions and into this idea of blockchain for social good
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,639	| IOT117a |	You brought this up in
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:31,455	| IOT117a |	I feel like we spent a lot of time talking about data
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:31,967	| IOT117a |	Send money
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:36,063	| IOT117a |	Business transformation but we don't actually talk about how we can make the world a little bit better
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,343	| IOT117a |	So
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,367	| IOT117a |	Expound on your idea
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:41,439	| IOT117a |	Creating a network of social good are people who care about social
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:51,679	| IOT117a |	Yes I feel like such a silly parody of the TV show Silicon Valley every time I say we just want to make the world a better place
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:57,823	| IOT117a |	But it's funny in part because so many people believe it's true and I for one think of blockchain sare
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:44:01,407	| IOT117a |	And nice unique opportunity for us to read decentralized
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:04,991	| IOT117a |	The internet and I didn't coined that phrase but I think it was
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:06,527	| IOT117a |	Icori doctor or somebody
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:12,927	| IOT117a |	The elf very famous but it's a great idea right at the internet we started off with thinking this is somehow away
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:15,231	| IOT117a |	Giving people more control
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,511	| IOT117a |	Over their lies
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,791	| IOT117a |	More autonomy
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:22,143	| IOT117a |	And in some ways it's become a powerful tool of social control
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:24,447	| IOT117a |	And high level of centralization
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:26,751	| IOT117a |	And I think we should remember that in fact
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,543	| IOT117a |	In many cases
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:32,383	| IOT117a |	What's powerful and empowering is to give people the tools
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:34,943	| IOT117a |	And access to assets that they couldn't previously
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:38,271	| IOT117a |	So why change Railway Distributing at work
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:42,111	| IOT117a |	And sharing it out either work or assets or other things
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,647	| IOT117a |	In a way
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:46,207	| IOT117a |	That seems as efficient and integrated
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:49,023	| IOT117a |	Centralized infrastructure
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:51,071	| IOT117a |	But without all of that overhead
EDL	00:44:51,071	00:44:52,095	| IOT117a |	Or centralization
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:55,167	| IOT117a |	And another analogy here is in a Bitcoin
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:57,983	| IOT117a |	Got a bunch of people who don't know each other
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:45:01,311	| IOT117a |	To work together collaboratively to create a reliable digital banking
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,615	| IOT117a |	We can do the same with
