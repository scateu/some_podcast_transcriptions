EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,584	| IOT137 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,608	| IOT137 |	What started off with
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,632	| IOT137 |	Self-driving
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:49,568	| IOT137 |	It's so funny you said minivans because all the people talking about the new waymo self driving taxis are like hey if you want to be a sock
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,616	| IOT137 |	Your mom just jump in the waymo van cuz
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,664	| IOT137 |	Girl Vans I'm kind of surprised
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,224	| IOT137 |	Cuz you don't make sense for you no
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,992	| IOT137 |	Taxi
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,528	| IOT137 |	Because she can get more people
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:01:59,808	| IOT137 |	Look at you
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:05,696	| IOT137 |	Can get all kinds of stuff plus minivans have these awesome features for self-driving cars which is the doors opening
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,208	| IOT137 |	Close on their own
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,000	| IOT137 |	Right right right right
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:12,352	| IOT137 |	That's very true and in fact we're talk about the Phoenix area and waymo and their self-driving taxis
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:16,192	| IOT137 |	Of course and we talked about this before but they're actually kind of live now which is kind of
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:19,776	| IOT137 |	Crazy you can literally within a hundred square miles of Phoenix
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,848	| IOT137 |	Fast travel in a waymo self driving minivan
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,384	| IOT137 |	For now
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:27,200	| IOT137 |	There will or maybe a waymo person
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,736	| IOT137 |	There is a waymo person
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,272	| IOT137 |	In the van with you
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:34,880	| IOT137 |	However they may not sit in the driver's seat you may have nobody in that driver seat
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,904	| IOT137 |	Is what waymo is saying
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:41,536	| IOT137 |	So it's pretty cool I think and I think it's really smart that they're doing it where they're doing it
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,560	| IOT137 |	For a couple reasons
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:45,120	| IOT137 |	Why don't people realize that but just outside of Phoenix
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:49,472	| IOT137 |	In the area of Mesa there's a massive driving test track
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,776	| IOT137 |	That has been there for like 30-40 years
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:56,896	| IOT137 |	Now there's like they're building solar panels and stuff there but the track is still there for testing so
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:02,528	| IOT137 |	A lot of companies use that it would not surprise me if waymo use that early on but now they're obviously in the city
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:04,832	| IOT137 |	And that environment that
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:11,232	| IOT137 |	Topography the weather it's all I perfect place and I tweeted out the store yesterday Stacy and somebody said
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:14,048	| IOT137 |	Well this isn't that challenging Phoenix is just a grid
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:18,656	| IOT137 |	It's flat as dry I'm like but that's what you want to start you don't want to start with the most
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,424	| IOT137 |	Challenging
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:22,752	| IOT137 |	Garments yeah yeah I mean
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:25,056	| IOT137 |	I think it's actually a very wise choice
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,384	| IOT137 |	For waymo to do this in the Phoenix area because it is very grid-like
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,176	| IOT137 |	Streets it is very flat
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:30,944	| IOT137 |	So
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,248	| IOT137 |	It gives them their foot in the door here so
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:38,368	| IOT137 |	This is I think this is level for driving as soon as not quite level 5 but
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,648	| IOT137 |	That's pretty darn close
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,184	| IOT137 |	It is it's one number away
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:47,584	| IOT137 |	I was going to say that it is smart that they still have a person in the car and suddenly I realized that
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:53,728	| IOT137 |	Holy cow if there isn't a person in the car eventually will have to develop systems for preventing vandalisation
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,008	| IOT137 |	Vandalism
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,776	| IOT137 |	Vandalism
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,848	| IOT137 |	So we'll have to
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,360	| IOT137 |	Figure out a way
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:03,200	| IOT137 |	Play scarves are cameras everywhere
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,248	| IOT137 |	Yeah and I guess you'll have a credit card UK
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:10,368	| IOT137 |	They'll just lock the doors and pull over until the police come
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,256	| IOT137 |	And other Automotive
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,024	| IOT137 |	News
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,863	| IOT137 |	Has partnered with NASA
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,631	| IOT137 |	It's not autonomous
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,423	| IOT137 |	But it is a filet
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,471	| IOT137 |	This is just a fun little
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:25,983	| IOT137 |	Video willing
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,263	| IOT137 |	I don't have a
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:33,919	| IOT137 |	I have to say after I mean the video that people should watch this basically
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:37,503	| IOT137 |	It's almost like the fast pass line at Disney World literally would
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:42,111	| IOT137 |	Scan your phone for barcode with Uber you request an Uber air whatever
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| IOT137 |	Can you go up
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,463	| IOT137 |	To the top of a building where maybe they have today helipad and stuff
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| IOT137 |	Enter these
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,303	| IOT137 |	Small little things like glider planes
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,583	| IOT137 |	Is what they're envisioning
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,887	| IOT137 |	And they have propellers that would
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,935	| IOT137 |	Tilt horizontally and vertically so they
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,447	| IOT137 |	Takeoff
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,727	| IOT137 |	Vertically
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,031	| IOT137 |	And then drive or fly you wherever you need to go
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:04,127	| IOT137 |	And it's interesting they say they're theorizing that you could go from
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,527	| IOT137 |	The LAX to the Staples Center in 10 minutes in one of these things as opposed to an hour and a half
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,807	| IOT137 |	Driving your car
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,575	| IOT137 |	So
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:17,695	| IOT137 |	Huge Time Savings and all that there is actually a pilot in the Drone like
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,719	| IOT137 |	Vehicle
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,999	| IOT137 |	It got me thinking
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:23,583	| IOT137 |	It's only a matter of time once they get this off the ground no pun intended
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:26,143	| IOT137 |	That they do this autonomously as well
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:30,495	| IOT137 |	And that's going to be a bigger challenge than autonomous vehicles because now you have a whole nother
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| IOT137 |	Dimension of
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,287	| IOT137 |	You know up and down and
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,055	| IOT137 |	What not so
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| IOT137 |	I just think it's worth watching is my
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,639	| IOT137 |	Okay I will keep watch
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,919	| IOT137 |	I will keep watching the skies
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| IOT137 |	All right
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| IOT137 |	Outside of car news
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,039	| IOT137 |	We have some exciting news
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,063	| IOT137 |	God we're going to talk about
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,343	| IOT137 |	Home Security
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:46,879	| IOT137 |	So here goes
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,159	| IOT137 |	We've got a couple story
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| IOT137 |	1
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,231	| IOT137 |	Ring and ADT
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| IOT137 |	Fake news
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,279	| IOT137 |	End of last week
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,863	| IOT137 |	ATT was granted a temporary injunction
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,887	| IOT137 |	Against rain
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:01,471	| IOT137 |	So when can no longer sell its ring protect
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,495	| IOT137 |	Product
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,519	| IOT137 |	Because
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,847	| IOT137 |	And this goes all the way back to March when
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,383	| IOT137 |	Ring hired
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| IOT137 |	Almost everybody from Zona
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,455	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,991	| IOT137 |	As part of that
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:17,343	| IOT137 |	Was like the security system yeah we have gone off but
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,135	| IOT137 |	Zone of had taken
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| IOT137 |	Funding
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:25,279	| IOT137 |	Alone from ATT and also was working with ADT to develop a smart home
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,303	| IOT137 |	Security system
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,375	| IOT137 |	ATT so ATT was like
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:35,519	| IOT137 |	Turn off that you just kind of sort of took with you because all these people that work for a ring
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT137 |	That's ours
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,591	| IOT137 |	And the judge basically
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:41,407	| IOT137 |	Agreed with ADT and that's why this temporary injunction
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| IOT137 |	What is
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,223	| IOT137 |	Scary face
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:50,623	| IOT137 |	Users or perhaps a great deal of people seem to be really excited about it ring basically said if you ordered one of our
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,647	| IOT137 |	Products
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,183	| IOT137 |	Ring protect
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,975	| IOT137 |	What's going to happen is
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:07:01,375	| IOT137 |	Ring is going to offer you a $50 promo code that you can use towards any ring doorbell or outdoor camera as well
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,679	| IOT137 |	Well is an additional $100 off
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,471	| IOT137 |	Ring protect once it's re-release
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,663	| IOT137 |	Sell this injunction went in place before ring actually got any product out the door right
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,479	| IOT137 |	Yeah cuz I'm just thinking if I ordered one before and Ashley
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:16,991	| IOT137 |	Got it
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,039	| IOT137 |	Can I still supported do I have to send it
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,367	| IOT137 |	It's probably a very small number if any
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,951	| IOT137 |	I got out there but what terrible timing we're going to the museum
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:30,047	| IOT137 |	Shopping season of the year here in the US and I'm sure some people going to buy security systems
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:35,679	| IOT137 |	No they don't make great stocking stuffers I just received
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,983	| IOT137 |	Okay then how's your smile
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,823	| IOT137 |	This is true and the pricing
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:44,895	| IOT137 |	Get this was a $199 system if I recall correctly.
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,967	| IOT137 |	So that's also going to appeal to people who may not want to pay
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,991	| IOT137 |	For 500 more
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,527	| IOT137 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,599	| IOT137 |	So this is big this is sad
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,647	| IOT137 |	Will cibor also
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,183	| IOT137 |	In the security space
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,511	| IOT137 |	This is a super hot area right now
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,607	| IOT137 |	We've got pricing came out for nest sonesse launched
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,631	| IOT137 |	Nest secure
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,703	| IOT137 |	The couple weeks ago and it is 499
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| IOT137 |	4
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,775	| IOT137 |	I think it's two sensors The Hub
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,823	| IOT137 |	And to text activate the Hub
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,615	| IOT137 |	Arm and disarm the system
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:20,991	| IOT137 |	So they launched that and they also said that they would offer a monitored security
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,759	| IOT137 |	Package
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:22,783	| IOT137 |	And lo and behold
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:23,807	| IOT137 |	Now they do
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,087	| IOT137 |	And it's kind of pricey
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,391	| IOT137 |	Yeah and it's also
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,183	| IOT137 |	Separate from the
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:33,791	| IOT137 |	Nest aware subscription if you pay for that so if you already paying nestegg IM $10 a month
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:39,679	| IOT137 |	Nest aware for your nest cam that's totally separate going to keep paying. So they're working with Mony Mony or money
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,959	| IOT137 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,983	| IOT137 |	Capital m o n
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,055	| IOT137 |	Yeah I know the second largest
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:50,431	| IOT137 |	Security monitoring company in the country last I checked so they're huge they also sell their own security systems
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:56,063	| IOT137 |	Similar to an ATT and so on and they have obviously monthly packages I'll give you the hardware for free and so on
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,343	| IOT137 |	Obviously with nest
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:01,183	| IOT137 |	You're not getting the harbor for free but the monitoring is optional
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| IOT137 |	And you can pay
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:07,327	| IOT137 |	2499 a month if you commit to a three year plan
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,887	| IOT137 |	Or you can pay 3499 a month
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:15,775	| IOT137 |	On a month-to-month basis with no plan and I just find that super super high because again you're paying for the hardware
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| IOT137 |	Right so
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,359	| IOT137 |	You know maybe give the nest
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,895	| IOT137 |	Oway and do the
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,687	| IOT137 |	Obviously that's not what next wants
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,479	| IOT137 |	To do so if it's just
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,247	| IOT137 |	Nest has
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,271	| IOT137 |	Just hold me in the past
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| IOT137 |	Sit there still very delicate
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| IOT137 |	Heated to their DIY
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,391	| IOT137 |	And the DIY people may not want one
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:31,903	| IOT137 |	Monitored security
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| IOT137 |	Sure
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| IOT137 |	So I think that's kind of
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,535	| IOT137 |	Nest also now
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,303	| IOT137 |	This is a little
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,375	| IOT137 |	I don't know if Nest is being actively
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,703	| IOT137 |	Part of this but Nest now works with security systems
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| IOT137 |	I'm a company car
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,239	| IOT137 |	Call notion
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,311	| IOT137 |	Innotion actually makes a really interesting system
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,335	| IOT137 |	It is
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,175	| IOT137 |	Set of sensors and then a bridge
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,455	| IOT137 |	And they're $0.05
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,735	| IOT137 |	Plus a bridge
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| IOT137 |	That's $300
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:05,183	| IOT137 |	And the sensors are really interesting they're cute little circles that you just stick anywhere and they measure things like
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,207	| IOT137 |	Vibrations of the
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| IOT137 |	Tell if your doors open
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:13,375	| IOT137 |	How close they measure temperature they can do Leak Detection they can do a lot of things and so now what they do is they all
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:17,471	| IOT137 |	Also can detect they work with the nest so if you're
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,007	| IOT137 |	Door is open in your air conditioning
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:24,127	| IOT137 |	I'm not sure if it'll let you arm and disarm
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,895	| IOT137 |	Based on
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,919	| IOT137 |	Presence detection
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,943	| IOT137 |	Turn The Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,711	| IOT137 |	Which would be Tycoon
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,759	| IOT137 |	But it's yet another Wrinkle in the
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| IOT137 |	Security world
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:35,903	| IOT137 |	It's good to have the integration I mean that more Generations are always better in my opinion so that's good
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:40,511	| IOT137 |	I hadn't seen this before I'm looking at it now it almost looks like a plastic August lock
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| IOT137 |	It's smaller
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:46,143	| IOT137 |	And their peel and stick
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,447	| IOT137 |	It is
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:56,127	| IOT137 |	Pretty much as they use a proprietary version of 802. 15. 4 which is zigbee
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,199	| IOT137 |	I know I thought
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,503	| IOT137 |	You almost lost me at bridge but now you're really lost
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,015	| IOT137 |	Proprietary
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,135	| IOT137 |	It makes sense you can't have a battery-powered sensor
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,415	| IOT137 |	That doesn't mean
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:08,927	| IOT137 |	You can't have a wife
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| IOT137 |	That's just great
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| IOT137 |	That's just
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,583	| IOT137 |	That's the
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,143	| IOT137 |	But we also have
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,655	| IOT137 |	Almond
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:25,567	| IOT137 |	The Almond router switch many people may not be aware of there by a company called securifi that actually all the way back
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| IOT137 |	Back in like 2000
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,151	| IOT137 |	11 mm 12 was launching mesh router
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,431	| IOT137 |	Because every
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,199	| IOT137 |	The way routers work
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,503	| IOT137 |	It's terrible so they were like super early in the
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| IOT137 |	They now
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,063	| IOT137 |	I have created
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| IOT137 |	Security package
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| IOT137 |	That
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:41,951	| IOT137 |	It has some sensors in it it works with the mesh routing system they
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:44,255	| IOT137 |	Long had a security offering
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,303	| IOT137 |	Are they have for the last year had a security offering
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,095	| IOT137 |	For ten bucks a month
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,119	| IOT137 |	He basically
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,191	| IOT137 |	Have a router that works with sensors
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| IOT137 |	From this company and
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:55,775	| IOT137 |	So I'm like
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,567	| IOT137 |	That's yet another wrinkle
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,151	| IOT137 |	Yeah and I said I could see more of this
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,431	| IOT137 |	Jack built into routers
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:08,575	| IOT137 |	You know it's like so almond actually did the Almond routers when they launch they had like a
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:13,695	| IOT137 |	An LCD screen in the Next Generation had all these radios
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:15,999	| IOT137 |	They're pretty good and then now the
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,791	| IOT137 |	End the latest version
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,071	| IOT137 |	It's the almond
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| IOT137 |	3s route
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,423	| IOT137 |	The third router plus that stands for security
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,007	| IOT137 |	It has a battery it has a SIM slot for cellular backup
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| IOT137 |	And it has all these great
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,383	| IOT137 |	I lied to you it's
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| IOT137 |	Professional emergency Mana
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:34,687	| IOT137 |	Is $20
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:38,527	| IOT137 |	And if you I guess do it
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| IOT137 |	Through the Indiegogo the secured
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,183	| IOT137 |	There you go cool stuff from them I
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,719	| IOT137 |	Just like their products so
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:52,351	| IOT137 |	Always worth a look if you are like a security maybe I also need a mesh router
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:52,863	| IOT137 |	Why not
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,191	| IOT137 |	Now
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,215	| IOT137 |	Moving outside this
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| IOT137 |	Let's go to Congress
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| IOT137 |	Edit security-related Act
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,871	| IOT137 |	Because we're talking about
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,943	| IOT137 |	New legislation that was introduced in the Senate
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,711	| IOT137 |	And the house
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:10,783	| IOT137 |	Call the Cyber Shield Act of 2017
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:17,695	| IOT137 |	I haven't seen the actual legislation Norton space I don't think you have either so we have a write-up on it and I think it's a good
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:18,975	| IOT137 |	Step it
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,767	| IOT137 |	Does a lot of teeth
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| IOT137 |	Two at a sickly
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:28,191	| IOT137 |	They're talking about setting up a voluntary program so that device makers can choose to have their products evaluated
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:32,287	| IOT137 |	And certified for meeting certain benchmarks on Cyber and data security
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:36,639	| IOT137 |	They got the right buzzwords in there but there's too many qualifiers such as a voluntary and Ken
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,151	| IOT137 |	Choose
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,687	| IOT137 |	And so on and so forth
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,271	| IOT137 |	It's going to take time to get these Benchmark settings put together
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:45,343	| IOT137 |	You're looking at a couple years before I think anything really
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,623	| IOT137 |	Happens here if it
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,903	| IOT137 |	At all quite honestly
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:50,207	| IOT137 |	Yes the legislation basically sets up
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,975	| IOT137 |	The committee
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| IOT137 |	Hey Kennedy
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:56,095	| IOT137 |	Over a period of 2 years to set bench
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,375	| IOT137 |	Parks for cyber security
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,911	| IOT137 |	Yay long time
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:03,263	| IOT137 |	And then one size benchmarks are enacted
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,031	| IOT137 |	It's voluntary
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,103	| IOT137 |	Yeah so it feels like
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:10,687	| IOT137 |	Let's talk about iot security without actually doing anything
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:12,735	| IOT137 |	To dress what is really actually a quite
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:19,135	| IOT137 |	Two plus two to three years from now the landscape will be very different anyway so
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,903	| IOT137 |	Tentative
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,463	| IOT137 |	Figure this out the next three to six months in my opinion
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,999	| IOT137 |	Yeah, this isn't going to do anything
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| IOT137 |	We should talk about
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,607	| IOT137 |	Decipher
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,935	| IOT137 |	Because this week there been a bunch of reports
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT137 |	About cyber secure
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| IOT137 |	From a bunch of
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:38,079	| IOT137 |	So in the newsletter I will highlight a bunch of these
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,871	| IOT137 |	Because there are so many
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,663	| IOT137 |	But the big things to take away
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,967	| IOT137 |	I think are pretty simple
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,759	| IOT137 |	The first thing to understand is
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:49,599	| IOT137 |	What's happening is there active groups targeted
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,111	| IOT137 |	Industrial
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:56,255	| IOT137 |	Systems so these are your skater these modbus all these old school industrial system
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,279	| IOT137 |	Running power plants
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,327	| IOT137 |	Yes nuclear plants
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| IOT137 |	Dams
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| IOT137 |	Manufacturing
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:06,239	| IOT137 |	All of this so these are all being targeted which is not actually news but
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,519	| IOT137 |	What is worth noting
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,823	| IOT137 |	Is that most companies right now
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:13,151	| IOT137 |	Are still under the belief that things like air gapping their Network
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| IOT137 |	Works
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:17,503	| IOT137 |	Not only is air gapping not enough
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,783	| IOT137 |	The Based on data coming
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,063	| IOT137 |	Cyber X
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:23,135	| IOT137 |	There's a lot of unpatchable stuff
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,159	| IOT137 |	They're so
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:28,511	| IOT137 |	According to the survey more than three out of four sites have obsolete Windows system
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,071	| IOT137 |	Yeah this is actually a big
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,351	| IOT137 |	Ideal hospitals have
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,119	| IOT137 |	Gotten
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,655	| IOT137 |	Ding by this when they're
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:37,471	| IOT137 |	An upgradable machines like MRI machines
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT137 |	Windows operating
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:43,359	| IOT137 |	Systems which is best five things like XP in 2000 things that are not really supported anymore
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| IOT137 |	They also have
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| IOT137 |	Crappy passwords
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,479	| IOT137 |	It's nearly three out of five sides
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:52,831	| IOT137 |	Have plain text passwords traversing their control Network
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,111	| IOT137 |	No no no u
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,487	| IOT137 |	I know you think those networks aren't online but people can get to them and they can be sniff
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,511	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,023	| IOT137 |	Half half
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,071	| IOT137 |	At least one unknown
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,887	| IOT137 |	Or Rogue device and 20% have wireless access
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,911	| IOT137 |	Points that
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,679	| IOT137 |	Are unknown
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,471	| IOT137 |	And you don't want your wireless access point
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,007	| IOT137 |	Because anything that
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,287	| IOT137 |	Connects to them will be vulnerable
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:17,919	| IOT137 |	So say I think anybody's implementing the system just needs to binge watch mr. robot and
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:20,223	| IOT137 |	I think they'll get a kick in the pants right there
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:22,527	| IOT137 |	There we go so really you guys if
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,551	| IOT137 |	You have
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,343	| IOT137 |	Automated systems
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,623	| IOT137 |	You have
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,903	| IOT137 |	Monitoring systems
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,207	| IOT137 |	You feel like they're secure
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,487	| IOT137 |	You should probably
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| IOT137 |	Double check
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:32,767	| IOT137 |	Statuses
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,071	| IOT137 |	Target got hacked
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,095	| IOT137 |	This way it was
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,399	| IOT137 |	Let us
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,447	| IOT137 |	So that's all the bad news
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,215	| IOT137 |	About 4
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,751	| IOT137 |	Z saber
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,519	| IOT137 |	Front
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:45,055	| IOT137 |	Let us move to
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,591	| IOT137 |	A giant M&M
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,919	| IOT137 |	As an Old Ship reporter I was
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| IOT137 |	Really
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,223	| IOT137 |	Excited is not the word
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,247	| IOT137 |	Kind of ostrich
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,807	| IOT137 |	At the idea that broadcom
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:56,575	| IOT137 |	Offered
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,087	| IOT137 |	This week
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,623	| IOT137 |	Hey
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,415	| IOT137 |	100 in
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:00,927	| IOT137 |	Pie five
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| IOT137 |	Billion dollars
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,999	| IOT137 |	Billion with a B
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,279	| IOT137 |	To acquire
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,839	| IOT137 |	Qualcomm this is an unsolicited takeover
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,375	| IOT137 |	Offering
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,399	| IOT137 |	70 bucks per share
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,935	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,215	| IOT137 |	This isn't the middle of
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,727	| IOT137 |	Broadcast
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,519	| IOT137 |	Trying to buy Brocade
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,799	| IOT137 |	After it said it would move it
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| IOT137 |	Back to the US
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| IOT137 |	And in the middle of
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| IOT137 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,431	| IOT137 |	Trying to finish its massive deal
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,455	| IOT137 |	Nxp
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,271	| IOT137 |	Yeah this is huge
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| IOT137 |	Broadcom is a
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,367	| IOT137 |	Big player just in a different way than
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:33,695	| IOT137 |	Qualcomm broadcom Zamora verb Bluetooth Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,487	| IOT137 |	Very low-power type chip
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,767	| IOT137 |	So here's
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,791	| IOT137 |	We all think of broad
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,839	| IOT137 |	Tom is one company but really it's not that
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,911	| IOT137 |	So broadcom that Kevin's talking
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,215	| IOT137 |	Is a Bluetooth
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:47,519	| IOT137 |	Powerhouse components and all sorts of
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| IOT137 |	The phone spot
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,591	| IOT137 |	Couple years ago it was acquired by a
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,151	| IOT137 |	Which was created by a private-equity
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,967	| IOT137 |	The pot hp's Agilent
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,759	| IOT137 |	So this is like super embedded
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,551	| IOT137 |	Detailed stuff and then they bought a bunch of network
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:02,367	| IOT137 |	Alyssa
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,391	| IOT137 |	Plx
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,671	| IOT137 |	Please crazy ethernet
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,439	| IOT137 |	Storage Network
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,463	| IOT137 |	Working all kinds of stuff
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,511	| IOT137 |	So what we call broadcom
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,279	| IOT137 |	Today
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,815	| IOT137 |	Is actually a mishmash of a
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,863	| IOT137 |	Bunch of really deep cut
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,887	| IOT137 |	Conant level
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| IOT137 |	In networking
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| IOT137 |	Right foot
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| IOT137 |	When we say networking level
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:22,335	| IOT137 |	What I think broadcom gets out of this but it doesn't have today and you can tell me if I'm wrong
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:25,663	| IOT137 |	Qualcomm modem business is huge
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,711	| IOT137 |	And not just for phones
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,759	| IOT137 |	I'm also thinking ahead to like
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,295	| IOT137 |	Capital M and
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:32,831	| IOT137 |	NB iot and such so
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,623	| IOT137 |	Art person
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,391	| IOT137 |	Respective
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:37,439	| IOT137 |	I think this would be a huge win for blood
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:41,279	| IOT137 |	Yes it would it would get its communication stuff so the bass Man in the Moon
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,815	| IOT137 |	Right
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,351	| IOT137 |	Also gets the Qualcomm
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,887	| IOT137 |	Application processor
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,423	| IOT137 |	Rich
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,983	| IOT137 |	Broadcom when it was
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,263	| IOT137 |	Actually Brad, Nut Bra
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,079	| IOT137 |	Avago actually was talking about doing
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:58,687	| IOT137 |	Arm-based servers and some really interesting and they had application processors to we should
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,711	| IOT137 |	Desperate
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:03,039	| IOT137 |	This is a deal that would basically
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| IOT137 |	The new broadcom
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| IOT137 |	Qualcomm
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,623	| IOT137 |	In every single phone
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,183	| IOT137 |	In the world
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:09,951	| IOT137 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,999	| IOT137 |	So it's
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| IOT137 |	Pumpkinhead
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,791	| IOT137 |	Huge deal
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:18,143	| IOT137 |	The broad, Clayton she said there may not be known for their application processors
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:21,727	| IOT137 |	But they have them for sure I mean the Raspberry Pi 3
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| IOT137 |	Runs on a beach
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,007	| IOT137 |	Township so
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:28,383	| IOT137 |	But you know it's not a new space for them but it would greatly expand the capabilities and reach of that
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,943	| IOT137 |	Yeah I mean Qualcomm is
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:33,247	| IOT137 |	Their application processors are the creme Dela
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:36,063	| IOT137 |	Yes Man unless we're talking about Apple's application process
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| IOT137 |	That is
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,671	| IOT137 |	That deal
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,695	| IOT137 |	I wrote a bit about it
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,719	| IOT137 |	Include a link
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,767	| IOT137 |	Put out a newsletter alert
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| IOT137 |	Because I thought it was such a
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,583	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,375	| IOT137 |	So we'll see what happens
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT137 |	We'll have some ship drama
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,215	| IOT137 |	And now
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,751	| IOT137 |	Let's move to
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,775	| IOT137 |	Holiday iot
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,567	| IOT137 |	Because
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,335	| IOT137 |	Why not
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,359	| IOT137 |	Amazon has been
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:01,919	| IOT137 |	Partying hard it did a great deal for
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,735	| IOT137 |	Lutron devices I think was 120 bucks got you
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,527	| IOT137 |	Hub the Lutron hub
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,087	| IOT137 |	Two of the switches
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:09,855	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| IOT137 |	To the little Pico room
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:13,183	| IOT137 |	Switch that basically threw in the hub for
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,279	| IOT137 |	$80 value so that was actually a smoking hot deal
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:19,583	| IOT137 |	I believe the SmartThings Hub is now 50
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,375	| IOT137 |	2% off for Black Friday
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:24,703	| IOT137 |	Beyond are going to be doing deals on the Amazon Echo all the answers
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,239	| IOT137 |	Hardware and
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,519	| IOT137 |	Released
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,287	| IOT137 |	Is there a news
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,335	| IOT137 |	Which has a nest cam
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,639	| IOT137 |	Call for a hundred
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,687	| IOT137 |	30 bucks that's one of the doorbusters
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,991	| IOT137 |	They also are going to do an echo.
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,295	| IOT137 |	30 bucks the new version
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT137 |	A little shorter
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:41,855	| IOT137 |	$80
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,903	| IOT137 |	Brighten up the place with the Hub
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,975	| IOT137 |	And then fo-sho for a hunt
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,535	| IOT137 |	By the way the Echo Show release
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,119	| IOT137 |	Really sad
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:21:00,031	| IOT137 |	My daughter told me no because she likes looking at she plays music on it she like seeing who
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:00,543	| IOT137 |	Did the song in the
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,079	| IOT137 |	And personally like
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,615	| IOT137 |	It's not worth that much money
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,943	| IOT137 |	What's 220 bucks that keep your kid happy
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,575	| IOT137 |	I don't know about you but I think it's a lot
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,111	| IOT137 |	So those are the big Smart Home
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| IOT137 |	Deals for
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,184	| IOT137 |	Hargett
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,328	| IOT137 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,888	| IOT137 |	Like I wear a Fitbit
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,400	| IOT137 |	But not everybody
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:32,032	| IOT137 |	He'll be more will have probably more of this next coming shows I have left
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| IOT137 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,336	| IOT137 |	IJustine
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,384	| IOT137 |	In case you're like who I want to buy one of these things
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:37,920	| IOT137 |	Now you can
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,480	| IOT137 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,272	| IOT137 |	Let's move this show right along
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:46,368	| IOT137 |	It might be a good time to update your Logitech Harmony remote to
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:49,696	| IOT137 |	Well so this is not the harmony this is the Logitech Harmony
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,208	| IOT137 |	Link
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,768	| IOT137 |	Vegas
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:57,376	| IOT137 |	I don't know if you want to update to Harmony maybe should get like a Chromecast and
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:59,424	| IOT137 |	Google Home Fire TV
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,192	| IOT137 |	Anime
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,728	| IOT137 |	Logitech is
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,240	| IOT137 |	Ricky
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:03,776	| IOT137 |	D
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,544	| IOT137 |	Logitech
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,360	| IOT137 |	Harmony link which is a device that you can buy
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,688	| IOT137 |	About seven years ago and it
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:13,760	| IOT137 |	Was it basically converted your IR signals
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,528	| IOT137 |	To WiFi
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:19,648	| IOT137 |	So this is not the harmony home hub that was introduced a little bit later and connect to madame
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:23,232	| IOT137 |	But plenty of people did buy this device in Logitech base
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,000	| IOT137 |	Basically said you know what
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,792	| IOT137 |	Guys in a couple months
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,584	| IOT137 |	We're going to send a software update and it's gone
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,632	| IOT137 |	Poopy heads
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:37,312	| IOT137 |	I don't know what else to say I mean it I said the Stacy before the show or talk about this these guys are not doing themselves any favors in order they do
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,848	| IOT137 |	In the industry any favors here
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:42,688	| IOT137 |	How to get back to that question I keep asking are you buying Hardware are you buying services
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:46,528	| IOT137 |	In this case you can keep your hard work it just going to be used
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| IOT137 |	Servu
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:52,672	| IOT137 |	I won't do anything and I sort of don't understand why they're doing it with this particular product because
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:56,256	| IOT137 |	It's nothing more unless I'm missing something
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:59,072	| IOT137 |	Then it rich to convert wifi-to-ir
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:01,120	| IOT137 |	I'm assuming they don't want to keep
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,144	| IOT137 |	Hoarding
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,680	| IOT137 |	The software
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:07,008	| IOT137 |	Logitech sent email to the link
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:10,080	| IOT137 |	On March 16th 2018
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:14,432	| IOT137 |	Logitech will discontinue service and support for the link it will no longer function after this date
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:18,272	| IOT137 |	They are offering customers a 35% discount on a New Harmony
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:23,392	| IOT137 |	And it's basically the same sort of thing IR Wi-Fi but you also get connected
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,184	| IOT137 |	So my hunch is they just one
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,208	| IOT137 |	Consolidate
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:27,744	| IOT137 |	No
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,792	| IOT137 |	But not everybody wants
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,304	| IOT137 |	Apple Smart Home
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:35,168	| IOT137 |	Some people just want to be able to control their TV
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,008	| IOT137 |	Product know and let's face it
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:43,872	| IOT137 |	Keeping software up to date on a device that handles IR codes and Wi-Fi it's not like
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:48,480	| IOT137 |	Guess you could say we're kind of going away maybe it is but
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,064	| IOT137 |	But then you go I mean that just
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,088	| IOT137 |	I don't like this at all
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:55,392	| IOT137 |	In this ties back so a couple of months ago I wrote
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,184	| IOT137 |	But I really do think
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:59,488	| IOT137 |	We should be talking about smart
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,512	| IOT137 |	Devices in the car
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,304	| IOT137 |	Expiration dates
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:05,120	| IOT137 |	So this would be avoided
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| IOT137 |	If
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,656	| IOT137 |	Wenzhou
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:11,264	| IOT137 |	Released a product said hey you know what this product we're going to support it guarantee
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,568	| IOT137 |	After that
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,384	| IOT137 |	That at least gives customers the Opera
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,432	| IOT137 |	Opportunity to say no
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:21,248	| IOT137 |	It's some will some won't and I think
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,784	| IOT137 |	As we move from
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:26,880	| IOT137 |	Straight up Hardware to Hardware that's supported by software we're going to have to
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:31,744	| IOT137 |	And at first I was like no I don't agree with you but then as I think about it
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:34,560	| IOT137 |	Especially as it relates to a totally different industry that we're all
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,352	| IOT137 |	Involved in smartphones
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,120	| IOT137 |	You
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| IOT137 |	So did you have that
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,424	| IOT137 |	You have
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:44,032	| IOT137 |	Companies Google for example we promised software Android software updates for
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:46,080	| IOT137 |	2 years on the new pixels
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:46,848	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:47,616	| IOT137 |	Security updates
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,384	| IOT137 |	3 years
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:51,200	| IOT137 |	Do you know what the shelf life of that is going to be
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,480	| IOT137 |	So I guess I do get it
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,296	| IOT137 |	Not saying I like it but I get it
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,856	| IOT137 |	The shift in ownership
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,880	| IOT137 |	I've never really are
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,184	| IOT137 |	Your in software does
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:04,000	| IOT137 |	Requires constant development in upgrades for security
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,304	| IOT137 |	Requires
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,584	| IOT137 |	Someone to support it
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,656	| IOT137 |	All of those things cost money and
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:13,472	| IOT137 |	It's possible that you won't want to have that happen
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:14,496	| IOT137 |	For the rest of the
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,544	| IOT137 |	The rest of the physical life
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,336	| IOT137 |	Right
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:21,152	| IOT137 |	So I think we're going to get into this I think
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| IOT137 |	The industry should be
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,968	| IOT137 |	Really rushing
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,040	| IOT137 |	So guys in the industry
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,320	| IOT137 |	Think about this
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,392	| IOT137 |	Really think about this and start discussing it and buy
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,160	| IOT137 |	Gosh
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,184	| IOT137 |	Start Ashley in
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:35,232	| IOT137 |	Because in the industry
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:37,536	| IOT137 |	It's already in Enterprise iot
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,352	| IOT137 |	You get a device with
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:40,864	| IOT137 |	Asset
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,400	| IOT137 |	Expiration date asset support
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,704	| IOT137 |	We need that is
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,496	| IOT137 |	It's going to suck
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:51,872	| IOT137 |	Real quick that one alternative I can think of I'm not saying it's a good idea is to start making this
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,640	| IOT137 |	Ace Hardware
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:58,528	| IOT137 |	Modular and or agreeable that look at this little hug device you know maybe I should be able to pop it open
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:01,088	| IOT137 |	Grab the board out of it pop new insert a new board that
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,904	| IOT137 |	Bring me new wireless Technologies and new capabilities and so on
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,440	| IOT137 |	And that way you
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,488	| IOT137 |	Kind of res to replacing it but
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,256	| IOT137 |	It's more of a
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,048	| IOT137 |	Update to the device already have
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,608	| IOT137 |	I think that would work on some devices
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,888	| IOT137 |	Unsung
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:19,264	| IOT137 |	Answers to Penny I mean most consumers are not going to be like
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:24,896	| IOT137 |	No you have to make a consumer-friendly. There's a plug-in type module again
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| IOT137 |	Yeah but I'm not trying to
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,480	| IOT137 |	Who your idea
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,600	| IOT137 |	Let's see we have we have a party
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,904	| IOT137 |	Kevin and nobody was invited
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:40,512	| IOT137 |	Yeah that's just a funny story actually leads into our listener voicemail because
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,536	| IOT137 |	Car related
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:44,096	| IOT137 |	An Amazon Echo in Germany that started a rave
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:47,936	| IOT137 |	And nobody was home so the police had to actually break the door down
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:50,240	| IOT137 |	Because of all the noise complaints from Neighbors
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,544	| IOT137 |	Nobody knows how long this person's
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:56,384	| IOT137 |	Echo started the crazy music party but it did on the six
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:58,432	| IOT137 |	Open window
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,712	| IOT137 |	Does not like somebody could have
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,992	| IOT137 |	Told madamaiyada
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,760	| IOT137 |	Crank up the
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,808	| IOT137 |	You know Electronics
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,600	| IOT137 |	Pump up the jams yeah
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:08,160	| IOT137 |	That's what I don't understand how this happened but it did
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,672	| IOT137 |	I just think it's funny
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:09,696	| IOT137 |	That is fun
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,000	| IOT137 |	And that brings us to our
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,280	| IOT137 |	Question of the week

EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,128	| IOT137 |	So you don't have to have a smart
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,944	| IOT137 |	To see what's possible
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,712	| IOT137 |	Schlage

EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:41,184	| IOT137 |	I'm loving the show I did have a question actually this
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:44,256	| IOT137 |	What company was last week show when you guys
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,024	| IOT137 |	Talked about
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,584	| IOT137 |	Google home
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:51,168	| IOT137 |	Does a night mode feature I haven't tried it out yet but I'm definitely
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,752	| IOT137 |	Get out but what I've been thinking is
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,800	| IOT137 |	Usually and I know this is especially
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,592	| IOT137 |	True with the
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:01,408	| IOT137 |	When I would whisper to the echo
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:03,200	| IOT137 |	It would usually responds
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,760	| IOT137 |	Obviously Amazon has a profile
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,528	| IOT137 |	Whispers
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,576	| IOT137 |	Does he know when you whisper
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,112	| IOT137 |	Obviously does not sound
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,160	| IOT137 |	Like a regular and irregular speech
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,232	| IOT137 |	So I'm just wondering why
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,536	| IOT137 |	They are not able to identify that
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,816	| IOT137 |	Body is Whispering
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,840	| IOT137 |	And then
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:22,656	| IOT137 |	Taylor response as it pertains to the volume
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,424	| IOT137 |	Accordingly
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:24,192	| IOT137 |	So it fits
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,240	| IOT137 |	In the morning and I said
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,616	| IOT137 |	Why can't Amazon recognizing I'm whispering
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,384	| IOT137 |	And then
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:32,896	| IOT137 |	Just automatic
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,688	| IOT137 |	Anyway
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,736	| IOT137 |	I don't know if they are complications that I'm
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,296	| IOT137 |	Not aware of what I would love to hear your take on it
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:39,808	| IOT137 |	Thank you guys
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:41,856	| IOT137 |	Odoo weight
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,392	| IOT137 |	What is a brilliant idea
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:46,464	| IOT137 |	Although I will say that when I whisper to my Madam and she never respond
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,000	| IOT137 |	But she does respond to my
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:54,912	| IOT137 |	So I love the idea I think it may be a bit of a technical challenge because you have to figure out
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:29:00,800	| IOT137 |	Somebody if the voice levels are low because somebody just further away or they're actually whispering
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:04,384	| IOT137 |	Right because if you're further away the noise level to whisper like
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,408	| IOT137 |	Sound level so
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:08,480	| IOT137 |	It could be tricky but I love the idea I hope that they could
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:11,552	| IOT137 |	Try I mean let's try it beta test it let's do it
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:14,880	| IOT137 |	Yeah well it it's a very human thing to do because like if
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,928	| IOT137 |	If I suddenly whisper to you
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,024	| IOT137 |	And I will respond at the same level
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,304	| IOT137 |	Exactly
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:24,096	| IOT137 |	So it's kind of like
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,120	| IOT137 |	My electronic device
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,400	| IOT137 |	Is my AI is now
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:27,936	| IOT137 |	More like me
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:28,704	| IOT137 |	So
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:29,984	| IOT137 |	Charlie
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:30,496	| IOT137 |	Amazon
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,032	| IOT137 |	Get on it
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,056	| IOT137 |	What did happen
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,080	| IOT137 |	Just let us know why
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,640	| IOT137 |	There might be
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:38,944	| IOT137 |	If you

EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,544	| IOT137 |	Thread because there is actually some big news this week
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:07,104	| IOT137 |	And it doesn't sound good for the thread standard
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,176	| IOT137 |	So I could Grant Erickson coming on the show 2
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,712	| IOT137 |	Talk about what's happening
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,480	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,504	| IOT137 |	And what is it
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,528	| IOT137 |	What isn't happening

EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:12,128	| IOT137 |	But we are bringing different people
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:15,712	| IOT137 |	Pictures of artificial intelligence to make that analysis and make that
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,480	| IOT137 |	Application
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:16,992	| IOT137 |	More robust
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:22,880	| IOT137 |	Do you have an example of maybe one of your clients and how they used AI to change their business
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,928	| IOT137 |	Absolutely closer
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,464	| IOT137 |	Which is the largest pump
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,488	| IOT137 |	Manufacturer
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,024	| IOT137 |	And the US is one of our client
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| IOT137 |	Take a break
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| IOT137 |	The failure in a bump
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,608	| IOT137 |	A few hours in advance
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,144	| IOT137 |	They applied are algorithms
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,168	| IOT137 |	And now they can
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,936	| IOT137 |	Extent
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:40,544	| IOT137 |	Forewarning of a pump failure by 6 days that is fundamentally changed their business
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:44,896	| IOT137 |	This Mortal they can sell prediction of the service which is really supercharged
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:45,408	| IOT137 |	Aftermarket
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:51,040	| IOT137 |	What are some of the critical steps to ensuring a successful
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| IOT137 |	Plantation
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:54,624	| IOT137 |	To the key to successful implementation
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,904	| IOT137 |	Could be the pink bag
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| IOT137 |	Strategically
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:57,952	| IOT137 |	An act
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,464	| IOT137 |	Tactical
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,744	| IOT137 |	What that means
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,536	| IOT137 |	Addressing the big picture problems
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:02,560	| IOT137 |	Concerning the Border
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,328	| IOT137 |	The c-suite
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,352	| IOT137 |	And the dressing

EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| IOT137 |	Outcomes
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:10,240	| IOT137 |	Building a good Roi story at the end of the day that technology
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,264	| IOT137 |	It should be tight
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,288	| IOT137 |	Clothes liquid
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,848	| IOT137 |	The the second thing that very important
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,640	| IOT137 |	Is the people Astor Cafe
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,176	| IOT137 |	Because it's new technology
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:19,200	| IOT137 |	And fix
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:20,992	| IOT137 |	Controller technology or Lord
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,528	| IOT137 |	The client's feet got to
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,064	| IOT137 |	Engage the people and get
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:27,392	| IOT137 |	Goodbye and so they don't feel nervous about it and their stock price
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,672	| IOT137 |	Technology
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:31,232	| IOT137 |	I can deliver the business outcomes that are looking for
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,000	| IOT137 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,304	| IOT137 |	And what are some of the risks of limitations
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,352	| IOT137 |	The biggest restaurant
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:41,472	| IOT137 |	Seen as people jumping to conclusions about what the technology can do
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,008	| IOT137 |	The dog building the right foundation
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,800	| IOT137 |	Safari examples
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:47,616	| IOT137 |	The organizational structure could be something.
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,920	| IOT137 |	It's not supportive of an AI implementation
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:56,832	| IOT137 |	It could be the lack of data or available data within the ideal environment to be able to support some of the artificial intelligence
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:59,136	| IOT137 |	Algorithm so between the organization
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,416	| IOT137 |	Structure in people
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,696	| IOT137 |	And the

EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:28,576	| IOT137 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:30,624	| IOT137 |	Is Grant Erickson Who is the
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:32,416	| IOT137 |	President of the thread group
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,696	| IOT137 |	Hey Grant how are you doing
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:36,256	| IOT137 |	Good morning sissy thank you so much for having me on this morning
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:38,304	| IOT137 |	I am super excited
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,072	| IOT137 |	Because
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:42,656	| IOT137 |	How to say you got news today and you guys are watching something
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:45,984	| IOT137 |	But I want to hear you explain in your own words cuz I'm a little worried about the
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,752	| IOT137 |	So
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,520	| IOT137 |	Let's talk
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:49,568	| IOT137 |	Thread
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:53,408	| IOT137 |	First offer people who are unfamiliar thread is a wireless protocol
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:57,248	| IOT137 |	It's like zigbee Z-Wave Bluetooth all those Wi-Fi even
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:34:03,136	| IOT137 |	Except it's a little different because it is a mesh base protocol it is also low power
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:04,160	| IOT137 |	And it's
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,464	| IOT137 |	IPv6 compliant which means
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:09,536	| IOT137 |	A device can talk directly to the internet as opposed to going
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,304	| IOT137 |	Rahab
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,864	| IOT137 |	So now that we know all of this about

EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,960	| IOT137 |	Talk about your news first.
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,984	| IOT137 |	Good news
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:19,520	| IOT137 |	Thread is used in more places
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,544	| IOT137 |	Let's talk about that
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:21,312	| IOT137 |	Aptoide
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:27,712	| IOT137 |	So we have an exciting pipeline of products coming into the marketplace today we have just shy of a dozen
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,480	| IOT137 |	Components
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:31,552	| IOT137 |	Facts of people in use build exciting iot products
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,320	| IOT137 |	Today
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:38,464	| IOT137 |	And because of this actually spending the number of places that you can go certify thread products and solutions
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:41,024	| IOT137 |	Spanish
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,328	| IOT137 |	Including a locations in Southeast Asia
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:44,864	| IOT137 |	And your looks to be closer
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:48,704	| IOT137 |	Mazar
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:50,240	| IOT137 |	So we have
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| IOT137 |	Two categories of
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:53,312	| IOT137 |	The people who really want to
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,848	| IOT137 |	Tell the world
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:35:00,224	| IOT137 |	We have something to talk about for quite some time which is our thread certified products
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:04,832	| IOT137 |	One of our first and most prominent companies in that category 0 who announced their stuff
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,112	| IOT137 |	Next generation Wireless products
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:08,672	| IOT137 |	Stutter hopefully soon-to-be thread certified
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:11,232	| IOT137 |	We have a second category of products
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:17,376	| IOT137 |	What is a member-driven organization and we have people who are really excited about touting their uses red in pots
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:20,192	| IOT137 |	Even though that maybe not all the way quite there
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:23,520	| IOT137 |	Program called shred ready
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:26,336	| IOT137 |	To support the interests of members who really won at out
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,896	| IOT137 |	They are using thread but they're not all the way to
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:33,504	| IOT137 |	Completely open trade system
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:36,320	| IOT137 |	That's one of the first example of that it messed
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,856	| IOT137 |	With a recently released
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:38,624	| IOT137 |	Nest
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:39,904	| IOT137 |	Acure product line
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:42,720	| IOT137 |	How's it's been running designation for their nest
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,512	| IOT137 |	And for their nest guard.
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:46,048	| IOT137 |	Okay so
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:49,120	| IOT137 |	What we're seeing here is threat certified which means
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,400	| IOT137 |	Ian Fleming
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,680	| IOT137 |	All parts of the
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,704	| IOT137 |	Thread protocol
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,472	| IOT137 |	Exactly
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,568	| IOT137 |	There is a second category which is
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:58,336	| IOT137 |	Thread ready
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,384	| IOT137 |	Which is implementing some parts
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,456	| IOT137 |	Exactly
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,224	| IOT137 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:06,528	| IOT137 |	So let's dig into this cuz this feels like
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,064	| IOT137 |	China
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,344	| IOT137 |	One day
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,904	| IOT137 |	So let's start with ness
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:14,464	| IOT137 |	So they are thread ready
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,488	| IOT137 |	What makes them
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,256	| IOT137 |	Thread ready
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:17,024	| IOT137 |	As opposed to
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:17,536	| IOT137 |	Thread certified
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,352	| IOT137 |	Stacy
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:25,728	| IOT137 |	Average of being a sponsor of the friend group is super excited about friend technology
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:31,104	| IOT137 |	And we're Liam wants to get to the end game of the vision we've all been talking about the last time we're
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:35,968	| IOT137 |	Couple things to do to the nature of its products and getting to Market
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:36,992	| IOT137 |	In which
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:41,344	| IOT137 |	Induction of leave application layer they want to do
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,880	| IOT137 |	Stout but they're using thread
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,928	| IOT137 |	Real Marketplace problems
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:49,024	| IOT137 |	Become a signal to the market that they're going to get there in terms of kind of this full open
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:52,864	| IOT137 |	Designation is really a way of saying
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:56,704	| IOT137 |	Network perspective everything we do is completely compliant
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:57,984	| IOT137 |	And meats.
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,520	| IOT137 |	Application
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:00,288	| IOT137 |	Commissioning
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,056	| IOT137 |	OtterBox
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:04,128	| IOT137 |	Experian score for the time being doing things a little differently
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,408	| IOT137 |	And offering them or close to
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:12,064	| IOT137 |	And so the ideas apps it's sort of a signal to the market Marketplace problems today
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:14,112	| IOT137 |	And it's a signal for company to say
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,136	| IOT137 |	Will get there
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:16,672	| IOT137 |	And because celebrity of time-bound
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:22,560	| IOT137 |	Here's the time in which we will like to move our products along to kind of the full red certified
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:24,864	| IOT137 |	Okay let's talk about the timeout
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,632	| IOT137 |	What aspect of it
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,936	| IOT137 |	And how you would go about becoming
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:30,496	| IOT137 |	Shred ready so how does a company
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:33,568	| IOT137 |	Goes to the process to say add-on to be certified
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:34,336	| IOT137 |	I want to be ready
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,872	| IOT137 |	And how long do they have
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:36,896	| IOT137 |	How to get from ready
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,408	| IOT137 |	To certify
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:41,504	| IOT137 |	The first stop is approaching the choice
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:47,648	| IOT137 |	Any one of these six that we're just identified that are open available today and in conjunction with talking to the test house
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:54,560	| IOT137 |	Tom Shirley application saying here is the bread ready
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:38:02,496	| IOT137 |	And the certification director of the certification committee and the board of directors or visa application
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,032	| IOT137 |	And figure out whether or not it
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:09,920	| IOT137 |	The spirit of thread ready which is a company that is really on its way to being fully thread to formal complaint
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:12,480	| IOT137 |	And whether or not the exception again
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:18,624	| IOT137 |	Minor thing or major thing
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:21,696	| IOT137 |	And in addition Delgado
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:25,280	| IOT137 |	Indication of how long they have to get their implementation
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,864	| IOT137 |	Okay so it's a case-by-case
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:29,632	| IOT137 |	Exactly
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,656	| IOT137 |	And the time window is
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:32,448	| IOT137 |	Anywhere from 12 to 18
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:38,080	| IOT137 |	Okay so within 12 to 18 months then we should expect Nest to be fully thread compliant
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,128	| IOT137 |	Okay
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,408	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:44,480	| IOT137 |	What are some of the things that are okay
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:47,040	| IOT137 |	To be so you could be thread ready but not
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,320	| IOT137 |	Trade certified
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:50,624	| IOT137 |	Commissioning apparently is not crucial enough
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,136	| IOT137 |	That you would be
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,696	| IOT137 |	Will let you be thread ready
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:55,488	| IOT137 |	What else could I change to be
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,256	| IOT137 |	Thread ready
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:39:01,120	| IOT137 |	I think mission is really the one that we've really thought long and hard about says that
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:03,168	| IOT137 |	Probably be the acceptable extent
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,984	| IOT137 |	Unique advance in changing some cool things about how they act
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,008	| IOT137 |	Publix
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:13,664	| IOT137 |	All of our years of experience with other alliances and other technologies that making changes and compromises there would be less than desirable
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:19,296	| IOT137 |	And such really more around probably those things that affect the out-of-box experience that might be very
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:20,320	| IOT137 |	Specific or unique
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,112	| IOT137 |	Tamar of a closed ecosystem
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:24,928	| IOT137 |	Alexander nevsky The Nest secure product is today
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,488	| IOT137 |	So if I wanted to change
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,280	| IOT137 |	I don't know the device management aspect
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:31,328	| IOT137 |	Probably not going to Grant an exception
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,400	| IOT137 |	Okay so from the perspective of a consumer
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:38,496	| IOT137 |	If I going to see something are there going to be two labels like thread certified and
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,008	| IOT137 |	Thread ready
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:43,872	| IOT137 |	Tell me a really really with this program wanted to limit that kind of confusion in the marketplace
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,432	| IOT137 |	Suspend ready participant
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:51,552	| IOT137 |	Can't use any low going they may indicate it's ready and Prince but they certainly may not use
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:56,160	| IOT137 |	But don't unfriend or thread certified did again
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:56,928	| IOT137 |	For the artist
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:06,400	| IOT137 |	Market excited about it and we're on our way to being fully Spencer Define interoperable
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,936	| IOT137 |	It's really there
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:09,728	| IOT137 |	Brand that is really the key Brannock
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,032	| IOT137 |	Perspective
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:14,848	| IOT137 |	If we look
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:18,944	| IOT137 |	Products that are in their ecosystem like the
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,224	| IOT137 |	They'll be Burlington
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:22,272	| IOT137 |	Looking for the logo
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:24,576	| IOT137 |	Estrada courts
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:28,160	| IOT137 |	Opportunity guarantee I'm looking for
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:29,440	| IOT137 |	And not necessarily Focus
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:30,720	| IOT137 |	Omni broad open
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:36,096	| IOT137 |	Okay so in 18 months
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:40,192	| IOT137 |	It'll have works with nest and also presumably thread certified
EDL	00:40:40,704	00:40:41,472	| IOT137 |	4
EDL	00:40:41,472	00:40:43,264	| IOT137 |	These devices that
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,312	| IOT137 |	Work with what actually Nest devices
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,592	| IOT137 |	Now
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:49,920	| IOT137 |	Or something like that Yale lock which presumably will also be
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| IOT137 |	Become thread
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,712	| IOT137 |	Ready at some point in time
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:55,296	| IOT137 |	They also have the choice to step up
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,344	| IOT137 |	To this certification level
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,136	| IOT137 |	Exactly
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:01,952	| IOT137 |	All right this to me feels a little bit
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,720	| IOT137 |	Like
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:05,792	| IOT137 |	Zippy which Bratz I really was stuck
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:07,328	| IOT137 |	Cuz
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,888	| IOT137 |	Zippy was like oh we're standard but they had different
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:10,400	| IOT137 |	Location lyrics
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,680	| IOT137 |	And so you could
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:13,984	| IOT137 |	Buy a zigbee certified product
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:17,056	| IOT137 |	Really guarantee that it would work with another
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,080	| IOT137 |	Certified
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:20,640	| IOT137 |	So how is this
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,408	| IOT137 |	Different
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:23,456	| IOT137 |	Differentiators
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:28,064	| IOT137 |	Programming in front of learning from history you have an IP layer
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:30,880	| IOT137 |	Cancel that I can really carry and transport
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,416	| IOT137 |	Multiple application layer
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:39,072	| IOT137 |	In fact if you think back to the demonstration that you saw at CES 2017 and that wall that we had
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:42,144	| IOT137 |	We actually have enough products
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:44,704	| IOT137 |	What program is running a personal strength
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,240	| IOT137 |	We're talking about here with friend ready
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:49,824	| IOT137 |	I knows we're on the very same networks as...
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,128	| IOT137 |	As well as the oci products that were on that wall
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:54,943	| IOT137 |	It's a really even though the method of getting those
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:55,711	| IOT137 |	Devices
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:59,295	| IOT137 |	The thread network was being shared difference between
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:07,231	| IOT137 |	At the end of the day once they were all on the network all three of those application-layer simultaneously work together harmoniously
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:10,815	| IOT137 |	And that's really the beauty of Ip and thread and ability is
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,215	| IOT137 |	Perspective
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:20,031	| IOT137 |	It's really great because you can have a comic
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:22,079	| IOT137 |	Today I want to be..
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:23,871	| IOT137 |	Tomorrow Mayra
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:25,151	| IOT137 |	The device has the resources
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:28,735	| IOT137 |	I want to upgrade with the software update
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:31,295	| IOT137 |	Justin Bieber I want to update
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:42,559	| IOT137 |	Okay and so let's talk about thread within the context of other Wireless Pro to
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:43,071	| IOT137 |	Call speakers
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:45,887	| IOT137 |	My gosh is getting hot and heavy in the wireless
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,215	| IOT137 |	So Bluetooth just
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,007	| IOT137 |	Bluetooth just
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,287	| IOT137 |	Came out with mesh
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:55,103	| IOT137 |	For a while
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,151	| IOT137 |	Capable
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:59,199	| IOT137 |	Not everybody implemented on the chip
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:02,783	| IOT137 |	So there is that but it is capable of doing it
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,295	| IOT137 |	Same thing
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:04,575	| IOT137 |	And
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,343	| IOT137 |	They also
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,367	| IOT137 |	Arlo power
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:07,647	| IOT137 |	Kelley Blue
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,415	| IOT137 |	Bluetooth low energy
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:10,207	| IOT137 |	So to me that feels like
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:10,975	| IOT137 |	The biggest
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:11,487	| IOT137 |	Predator
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:13,279	| IOT137 |	The red
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,559	| IOT137 |	How do you guys
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,327	| IOT137 |	View kind of
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:16,351	| IOT137 |	Protocol
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,375	| IOT137 |	Battles
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:19,679	| IOT137 |	Actual question Stacy and I think
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:23,775	| IOT137 |	Lykke Li I think we're kind of to some extent in our mind
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:26,079	| IOT137 |	Past the particle battles I think there's a link
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:28,895	| IOT137 |	For every application there's a network for every application
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:32,479	| IOT137 |	And generally speaking it's red we kind of see if spread is
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:35,295	| IOT137 |	Aswan + Wi-Fi
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:41,183	| IOT137 |	DSL DOCSIS for your kind of coupling to the internet connectivity
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:42,719	| IOT137 |	I need with Bluetooth
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:45,535	| IOT137 |	If you can play the Pick 4 do you look at Bluetooth
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:49,631	| IOT137 |	Remember partners that actually have ratted out of box
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:50,911	| IOT137 |	Solutions
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:52,703	| IOT137 |	But use Bluetooth today for that kind
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,471	| IOT137 |	Repairing another box
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:57,055	| IOT137 |	I think MacArthur perspective but we really love to see
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:44:00,639	| IOT137 |	Is working together with members of the Bluetooth community
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,687	| IOT137 |	To really start to standardize
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:04,479	| IOT137 |	How thread and be illegal together
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:06,527	| IOT137 |	If you look at our silicon partners
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:10,623	| IOT137 |	Define. Almost all of modern chips and components that are being offered
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:11,647	| IOT137 |	Actually
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,671	| IOT137 |	Dual stack
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,695	| IOT137 |	Joel thread
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:14,463	| IOT137 |	Ble radios
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:19,583	| IOT137 |	Use cases in terms of how you could have point
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,351	| IOT137 |	Interactions
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:23,679	| IOT137 |	The periphery of the thread
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:28,543	| IOT137 |	Really using thread is kind of that backbone steady-state Network
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:29,823	| IOT137 |	Actually
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:35,455	| IOT137 |	Business
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:37,247	| IOT137 |	Alice fredenham
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:37,759	| IOT137 |	Again
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:41,087	| IOT137 |	Again I think that really is a complementary view of
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,903	| IOT137 |	House red and Bluetooth can work together in the future
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:47,743	| IOT137 |	Billy Mac's Asbury Nathan
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:49,279	| IOT137 |	Billy IP is very nice and
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:54,399	| IOT137 |	Solution of cheer in the market today available today and open rule problems
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:45:00,799	| IOT137 |	And I know your ship partners are obviously doing a lot of the work to Bluetooth and thread together
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,639	| IOT137 |	Are you guys at the
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,687	| IOT137 |	Actively talking to people at
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,711	| IOT137 |	The Bluetooth Sig
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:11,807	| IOT137 |	To try to make something happen much like you guys did with
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:13,343	| IOT137 |	How many ducks
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:19,999	| IOT137 |	But we do have many members in common between both the Bluetooth Sig and
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:23,583	| IOT137 |	And those common shared numbers are
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:29,983	| IOT137 |	Doing a lot of work in the background I try to bring those two worlds together and show the marketplace how easily can be complementary
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,519	| IOT137 |	Augusta Technologies
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:34,079	| IOT137 |	And final thought
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:35,359	| IOT137 |	Thread is
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:37,663	| IOT137 |	I know that Nest is obviously a big prick
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:42,015	| IOT137 |	There's the Eero routers I've talked to LaGrande which makes
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,295	| IOT137 |	Beautiful switches
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,831	| IOT137 |	And those cool plugs
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:45,343	| IOT137 |	Pop out of the wall
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:48,415	| IOT137 |	Are there other players
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,183	| IOT137 |	Using
EDL	00:45:49,183	00:45:50,207	| IOT137 |	Threads that are worth
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:57,887	| IOT137 |	We can mention by name we have confidential agreements with all of our members and partners that do go into the store
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:05,567	| IOT137 |	Certainly do now that they are there they are actively engaged with her greatest test labs and tough houses and if we kind of
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:11,199	| IOT137 |	What to add everything up that we see in the pipeline and I'm Horizon we think by end-of-year CS
EDL	00:46:11,199	00:46:15,039	| IOT137 |	2018 time frame we should definitely see certified products
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:17,599	| IOT137 |	Numbering in low
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:19,391	| IOT137 |	Okay so CES
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,159	| IOT137 |	2018
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,183	| IOT137 |	The year
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:25,791	| IOT137 |	Coming on the show
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:29,119	| IOT137 |	I really appreciate the time-space it's been a pleasure as always.
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:35,519	| IOT137 |	Look forward to everything I try and things podcast remember if you want more
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:41,663	| IOT137 |	Or iot news please sign up for my newsletter at Stacey on iot. Com
