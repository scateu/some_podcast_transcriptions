EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:35,904	| IOT153 |	As referenced in our ad oh my gosh you guys Amazon
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,208	| IOT153 |	Just this week said that it would buy
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,744	| IOT153 |	Ring the maker of
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,768	| IOT153 |	The ring doorbells
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:44,096	| IOT153 |	Ring lights and ring outdoor security cameras
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:47,936	| IOT153 |	Maybe the ring security system
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT153 |	Which is currently
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,472	| IOT153 |	Being
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,496	| IOT153 |	Cancel because of
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,288	| IOT153 |	Civil lawsuit
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,872	| IOT153 |	Yeah that's that's part of the story too but
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:03:01,248	| IOT153 |	I guess there's a couple pieces here to unpack one is how much we do know how much Amazon has
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:03,040	| IOT153 |	Buying ring for
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:08,160	| IOT153 |	River was 1 billion but then people saying it's the second largest amount
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:10,208	| IOT153 |	That Amazon has spent on acquisition
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,536	| IOT153 |	So maybe a bit more than a billion
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| IOT153 |	Second largest
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,376	| IOT153 |	Largest was Whole Foods at 13th
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,144	| IOT153 |	2.7 billion
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,960	| IOT153 |	Zappos
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,496	| IOT153 |	Appears to be the second-largest at
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,824	| IOT153 |	2 billion
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,640	| IOT153 |	8 billion +
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,408	| IOT153 |	That's a pretty
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:35,296	| IOT153 |	After number
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,648	| IOT153 |	They said they estimate there are about 1.2
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,208	| IOT153 |	Million ring doorbells out there
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,024	| IOT153 |	So if we use the one point
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,304	| IOT153 |	2 million
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,352	| IOT153 |	Ring units sold
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:55,264	| IOT153 |	And we say on the low side is a 1.2 billion dollar deal Amazon's paying like $1,000
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,312	| IOT153 |	Hours per customer per doorbell
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,640	| IOT153 |	If I ring and I know they're not just buying customers
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:06,528	| IOT153 |	The buying new Rings assets and IP and I get that a wow that's a lot of money
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,552	| IOT153 |	It is a lot of fun
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,368	| IOT153 |	You know I suppose
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,648	| IOT153 |	I suppose it's
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:16,512	| IOT153 |	I know it's just a lot of money
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,536	| IOT153 |	It is a lot of money
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:21,887	| IOT153 |	We shouldn't ignore the fact that in December Amazon also bought
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:26,495	| IOT153 |	Which is a security company that also makes security cameras and doorbells
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:30,591	| IOT153 |	The interesting thing to know here Amazon seems to be
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,359	| IOT153 |	There's a couple
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:34,175	| IOT153 |	Thanks this gets into what I wrote about when the deal was announced but
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT153 |	Review at quickly
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,271	| IOT153 |	One home security is essential
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| IOT153 |	For the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:44,671	| IOT153 |	I know we talked a lot about automation cuz that's where heart lies most consumers buy into the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:47,999	| IOT153 |	Which home security systems is the number one reason that people buy stuff
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,047	| IOT153 |	Number 2 is Energy Efficiency
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,607	| IOT153 |	So you can't be
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| IOT153 |	In a smart home without
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,423	| IOT153 |	And
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:55,935	| IOT153 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,471	| IOT153 |	As its
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:03,871	| IOT153 |	Falling into this magical Madam a place where it's okay we're
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,431	| IOT153 |	Play double down on that I think what's happened is
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,711	| IOT153 |	They bought blink
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,015	| IOT153 |	For a technology powers
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:13,343	| IOT153 |	Has it started out as a chip company making aloe
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,623	| IOT153 |	Power video processor
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| IOT153 |	And
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:22,559	| IOT153 |	That kind of technology is going to be key if we want these kind of sensors around the home at a low price and being batteries
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,327	| IOT153 |	Empowered
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:25,375	| IOT153 |	What is getting with ring is
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,399	| IOT153 |	Market share
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:32,799	| IOT153 |	Ring is by far the leader in this market is according to IHS it has about a 45% share of the Americas
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,823	| IOT153 |	Market in
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,103	| IOT153 |	Video doorbells
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:35,871	| IOT153 |	So
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:42,271	| IOT153 |	That's number one the other is there is Nest just lunch the doorbell their skybell there is August had a doorbell
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,295	| IOT153 |	Like really
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,063	| IOT153 |	Ring was
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,575	| IOT153 |	The contender
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,647	| IOT153 |	So Amazon gets all of this
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:51,743	| IOT153 |	Classic hits
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,767	| IOT153 |	We can't see Aqua hired
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:58,399	| IOT153 |	Lawsuit with ATT
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:05,311	| IOT153 |	Because ATT had invested in off and was security products
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,847	| IOT153 |	There smart home kind of security
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| IOT153 |	Product
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,407	| IOT153 |	And they were 44 ring
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:15,295	| IOT153 |	Well that that's what it gets me through the other thing Amazon is getting here lawsuits
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:19,391	| IOT153 |	What happens with the prior tsutsumi obviously they're not going away
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:22,463	| IOT153 |	And Amazon has deeper Pockets than ring does obviously
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,999	| IOT153 |	So
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,023	| IOT153 |	What does X Change
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,607	| IOT153 |	What happened to nest in the Honeywell lawsuit after Google acquired
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,911	| IOT153 |	My gosh just a few months later it was settled
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:34,495	| IOT153 |	Yeah well maybe that's all part of this big number
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,263	| IOT153 |	Somehow
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:41,407	| IOT153 |	Yeah and it's so it also in addition to the ADT lawsuit it was also being sued by skybell for patent infringement
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,455	| IOT153 |	Darius doorbell
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,735	| IOT153 |	Video doorbell
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| IOT153 |	Right
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,295	| IOT153 |	So
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,087	| IOT153 |	I don't know what happens to those
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| IOT153 |	I reached out to people
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,439	| IOT153 |	It's so new that people are kind of like a shrug
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,487	| IOT153 |	Right
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| IOT153 |	We'll figure that out
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:04,447	| IOT153 |	We may never find out unless I'm going to assume the saying that these suits will be settled no hear about it soon
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,727	| IOT153 |	The next coming months
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,287	| IOT153 |	And I doubt we'll ever hear the sums that were
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,103	| IOT153 |	Presented for settling these suits
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:16,223	| IOT153 |	I would love to know that because taking back in that money out of the purchase price for reading
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:19,551	| IOT153 |	That's really what Amazon is paying for ring in my opinion
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:24,415	| IOT153 |	Has raised a lot of money they were actually going back
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,951	| IOT153 |	Again to the market
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,255	| IOT153 |	With around that would value them in a billion.
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,815	| IOT153 |	Color switches are around billion dollars it was just some
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:37,471	| IOT153 |	So it makes sense the price that people heard it makes sense it was around a billion and then it also makes sense
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:45,151	| IOT153 |	Right they went through six rounds and raised about 210 million dollars and they're looking for more
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:48,479	| IOT153 |	And that kind of speaks to how hard it is to profit in this market as well
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:55,391	| IOT153 |	Right you know
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,695	| IOT153 |	We traded company that was the exit and
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:00,255	| IOT153 |	What happened is it just
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| IOT153 |	It couldn't get there
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,047	| IOT153 |	Fast enough
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,583	| IOT153 |	It was selling well
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:10,495	| IOT153 |	But the doorbell my understanding is has a relatively High bill of materials licensing fees on their video
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| IOT153 |	Testing machines
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,079	| IOT153 |	There's no scale potential there
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,127	| IOT153 |	There could be now with Amazon buying it
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,711	| IOT153 |	Casinos blinx technology
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| IOT153 |	Well you can put links technology inside and
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,599	| IOT153 |	Amazon video processing
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,111	| IOT153 |	Itself
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:29,695	| IOT153 |	SoundCloud it's not AWS
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,999	| IOT153 |	So there are definitely economic
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,767	| IOT153 |	Advantages to
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,839	| IOT153 |	All at all
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:39,423	| IOT153 |	It's a good deal the other thing that I think is really important to know
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,703	| IOT153 |	Well there's two
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:46,335	| IOT153 |	Is if you have a ring doorbell it is going to work for now just the same as it always has
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,383	| IOT153 |	So that means it will stay in great
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,151	| IOT153 |	With other platforms
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,175	| IOT153 |	Amazon
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| IOT153 |	Ring says they are still can't
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,039	| IOT153 |	Doorbell
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| IOT153 |	That's not out yet
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,695	| IOT153 |	So keep waiting on that and
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,463	| IOT153 |	Then
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,999	| IOT153 |	Will that continue
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,767	| IOT153 |	I hope so
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,583	| IOT153 |	I would hate to see the Google flights
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:13,215	| IOT153 |	Especially with Google launching their visual display stuff I would love to be able to look at who's at my ring doorbell on my
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| IOT153 |	Google
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,543	| IOT153 |	I want to call it the Google show
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,591	| IOT153 |	The smartscreen like spaghetti sauce
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:27,039	| IOT153 |	I can do that today obviously with a nest in a Android TV
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,575	| IOT153 |	So I would hope that
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:32,671	| IOT153 |	That kind of thing continues I'm pretty sure that ring will continue on its own
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,207	| IOT153 |	Brandon all that so I don't
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,999	| IOT153 |	I don't expect massive changes
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:41,375	| IOT153 |	As far as what it's going to work with him but it won't work with I think we'll just be highlighted how well it works with Madam a
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:47,775	| IOT153 |	Yeah I don't know I feel like getting to this point where everybody's got Amazon is almost feels
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,591	| IOT153 |	You're going to have to have your own
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,103	| IOT153 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,175	| IOT153 |	So like the nest gear going into Google
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,479	| IOT153 |	And being more closely tied
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,783	| IOT153 |	I can see Amazon looking at that and saying
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| IOT153 |	I guess we got to get our own dear to
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,671	| IOT153 |	Questions what happens to other partner
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,719	| IOT153 |	Canary
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| IOT153 |	Or Skype
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:12,607	| IOT153 |	Those who are working with
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:19,007	| IOT153 |	So lots of question solidation it's going to be a mess as consumers
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,799	| IOT153 |	I'm kind of consumers
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,591	| IOT153 |	We could be host a little bit with our
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:26,687	| IOT153 |	Are devices that used to work in multiple ecosystems we may find them getting
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,759	| IOT153 |	Crunched which is a shame because we bought them
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,039	| IOT153 |	With the
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:36,927	| IOT153 |	Understanding that would work with multiple ecosystems
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| IOT153 |	Other
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,487	| IOT153 |	Companies get squeezed out now
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,255	| IOT153 |	MN
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:45,119	| IOT153 |	You know the products that you bought that don't have a big-name partner may not have a future
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| IOT153 |	Send it
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,727	| IOT153 |	That's sad
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,239	| IOT153 |	That is sad
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,359	| IOT153 |	I'm trying to think of all the devices
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:01,759	| IOT153 |	All the signals the end
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,319	| IOT153 |	Rush of startups
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:08,927	| IOT153 |	That came out in 2013 2012 All Around the iot
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:12,767	| IOT153 |	We saw this huge massive amount of kick-started in French
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,607	| IOT153 |	Crowdfunded in venture-backed companies in
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,887	| IOT153 |	2012
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| IOT153 |	2013
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| IOT153 |	Even a little in 2014
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,055	| IOT153 |	If you weren't out in finding America by then
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:25,823	| IOT153 |	You were kind of
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,103	| IOT153 |	Addalock in
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:31,711	| IOT153 |	We're seeing that with the end of a lot of devices and it's kind of sad so
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:35,551	| IOT153 |	We talked about this early on with Matt turkey was a guest a while back
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,575	| IOT153 |	And he was like yeah
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| IOT153 |	There is over
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,367	| IOT153 |	I think he's right
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,183	| IOT153 |	Teresa
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:41,951	| IOT153 |	Very sad
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,487	| IOT153 |	What else would we talk about
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,559	| IOT153 |	We can talk about a new camera
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:48,863	| IOT153 |	Yes let's talk about it
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,655	| IOT153 |	Clip is finally out
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:54,495	| IOT153 |	This is a camera they announce the Google IO and it was a
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,567	| IOT153 |	Yes that's correct
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,151	| IOT153 |	Is pizza
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,967	| IOT153 |	You said it somewhere and it decides the right time to take
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,991	| IOT153 |	Picture and it takes it
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,575	| IOT153 |	And what kind of it outside the button so you can
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,135	| IOT153 |	Take pictures yourself but the idea is that
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,415	| IOT153 |	You're living your life in
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,439	| IOT153 |	Google decides what
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:20,863	| IOT153 |	Yeah which it's actually intelligent idea because Google has so much data from Google photos about you
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:27,775	| IOT153 |	You know who's in your family who the people you care about that you take pictures a lot of what pets you know do you have it in you take pictures of
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:31,359	| IOT153 |	It takes you from behind the camera and put you in front of the camera with those
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,895	| IOT153 |	People and things and
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,431	| IOT153 |	And intelligently
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:38,783	| IOT153 |	Captures that we supposedly captures you no meaningful memories
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:41,087	| IOT153 |	Did you read the reviews at all by the way
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:43,135	| IOT153 |	Yeah did you see any good ones
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:52,351	| IOT153 |	The surprise really excellent story about
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,655	| IOT153 |	Google clip in Lighthouse which is now out
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,703	| IOT153 |	Lighthouses another intelligent camera
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:01,823	| IOT153 |	In his his reviews weren't like these are not pictures that I used to taking
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,407	| IOT153 |	But it captured some really good moments that I would never
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| IOT153 |	Captured or even noticed
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:11,039	| IOT153 |	Which is that good I think it's a totally different type of
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,343	| IOT153 |	So I think you expect
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,903	| IOT153 |	Much like people poo-pooed smartphone
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:16,671	| IOT153 |	Pictures
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,695	| IOT153 |	For their DSLR
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:21,535	| IOT153 |	DSLR
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,559	| IOT153 |	I think we're going to
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,095	| IOT153 |	This type of
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:30,495	| IOT153 |	Innovation for a while but I think we're going to start getting used to seeing them and then
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,519	| IOT153 |	Start treasuring these Lake
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,055	| IOT153 |	Little moments
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:33,823	| IOT153 |	It captures
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:37,407	| IOT153 |	What degree is early days this is like the first
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,175	| IOT153 |	Camera of it
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:44,319	| IOT153 |	Kind so to speak in a mass-market level and it's going to take time for it to become smart enough to truly become Valley
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,367	| IOT153 |	So
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:52,767	| IOT153 |	I agree with you I wouldn't write it off I don't think it's quite ready for everybody to rush out and buy one based on what I've seen
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| IOT153 |	And I'm not used one
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:59,167	| IOT153 |	But I read every review out there from people that I know and trust and I'm like yeah
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:13:59,935	| IOT153 |	It's just not
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:04,287	| IOT153 |	Not enough value for the turn $49 yet
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:10,431	| IOT153 |	The other thing to note is Google
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,479	| IOT153 |	You choose what images
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,503	| IOT153 |	So if
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,295	| IOT153 |	Google Clips catches you
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,343	| IOT153 |	Running across the living room in a towel
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,879	| IOT153 |	Work without any clothes
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,415	| IOT153 |	You can just delete
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| IOT153 |	That would be a moment
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:31,423	| IOT153 |	It's doing its job it's capturing the memory I think the key here is recognized
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,703	| IOT153 |	Job of explaining this
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,983	| IOT153 |	Recognizing
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,287	| IOT153 |	This is a big thematic shift
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,823	| IOT153 |	Imaging technique
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,639	| IOT153 |	Beforehand we had cameras that were dumb
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:44,991	| IOT153 |	It just you know to make a judgment call a human had to be involved
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,831	| IOT153 |	Normal cameras but now the cameras are making their own judgments
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:51,391	| IOT153 |	Computers
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:51,903	| IOT153 |	Which these are
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,951	| IOT153 |	Are so much
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:58,815	| IOT153 |	More scalable we're going to have the ability to make judgments about pretty much everything
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,583	| IOT153 |	Every second
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,119	| IOT153 |	The day and that's actually really
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,959	| IOT153 |	Yeah you know I would say
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:10,591	| IOT153 |	Cameras actually a pretty smart even before this came out and I took away a lot of the
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,383	| IOT153 |	Human judgments in terms of
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:15,199	| IOT153 |	Composition near things like laser autofocus
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:19,807	| IOT153 |	Multi-point Focus so it can determine what the actual subject of the photo is
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,831	| IOT153 |	And these are all
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,879	| IOT153 |	Technical things not a I type things
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,439	| IOT153 |	Now we're adding a AI
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:29,791	| IOT153 |	You know that point and shoot type features of many cameras today are so smart that
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:34,655	| IOT153 |	Arrival at completely manual camera so to me this is the next step is just
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,935	| IOT153 |	It's a very first step
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,751	| IOT153 |	Sure so Aesthetics
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:42,079	| IOT153 |	We've been using AI for Aesthetics for a while now
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,711	| IOT153 |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,479	| IOT153 |	It's a little freaky
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:52,319	| IOT153 |	Will probably talk more about this at other junctures
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:55,135	| IOT153 |	Let's move on to World Congress
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:58,207	| IOT153 |	The show of shows
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:02,303	| IOT153 |	Congress
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:02,815	| IOT153 |	Is it
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,863	| IOT153 |	It is in Barcelona
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:08,191	| IOT153 |	So and also we should say this weekend is also happening in Germany
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:12,543	| IOT153 |	Not seeing a ton of great news out from that but check out the newsletter if you want
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,079	| IOT153 |	Some when it comes out
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| IOT153 |	Back to Mobile World Congress
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:19,967	| IOT153 |	Qualcomm is doing couple things that I thought was interesting
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,271	| IOT153 |	One is the guy
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,807	| IOT153 |	They've taken their snapdragon
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,647	| IOT153 |	High-end phone chips and they created embedded versions
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,463	| IOT153 |	The important thing about these embedded versions
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:33,023	| IOT153 |	They're going to have support contracts for
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:38,143	| IOT153 |	5 years 7 years however they're going to be made for the embedded
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:45,055	| IOT153 |	This means that they're going to have a longer support life and be around for longer if you want to build them into your products
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:51,455	| IOT153 |	Yeah I need these are also very capable chips that the newest one is anyway because it's built on the Snapdragon 820 which
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:55,551	| IOT153 |	What was powering Flagship phones just two years ago
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:58,111	| IOT153 |	So it's not like a low-power type
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:02,719	| IOT153 |	Chip that you might see and say a smart plug or something this is going to have a lot of computing power
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,279	| IOT153 |	Relatively speaking front of to device
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:07,327	| IOT153 |	And computing power
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:10,143	| IOT153 |	All the connectivity that you would expect in basically
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,167	| IOT153 |	Longer support
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:16,799	| IOT153 |	Mostly lock support
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:22,943	| IOT153 |	They're going to standby some design considerations
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:30,367	| IOT153 |	Pokemon different types of pre-configured modules one is for LTE
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:33,183	| IOT153 |	Which is great because you can
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,463	| IOT153 |	Is a software development kit
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,255	| IOT153 |	And module
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:40,863	| IOT153 |	You buy it and then you seem connected to a variety of different LTE networks around the world which is just
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| IOT153 |	Easier
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,423	| IOT153 |	If you're trying to build something
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,727	| IOT153 |	And then they also did
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,519	| IOT153 |	Pre-configured multi radio
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| IOT153 |	Module 4
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,615	| IOT153 |	Alkota homes
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:53,151	| IOT153 |	Bluetooth Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,175	| IOT153 |	All kinds of fun stuff
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:58,015	| IOT153 |	You're actually two different versions of that one has Wifi one does not
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,319	| IOT153 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,599	| IOT153 |	When is super low power
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:07,743	| IOT153 |	The other thing that jumped out to me
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,047	| IOT153 |	These two that were talking about now actually
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,839	| IOT153 |	Come with pre-integrated support for homekit
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,935	| IOT153 |	I'm like electricity
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| IOT153 |	Yeah I'm still
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,007	| IOT153 |	I hear you
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| IOT153 |	Okay good for them
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,615	| IOT153 |	It's Not Dead
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,639	| IOT153 |	Yet it won't ever
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:25,919	| IOT153 |	I shouldn't say that
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,479	| IOT153 |	No AT&T
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,503	| IOT153 |	They are
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,551	| IOT153 |	Powering all the connectivity for
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,575	| IOT153 |	Caterpillar
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,599	| IOT153 |	Which is
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,647	| IOT153 |	They make all kinds of industrial and farming
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,415	| IOT153 |	Equipment
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:42,815	| IOT153 |	What school is they also had a very nice story and a SIM card announcement around
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:47,679	| IOT153 |	Google house in I pay attention to this because AT&T actually led the way with Kinect
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| IOT153 |	10 cars
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,007	| IOT153 |	They are by far the dominant
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,799	| IOT153 |	Provider for connectivity in
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:53,823	| IOT153 |	Vehicles
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:57,407	| IOT153 |	They've got in the US
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| IOT153 |	Or the cut
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:01,759	| IOT153 |	So they picked the right Market there
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:07,647	| IOT153 |	And that was good and I'm interested because now if they're really doubling down or focusing hard on medical
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,975	| IOT153 |	Then maybe it's actually time for medical 2
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:11,999	| IOT153 |	To be a thing
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:14,047	| IOT153 |	I feel like I've been saying this for a decade
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:21,727	| IOT153 |	You know it's funny because I remember - this goes back about 6-7 CSS ago
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,263	| IOT153 |	Seeing the
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:25,311	| IOT153 |	Little Pill cases that had
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,591	| IOT153 |	Connectivity in them
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,615	| IOT153 |	Adding wood
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:30,943	| IOT153 |	Take your medicine and then
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:35,039	| IOT153 |	It could determine if you didn't if you didn't it could use that connectivity to like
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:41,183	| IOT153 |	Reach out to a healthcare provider say hey this person I don't remember
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,511	| IOT153 |	There you go
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,047	| IOT153 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,095	| IOT153 |	It's time again for that I can talk with
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:52,191	| IOT153 |	Yeah well okay but see take the Qualcomm
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,007	| IOT153 |	LTE bass modules
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,079	| IOT153 |	And that's the kind of product a
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,615	| IOT153 |	Medical device manufacturer
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,895	| IOT153 |	Watch so red
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,431	| IOT153 |	High-powered snapdragon
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:05,247	| IOT153 |	You know capabilities with long-term
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,783	| IOT153 |	Ish support
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,319	| IOT153 |	And so
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,599	| IOT153 |	We could be seeing
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,623	| IOT153 |	What we need to make
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,903	| IOT153 |	That happened
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:14,207	| IOT153 |	Okay let's get to Bass news bits
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:20,351	| IOT153 |	Yeah so this kind of came out of nowhere just happened to be the person in charge basically out of
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| IOT153 |	MattyB
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:27,519	| IOT153 |	And also the person who created The Madam a prize which is a million-dollar prize to create a chatbot for
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,055	| IOT153 |	I can interact with a human
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,591	| IOT153 |	Buy sell for 20 minutes
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,639	| IOT153 |	His name is Ashwin Ram
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:38,271	| IOT153 |	And he has left Amazon is now the technical director of AI at
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:38,783	| IOT153 |	The Google
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:49,535	| IOT153 |	As a bonus to this Kevin has found a really interesting about conversation
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,839	| IOT153 |	Because you should read this conversation
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:57,983	| IOT153 |	Yeah these are the actual conversations that the people going for the Madame a present as a million-dollar prize by the way
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:02,079	| IOT153 |	We're trying to win so these are there people testing the chatbots
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:06,687	| IOT153 |	The conversations are sometimes scary but also very interesting
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:12,063	| IOT153 |	By the way question from one of our listeners who was
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,672	| IOT153 |	British spelling
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,208	| IOT153 |	We're talking about
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| IOT153 |	The Amazon echos brains
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:21,792	| IOT153 |	EXA
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,096	| IOT153 |	We try not to say it because we don't want to set up
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:29,472	| IOT153 |	One day we will have access to Amazon's medical High free
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:33,056	| IOT153 |	Mancino and said they play beforehand and maybe we can get our
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| IOT153 |	Our own versions bat
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:37,152	| IOT153 |	Can reverse engineering
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:37,920	| IOT153 |	Kevin
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,712	| IOT153 |	Get on that ass
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:40,992	| IOT153 |	Alright in other news
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,808	| IOT153 |	Dismiss a company that is selling Enterprise
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,832	| IOT153 |	Intelligent WiFi
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:51,744	| IOT153 |	Is raised 46 million dollars I really wanted to talk about this because missed is changed its
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:58,144	| IOT153 |	Marketing in the last probably 18 months or so and I think it's worth noting they started out actually touting
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,912	| IOT153 |	Virtual Beacon
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:03,264	| IOT153 |	Location basically so you could actually run their software on your access
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,056	| IOT153 |	What's your Wi-Fi access points
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,848	| IOT153 |	And use it software to
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,616	| IOT153 |	Place
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:11,200	| IOT153 |	Virtual Bluetooth beacons to interact with your employees phones
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:16,320	| IOT153 |	I thought it was awesome but apparently the market was not keen on this because now
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,368	| IOT153 |	They're touting themselves as
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,904	| IOT153 |	Intelligent Wi-Fi event
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,672	| IOT153 |	For the Enterprise
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| IOT153 |	Hyacinth
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:23,744	| IOT153 |	They're using very similar
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:27,328	| IOT153 |	Spectral analysis is how they're doing this capabilities
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,352	| IOT153 |	To say
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:31,680	| IOT153 |	What's wrong on your network how many devices are on your network
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,216	| IOT153 |	So they
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:37,056	| IOT153 |	A couple months ago or maybe a month ago announced that skill for Madam a that basically
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,872	| IOT153 |	You can say hey Madam a
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,408	| IOT153 |	Why is Bob smartphone
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| IOT153 |	Not on the network
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,712	| IOT153 |	And it would tell you
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:47,040	| IOT153 |	So how many iPhones do I have
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,904	| IOT153 |	And the answer is more than you think
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,952	| IOT153 |	Now you know
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:58,048	| IOT153 |	So I just thought this was an interesting shift because
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:03,168	| IOT153 |	One of the things Kevin and I were disappointed about last year
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,448	| IOT153 |	As a good context
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:06,240	| IOT153 |	And it sounds like location is still
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:13,152	| IOT153 |	Not yet in there no I actually like the whole virtual Beacon idea but
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:18,016	| IOT153 |	Honestly I'm not hearing a lot about beacons in general it's like that technology that's like
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:20,320	| IOT153 |	It's great it's just that nobody's using it
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,600	| IOT153 |	Yeah so
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,136	| IOT153 |	We'll keep an eye on it
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:25,696	| IOT153 |	Apparently
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,976	| IOT153 |	No one else has no one else has
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| IOT153 |	Welcome to our world
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,840	| IOT153 |	Merced news
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:33,888	| IOT153 |	Staples connect
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,168	| IOT153 |	Is finally dead
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:37,472	| IOT153 |	So Staples connect timeout
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,264	| IOT153 |	Cash in like 2013
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:45,152	| IOT153 |	I was really excited about it actually showed it one of our first conference has that we hosted his eye
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:45,664	| IOT153 |	Happy people
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,248	| IOT153 |	And it was a
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,784	| IOT153 |	Zana built it
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:55,392	| IOT153 |	And it was a back-end platform plus a hug that connected lots of different things including
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,208	| IOT153 |	Smoke detectors Lutron lights
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,512	| IOT153 |	All kinds of other products
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,304	| IOT153 |	Nobody really bought it
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:05,888	| IOT153 |	It was actually one of the best and well design platforms out there especially for normal people
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,680	| IOT153 |	And they stop supporting it
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,472	| IOT153 |	You know when Zara Flint to ring
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:13,056	| IOT153 |	Staples decided to shut it down and now
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,568	| IOT153 |	It's probably
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:20,480	| IOT153 |	You can't pronounce the service at all I don't think the problem was the platform because you said it was one of the better ones around it
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,248	| IOT153 |	What's the time
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:24,320	| IOT153 |	Ain't nothing against Staples but I don't know if that was the right
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| IOT153 |	Place to sell it
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,512	| IOT153 |	Here's a good thing
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:36,864	| IOT153 |	The fibaro smart plug is shipping this is Kevin really likes
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:39,936	| IOT153 |	You like it you tell
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:46,592	| IOT153 |	Sure sure I saw it at CVS and shared a picture on her Instagram page talking to you Attleboro folks about it
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:49,152	| IOT153 |	So it's you know it's your typical smart plug
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,040	| IOT153 |	Just takes up one Outlet you don't obviously it itself isn't outlet but it doesn't cover up the second one which is nice
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:58,112	| IOT153 |	Have a really nice LED ring around it and that is
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:01,440	| IOT153 |	Kind of cool because you can change the color of it you can use it as a night light
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:04,768	| IOT153 |	But you can also use it to determine how much power is coming
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,304	| IOT153 |	Through the outlet in a given time
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,120	| IOT153 |	$50
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:14,496	| IOT153 |	It's a Z-Wave Outlet if you want to spend an extra ten bucks and I probably would because this is cool
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,824	| IOT153 |	It has a USB port to it as well so you can charge something
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:22,432	| IOT153 |	And then you can monitor both the output of the outlet itself as well as the USB output
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,736	| IOT153 |	Pretty
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,088	| IOT153 |	Other news
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,648	| IOT153 |	Bixby speaker
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| IOT153 |	Push to the SEC
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,536	| IOT153 |	Yeah they were hoping to do it in the first half of the year and then it
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:43,936	| IOT153 |	NWC earlier this week they announced their Galaxy S9 S9 plus and of course it's got the dedicated
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,520	| IOT153 |	Bixby button so they're Bixby smart speaker isn't quite ready
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:52,640	| IOT153 |	They're talking about approving Bixby calling a Bixby 2.0 at least internally
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:58,016	| IOT153 |	And I have a feeling that's why the smart speaker itself is pushed out because I want to improve the
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:01,344	| IOT153 |	Voice Assistant something that other companies
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,416	| IOT153 |	Don't you want to have a
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:08,256	| IOT153 |	You would want to have a $350 speaker that's not too smart
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,280	| IOT153 |	Just saying
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,048	| IOT153 |	There we go
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,816	| IOT153 |	All right
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,584	| IOT153 |	Well
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,352	| IOT153 |	I
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:18,752	| IOT153 |	Also I meant with her I meant I was at Bosch connected world this weekend I'm not going to talk too much about it cuz they'll be more of this in
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,520	| IOT153 |	The newsletter
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:23,872	| IOT153 |	It's cold I think the big trend for Enterprise and Industrial iot
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:28,224	| IOT153 |	Where is last year we focused a lot on security and proof of Concepts
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:34,624	| IOT153 |	I think this year we're going to focus more on culture and making these things actually work with your staff and how to get your staff and
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,416	| IOT153 |	Employees on board with it and training
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,952	| IOT153 |	That's kind of
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:42,560	| IOT153 |	One day take away the other big takeaway is we're going to see a lot more competition
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,376	| IOT153 |	As people build services so
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:49,728	| IOT153 |	We'll talk about it and future shows but basically I talked to bear
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,800	| IOT153 |	Which is both a drug company and make sex
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,568	| IOT153 |	Cultural supplies
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:58,176	| IOT153 |	And they are trying to do agriculture as a service so
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,712	| IOT153 |	Growing plants as a service
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,248	| IOT153 |	And they're building a
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,320	| IOT153 |	Connected weed killing machine that
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,368	| IOT153 |	Basically identifies weeds and kills them
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:11,232	| IOT153 |	It sounds like what John Deere bought when it bought a company called Blue River Technologies last year
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,768	| IOT153 |	That's because it is
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,792	| IOT153 |	Exactly the same concept
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:17,632	| IOT153 |	What's interesting to me is both companies used to work
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:22,240	| IOT153 |	As parts of the supply chain so John Deere sold equipment to Farmers
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:31,200	| IOT153 |	What's happening is they're both trying to offer agriculture yields as a service which means they're both going
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:31,712	| IOT153 |	After the same
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,736	| IOT153 |	Market now
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:37,088	| IOT153 |	And we're going to see this this is just one example but we're going to see this play out
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,368	| IOT153 |	Again and again and again
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,648	| IOT153 |	With iot
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,416	| IOT153 |	So
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,720	| IOT153 |	Keep your eyes peeled for that it's going to be fun
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,744	| IOT153 |	And now it's time for
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:49,120	| IOT153 |	The iot podcast listener hotline

EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,024	| IOT153 |	Hi Stacy and Kevin
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:20,608	| IOT153 |	My name is Christopher and I'm calling you from Broken Arrow Oklahoma
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:21,888	| IOT153 |	I was wondering
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:28,288	| IOT153 |	Good idea to segment all of your iot traffic in your home on to a specific SSID on your router
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,848	| IOT153 |	Segregating it from your computers
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,920	| IOT153 |	Wifi-connected TV devices
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:40,320	| IOT153 |	I'm thinking of segmenting at off onto a guest network from a security perspective but I don't want to lose functionality and
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:43,648	| IOT153 |	I think so I haven't started setting up smart home devices yet
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,672	| IOT153 |	But I plan to do so
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,696	| IOT153 |	In the near future
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:49,536	| IOT153 |	We are an apple household so my preference would be to use homekit
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:52,352	| IOT153 |	I have a router that can handle multiple guest Networks
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:57,472	| IOT153 |	So I can do this and still have a guest network available for my kids friends to use when they come over
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,752	| IOT153 |	I would love to hear your thoughts
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,056	| IOT153 |	Oh
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:03,872	| IOT153 |	Christopher this is such a good idea
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:05,152	| IOT153 |	It's so good
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:05,920	| IOT153 |	And
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:08,224	| IOT153 |	I'm very concerned that you're going to get frustrated
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,016	| IOT153 |	Which is exactly what happened to me
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,040	| IOT153 |	I decided to try to
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:17,440	| IOT153 |	You can do this in setting it up on a guest Network and ability to have multiple guest Networks
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:20,256	| IOT153 |	Great so the challenge comes in
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,536	| IOT153 |	When you want your
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,816	| IOT153 |	Phone2action
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,096	| IOT153 |	Sni4 geofencing
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:24,864	| IOT153 |	If you don't
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,400	| IOT153 |	Care about things like that
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,960	| IOT153 |	You actually should be
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:35,360	| IOT153 |	Okay cuz the challenges your phone's going to come in and connect to your regular Network as opposed to your
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,128	| IOT153 |	Gesnetwork
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:39,456	| IOT153 |	And in a lot of cases that can be a trigger for events to have
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,736	| IOT153 |	It's not always a tree
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,832	| IOT153 |	You will quickly find out what devices use it as a trigger
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:48,160	| IOT153 |	But if you're not Super King
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,768	| IOT153 |	It is actually possible and fairly easy to do
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:57,632	| IOT153 |	The challenges you won't encounter the hiccups until you
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:00,192	| IOT153 |	Get a particular device and I'm
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,984	| IOT153 |	Sorry to be so vague
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:05,312	| IOT153 |	I remember you went through the Senate
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,104	| IOT153 |	It did present some little
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:13,504	| IOT153 |	Challenges you know I I wonder about will I get my notifications can I still control all my devices from the phone and all that is around
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:19,648	| IOT153 |	Different networks that It's Tricky It's Tricky
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,696	| IOT153 |	So they were on the guest Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:25,280	| IOT153 |	Which basically turn them into when I was in my home
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,816	| IOT153 |	On my phone instead of being
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:33,728	| IOT153 |	They're my phone read it in the video doorbell extra seconds
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,496	| IOT153 |	Right
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,032	| IOT153 |	Those are the kind of things where
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,336	| IOT153 |	Didn't have the time
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:42,944	| IOT153 |	Which could be fun is if you have like the nest doorbell and it ties into your
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,992	| IOT153 |	Google home thing
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:48,576	| IOT153 |	Or your Android Television then you might actually get
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:52,416	| IOT153 |	Those are all in the same local network so it's going to bypass your phone anyway
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:55,232	| IOT153 |	If that makes sense so that actually might
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,024	| IOT153 |	Be a way to solve for some of that wood
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:57,536	| IOT153 |	Additionally
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:31:04,448	| IOT153 |	Yeah you're going to have to really think about this to see which products talk to each other and how you want to be notified
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:08,800	| IOT153 |	Use these products I'm in my Android TV does get information from my nest
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,592	| IOT153 |	Camera they are on the same network
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:14,688	| IOT153 |	I don't think it would work if they're on different Networks
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:19,552	| IOT153 |	Right but the key is if you have your computers and phones in the phones are really
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,064	| IOT153 |	The question
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:26,464	| IOT153 |	When I have Spotify playing on my phone actually
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:30,816	| IOT153 |	Can see all of my Sonos has in my Amazon echos and my Google homes
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:34,656	| IOT153 |	It can actually cast essentially to the I know it's not casting
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,192	| IOT153 |	Another ecosystem
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:36,960	| IOT153 |	But whatever
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,032	| IOT153 |	If it sees all those and I can just cast it to that
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,824	| IOT153 |	Which I couldn't if I was on a different
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,152	| IOT153 |	So again it's very huge case-specific
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:52,064	| IOT153 |	I say give it a whirl the worst is going to happen is you're going to have a couple devices you're going to have to go through those set of processes
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:52,832	| IOT153 |	Change the SSID
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,624	| IOT153 |	Which you know is it fun
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:56,672	| IOT153 |	It's not the end of the world
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,208	| IOT153 |	Yeah and I think
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,000	| IOT153 |	It's a question of balancing
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:02,048	| IOT153 |	Security vs. convenience
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:07,680	| IOT153 |	Really can you got it that's a personal decision at that point I pretty much have everything on the same network but I do I have
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,728	| IOT153 |	Security concerns so that I can start late
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,032	| IOT153 |	Recognize the importance of Christopher's questionnaire
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,568	| IOT153 |	Yes we are not
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,080	| IOT153 |	It all denigrating
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:20,992	| IOT153 |	New we can have the ability to hop onto
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:22,016	| IOT153 |	Networks
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,040	| IOT153 |	Not sure how that would work
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,088	| IOT153 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,672	| IOT153 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:29,952	| IOT153 |	Well
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:32,256	| IOT153 |	Christopher excellent question remember

EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,608	| IOT153 |	Probably aware of what I owed is
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:13,888	| IOT153 |	Quickly Dominos
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,424	| IOT153 |	Oops
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:18,496	| IOT153 |	Jeff Corso is basically different
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,008	| IOT153 |	Improvement
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,616	| IOT153 |	Stupid technology
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,408	| IOT153 |	And the main focus of an IRA
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:27,456	| IOT153 |	3D unleash the full potential
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,272	| IOT153 |	But first
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,296	| IOT153 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:34,624	| IOT153 |	Everybody who's familiar with black jeans and things like
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| IOT153 |	Pointing at cereal
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:36,672	| IOT153 |	You guys are
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:37,696	| IOT153 |	Little bit different because your text
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:39,488	| IOT153 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,888	| IOT153 |	We are
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,168	| IOT153 |	Technologist
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:47,680	| IOT153 |	Realized
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:54,592	| IOT153 |	Issues we have issues
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,128	| IOT153 |	We have to minor illegal
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,176	| IOT153 |	It is really not helping us
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,832	| IOT153 |	Beaufort improve 2 blocks any soft
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,392	| IOT153 |	3D make a scalable and bring it to Industry
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,416	| IOT153 |	N2 production
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:11,232	| IOT153 |	When is we we looked at the Block
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:15,328	| IOT153 |	It shouldn't just be like the sequential change
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,632	| IOT153 |	What are some
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,656	| IOT153 |	Ways to achieve
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,984	| IOT153 |	What is consensus of what is true and what is not true
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:23,264	| IOT153 |	An executive
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:25,056	| IOT153 |	Dad we done came up with this Dakar
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,808	| IOT153 |	Know every
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:37,344	| IOT153 |	Participant in an effort to execute
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,160	| IOT153 |	Participate in his validation
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:43,232	| IOT153 |	And Confirmation Transaction what is music
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,000	| IOT153 |	Iota
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,792	| IOT153 |	When you executed for Zaxby's
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:47,072	| IOT153 |	To confirm to transaction
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:47,840	| IOT153 |	History
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,376	| IOT153 |	Blue Datsun two transaction
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,144	| IOT153 |	Increasing
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,496	| IOT153 |	1
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:56,544	| IOT153 |	You have to pay no transaction fees
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:58,336	| IOT153 |	What is miso
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:01,152	| IOT153 |	That transaction
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:03,456	| IOT153 |	Because now we can truly do micropayments but
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,272	| IOT153 |	Scalability issue
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,600	| IOT153 |	Limited to the block sizes
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:12,160	| IOT153 |	To the Block in troubles what is real
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:16,512	| IOT153 |	Okay so we're going to bring some of that down because with
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:19,840	| IOT153 |	Bitcoin and other traditional blockchain Technologies
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:22,400	| IOT153 |	The more information you have the
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,168	| IOT153 |	Longer it takes
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,472	| IOT153 |	How are you need to actually valid
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:30,592	| IOT153 |	Cheer
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:34,944	| IOT153 |	I am saying hey if I wanted validate something I also
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,712	| IOT153 |	Scepter promise
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,736	| IOT153 |	We're actually validate
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:38,016	| IOT153 |	Behind me
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,040	| IOT153 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:40,320	| IOT153 |	Right exactly
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| IOT153 |	So we can look at this
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,416	| IOT153 |	Nothing
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,696	| IOT153 |	And everything is stopped
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:53,888	| IOT153 |	And the beautiful thing about I already said we are no longer limited to a single pipe
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| IOT153 |	Midas a new architecture
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,264	| IOT153 |	And the main reason why are you
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:01,568	| IOT153 |	Horizontally
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,616	| IOT153 |	What is means that now is
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:14,624	| IOT153 |	Okay now I keep reading that the number of iota's out there
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,648	| IOT153 |	Have been set
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,696	| IOT153 |	And so I'm trying to understand
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,744	| IOT153 |	It works with the
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,256	| IOT153 |	Validation
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:22,816	| IOT153 |	Behind us in so I think there is
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,840	| IOT153 |	There's a mix of
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:26,144	| IOT153 |	What Iota supposed to be doing and
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:27,424	| IOT153 |	Cryptocurrency world
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:30,752	| IOT153 |	It's a little confusing for me
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,848	| IOT153 |	Reading for anyone
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:36,128	| IOT153 |	Participate
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,640	| IOT153 |	Dish Network
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:39,456	| IOT153 |	What is osmosis
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,992	| IOT153 |	Currency that is intrinsic
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,016	| IOT153 |	What is protocol
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:43,296	| IOT153 |	Bitcoin today
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:45,600	| IOT153 |	For you to be able to transfer
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:49,440	| IOT153 |	But the thing is now the beautiful thing about this that you can utilize
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,048	| IOT153 |	True things
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,608	| IOT153 |	Is cryptocurrency dead
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,960	| IOT153 |	And if it contains data
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,984	| IOT153 |	Use case that comes out of that
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:12,224	| IOT153 |	Different sentence structures
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,784	| IOT153 |	So the children was just a way for you guys to raise money
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,320	| IOT153 |	Notes
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,112	| IOT153 |	Exit right
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| IOT153 |	The token for us
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:26,560	| IOT153 |	Cuz all vision is this machine economy and what is machine economies now
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,328	| IOT153 |	Machine
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,096	| IOT153 |	Future
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:28,864	| IOT153 |	To hold
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,960	| IOT153 |	But the thing is now when
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:34,496	| IOT153 |	He comes to this machine
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,568	| IOT153 |	Participate
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,336	| IOT153 |	Can contribute
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,360	| IOT153 |	Reconstruct
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,128	| IOT153 |	Earning money by
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,944	| IOT153 |	Capitation to a car dancing
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:43,968	| IOT153 |	Or something like that
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,016	| IOT153 |	Meetup cryptocurrency
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:51,136	| IOT153 |	There's no censorship
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,160	| IOT153 |	Is nobody controlling it
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,720	| IOT153 |	Undisputed peer-to-peer pushing machine
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,280	| IOT153 |	But this gets into a deeper issue
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:59,072	| IOT153 |	Almost all blotchy
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:00,608	| IOT153 |	Chains
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,656	| IOT153 |	Effort out there which is
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:04,192	| IOT153 |	Are correlated so strong
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,008	| IOT153 |	The people are focused on the value
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,312	| IOT153 |	You're choking as opposed to what
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:09,824	| IOT153 |	You can do
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:12,128	| IOT153 |	Entire blocks

EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,600	| IOT153 |	This is Teresa
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,928	| IOT153 |	What is technology
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,304	| IOT153 |	Fundamental issues in society
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:32,608	| IOT153 |	What's Sophia should we trust
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,632	| IOT153 |	What's the name of new business
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,472	| IOT153 |	At this point
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,240	| IOT153 |	To Pakistan
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:39,008	| IOT153 |	Circulation
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:40,800	| IOT153 |	Sick of it
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:44,128	| IOT153 |	Which is why we're really focused on his pregnant
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,920	| IOT153 |	We want to bring a Yoda ink
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:46,688	| IOT153 |	Industry
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,224	| IOT153 |	Focus more on
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:50,016	| IOT153 |	Concept

EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:55,904	| IOT153 |	Concrete work on a product
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:56,928	| IOT153 |	Roadmap and strategy
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,720	| IOT153 |	So we can really bring this
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:39:59,488	| IOT153 |	Angel production
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:03,328	| IOT153 |	Purchase are useless if there's no
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,632	| IOT153 |	That is true
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:09,472	| IOT153 |	Need something to allow machines to talk to each other and transact
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,752	| IOT153 |	At least information is not act
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:14,080	| IOT153 |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:17,920	| IOT153 |	Customers your users are looking
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,528	| IOT153 |	And the first ball is over the air updates

EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:08,831	| IOT153 |	That makes sense

EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:27,007	| IOT153 |	You think so we get there
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:27,775	| IOT153 |	What's a long time to move
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:29,567	| IOT153 |	Models
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:33,407	| IOT153 |	For software for example to subscription models and now
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:36,223	| IOT153 |	What you're proposing / resource unit is even more extreme
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:39,551	| IOT153 |	The question is
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,903	| IOT153 |	Look at the cryptocurrency song
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:44,671	| IOT153 |	Because
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:46,719	| IOT153 |	The biggest problem we have today's we are not
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:53,887	| IOT153 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,423	| IOT153 |	Adoption
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,215	| IOT153 |	Difficult Odyssey is
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:02,335	| IOT153 |	I think of some different solution how we can actually anybody's mic
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,663	| IOT153 |	IndyCar
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:13,087	| IOT153 |	Chico
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,927	| IOT153 |	What's even more important that is it to rethink about what
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,951	| IOT153 |	In which areas of
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,975	| IOT153 |	Everybody's first adoption
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,279	| IOT153 |	Payments
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:24,095	| IOT153 |	When it comes to
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:25,887	| IOT153 |	Computation
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,703	| IOT153 |	Asian market places
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,983	| IOT153 |	That's where we going to see the person
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,543	| IOT153 |	I've been covering datamark
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:33,567	| IOT153 |	Play Systems Lake

EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:40,991	| IOT153 |	And they never happy
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:44,319	| IOT153 |	At first it was an infrastructure issue
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,951	| IOT153 |	Antitrust issue
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,095	| IOT153 |	The marketplace
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,655	| IOT153 |	Don't actually want to contribute their data
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,959	| IOT153 |	Main difficulty becomes.
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:02,495	| IOT153 |	What is date of birth
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:04,031	| IOT153 |	Bicycle
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,871	| IOT153 |	And nobody has been able to solve
EDL	00:46:07,871	00:46:09,663	| IOT153 |	Subscription services
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:14,783	| IOT153 |	But that is not really an issue for potential
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:17,855	| IOT153 |	I saw think now everything is kind of
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:18,367	| IOT153 |	Coming together right
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,671	| IOT153 |	2008

EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:30,655	| IOT153 |	On the market
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,751	| IOT153 |	Different Technologies
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:37,055	| IOT153 |	PEMDAS convergence now
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,079	| IOT153 |	I do think that
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:40,639	| IOT153 |	Now is the right time for a market-based establish yourself
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,663	| IOT153 |	But the difficulty August
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:43,199	| IOT153 |	How do you make a pot
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:44,735	| IOT153 |	Entire Industries to adopt

EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,231	| IOT153 |	And that's why
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:57,023	| IOT153 |	In my opinion we as a non-profit
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:57,791	| IOT153 |	Supination
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:59,071	| IOT153 |	With no electric incentive other than
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,191	| IOT153 |	Foster and ocean Marketplace
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:04,703	| IOT153 |	Bring it to the mall
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:07,263	| IOT153 |	As long as it's open source and we have
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,359	| IOT153 |	I do think the Gnostic
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:12,639	| IOT153 |	What about
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:14,175	| IOT153 |	Privacy that's been
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:15,967	| IOT153 |	Corporations against

EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:23,391	| IOT153 |	Because it's so transparent
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,183	| IOT153 |	We have some
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:26,975	| IOT153 |	Wonders
