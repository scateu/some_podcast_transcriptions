EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:49,920	| IOT122 |	After we hear from
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:51,456	| IOT122 |	Our sponsor this week
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:51,968	| IOT122 |	Schlage
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:52,992	| IOT122 |	Now
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:56,064	| IOT122 |	Let's get the show started with a message from another one of our sponsor
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:01:04,000	| IOT122 |	Smart Kitchen Summit is the only event of his kind to tackle the future of food cookie
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:08,352	| IOT122 |	And the kitchen with decision-makers and disruptors across the food

EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:20,640	| IOT122 |	Will be held at Benaroya Hall in Seattle
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,432	| IOT122 |	On October 10th at 11
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:26,272	| IOT122 |	My listeners get to take 25% off of any ticket type with the code
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:29,600	| IOT122 |	Stacey Stacey
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,368	| IOT122 |	Don't wait
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:34,208	| IOT122 |	Because early bird ticket pricing ends July 31st
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:36,512	| IOT122 |	An added bonus
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:37,792	| IOT122 |	Or not I don't know
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:38,816	| IOT122 |	I'll be there
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,840	| IOT122 |	All right
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:40,864	| IOT122 |	Is it a bonus
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,888	| IOT122 |	That's a bonus
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,168	| IOT122 |	Kevin's hang out with me in person
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,216	| IOT122 |	It's a bonus people trust me
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:47,008	| IOT122 |	So okay
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,800	| IOT122 |	I am actually in Seattle this week
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:49,312	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,336	| IOT122 |	It's nice up here
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,872	| IOT122 |	Maybe one day the show
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,152	| IOT122 |	All the time
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:57,248	| IOT122 |	So let's get started with
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:00,064	| IOT122 |	Embedded RFID tags because I don't know
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:08,000	| IOT122 |	Kevin yes or no yes or no so so that the news isn't that a company is
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,768	| IOT122 |	Implanting
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:12,608	| IOT122 |	Microchips and some of its employees little RFID tags
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,632	| IOT122 |	They're certainly not the first
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:16,704	| IOT122 |	People to have these I've seen for a couple years now people
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:22,336	| IOT122 |	Actually putting a little RFID chips in the webbing between their thumb and their
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,128	| IOT122 |	A palm in their hand
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,664	| IOT122 |	These are just they're doing in cells
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:31,296	| IOT122 |	Albert is actually employee a three Square Market is the name of the company in Wisconsin
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,832	| IOT122 |	About 50 employees are
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,416	| IOT122 |	Can you get implanted with RFID tags and why are they doing that
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:41,536	| IOT122 |	So it's easier to buy snacks and things from kiosks there at the
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,864	| IOT122 |	Office without using a credit card cash or smartphone
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:45,888	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:51,520	| IOT122 |	A lot of people read this and say exactly what you did say say it's creepy because it's so they're going to know everything
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:56,640	| IOT122 |	There's no tracking your GPS or like that so I don't know how creepy it really is
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,920	| IOT122 |	Why do you say it's creepy
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,992	| IOT122 |	PÃ©kin planting things in your body to buy
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,784	| IOT122 |	Snickers bars is
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,088	| IOT122 |	A step too far now we should clarify this
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| IOT122 |	Voluntary
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,904	| IOT122 |	We should also clarify that
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:14,560	| IOT122 |	For the most part you have to actually get pretty close to it a reader that reads RR
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,680	| IOT122 |	Yes you have this thing in your body
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,472	| IOT122 |	But you have to get
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:21,984	| IOT122 |	Usually within a
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,568	| IOT122 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:29,664	| IOT122 |	A couple inches
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,712	| IOT122 |	There's passive and active
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| IOT122 |	Enticing
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| IOT122 |	The Pacifier
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:39,136	| IOT122 |	I would imagine that they are everything to keep them as small as possible I would never agree with you
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:39,648	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| IOT122 |	If you don't eat just
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:45,536	| IOT122 |	But I've been to it so Facebook you know that they've had these for a while you can
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,328	| IOT122 |	They have vending machines full of like
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,888	| IOT122 |	All kinds of stuff and you just input your employer code
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,936	| IOT122 |	You get your thing
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,216	| IOT122 |	So that's also cashless
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,544	| IOT122 |	Facebook pay pay for it but it other places you could
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,312	| IOT122 |	Tie it to someone
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:57,824	| IOT122 |	Paycheck
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,992	| IOT122 |	If there's obviously there are alternatives to this
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:08,576	| IOT122 |	You know you could use your smartphone and ID badge watch Etc
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:12,672	| IOT122 |	I thought about doing this myself a couple years back and to test it
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,512	| IOT122 |	I don't know if you remember this but I'm going to say back in 20
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,047	| IOT122 |	12 or so
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,143	| IOT122 |	Samsung was selling programmable NFC stickers
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| IOT122 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:30,079	| IOT122 |	So I said before I put something in my body let me put something on my body cuz it at that time there was no
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,103	| IOT122 |	NFC
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,175	| IOT122 |	Smart watches and things like that it was we knew they were coming
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,967	| IOT122 |	Am I going to stick this on my
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:40,063	| IOT122 |	On the back of my hand for a couple days I put an NFC Reader in my
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:46,719	| IOT122 |	Mudroom door to get in the house when I came in I would just swipe my hand over the reader and all the lights would come on so I was doing some kind of automation
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,047	| IOT122 |	If I did this myself
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,583	| IOT122 |	I don't see that there's any
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,631	| IOT122 |	Creepy Factor new Big Brother Factor but
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:58,495	| IOT122 |	I can understand people not wanting a company into an item I would not want to companies do that either
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:02,079	| IOT122 |	I think we're getting to the point now where you can program these things
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| IOT122 |	Easily
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,663	| IOT122 |	And you could actually do this yourself and not
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,223	| IOT122 |	And you have control I guess that's really what it comes down to
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,807	| IOT122 |	Because it comes it comes down to it being voluntary
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,391	| IOT122 |	Implicit question with a poises does it some point it become
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| IOT122 |	Coercive
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,207	| IOT122 |	Like if you were the only person who is like
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,999	| IOT122 |	Yeah you know what I don't want
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,327	| IOT122 |	That's a pretty picture
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| IOT122 |	Invasive
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,911	| IOT122 |	Crispy definition
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,751	| IOT122 |	That's where I am
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,847	| IOT122 |	I have this feels like a slippery slope that we're going down
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:40,223	| IOT122 |	What if it was you and I'm not saying that you would do this but what if you said you would if you had total
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,039	| IOT122 |	Control over it so you could program it to your door locks and
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,087	| IOT122 |	Your bank accounts
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:45,599	| IOT122 |	Send
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:50,207	| IOT122 |	Maybe three API through a place that you worked out and they would just allow
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,975	| IOT122 |	You did
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,255	| IOT122 |	No enter in
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,279	| IOT122 |	Country security with
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,071	| IOT122 |	You had control
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:06:01,727	| IOT122 |	That feels like a step too far just in turkey oven if I had control because I'm not sure that I would have control and then they become
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,007	| IOT122 |	What are some
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,823	| IOT122 |	You know tapped into that API
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,847	| IOT122 |	Pulling out information
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:10,431	| IOT122 |	Are there mechanisms to change that without having to
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,223	| IOT122 |	Remove the implant and pop another
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| IOT122 |	Oh you can you can reprogram these things
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,599	| IOT122 |	I reprogram it with my phone
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,111	| IOT122 |	Mini
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:25,023	| IOT122 |	Yeah you just tell the program what you want to do what you want the NFC tag to represent
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,559	| IOT122 |	I just tap it and it reprogrammed
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,863	| IOT122 |	Probably
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,911	| IOT122 |	It's not give me the instructions
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,191	| IOT122 |	Instructions
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,703	| IOT122 |	But it's
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,239	| IOT122 |	Is it's kind of
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,031	| IOT122 |	Caring for lack of a better word
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,055	| IOT122 |	And can they be spoofed
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:40,127	| IOT122 |	Magic anything can be smooth
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,175	| IOT122 |	10 min but I don't think it would be easy
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:46,271	| IOT122 |	These are the questions that I would want before I post
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| IOT122 |	Like
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,599	| IOT122 |	There's also you know how long do electronics
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:55,231	| IOT122 |	Nothing to deserve because they're encased in some kind of capsule
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,279	| IOT122 |	That's about the size of a grain of rice
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,047	| IOT122 |	Pink
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,327	| IOT122 |	But they're good for about 10 years
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,375	| IOT122 |	So it's like a microchip in a dog
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,959	| IOT122 |	Is it okay to do to the dog
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,751	| IOT122 |	Really really
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,055	| IOT122 |	You know I will
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,335	| IOT122 |	Alright so
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,383	| IOT122 |	This is happening you guys
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,175	| IOT122 |	And if you think this is awesome
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,247	| IOT122 |	Then you know there's a company in Wisconsin plus you
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| IOT122 |	Cheese curds
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,039	| IOT122 |	Which
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,575	| IOT122 |	Apparently our delicious
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:23,391	| IOT122 |	Moving right along into
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,671	| IOT122 |	Possibly
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,207	| IOT122 |	Google is equal to
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,743	| IOT122 |	Let's talk about the Roomba
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,047	| IOT122 |	I was saying if you thought poop
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,607	| IOT122 |	Apocalypse was bad you should see Matt gaetz
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,399	| IOT122 |	But then Kevin and I discussed how hard it was
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| IOT122 |	Say that words
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:39,007	| IOT122 |	Remember how rubos were taking people's apparently their pets
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,031	| IOT122 |	Poop on the carpet
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:42,847	| IOT122 |	Everywhere I never was a guy
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| IOT122 |	Why robots
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,127	| IOT122 |	The comedy behind
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,663	| IOT122 |	Is that again
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| IOT122 |	Bad press
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,223	| IOT122 |	This time about
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,551	| IOT122 |	Liru bizarre it's the 900 in
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,831	| IOT122 |	80 I believe
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,903	| IOT122 |	Ribeye so the ones with Wi-Fi the 980
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| IOT122 |	Evolution 2015
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| IOT122 |	Maps your home
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,303	| IOT122 |	And apparently according to the terms of service
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,375	| IOT122 |	You can actually send that mapping data
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,703	| IOT122 |	And people are like
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,215	| IOT122 |	We don't like this
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,799	| IOT122 |	Well yeah I mean I don't
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:17,663	| IOT122 |	Biscuits Pakistani talk about a week or two ago consumer awareness and and maybe putting
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:22,015	| IOT122 |	And very clear print on the packaging of these things what happens to the data what are you
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,063	| IOT122 |	I know there's that you learned all that but
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,599	| IOT122 |	People don't read that and it's just
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,135	| IOT122 |	Not simple to read
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,975	| IOT122 |	There's got to be a better way to communicate it
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:34,047	| IOT122 |	Because if you agree to it then room is doing there within their bounds
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,863	| IOT122 |	Yes and
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,399	| IOT122 |	Here's again like
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT122 |	Like you said
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,679	| IOT122 |	We talked about
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| IOT122 |	Companies that want
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,799	| IOT122 |	To be proactive about this are going to do better
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,335	| IOT122 |	Because right now everyone is
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,615	| IOT122 |	Freaking out
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:50,175	| IOT122 |	Roomba said in that it was
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,991	| IOT122 |	Committed to the absolute privacy of their customer related data
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| IOT122 |	They can use
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,063	| IOT122 |	The rainbow without connecting it
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:00,671	| IOT122 |	Go to the internet and you can opt out of sending that data to the cloud through switch on the mobile app
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:07,583	| IOT122 |	The company also said that no data is sold to third parties no data will be shared with third parties without informed consent
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,351	| IOT122 |	Of our customer
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:09,887	| IOT122 |	Zoe
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,423	| IOT122 |	I read
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:17,823	| IOT122 |	About half of the hughleys in terms of service in terms of service in the privacy policy or two different
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| IOT122 |	Document
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,175	| IOT122 |	I read those in about half of my
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,479	| IOT122 |	Barely Legal
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,759	| IOT122 |	These are not things that
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,527	| IOT122 |	Explain stuff
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,039	| IOT122 |	Very clearly
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,831	| IOT122 |	I read a lot of them so I
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,111	| IOT122 |	Have a sense
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,623	| IOT122 |	What's me
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,719	| IOT122 |	Done but no one reads the terms of service on their back
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,511	| IOT122 |	Just like I didn't read the terms
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,279	| IOT122 |	Service that appeared
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,303	| IOT122 |	My oven
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| IOT122 |	We don't have time for that
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:47,263	| IOT122 |	It's not consumer-friendly it's not that day it's all legally isn't and what time did you need to know what you're looking for
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:48,543	| IOT122 |	I think
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,615	| IOT122 |	Before you understand it and it's just not easy
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,175	| IOT122 |	Absent regulation which I do think we need
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| IOT122 |	We need
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:59,039	| IOT122 |	Friendly ways to say hey
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,319	| IOT122 |	Here's how to opt-out
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,367	| IOT122 |	And it should be like
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,415	| IOT122 |	Possibly like
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:08,511	| IOT122 |	Permissions on like an Android app for an iPhone app with a like this company is trying to
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,535	| IOT122 |	Is asking for access
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| IOT122 |	Could be something as simple as
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,375	| IOT122 |	The Roomba
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,399	| IOT122 |	Wants to
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:14,911	| IOT122 |	Cher
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:18,751	| IOT122 |	So this is what I think we need to get to
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,775	| IOT122 |	Otherwise
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,055	| IOT122 |	People are not like
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,335	| IOT122 |	I guarantee like
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| IOT122 |	People read this were like
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| IOT122 |	And if you already did
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,783	| IOT122 |	You're like okay well I'm going to turn that off
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| IOT122 |	No data for you
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,367	| IOT122 |	In a sense that the problem because room is using
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:38,207	| IOT122 |	You said that mapping data to the cloud so that I could get better
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| IOT122 |	Right
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,279	| IOT122 |	And so that's why
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,327	| IOT122 |	Topic need to be like
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,375	| IOT122 |	Transparent about was happy
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,655	| IOT122 |	Not transparent
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:49,471	| IOT122 |	Phuket legalese for transparency
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| IOT122 |	Hey we're going to do this with your data
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:57,151	| IOT122 |	Yeah it's a tricky because a lot of these products you provide better Services when they crowdsource the data that they all cap
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,223	| IOT122 |	Right they can make the devices smarter and
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,807	| IOT122 |	Optimize and so on on the flipside people have to have a
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:07,135	| IOT122 |	Clear wedge opt-in or opt-out early early on
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:09,183	| IOT122 |	I need to know what they're opting in or out to
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| IOT122 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,511	| IOT122 |	That's rude
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:13,791	| IOT122 |	So what's worse
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,095	| IOT122 |	Sharing your spreading your dog's paw
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,191	| IOT122 |	I'm sure for some people exposed
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,263	| IOT122 |	All right
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,543	| IOT122 |	Let's see August
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,079	| IOT122 |	B-connected door lock maker
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,407	| IOT122 |	About 25 million dollars in additional
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:29,919	| IOT122 |	Funding
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,479	| IOT122 |	This is on top of
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,015	| IOT122 |	Around the Rays last year
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,807	| IOT122 |	Here is
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,087	| IOT122 |	They've actually launched
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| IOT122 |	A bunch of products
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,647	| IOT122 |	They launched a prologue
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,207	| IOT122 |	A new version of their locked
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| IOT122 |	Tomcat version ticket
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,511	| IOT122 |	Valentines
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:50,911	| IOT122 |	The goal here is to boost their access August access Services Program
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:53,471	| IOT122 |	Lets people into your house
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| IOT122 |	When you
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,263	| IOT122 |	Can see what it is
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,543	| IOT122 |	Or you can give codes
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,311	| IOT122 |	Do people like
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,591	| IOT122 |	Delivery folks
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,103	| IOT122 |	Etcetera
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,127	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,431	| IOT122 |	This is pretty cool
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,711	| IOT122 |	In addition to a funding
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,271	| IOT122 |	Gay good news we have an acquisition
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,319	| IOT122 |	This is an industrial internet
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,087	| IOT122 |	Things
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,367	| IOT122 |	Acquisition this is a company called
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,951	| IOT122 |	It is acquired a company called a rant
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,023	| IOT122 |	You may not recognize these companies
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,047	| IOT122 |	Because they
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,583	| IOT122 |	Direct consumer
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:24,447	| IOT122 |	Is iot services provider to a lot of company
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,495	| IOT122 |	Big Appliance makers
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:30,335	| IOT122 |	Basically have been doing this since 2006
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| IOT122 |	So they're old school
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:36,479	| IOT122 |	They can connecting devices to the internet and managing those connections for a long time
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,039	| IOT122 |	I don't know how much the deal was for
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,087	| IOT122 |	Protea is a really strange company
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| IOT122 |	They came out of nowhere
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:46,719	| IOT122 |	Is my 2015 with a hundred million dollars
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,487	| IOT122 |	In funding
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:51,327	| IOT122 |	It's the Ansari family who does the Ansari x-prize
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,119	| IOT122 |	The cell
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,935	| IOT122 |	An operating system for the Smart Home
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,751	| IOT122 |	To telcos and service providers
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,847	| IOT122 |	And I was kind of like really is that is that going to be a big business
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:05,407	| IOT122 |	But what they've done here is
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:09,247	| IOT122 |	They're still doing that line of business but with the acquisition of a rayon
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,783	| IOT122 |	They now basically have a
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,111	| IOT122 |	God I hate these words end in solution oh my God but they can do everything
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:19,231	| IOT122 |	And it really approaching it from that Telco mentality of
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,815	| IOT122 |	It's five nines reliability and all that
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:24,607	| IOT122 |	The one thing that I think is
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:27,679	| IOT122 |	Interesting and we never talked about this and it's a really big deal
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,471	| IOT122 |	Is they have
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,263	| IOT122 |	Really flexible
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,287	| IOT122 |	Pricing
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,335	| IOT122 |	For creating iot services
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:40,991	| IOT122 |	That's actually a big deal in the Telco space because a lot of these companies like when you have a cell phone plan
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:46,879	| IOT122 |	The software that manages all of that for the billing perspective is Arcane and in
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,671	| IOT122 |	Tents and it's slow
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,999	| IOT122 |	So a service provider champs-elysees
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| IOT122 |	Swap out my
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,815	| IOT122 |	Plants I want to change things up a little
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,119	| IOT122 |	That takes weeks
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:02,495	| IOT122 |	So what these guys have done if they made it on demand
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:06,079	| IOT122 |	They have that capability to create an on-demand service
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,175	| IOT122 |	Program I'm just using one
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,503	| IOT122 |	I wonder that also helps
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,527	| IOT122 |	Companies
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,807	| IOT122 |	Startups actually
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:22,207	| IOT122 |	Get their connectivity easier in a sense of you know sometimes if you're not big enough Verizon AT&T is not going to talk to you
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,255	| IOT122 |	They will work with startups
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,815	| IOT122 |	You can call
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,679	| IOT122 |	But this is more for like a big company
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,215	| IOT122 |	Come in and say hey
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,007	| IOT122 |	All of these connected devices
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,311	| IOT122 |	I want you guys to connect them and manager
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:41,919	| IOT122 |	What my customers when I have 10 million customers
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,967	| IOT122 |	What services thereby in charge them
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,735	| IOT122 |	Inappropriately for them
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| IOT122 |	Got it
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,575	| IOT122 |	The scalability then
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,111	| IOT122 |	Yeah it's hard
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,927	| IOT122 |	I know it sounds really excruciating lead all it does
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,695	| IOT122 |	But it's hard
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,999	| IOT122 |	This is
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| IOT122 |	Not a small thing
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,047	| IOT122 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,095	| IOT122 |	We got our funding
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,399	| IOT122 |	We got in a position and sadly
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,447	| IOT122 |	We have a company that has stopped
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,543	| IOT122 |	I hate this
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,823	| IOT122 |	So finkton
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:10,847	| IOT122 |	Which
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| IOT122 |	How do upstairs
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,943	| IOT122 |	I left the founders I would have met with him a bunch of times
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,271	| IOT122 |	It was a consumer-oriented
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,807	| IOT122 |	Text based
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,831	| IOT122 |	Home automation
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,415	| IOT122 |	So basically it was kind of conversational interface
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| IOT122 |	It was tied to your Twitter account
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:28,511	| IOT122 |	Any idea was like
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,327	| IOT122 |	Your things knew who you were in there
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,119	| IOT122 |	I knew your friends were
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,799	| IOT122 |	It would even if I remember correctly reach out to you it's not like you would just not like a chatbot where you have to initiate the conversation
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:45,919	| IOT122 |	And it may notice something from a sensor or location of a friend or something and it would tell you something
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,735	| IOT122 |	Yeah so this was a really friendly in
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| IOT122 |	Cute in
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:52,063	| IOT122 |	Fun idea for how to communicate with
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,135	| IOT122 |	That is not where the bark
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| IOT122 |	It's going so
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,231	| IOT122 |	Tom Coates a co-founder he he said that
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| IOT122 |	It's not working
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,279	| IOT122 |	Southington is is dead
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,399	| IOT122 |	Nice interface
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,447	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,031	| IOT122 |	All right
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,543	| IOT122 |	Elon Musk
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:14,847	| IOT122 |	So we've got
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,919	| IOT122 |	Funny acquisition death and
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:21,503	| IOT122 |	Something more exciting stuff and now we have something boring
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,015	| IOT122 |	Flooring
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,063	| IOT122 |	Literally
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:31,999	| IOT122 |	Not too much to tell but it's kind of cool the boring car elevator from Elon Musk
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,583	| IOT122 |	He tweeted out a video of
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,607	| IOT122 |	The first demonstration
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,143	| IOT122 |	Showing a
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,703	| IOT122 |	Tesla of course pulling up to a little
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:44,031	| IOT122 |	Platform and then down down down the car went and this is
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,823	| IOT122 |	I can choose this before we were talking about
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,871	| IOT122 |	Just before the show started
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:51,967	| IOT122 |	I was thinking hyperlipid this actually doesn't have any idea what the hyperloop this is going to
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:56,063	| IOT122 |	The platform's going to bring cars down to almost like a conveyor belt
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:58,623	| IOT122 |	Type of solution for underneath cities
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,439	| IOT122 |	This is at this is your cortical on-ramp
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,791	| IOT122 |	Yes this is so basically you drive on it there's a really great Debo it's
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,351	| IOT122 |	Super fun in your life
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:08,863	| IOT122 |	Real
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| IOT122 |	The cars
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| IOT122 |	Elevator that
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,983	| IOT122 |	Disguised as a parking space
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:15,263	| IOT122 |	Ghost
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| IOT122 |	And it drops you into this
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,383	| IOT122 |	Zips along underneath the ground
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:27,039	| IOT122 |	Either Menard report or iRobot
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| IOT122 |	In the movie
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:35,487	| IOT122 |	Yeah I guess it's like that but I remember is that the highways on one of those two movies I think it was iRobot work
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:35,999	| IOT122 |	It would drop
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:38,047	| IOT122 |	Cars down to lower levels
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,095	| IOT122 |	And whatnot and they were just
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,375	| IOT122 |	Be automated
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,935	| IOT122 |	No traffic you know everything was happy
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,703	| IOT122 |	Pappy and Autumn
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,239	| IOT122 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| IOT122 |	So boring not doing it
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT122 |	But
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,847	| IOT122 |	That's what's happening there
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,615	| IOT122 |	How far are we from this
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,663	| IOT122 |	Lord Only Knows do we want this
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,503	| IOT122 |	Although
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,783	| IOT122 |	With automation
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,551	| IOT122 |	You know
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,879	| IOT122 |	Maybe we should get there without having to dig tunnels underneath the ground
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,927	| IOT122 |	Baby you know adding more freeways
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| IOT122 |	Has never solved
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| IOT122 |	Traffic
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,023	| IOT122 |	Really I don't know
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,327	| IOT122 |	Places like Houston we have
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:11,839	| IOT122 |	Luckily freeways
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:15,423	| IOT122 |	There still traffic so with autonomous driving
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,703	| IOT122 |	More
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:19,775	| IOT122 |	Space may be helpful but I think autonomous-driving is probably the bigger
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,799	| IOT122 |	Solution to this
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,311	| IOT122 |	Exactly
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,127	| IOT122 |	So also an industrial news
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| IOT122 |	Because it's fun
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,223	| IOT122 |	We got two reports worth checking out
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:33,343	| IOT122 |	Actually we've got one report was checking out in the news that the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:33,855	| IOT122 |	Consortium
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,647	| IOT122 |	Has put out April
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,415	| IOT122 |	Vocabulary
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:39,231	| IOT122 |	For the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,303	| IOT122 |	Can I can I just
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,887	| IOT122 |	Reading that is like a dictionary and then that's the ultimate
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,423	| IOT122 |	Boring example
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,727	| IOT122 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:53,567	| IOT122 |	Yes that's true we we miss our great Segway
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,847	| IOT122 |	Sorry
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,359	| IOT122 |	Nope
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:00,991	| IOT122 |	So basically what this is is they've added 16 new words so
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,295	| IOT122 |	You know what we're talking about when we have the inner
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| IOT122 |	We're talking about the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,135	| IOT122 |	This isn't
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,159	| IOT122 |	Bad idea
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:13,023	| IOT122 |	Because even just two weeks ago I wrote a story where is it I don't even know what the edge of the network
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:15,071	| IOT122 |	Cuz everyone's come throws these terms around in you
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,351	| IOT122 |	What is
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,375	| IOT122 |	So now
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:21,215	| IOT122 |	They actually have a definition not of the edge but they do have the edge Gateway in here
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,311	| IOT122 |	I'm still out of luck at my definition for the edge but that's okay
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:27,359	| IOT122 |	So they've defined things
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:32,479	| IOT122 |	Using their own standards but also ISO standards for people who are going to have to be
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,015	| IOT122 |	Compliant which is a big deal for me
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,527	| IOT122 |	Manufacturing
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,855	| IOT122 |	If it turns a definer is mundane as
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,879	| IOT122 |	Mosquito cryptography
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT122 |	Data-at-rest
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,463	| IOT122 |	Who is esoteric as
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,743	| IOT122 |	A cross-cutting
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,535	| IOT122 |	Concern or a cross-cutting function
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,863	| IOT122 |	By the way those are things that affect the whole system
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,143	| IOT122 |	It may impact
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,191	| IOT122 |	Multiple viewpoints of the architecture
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:59,359	| IOT122 |	Cross-cutting function is a function that may be applied and realize across multiple functional domains
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:03,199	| IOT122 |	Describe the architecture to address
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:03,967	| IOT122 |	Cross-cutting
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,479	| IOT122 |	Concerns
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,783	| IOT122 |	So you can see this is riveting stuff
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,831	| IOT122 |	But if you're in the industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,367	| IOT122 |	You may want to check it out
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,647	| IOT122 |	Also in the white paper
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,927	| IOT122 |	World
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,207	| IOT122 |	We actually have a really cool paper
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:18,303	| IOT122 |	We won't dig into it but we going to link to it and I'll probably do it my newsletter as well be
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,351	| IOT122 |	That rich
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,375	| IOT122 |	And inciting
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,935	| IOT122 |	Arm has put out a paper a white paper on
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:28,031	| IOT122 |	The internet of things and the economics of a trillion connected devices
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,567	| IOT122 |	Because when arm was bought by soft
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,615	| IOT122 |	DC or something
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,895	| IOT122 |	Came out to there
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,687	| IOT122 |	Add event last year and was like
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| IOT122 |	You know how people are like
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,783	| IOT122 |	20 billion connected devices
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| IOT122 |	Inside
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,391	| IOT122 |	It was actually really great
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:47,487	| IOT122 |	Talk in this paper basically backs that up and then gets lots of data on
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:51,071	| IOT122 |	What that's going to cost but it's going to need to tail
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,607	| IOT122 |	In my favorite chart
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,143	| IOT122 |	Is
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:57,215	| IOT122 |	A chart that basically gives you the cost
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,495	| IOT122 |	There it just made it cost
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,775	| IOT122 |	A different iot
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:00,799	| IOT122 |	Modules
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:03,615	| IOT122 |	Was that your favorite chart
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,943	| IOT122 |	I like that chart I think
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,455	| IOT122 |	There
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:14,367	| IOT122 |	I'm a little more optimistic the prices will come down faster than what they say but they do take something in consideration that you pointed out to me
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:18,464	| IOT122 |	And that is the power for these modules such as using solar cells to power a lot of them
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:21,280	| IOT122 |	And that'll increase cost so
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,560	| IOT122 |	I see where they're coming from
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:25,632	| IOT122 |	I like to have a broken down by industry to on
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,936	| IOT122 |	How much each industry will
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,216	| IOT122 |	Benefit financially
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:32,032	| IOT122 |	Switching over to iot tech devices
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,800	| IOT122 |	Yes
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,312	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,872	| IOT122 |	I think everyone should actually check this out
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,896	| IOT122 |	Because
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,432	| IOT122 |	You're going to feel smarter after
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,712	| IOT122 |	I promise you
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,760	| IOT122 |	And you're going to be smarter with actual data
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,272	| IOT122 |	Which is the best
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,088	| IOT122 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,136	| IOT122 |	We each have two things
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,160	| IOT122 |	To talk about
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:52,256	| IOT122 |	Kevin's got a book recommendation and then I was going to tell you about my life with the Amazon
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,280	| IOT122 |	His theme
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,072	| IOT122 |	With a wand
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,864	| IOT122 |	The echo Dot
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:59,424	| IOT122 |	The echo wand
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,192	| IOT122 |	I thought this
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,288	| IOT122 |	A while back but we haven't talked about it
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,312	| IOT122 |	Basically this is a
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,872	| IOT122 |	This is my gateway to Amazon shopping
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,432	| IOT122 |	In the market and I bought it because of that
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,200	| IOT122 |	Whole Foods deal
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,784	| IOT122 |	You can only buy things
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,064	| IOT122 |	It's like a track sure
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:17,600	| IOT122 |	Your quest
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,392	| IOT122 |	Here at the shopping list you can talk to it and
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:20,416	| IOT122 |	Scan things
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,440	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,744	| IOT122 |	But it only buys things on Amazon
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,024	| IOT122 |	Put it on your Amazon list
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:25,536	| IOT122 |	Switch
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,072	| IOT122 |	How convenient
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,376	| IOT122 |	Yeah I guess you know Amazon's not that great
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,168	| IOT122 |	Does not
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,680	| IOT122 |	Grocery shopping
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,472	| IOT122 |	So I don't actually use it
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:38,848	| IOT122 |	Except I do scan these three things I buy an Amazon all the time I will use the one to
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,872	| IOT122 |	Escaneador
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,408	| IOT122 |	But
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,432	| IOT122 |	It also has
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,528	| IOT122 |	So what is actually kind of fun for is
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| IOT122 |	You have to hold down the button
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,320	| IOT122 |	Can I talk to it
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,600	| IOT122 |	But
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:56,000	| IOT122 |	I gave it to my mom when she was staying over and it became like this little remote control cuz there's no. In the
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| IOT122 |	Bedroom or an echo in the bedroom
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,560	| IOT122 |	Does she got to like
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,328	| IOT122 |	Control things like
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,608	| IOT122 |	Hey
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,400	| IOT122 |	If it's too cold for you at night
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:04,704	| IOT122 |	Press this button and say Madam a
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,520	| IOT122 |	Turn the ecobee to blah blah blah
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:11,616	| IOT122 |	So that was kind of nice cuz it was twenty bucks and was actually free
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,664	| IOT122 |	Because I got into $20 Amazon credit
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:15,712	| IOT122 |	So basically I got like a little remote
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,224	| IOT122 |	Controls for my echo
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:23,392	| IOT122 |	Yeah I actually never thought of it like that. I did not buy one because I'm Mighty now that I have Dash buttons for certain things I've heard
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,928	| IOT122 |	Amazon grocery wise
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:29,024	| IOT122 |	Didn't see the need for one that you're right I mean you can walk around the whole house
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:31,584	| IOT122 |	It's like carrying an echo in your pocket
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,352	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,424	| IOT122 |	It's not design
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,448	| IOT122 |	If you're carrying a
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:36,960	| IOT122 |	IPhone
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:41,056	| IOT122 |	Brighten also have that yeah
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,080	| IOT122 |	I found it useful for that
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,640	| IOT122 |	And I saw actually somebody
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:47,200	| IOT122 |	Link to it someone put an echo dot in there
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:47,712	| IOT122 |	Your car
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:51,296	| IOT122 |	Wichita that I wanted to do so I was like hell
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,064	| IOT122 |	Can I bring this into my
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,088	| IOT122 |	Far
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,880	| IOT122 |	But I don't have an always-on Wi-Fi
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,696	| IOT122 |	But I am constantly in my
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,464	| IOT122 |	My car and I want to ask
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:23:59,744	| IOT122 |	Questions
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,536	| IOT122 |	So that was
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,864	| IOT122 |	What was certain smartphones you can do that now
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,936	| IOT122 |	That is true or I could just ask Google who's actually smart
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,960	| IOT122 |	Questions I usually come up
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:13,056	| IOT122 |	Do squirrels have opposing
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,568	| IOT122 |	Thumbs
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,360	| IOT122 |	They do not
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,920	| IOT122 |	Titans
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,688	| IOT122 |	Good to know
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,224	| IOT122 |	Will there be a child
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:23,552	| IOT122 |	This is this is what happens when you're at a red light and you're watching a squirrel like I was
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| IOT122 |	Doing origami
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,648	| IOT122 |	Somebody's been driving too much
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,464	| IOT122 |	Yeah yeah that's not drinking just right
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,512	| IOT122 |	So that's
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,304	| IOT122 |	Kevin Kevin maybe house
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,912	| IOT122 |	Well since we gave people some
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,192	| IOT122 |	Good reading song
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:45,824	| IOT122 |	I still think boring reading here some exciting reading and I didn't realize you would already read this
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,384	| IOT122 |	I'm not ready for the show but I read a book
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,432	| IOT122 |	By Matthew Mather
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,456	| IOT122 |	Called darknet
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,272	| IOT122 |	Activate mobile me
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:57,344	| IOT122 |	Well in bookstores obviously and I read it on my Kindle on tickets
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,928	| IOT122 |	Part of Kindle unlimited so if you already parking on unlimited you can read it
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,208	| IOT122 |	Free or
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:07,072	| IOT122 |	Prescription if not the Kindle prices $5.99
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,096	| IOT122 |	It's so hard
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,912	| IOT122 |	Talk about this book without giving too much away
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,680	| IOT122 |	But
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:16,544	| IOT122 |	I why am recommending it is because we've always talked about all these sensors around the world and
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:19,360	| IOT122 |	Only can have more than one trillion size arm
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:22,688	| IOT122 |	Nai and autonomous this and that
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:26,272	| IOT122 |	And privacy concerns and spoofing
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| IOT122 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,344	| IOT122 |	So I'm not going to say anymore but
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,648	| IOT122 |	It's all that and a bag of chips
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:36,512	| IOT122 |	Wrapped in a story
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,536	| IOT122 |	Maybe years ago
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,096	| IOT122 |	Think about it
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:47,776	| IOT122 |	Yeah because it's one of those sci-fi books that way after you read it especially because it's now to wish years old
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:48,800	| IOT122 |	Any industry
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:50,336	| IOT122 |	Ramps up so fast that you're like
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:53,408	| IOT122 |	2 years ago this was science
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,712	| IOT122 |	Fiction now it's not even so much
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| IOT122 |	Fiction
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,040	| IOT122 |	I want to see anymore
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:25:59,808	| IOT122 |	Yes
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,600	| IOT122 |	I will say that
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,880	| IOT122 |	Will be reading future
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:06,464	| IOT122 |	Underground bunkers with absolutely no connectivity
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,048	| IOT122 |	Etiwanda
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:13,632	| IOT122 |	That's not coming
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:14,656	| IOT122 |	All right
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,960	| IOT122 |	That's a good stopping
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,496	| IOT122 |	For this week
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,800	| IOT122 |	Next up we are going to have a word for
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,848	| IOT122 |	And after that
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,384	| IOT122 |	We are going to
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,408	| IOT122 |	To hear from Alex
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:27,456	| IOT122 |	Scrum who is in charge of
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,224	| IOT122 |	Comcast
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,248	| IOT122 |	Machineq Network
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:32,064	| IOT122 |	And this is not just Comcast
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,344	| IOT122 |	Life
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,904	| IOT122 |	In X with machine Cube It's all about Laura
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,696	| IOT122 |	Low power
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,232	| IOT122 |	Wide area network
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,280	| IOT122 |	Technology and how
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:44,096	| IOT122 |	You can use that you're gonna learn a lot about power constraints bandwidth
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:44,608	| IOT122 |	Security
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:47,424	| IOT122 |	Is chock-full of awesome stuff in a lot of
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,960	| IOT122 |	It's really useful for asset tracking
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| IOT122 |	Stay tuned for that
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:56,128	| IOT122 |	And now a word from our sponsor
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:27:02,528	| IOT122 |	Everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is Al
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,808	| IOT122 |	Legion which makes
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,088	| IOT122 |	Schlage Locks
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,624	| IOT122 |	I've got robbed
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,672	| IOT122 |	Set futuristics Lake here to talk to us
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,952	| IOT122 |	Yesterday hi Rob how are you doing
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,256	| IOT122 |	I'm great Stacy how are you
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,024	| IOT122 |	Excellent
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,328	| IOT122 |	So what are some considerations
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,864	| IOT122 |	In choosing a Smart Lock
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,424	| IOT122 |	Stacy I have some thoughts
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,216	| IOT122 |	Surround electronic lock
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:24,032	| IOT122 |	Consideration or selection for your viewers
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:27,872	| IOT122 |	Basics candy Left Behind when you're thinking about technology first
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,432	| IOT122 |	So one of the things we recommend is
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:34,272	| IOT122 |	Make sure first and foremost that you get a good grated lock
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:37,344	| IOT122 |	So Beacham a grading is important
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| IOT122 |	But also things like understanding
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| IOT122 |	Hey
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,464	| IOT122 |	Can I replace the deadbolt
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:45,280	| IOT122 |	Or do I need to go with a retrofit
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,048	| IOT122 |	Solution
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,864	| IOT122 |	Now the benefits of replacing your deadbolt parts
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,632	| IOT122 |	Control
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,424	| IOT122 |	If you replace the deadbolt
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:55,008	| IOT122 |	You're guaranteed that all the keys that you may have delivered
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:55,776	| IOT122 |	Neighbors
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,288	| IOT122 |	Friends
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,568	| IOT122 |	Whoever
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,336	| IOT122 |	Overtime
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,872	| IOT122 |	Are not going to work
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:00,384	| IOT122 |	And that deadbolt
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,968	| IOT122 |	So when you replace the deadbolt you have the benefit of key
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| IOT122 |	Control
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:07,296	| IOT122 |	Other things to consider when you buy
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:10,624	| IOT122 |	An electronic deadbolt touchscreen deadbolt solution
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,672	| IOT122 |	Does it have a tapered deadbolt
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,488	| IOT122 |	If you don't replace the original deadbolt
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:18,048	| IOT122 |	You're going to have a traditional deadbolt that's not tape
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,328	| IOT122 |	Rob
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,352	| IOT122 |	What is a tapered deadbolt
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:25,984	| IOT122 |	A tapered deadbolt is exactly that it's a deadbolt that's slightly tapered
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:26,752	| IOT122 |	On each end
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,056	| IOT122 |	This is important for door alignment
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,384	| IOT122 |	Door alignment is important because
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,176	| IOT122 |	With heat your door expand
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,736	| IOT122 |	With called your dorm a shrink
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:40,320	| IOT122 |	And if that deadbolt isn't aligned properly
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,112	| IOT122 |	It will never
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:42,880	| IOT122 |	Close fully
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:43,904	| IOT122 |	Secondly
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,464	| IOT122 |	The other thing associated with that is
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:46,976	| IOT122 |	Motors
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,304	| IOT122 |	It's important have a strong motor on your touch
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,328	| IOT122 |	Screen deadbolt
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,864	| IOT122 |	So that has enough strength
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,656	| IOT122 |	Where is that taper deadbolt
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,168	| IOT122 |	Couches
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:57,728	| IOT122 |	Pull the door closed
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,776	| IOT122 |	Any other considerations
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,080	| IOT122 |	So Stacy one of the things
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:05,408	| IOT122 |	That we focus on is ease of installation
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,688	| IOT122 |	We like to think
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:07,712	| IOT122 |	That you can
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:11,296	| IOT122 |	Install one of our touchscreen deadbolt in less than 10 minutes
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,856	| IOT122 |	With just a Phillips head screwdriver
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,624	| IOT122 |	Another thing
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:20,768	| IOT122 |	Consider is battery life we don't believe in using proprietary batteries we think they should be conveniently available
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,072	| IOT122 |	We also
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:25,120	| IOT122 |	Specify are touchscreen deadbolt
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,144	| IOT122 |	What's the last at least
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,424	| IOT122 |	12 month
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,704	| IOT122 |	Width for double a batteries
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,496	| IOT122 |	And that doesn't mean
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,264	| IOT122 |	That is just
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,032	| IOT122 |	On
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:37,408	| IOT122 |	Day in and day out that means testing it with a minimum of 10 usages a day
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| IOT122 |	Fourier
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| IOT122 |	Hot diggity
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:39,968	| IOT122 |	That's pretty awesome
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,272	| IOT122 |	So where can I go to find out more

EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:07,104	| IOT122 |	Alex Karim who is
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:09,664	| IOT122 |	General manager at machineq
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,944	| IOT122 |	Which is Comcast
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,736	| IOT122 |	Lorawan Network effort
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,528	| IOT122 |	Alex how are you doing today
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,552	| IOT122 |	I'm doing great thanks Stacy
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:18,368	| IOT122 |	I am excited to have you on the show
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,160	| IOT122 |	About a year ago Comcast
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,720	| IOT122 |	Excited about law
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:25,024	| IOT122 |	And I was like who
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:31,168	| IOT122 |	This could be fine and we didn't hear much from you until a couple weeks ago when you guys run doubt to total of 15 markets
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,216	| IOT122 |	Adam-12 markets
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:39,104	| IOT122 |	And here you are today to talk not just about Comcast's efforts but also what people should think of
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:39,872	| IOT122 |	When they think of Laura
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,920	| IOT122 |	Tall order can you handle it
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:42,688	| IOT122 |	Yes
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,712	| IOT122 |	And thank you for having
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,992	| IOT122 |	Guess
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,040	| IOT122 |	Alright let's get started with
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:47,808	| IOT122 |	Why
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,320	| IOT122 |	Laura
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,600	| IOT122 |	Laura win
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,368	| IOT122 |	For Comcast
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,392	| IOT122 |	How did this all come about
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:56,256	| IOT122 |	About two years ago we started looking at low-power wide area Networks
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:58,048	| IOT122 |	There's an opportunity for Comcast
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,584	| IOT122 |	To provide a whole
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:01,120	| IOT122 |	New set of services
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:01,632	| IOT122 |	To its client
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,168	| IOT122 |	Primarily business clients
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:08,288	| IOT122 |	Conversations business and Bose technical
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,336	| IOT122 |	Looking at the competing on license
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,128	| IOT122 |	Opportunities out there
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:15,712	| IOT122 |	As you know probably that recently we actually acquired Spectrum as well
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:19,040	| IOT122 |	But at that point we are focused primarily on license opportunities
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,320	| IOT122 |	And so
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,368	| IOT122 |	Begin a pretty intensive
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,160	| IOT122 |	R&D research effort
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,440	| IOT122 |	Travel the globe
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:28,512	| IOT122 |	Supposed to different carriers both Wireline and Wireless
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:31,328	| IOT122 |	Understand how they were thinking about iot in the future
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:34,912	| IOT122 |	And after having their own field trials here in Philadelphia and having looked at
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:39,008	| IOT122 |	Are the dishes opportunities visibility the unlicensed Technologies
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,568	| IOT122 |	Became pretty obvious to us when you had
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,336	| IOT122 |	Interrupting
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,128	| IOT122 |	Thirtysomething or Plus
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:46,944	| IOT122 |	Types of carriers mobile carriers in NY line carriers
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:50,272	| IOT122 |	Adopted lorwyn standard that the ecosystem was
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,808	| IOT122 |	Going to be critical going for
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,088	| IOT122 |	And Laura Wang
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,368	| IOT122 |	Heather ecosystem
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:32:00,768	| IOT122 |	In addition to Hardware companies I Cisco who are who are supported Etc thrust feeling of Laurel and all fertile
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,304	| IOT122 |	The best long-term strategy
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,096	| IOT122 |	Future-proof having
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,144	| IOT122 |	And iot Enterprise iot
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,192	| IOT122 |	Got it now
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:09,216	| IOT122 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,496	| IOT122 |	Laura as a standard
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:13,568	| IOT122 |	Because there's a lot going on there and it's not like everybody
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:15,616	| IOT122 |	What Laura in
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,664	| IOT122 |	As you mentioned it's unlicensed
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:20,992	| IOT122 |	Work
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:23,552	| IOT122 |	Let's talk about bandwidth rates and all of that kind
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:25,344	| IOT122 |	Power consumption
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:29,440	| IOT122 |	Sure seal or Bay City is a physical communication protocol that
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,720	| IOT122 |	Have traction
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:33,024	| IOT122 |	Primarily is New Beginning days is a camp
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:33,792	| IOT122 |	Campus
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,816	| IOT122 |	Regional opportunity
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:38,400	| IOT122 |	But you were able to set up a Gateway and start managing
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,448	| IOT122 |	Tickler device using the Laura
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:43,008	| IOT122 |	Protocol he did such a great job of
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:49,920	| IOT122 |	Doing that and I'm providing the right propagation and because of you it's very low-power depending on certain what they require
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,200	| IOT122 |	Apartments off of the device
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,224	| IOT122 |	Allura
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,784	| IOT122 |	Battery powered device can remain out in the field for about a decade
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,064	| IOT122 |	That
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,368	| IOT122 |	Carriage got together and started thinking through
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:04,768	| IOT122 |	Can we create a mock layer basically a way for this to move out of the campus of Art and more into true
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:06,048	| IOT122 |	Why the area of arm
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,328	| IOT122 |	Weekend blanket
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,120	| IOT122 |	Cities Region's countries
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,168	| IOT122 |	With this applicant with his protocol
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,728	| IOT122 |	Okay so. Laura
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:16,032	| IOT122 |	In one of the band width what are the up and downs
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:16,544	| IOT122 |	Flora and
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,872	| IOT122 |	Downelink
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:21,920	| IOT122 |	It's probably about you 20 kilobits to seconds
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,480	| IOT122 |	These were saying in the field
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,272	| IOT122 |	I think we're talking about
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,808	| IOT122 |	The 5 to 10 kilobits
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:30,368	| IOT122 |	Most of the Transmissions we see
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:36,768	| IOT122 |	Domestic limited I think it differs by market depending on need of what the unlicensed regime You Are by 9:15
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,560	| IOT122 |	Hiossen Bandit States
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:41,632	| IOT122 |	But I'd say like if you're looking to build an application devices
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:43,680	| IOT122 |	Sub 5 kilobits per second
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:45,984	| IOT122 |	Then this is the ideal protocol for you
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:49,568	| IOT122 |	And there is no Universal
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,848	| IOT122 |	Laura Spectrum
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:54,432	| IOT122 |	SWAT so if you're going to build a Lora based products
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,480	| IOT122 |	You're going to have to build different radios for
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,248	| IOT122 |	Each different country
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,808	| IOT122 |	Right I think there's definitely
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:04,928	| IOT122 |	Some countries have very similar artists in South Korea share the same band that were using on
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,976	| IOT122 |	And so today is your sort of decision to
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,256	| IOT122 |	Manufacturer product for booth
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,536	| IOT122 |	Certain markets
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:13,632	| IOT122 |	Europeans have a different subsets of Standards but that's correct that you have to do some
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:14,400	| IOT122 |	Testing
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:18,752	| IOT122 |	You have to get certifications in in these sort of domestic country to before you can launch that
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:21,056	| IOT122 |	Going Global is always hard
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,336	| IOT122 |	Alright so
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,872	| IOT122 |	Let's talk about the challenges
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,920	| IOT122 |	Because you you correct me earlier and I appreciate
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,968	| IOT122 |	I'm thinking Laura
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,504	| IOT122 |	Laura is Laura
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:32,320	| IOT122 |	And this is
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:34,112	| IOT122 |	The radio protocol Plus
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,136	| IOT122 |	Next level
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:38,208	| IOT122 |	Standardization turn Zalora Network
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,000	| IOT122 |	Work into something broader so
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,792	| IOT122 |	What is that architecture
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,816	| IOT122 |	Look like broccoli
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,352	| IOT122 |	What devices have what cave
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,168	| IOT122 |	Sure so
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,960	| IOT122 |	After tracking
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:52,288	| IOT122 |	It's easy to go put Alora wanker
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| IOT122 |	Client
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,616	| IOT122 |	Module into a an asset tracker
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:59,200	| IOT122 |	It requires a lot less battery power than traditional cellular Technologies
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:01,248	| IOT122 |	They can remain in the field for years
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,040	| IOT122 |	The reason why again it's
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,088	| IOT122 |	We've mentioned or versus or when
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:06,368	| IOT122 |	Laura Wynn
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,136	| IOT122 |	It can work
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:13,536	| IOT122 |	Across different country so orange is an example just publicly announced that they're working on Laurel and roaming in Europe for
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:17,632	| IOT122 |	For next year so I think that's where things are going as I said it should have started out as this
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:18,656	| IOT122 |	Greycampus
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:22,496	| IOT122 |	Tool but it became a domestic cool now it's becoming international roaming tool
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,032	| IOT122 |	Why were all on
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:26,848	| IOT122 |	Different sort of as you mention standards in terms of the band
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,128	| IOT122 |	That is
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:34,528	| IOT122 |	There's ways of making sure that we can serve Rome among each other but the vast majority of devices that were focused on it
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:38,368	| IOT122 |	I think the other carriage for the Doppler Wendy's are things that really happen
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:41,440	| IOT122 |	Connected to the cloud they want to connect it wannabe
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:47,840	| IOT122 |	Providing information quite frankly to visit businesses to improve operations and improve Services everything from
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:48,608	| IOT122 |	Pallets
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:49,376	| IOT122 |	Two containers
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:52,960	| IOT122 |	And we just had a hackathon in Philadelphia recently actually
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:57,056	| IOT122 |	And some of the winners had some amazing things that they came up with
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:57,824	| IOT122 |	Number one
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:03,200	| IOT122 |	It's a device that basically just monitors temperature in the real use case was for elderly people
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,736	| IOT122 |	Monkey living by themselves
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,016	| IOT122 |	To make sure that
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:08,064	| IOT122 |	You can go put this in parts of their homes
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,112	| IOT122 |	They might have another connected device in the house
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:17,024	| IOT122 |	They might not want to pair something with their smartphone but it would be able to alert anyone that needed to be alerted it is certain
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,304	| IOT122 |	Temperature threshold is met
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,608	| IOT122 |	That there's a danger here for that person
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:23,424	| IOT122 |	And that you can do with Laurel and it sort of set in Africa
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:27,008	| IOT122 |	Hackathon winners Nikes you know would love to commercialize and ghosts
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,288	| IOT122 |	Citgo pry this to
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:34,688	| IOT122 |	Folks and you can go put it into let's say one of our markets over building in it would automatically sort of authenticate over-the-air and it be nice
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:37,504	| IOT122 |	Easy sort of on-ramp and you would solve that problem for
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:43,904	| IOT122 |	That's subset of the market is someone of the second prize winners was a tool that would go into it was a kraut source
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:44,928	| IOT122 |	Pothole tool
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:48,768	| IOT122 |	The application was to go and put a little sensor on this
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,536	| IOT122 |	Extensions
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,328	| IOT122 |	As Municipal vehicles
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:57,728	| IOT122 |	They put on the fire truck in front of police vehicle in a particular area and it goes down a certain number of degrees it would
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:37:00,288	| IOT122 |	Identify where the wheel would go down
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:06,688	| IOT122 |	And actually have a GPS coordinates recorded events ended up and eventually you have enough of this data to predict until the city officials
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:10,784	| IOT122 |	It's probably a bunch of potholes developing here you probably should go check this out
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:13,088	| IOT122 |	But those are things quite frankly that before
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:16,928	| IOT122 |	Be difficult to sort of the field
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,720	| IOT122 |	I think like right around 5 to $10
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,792	| IOT122 |	So these modules
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:24,352	| IOT122 |	The gateways as opposed to going straight up to the end
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:25,376	| IOT122 |	That's correct
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:29,472	| IOT122 |	So how many lorawan Network
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:31,520	| IOT122 |	How many gateways do I need
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,312	| IOT122 |	Cover a square mile
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:37,920	| IOT122 |	Depends on sword of the use case if you if you're looking to cover a square mile for
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:44,320	| IOT122 |	An outdoor only use case and there's no sort of high buildings for Square mall you can if you have a high enough power
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,088	| IOT122 |	In this case
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:47,648	| IOT122 |	Anybody put two or three gateways new cover that
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:49,184	| IOT122 |	But the reality is is that
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:50,976	| IOT122 |	I mean I think you know
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:55,328	| IOT122 |	But each one of these devices has its own sort of particular use case so if you're looking to Culver City
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:56,608	| IOT122 |	But
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:59,168	| IOT122 |	Your application requires getting into a
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:00,448	| IOT122 |	Parking garage
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:01,216	| IOT122 |	Two floors down
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:03,264	| IOT122 |	Different types of Gateway Tennessee show me there
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,824	| IOT122 |	And I'm trying to remember
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:06,848	| IOT122 |	900
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:07,360	| IOT122 |	900
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:08,640	| IOT122 |	10 megahertz
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:09,664	| IOT122 |	How does that travel
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,968	| IOT122 |	Walter Wallace this is something that's going to work indoors
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,040	| IOT122 |	Yes I think it propagations excellent soil
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:21,952	| IOT122 |	Clearly that one of the reasons why laurel-ann Works in many ways for most of these iety industrial applications because of
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,976	| IOT122 |	It can penetrate
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:29,376	| IOT122 |	A lot better than other bands this person is always been there for vism industrial science and medical devices
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:33,216	| IOT122 |	So what does propagate very well but it going to goes back to
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:38,336	| IOT122 |	Making sure you still have the right Gateway density in the right locations which goes back to one of the reasons why I think
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:42,688	| IOT122 |	We were able to successfully work with within Comcast cable to make sure that
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:47,808	| IOT122 |	You look at the long-term vision of how lower way I could be the toilets multi-user of nodal
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:52,416	| IOT122 |	And it's just in the way of looking at building a network it's not I'm just going to go build a mackerel layer
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,952	| IOT122 |	Towers
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:58,560	| IOT122 |	But you can look at potentially putting it on strands of your looks a data cable operator
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:02,400	| IOT122 |	You can put them in homes or other locations if you want to put into CPE
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:05,472	| IOT122 |	And this is not unlike what the Europeans I couldn't have been
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:08,288	| IOT122 |	You're looking at for about a year or so that
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:14,688	| IOT122 |	Real use public examples of what they've done but I think an orange has been a leader in the space for quite a while.
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:16,736	| IOT122 |	Build a macro based
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:19,552	| IOT122 |	Cell tower filled out in France
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,320	| IOT122 |	With lorawan
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:26,720	| IOT122 |	And then they were experimenting with putting in home devices like a lorawan lamp for some employees
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:29,024	| IOT122 |	It's a Gateway effectively
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:29,792	| IOT122 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,328	| IOT122 |	Identification in Paris
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:35,168	| IOT122 |	All right to Comcast having all of this
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:41,568	| IOT122 |	Consumer promise equipment so basically it's any gear that you get from Comcast could we possibly one day see you guys
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,080	| IOT122 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:47,712	| IOT122 |	Let's make this more dense let's put this in homes because it makes sense for like smoke detectors or other crazy ideas
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:52,320	| IOT122 |	Restless Papo Gateway into our routers are
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,600	| IOT122 |	Set up exercise
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:56,160	| IOT122 |	That's exactly right I think all those options on the table
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:40:02,048	| IOT122 |	And I think if you look at sort of what other folks are looking to deploy globally and get ourselves that
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:08,448	| IOT122 |	I think naturally that the more more applications in the more B2B to see the more consumer applications be fine for I
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:12,544	| IOT122 |	30th and cook good more likely to start saying companies like ourselves considered adoption
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,336	| IOT122 |	All right now
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,360	| IOT122 |	If I have a business
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,200	| IOT122 |	Sitting here and like I don't really care
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,480	| IOT122 |	In Great Neck
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,784	| IOT122 |	Work staff who should care about
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:24,832	| IOT122 |	You've got this
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:29,184	| IOT122 |	Siri you can send small amounts of data pretty far distances really cheaply
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:29,952	| IOT122 |	Play so
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:31,488	| IOT122 |	What kind of use cases can we see
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:34,048	| IOT122 |	Loose cases Racine
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,816	| IOT122 |	Stan
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,608	| IOT122 |	Ferreus Industries
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:39,168	| IOT122 |	So if you look at the most natural ones
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:41,472	| IOT122 |	Asset heavy Industries which have
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:48,384	| IOT122 |	High-value devices are assets in the field and needed pracna crucially couldn't track them because they lack the power
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,920	| IOT122 |	That's a no-brainer
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| IOT122 |	We've seen that
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:54,528	| IOT122 |	I think you look at heavy machinery II metering
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,320	| IOT122 |	Do you want to know where something is
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,600	| IOT122 |	Geo-fence something
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:00,160	| IOT122 |	Vegetable with a cost of the modules coming
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:02,464	| IOT122 |	Further down leaving sub $5 and in
EDL	00:41:02,464	00:41:03,744	| IOT122 |	Put it in the near future
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:07,328	| IOT122 |	Now using the return on investment should I spend you know
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,888	| IOT122 |	10 $15 put a tracker on this device
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:12,704	| IOT122 |	And pay Comcast
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,008	| IOT122 |	We're just in this case our partner will pay us
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:15,776	| IOT122 |	Disconnect
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:18,080	| IOT122 |	That device for them and feel for your so
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:22,432	| IOT122 |	To make sure that I know where all this devices are they leave this particular area I should know
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:27,040	| IOT122 |	Do you have that sort of that side of the equation the other side there's people who are looking
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,832	| IOT122 |	Revolutionize everything from
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:33,440	| IOT122 |	Parts of the pharmaceutical industry or mention adherents
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:34,720	| IOT122 |	I'll put it out there
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:36,000	| IOT122 |	Dispenser to this
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:41,120	| IOT122 |	Dream to be able to have a connected Hilltop it didn't require constant battery patio
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:41,632	| IOT122 |	Replenishing
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:43,936	| IOT122 |	How does the device like this
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:45,984	| IOT122 |	Help solve problems ie
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:48,800	| IOT122 |	How many times has this person has a station opened up
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:49,568	| IOT122 |	That device
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:51,616	| IOT122 |	License office
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:53,151	| IOT122 |	2
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:56,223	| IOT122 |	Even advertising we've seen other interesting spaces were
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,783	| IOT122 |	I can't get into specifics but more or less
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:02,111	| IOT122 |	I think about the prettiest trees and being able to track
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,135	| IOT122 |	What people are doing
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:05,183	| IOT122 |	On catalogs
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:07,487	| IOT122 |	Wait people still get catalogs
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:10,559	| IOT122 |	Play get on the questions do they open or not
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:12,095	| IOT122 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,375	| IOT122 |	That feels kind of like spine
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:18,495	| IOT122 |	You send me mail and suddenly I've got this like sensor on it that's a poop
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:26,431	| IOT122 |	These are the examples of people are coming up with them out there in the field
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:27,711	| IOT122 |	But you ask
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:30,271	| IOT122 |	What are use cases in my point is everything from
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:32,319	| IOT122 |	Yo heavy Industrial
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:35,391	| IOT122 |	Pharma the advertising the pest control
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:37,439	| IOT122 |	Ozium
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:37,951	| IOT122 |	Smart now
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,119	| IOT122 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:47,423	| IOT122 |	Exactly so
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:51,263	| IOT122 |	That's been through my conversation to given day of the week she's been all those people
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:52,543	| IOT122 |	Flooring
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,823	| IOT122 |	And those opportunities
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:56,127	| IOT122 |	Understanding what the technology is capable of doing
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,175	| IOT122 |	It is wonderful seeing
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:01,503	| IOT122 |	Their brains race to think about how this can help their business
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:04,831	| IOT122 |	All right now I'm going to go into some of the things that
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:05,599	| IOT122 |	Concern me
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:08,927	| IOT122 |	Because it's always fun to talk about the trade-offs and every technology
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:09,439	| IOT122 |	Does happen
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:10,719	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:13,535	| IOT122 |	The Gatorades here
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:14,815	| IOT122 |	It worries me because
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,375	| IOT122 |	It's a very small amount
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,399	| IOT122 |	A data and
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:23,263	| IOT122 |	Security being what it is I feel like things are going to need more over the air updates in the
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,287	| IOT122 |	Future not fewer
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:28,127	| IOT122 |	Sub-5 kilobits
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:29,151	| IOT122 |	Per second
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,175	| IOT122 |	Is that enough
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:30,943	| IOT122 |	To keep things updated
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:32,223	| IOT122 |	Transmit neusoft
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,015	| IOT122 |	Yes we went
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:37,855	| IOT122 |	Through this analysis we definitely thought about Serta firm over there updates is being
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:40,159	| IOT122 |	Critical analysis especially when these devices
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:43,487	| IOT122 |	Requirements of being out in the field for many many years
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:47,839	| IOT122 |	And as I said before it right now but the average type of
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:49,375	| IOT122 |	Interactional
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:53,983	| IOT122 |	Floral and device I've seen anyway it's looking for Farmer 5 kilobits but in terms of downlink
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:56,543	| IOT122 |	You can go to 25 kilobits per second
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:57,567	| IOT122 |	They'll get it
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:00,639	| IOT122 |	Still nowhere near what you expect from trishul cellular Technologies
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:01,663	| IOT122 |	Requirements
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:02,943	| IOT122 |	But
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,247	| IOT122 |	That's part of the value of working
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:08,319	| IOT122 |	Comcast and other folks in the others a huge ecosystem
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:11,391	| IOT122 |	All the partners in the in the Laurel and Alliance
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:15,231	| IOT122 |	Is working on firmware over-the-air serve best practice standards
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:16,511	| IOT122 |	So
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,535	| IOT122 |	We can do things
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,559	| IOT122 |	Hush
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:21,887	| IOT122 |	Silent the rest of the Network's we can sort of make sure that this client
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:25,727	| IOT122 |	10000 devices are going to be updated over an ex
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:26,239	| IOT122 |	Happy Days
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:27,519	| IOT122 |	For this upgrade
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:33,407	| IOT122 |	An actual. Talk about scale how many devices can you put on a Gateway or
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,687	| IOT122 |	How big can is net worth
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:35,199	| IOT122 |	Work schedule
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:37,759	| IOT122 |	Get it comes down to being serve application
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:41,343	| IOT122 |	Specifically our trials we put things on tracking that immitracker needs
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:45,183	| IOT122 |	To talk every couple seconds versus be put of the lights out there we need to talk every year
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,975	| IOT122 |	Putting General work Hawking
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:51,327	| IOT122 |	Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of devices potentially forget what
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:52,607	| IOT122 |	That feels
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,119	| IOT122 |	Doable
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:54,399	| IOT122 |	All right
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,167	| IOT122 |	Now Comcast
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:57,983	| IOT122 |	You guys have embarked upon Wireless
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:44:59,519	| IOT122 |	And
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,031	| IOT122 |	Then you guys were
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:06,943	| IOT122 |	Why create your own iot
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:08,223	| IOT122 |	Wireless net
EDL	00:45:09,247	00:45:10,271	| IOT122 |	I think
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:11,295	| IOT122 |	The reason why we're
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:13,343	| IOT122 |	Pitabilities networks and to get in
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:15,647	| IOT122 |	This is because there's no other Alternatives today
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:17,183	| IOT122 |	That we're not looking too
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,975	| IOT122 |	Sorted offer
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,279	| IOT122 |	This is not a cytotechnologist
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:24,863	| IOT122 |	Right there's a lot of business has a lot of
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,655	| IOT122 |	Opportunities for
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:28,703	| IOT122 |	Provide some real value here
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:32,031	| IOT122 |	For Industries which until another alternative comes up
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:33,311	| IOT122 |	That we
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:35,359	| IOT122 |	Put it upon ourselves looking at was out there
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:38,943	| IOT122 |	We have a network we have the assets we have the relationships
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:43,295	| IOT122 |	We provide a service which is valuable not only to businesses but also you communities
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:46,367	| IOT122 |	Geauga CCR Smart City vertical being pretty important
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,391	| IOT122 |	And we've been in these
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:49,951	| IOT122 |	Calories for 50 plus years of time
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:54,559	| IOT122 |	As you start hearing about Urban landscape Suburban rural needs
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:46:01,471	| IOT122 |	It became obvious that seeing other carriers globally what they're doing and why they're doing it that it made sense for us considering the
EDL	00:46:01,471	00:46:03,007	| IOT122 |	Mixture of assets available to us
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:05,823	| IOT122 |	And how is Comcast
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,103	| IOT122 |	Going to sell this so
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,639	| IOT122 |	In this case
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:11,455	| IOT122 |	Your building these networks in the 15 cities
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:13,247	| IOT122 |	Partybell temp
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,783	| IOT122 |	You're going to sell these two
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,831	| IOT122 |	And users or
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:19,391	| IOT122 |	Systems integrators or the cities themselves how does a
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,951	| IOT122 |	Key question I think that
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:22,463	| IOT122 |	Having
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:23,999	| IOT122 |	Barton
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:26,559	| IOT122 |	Being a public trial 6 months ago in October
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,095	| IOT122 |	Become obvious that are our first
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:32,447	| IOT122 |	Sweet spot is working with partners partners being those who are manufacturing device
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,239	| IOT122 |	They have
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,263	| IOT122 |	The expertise
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,799	| IOT122 |	Understand the technology
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,335	| IOT122 |	Coming to us
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,127	| IOT122 |	Looking to
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:41,919	| IOT122 |	Connect other devices to us
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:43,711	| IOT122 |	Avenues partners
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:47,807	| IOT122 |	Have verticals and channel expertise industry expertise
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:52,415	| IOT122 |	Busy themselves with once they've connected to us they're going to bomb a bath together
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:54,975	| IOT122 |	And going to work with their channels to sell so
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:57,535	| IOT122 |	Yes indeed a we are in the Smart City
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:46:58,047	| IOT122 |	Space
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:01,887	| IOT122 |	But right now we don't see ourselves as going in
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:04,191	| IOT122 |	Raising her hand becoming a prime
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:05,727	| IOT122 |	Contractors
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,775	| IOT122 |	Do any Municipal requests comes in
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:08,799	| IOT122 |	However our partners are
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:10,847	| IOT122 |	And
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:13,919	| IOT122 |	You also are looking for partners among startups in other develop
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:16,223	| IOT122 |	That's right so I think it's
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:21,087	| IOT122 |	It one of the fascinating things is we're dealing with Fortune 500 companies and also startups
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,391	| IOT122 |	So on both sides of the spectrum
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:28,255	| IOT122 |	You see a lot of big corporations doing pilots and proof of Concepts and their
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:29,535	| IOT122 |	We're working on them
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:32,607	| IOT122 |	And proving out that this particular need they have
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:35,423	| IOT122 |	The technology is exactly what fits for their needs
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:37,215	| IOT122 |	Economics work for them
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:41,567	| IOT122 |	And they have no natural teams thinking about how to Andino add sensors if you will
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,615	| IOT122 |	2 horse float existing businesses
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:44,639	| IOT122 |	But they have
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:45,151	| IOT122 |	And
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:47,455	| IOT122 |	That levels of excavate
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:51,551	| IOT122 |	Some of them have that deep level of expertise and I have all the skill sets and how some of them don't
EDL	00:47:52,063	00:47:54,879	| IOT122 |	Torquing them on the other side of the spectrum
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,927	| IOT122 |	Plus startup sir also engaging
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:48:01,279	| IOT122 |	I have been using that quite frankly other types of Wireless protocols
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:05,119	| IOT122 |	Heather now looking dust insecticide might have used you know XYZ before
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:09,471	| IOT122 |	I was only a wifi-only device or I was a Bluetooth only device
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:15,871	| IOT122 |	Right here that you were offering lorwyn in my market are you and your spending this I like to work with you on how I can help my device
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,151	| IOT122 |	Right onto them to network
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:18,687	| IOT122 |	Still working in Spanish
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:26,111	| IOT122 |	Got it okay well Alex thanks so much for coming on and sharing all this great information about Laurel or away
