EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:13,056	| IOT007 |	Higginbotham if you are listening to The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:00:13,568	00:00:16,128	| IOT007 |	We are back and here is my co-host
EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:17,408	| IOT007 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:20,224	| IOT007 |	Welcome to the show
EDL	00:00:20,736	00:00:25,088	| IOT007 |	We've got a lot of news today we've got some exciting Gadget reviews and we have a great guest
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:28,160	| IOT007 |	Who actually is also the CEO of the gadget company
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:28,928	| IOT007 |	So we're having a gadget
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:33,792	| IOT007 |	You are
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:37,120	| IOT007 |	And I'm a business gal and acatic how so many
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:41,728	| IOT007 |	So let's get started with the exciting news that is not exciting
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:42,752	| IOT007 |	Actually it's kind of sad
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:46,080	| IOT007 |	That's a terrible Segway so ninja blocks
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:50,688	| IOT007 |	Company out of Australia that was making a really cool
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,968	| IOT007 |	Home hub
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:52,480	| IOT007 |	Device
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:54,528	| IOT007 |	Call the Ninja sphere
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:55,808	| IOT007 |	It looked kind of like
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:59,136	| IOT007 |	Heck it looks like an alien ship that was
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,928	| IOT007 |	Landed on your coffee
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:05,024	| IOT007 |	Table basically it was part Spear and part pyramid they called it a Stearman
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:12,192	| IOT007 |	They did and we had we had Pete Moore who was a co-founder of the Ninja sphere
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:14,496	| IOT007 |	Made by the company that made ninja blocks
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:19,616	| IOT007 |	On the podcast about a year-and-a-half ago and he talked about kind of
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:22,944	| IOT007 |	Thinking of his thinking about the market and designing this thing and
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:26,272	| IOT007 |	Kind of the differentiating factor about the ninja sphere
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,320	| IOT007 |	Was that it used gesture
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:30,624	| IOT007 |	Controls that used EMF actually
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,416	| IOT007 |	To figure out
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:36,256	| IOT007 |	Where your hands were in in the room
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:39,072	| IOT007 |	Seafood Chester to the ninja sphere to turn your lights on
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,096	| IOT007 |	Or
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:44,960	| IOT007 |	Actually was mostly used for lighting but I thought that was a very nice you I think
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:51,872	| IOT007 |	Cuz it it kind of conceited it maybe you don't have your phone on you all the time and maybe you don't want to pull it out of your
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,640	| IOT007 |	Pocket
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,920	| IOT007 |	And open it up and
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:54,944	| IOT007 |	Turn on your lights
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:56,736	| IOT007 |	Comedian
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,784	| IOT007 |	This is true
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,368	| IOT007 |	And I tell you it was an interesting looking product
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,416	| IOT007 |	It was really expensive I'm in a hit
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,208	| IOT007 |	Carbon cost of a normally do but
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:07,744	| IOT007 |	$249
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,768	| IOT007 |	It was a bit much I think
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:12,352	| IOT007 |	It was it was expensive and so what happened
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,912	| IOT007 |	They wrote a blogpost about it
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,192	| IOT007 |	They ran out of money
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:17,728	| IOT007 |	They
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,800	| IOT007 |	They spend a lot of time developing the sphere
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,568	| IOT007 |	And
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,616	| IOT007 |	Basically
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,384	| IOT007 |	They
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,664	| IOT007 |	They couldn't raise their next round
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:30,272	| IOT007 |	And all but 300 of the Ninja Spears were built in box
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,040	| IOT007 |	And the ready to go
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,344	| IOT007 |	So they are going to ship those
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| IOT007 |	If you ordered one
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,672	| IOT007 |	And you didn't
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,232	| IOT007 |	If you ordered one and
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,536	| IOT007 |	You're one of the 300 that
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| IOT007 |	I can't make
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,632	| IOT007 |	They're going to prioritize those by those who
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,912	| IOT007 |	Ordered more than one
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:51,008	| IOT007 |	Set the ordered multiple ninja Spears you're probably only going to get one of them
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,592	| IOT007 |	And they're hopeful that maybe they'll get
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:03:00,224	| IOT007 |	Somewhere someone nice will give them additional money to get those last three hundred
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,088	| IOT007 |	If you bought from the site within the last few months you'll be getting a refund
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,880	| IOT007 |	And
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,464	| IOT007 |	Kickstarter backer Kickstarter backers will receive their Spears
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,256	| IOT007 |	I'm in
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| IOT007 |	Sanders
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,072	| IOT007 |	Yeah it is sad
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,376	| IOT007 |	And
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:17,888	| IOT007 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| IOT007 |	That is
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,216	| IOT007 |	That is sad
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:28,128	| IOT007 |	And there's the only other thing I would like to point out is they did talk about like the cloud cost because
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,432	| IOT007 |	How to make the ninja blocks
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| IOT007 |	They have
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,552	| IOT007 |	Scale back some of the
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:40,160	| IOT007 |	Features and servers associated with the ninja block service
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,976	| IOT007 |	So they're going to try to keep that as well
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,512	| IOT007 |	To keep that going as long as possible
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:49,120	| IOT007 |	So you should expect it may go down
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,656	| IOT007 |	But they're going to let you know before
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,984	| IOT007 |	And that's kind of an interesting conundrum for anyone
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,544	| IOT007 |	Who buys into some of these cloud
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,824	| IOT007 |	Back products
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:02,176	| IOT007 |	I was just going to say that we've talked about this past shows how
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,712	| IOT007 |	I kind of prefer to have a
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:07,296	| IOT007 |	A Smart Hub in my house that's not really cloud connected but
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,088	| IOT007 |	More something that I'm in control of
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:13,952	| IOT007 |	Because while this is one of the reasons I think there's a couple of the reasons that I would prefer that but this is a Big E
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,536	| IOT007 |	It is in you know Cloud connected services do
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,327	| IOT007 |	Kum & Go it's it's very hard
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,143	| IOT007 |	I guess if you don't have a big back or two
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,215	| IOT007 |	Even if you do have to be back or Sony actually
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,239	| IOT007 |	There's a internet
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:29,311	| IOT007 |	Austin's 404 kind of Tumblr that
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:32,127	| IOT007 |	Tracks this sort of thing there's actually not that many products on it but
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:36,479	| IOT007 |	Sony's aibo robot I don't know if you remember the robot dogs they were like
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| IOT007 |	2005
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| IOT007 |	2006
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,807	| IOT007 |	Been around awhile
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| IOT007 |	Sewing
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:44,671	| IOT007 |	2014 they finally took those offline officially
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,463	| IOT007 |	So they stop supporting them
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,743	| IOT007 |	There no more
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,583	| IOT007 |	Little doggies
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| IOT007 |	They put him down
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,215	| IOT007 |	I flipped a switch and put my puppy down
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,311	| IOT007 |	Companies don't support their products forever
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,591	| IOT007 |	That is the moral here
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| IOT007 |	So sad news
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,199	| IOT007 |	I'm for the ninja blocks
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,735	| IOT007 |	I Spy
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,039	| IOT007 |	I think they did it the right way they were very transfer
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:18,719	| IOT007 |	You know you can feel in their posts that they wrote that they were kind of bummed about this whole thing
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,047	| IOT007 |	They're doing what they can and they're trying to let
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,399	| IOT007 |	What does
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,423	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:30,495	| IOT007 |	There we go now we'll move on to
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,287	| IOT007 |	A big company doing something
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,055	| IOT007 |	I don't really know if
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,103	| IOT007 |	Happy or not it's just a big company doing something
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,431	| IOT007 |	Today at The Internet of Things World Conference in San
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| IOT007 |	Cisco
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| IOT007 |	Samsung
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT007 |	You may have heard of him
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,039	| IOT007 |	Has launched a
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:46,879	| IOT007 |	Series of chips called the Arctic chips for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,975	| IOT007 |	Benton done in competition with Intel
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,791	| IOT007 |	Qualcomm broadcom freescale
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,559	| IOT007 |	Nxp
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,583	| IOT007 |	All the other
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,095	| IOT007 |	Atmel
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:00,447	| IOT007 |	Really every building tips for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,775	| IOT007 |	So there are three of them
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:04,543	| IOT007 |	There's the Arctic
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,335	| IOT007 |	1 which is a
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,151	| IOT007 |	Tiny little looks like in MCU
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,247	| IOT007 |	Bluetooth and A9 access
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,271	| IOT007 |	Sensor looks like a
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,831	| IOT007 |	Nine access
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,367	| IOT007 |	Gyroscope accelerometer
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:22,207	| IOT007 |	Addison's motion sensor on there on the Arctic. IO site
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,231	| IOT007 |	Okay
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,535	| IOT007 |	And that is running
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:30,143	| IOT007 |	Embedded artists the nucleus OS its artists from mentor Graphics I know that
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:35,263	| IOT007 |	I've heard of other companies using this there's a good Chilean million artists out there so
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,311	| IOT007 |	Is that your flavor of the month
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,079	| IOT007 |	That's what it's running
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:41,919	| IOT007 |	And that's design for really small
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,431	| IOT007 |	Things
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| IOT007 |	I don't know if it would run in watches that's my guess
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,575	| IOT007 |	Watches kind of things designed to work with the phone
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,391	| IOT007 |	And then the bigger versions
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:51,903	| IOT007 |	AR
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:56,255	| IOT007 |	Downtown and smarter phone is kind I think maybe
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,047	| IOT007 |	Smart Hub and
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| IOT007 |	Door lock
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:07,775	| IOT007 |	It's hard to say it's hard to say me when you look at the the specifications for the Arctic 5 in the Arctic 10 you start
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,823	| IOT007 |	Getting close to a glow and smartphone
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,615	| IOT007 |	Processors here in Reno
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,687	| IOT007 |	Dual core and octa-core arm chips
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:18,271	| IOT007 |	512 Meg memory or 2 gig of memory
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,319	| IOT007 |	You get the addition of
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:24,927	| IOT007 |	Zigbee and Wi-Fi the 802 11bgn flavors
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:27,487	| IOT007 |	So you start getting you no more until
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,023	| IOT007 |	It was like a low on smartphone
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,631	| IOT007 |	But this is the Internet of Things Kevin so we're Thinkin thermostat
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,399	| IOT007 |	Connect sub
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,703	| IOT007 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,215	| IOT007 |	Feel like
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,495	| IOT007 |	Smartphones
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:42,847	| IOT007 |	Police seem pretty powerful force a thermostat or something I mean they're talking about
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,663	| IOT007 |	Hardware video codecs you know of
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:51,039	| IOT007 |	720p decoding at 30 frames a second for the Arctic 5 in
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,087	| IOT007 |	1080p video decoding Sullivan
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:57,951	| IOT007 |	But it seems like overkill for a thermostat I don't know what they're going to use these for
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,743	| IOT007 |	Well I mean maybe if you
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,279	| IOT007 |	You stick it I mean if you think about
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,351	| IOT007 |	Kind of a connected wall plate for example
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,399	| IOT007 |	You might want that to run
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,447	| IOT007 |	That's what you just can't
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:12,287	| IOT007 |	Maybe not Netflix but you might want to run videos who's at your front door or a tree
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,311	| IOT007 |	Brown birds
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,591	| IOT007 |	Your canoe
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,639	| IOT007 |	Office
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,151	| IOT007 |	I have no I
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| IOT007 |	Sew in
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| IOT007 |	Honestly
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:24,319	| IOT007 |	They're probably I assume they're repurposing
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:28,159	| IOT007 |	I think I read somewhere that they're repurposing their exynos line
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,671	| IOT007 |	4
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,743	| IOT007 |	Chips so
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,023	| IOT007 |	It makes sense that
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,839	| IOT007 |	It might be a little Overkill but
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:41,215	| IOT007 |	You start out with some intelligence in one place and you never say Kush
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,263	| IOT007 |	I wish I could do less with
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,847	| IOT007 |	Whatever says that
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:49,919	| IOT007 |	Not nothing you typically not a good strategy for business no
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,199	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,991	| IOT007 |	So that's what these are and
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,271	| IOT007 |	On the OS side
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,575	| IOT007 |	I was kind of surprised
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| IOT007 |	I don't know if you were but
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,135	| IOT007 |	They aren't running tizen
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:06,303	| IOT007 |	Yeah that does surprise me because you and I sat at that it's a small world keynote at CES were
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,351	| IOT007 |	Samsung song about Internet of Things
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:11,935	| IOT007 |	And we're all going to come together in one ginormous Global Group Hug
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:15,263	| IOT007 |	And Tyson's going to be the platform the ties it all together for Internet of Things
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,335	| IOT007 |	There's no mention ties at all instead it's all
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,151	| IOT007 |	Yo Arduino that uses nucleus OS
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,735	| IOT007 |	Programming in Java and C + + +
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| IOT007 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,295	| IOT007 |	Where's the worst Eisen
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,343	| IOT007 |	I don't know but there is so there is
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:35,231	| IOT007 |	For development environment on these chips they do support groovy which is what the SmartThings
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,559	| IOT007 |	Home hub is using in SmartThings was bought by Samsung
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| IOT007 |	For those of you guys out
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,863	| IOT007 |	There who are like
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,887	| IOT007 |	High on SmartThings
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:46,239	| IOT007 |	That is the Samsung chip announcement
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:51,871	| IOT007 |	Well we'll move into broadcom also it internet-of-things world had an announcement that
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,431	| IOT007 |	A lot of people might be excited about
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:58,271	| IOT007 |	One is a chip that does faster Bluetooth CC speed of
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| IOT007 |	Give me the rates
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,087	| IOT007 |	Yay
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,647	| IOT007 |	That'll actually be good in your watch
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:07,743	| IOT007 |	Oh please hit need to let me just say that right now
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:14,143	| IOT007 |	Because all the appdata on the Apple watch coming from the iPhone it says it's faster sometimes for me to just blow the phone
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,655	| IOT007 |	I kid you not
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,215	| IOT007 |	I wouldn't doubt that is this the first generation
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,567	| IOT007 |	I probably excited about is the
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,127	| IOT007 |	Is a software
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| IOT007 |	Platform
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,687	| IOT007 |	On top of it
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| IOT007 |	Chips
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,735	| IOT007 |	4
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| IOT007 |	Developers and
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:33,599	| IOT007 |	This one they're adding homekit to it software platform
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| IOT007 |	And as part of that
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:35,647	| IOT007 |	It's called wicked
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,439	| IOT007 |	Platform
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:40,255	| IOT007 |	They're supporting homekit
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,023	| IOT007 |	And
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:45,631	| IOT007 |	We're kind of reading in between the lines are actually we're not it talks about it directly
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,703	| IOT007 |	It talks about how it's supporting the bridging strategy
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| IOT007 |	For homekit
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,031	| IOT007 |	And basically
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:57,919	| IOT007 |	It talks about having the bridge and capability to connect in points that are not homekit enabled
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,735	| IOT007 |	Yay
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:05,343	| IOT007 |	Yeah in fact they specifically Give an example they say this was a product like a bluetooth smart light bulb
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,647	| IOT007 |	To connect to a Smart plug containing brockhampton
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| IOT007 |	Protons wecan module
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:12,767	| IOT007 |	Creating a bridge from the bulb to the homekit supported app on there
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,791	| IOT007 |	IOS device
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,303	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,327	| IOT007 |	Dairy Queen
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,119	| IOT007 |	So yes and it says
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,911	| IOT007 |	It'll make it easier for customers
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,495	| IOT007 |	Using Siri or iOS application stink
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| IOT007 |	Patrol
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,287	| IOT007 |	Homekit enabled
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,335	| IOT007 |	Just kidding
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,383	| IOT007 |	That's not that's not in
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:33,247	| IOT007 |	I got all excited like I could use Siri to control mine on home can not yet not yet
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,319	| IOT007 |	Not yet my suspicions would be Apple products
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:39,647	| IOT007 |	Woodforest support that and then Applewood opencv upload more
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,207	| IOT007 |	That's the hope
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,719	| IOT007 |	Apple stuff
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| IOT007 |	Now
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:48,351	| IOT007 |	So that's that's kind of the big news for this week I can't think of other big news items
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,655	| IOT007 |	So here we got sadness
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,423	| IOT007 |	And we've got chips
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,751	| IOT007 |	How about a little
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,543	| IOT007 |	Joyous light bulb
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,823	| IOT007 |	Review
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:04,223	| IOT007 |	Joyous life reviews I love it so yeah it last week I sent Kevin I had the shoe folks send Kevin's
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:09,343	| IOT007 |	Some light bulbs so he could actually get in on this internet of things and smart home stuff that we always talk about
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,367	| IOT007 |	It's about time right now
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:13,695	| IOT007 |	It is about time yes I did not have to unpack her like my own
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| IOT007 |	Stuff
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,999	| IOT007 |	From my
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,791	| IOT007 |	Move that didn't happen last year
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,351	| IOT007 |	Instead the Hue bulbs were sent here alone with a bridge
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,655	| IOT007 |	You were right on the last year you said this and take me like
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,191	| IOT007 |	5 minutes to set up
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:29,311	| IOT007 |	Kudos to the folks at Hugh because it took even last time I mean literally
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,591	| IOT007 |	Pulled out the
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:34,687	| IOT007 |	Raspberry Pi that I have connected to my home router over ethernet
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:38,527	| IOT007 |	And I plugged in the hue light Bridge instead in its place
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:43,135	| IOT007 |	Literally press the button on that had tube light bulbs already turned on screwed into the
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,927	| IOT007 |	Various textures and boom that was it
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:49,023	| IOT007 |	I never just a matter of getting the apps but Hue app on my iPhone
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:52,607	| IOT007 |	And I'll be honest I like the Hue app
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,935	| IOT007 |	Far better on my phone that I do on my Apple watch more than a second
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:02,335	| IOT007 |	You obviously said Stacy you've used up the Hue app so you know what it's like you can
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,407	| IOT007 |	Pick the color of any and all lights you can change the
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:08,479	| IOT007 |	Brightness on any of them so I was having fun with that
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,247	| IOT007 |	The iPhone
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:15,391	| IOT007 |	And then because I do have an Apple Watch it says hey we got Apple watch sport do you want to put that on your Apple watch I said sure
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,439	| IOT007 |	It's kind of limited
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,999	| IOT007 |	I'd say it's more like the
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,535	| IOT007 |	Like a widget
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,559	| IOT007 |	Basically did
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:27,935	| IOT007 |	Literally you pre-load certain scenes for your lights on to your Apple watch if you got off on the phone
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,519	| IOT007 |	And then when you go in the Hue app on your watch you have those scenes
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| IOT007 |	I just have them
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,103	| IOT007 |	And the lights change so
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:39,455	| IOT007 |	You can't control brightness there I would love to see that digital Crown be a nice little
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:41,503	| IOT007 |	Raise or lower the brightness level
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,319	| IOT007 |	But maybe that's not possible just yet so
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:47,391	| IOT007 |	It is early days as you said the Apple watches version 1
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,975	| IOT007 |	I don't have to use my phone to actually change the colors of the lights are
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,023	| IOT007 |	You know cuz I can do that from The Watch
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:56,607	| IOT007 |	But it still has a little bit of control to be desired yet
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:03,519	| IOT007 |	Have you seen on other watch apps a little bit less of the widget feeling more of a true
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,031	| IOT007 |	Absol
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:09,407	| IOT007 |	You know I didn't look for I know there are other third party app
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:12,223	| IOT007 |	But I really just wanted to use the native
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,271	| IOT007 |	Hue app to give it a full
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,039	| IOT007 |	Taskus
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:20,159	| IOT007 |	I think most people who buy these bulbs are probably not going to go search around for apps are going to follow the instructions in the
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:22,207	| IOT007 |	In the cat and if they are going to go get my
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:24,255	| IOT007 |	My app from for iOS or Android
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,535	| IOT007 |	I don't know if they're going to venture beyond that
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,839	| IOT007 |	Oh I was thinking more
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:31,167	| IOT007 |	Less specific and more just in general on other
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,959	| IOT007 |	Apps
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,983	| IOT007 |	Okay well
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:38,591	| IOT007 |	Play honestly the only true native apps on the Apple watch a really those from Apple itself
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,383	| IOT007 |	Even though with the watch
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,175	| IOT007 |	Kid platforms available
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:48,575	| IOT007 |	Developers can't create native app so basically what they are they're all extensions of iPhone apps
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,879	| IOT007 |	Right now meaning they're very much like widgets
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:54,207	| IOT007 |	You can do notifications and glances and such but again
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,839	| IOT007 |	I'm seeing more of them that look and feel just like the widget you might add to your
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,655	| IOT007 |	Your notification screen on iOS right now
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,447	| IOT007 |	It again early days
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:07,263	| IOT007 |	Apple hasn't really opened it up yet for
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,287	| IOT007 |	Richer functionality
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,079	| IOT007 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| IOT007 |	So now
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,711	| IOT007 |	Edwin Sumo CA an insteon review
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| IOT007 |	Right
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,271	| IOT007 |	You just you just wet my appetite
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,319	| IOT007 |	Now I want the insteon
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:27,999	| IOT007 |	I'm kind of tired from screwing any three light bulbs to be
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,511	| IOT007 |	Describe my life
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:32,095	| IOT007 |	It's on my to-do list
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:34,655	| IOT007 |	I look at my Apple watch in the to do zits on there
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,167	| IOT007 |	There we go
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,703	| IOT007 |	I can't wait to see
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT007 |	All right
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:41,311	| IOT007 |	I will report back actually on me
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,103	| IOT007 |	On the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:47,967	| IOT007 |	In the house just a quick little reporting back I've noticed it getting a little wonky or lately
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,295	| IOT007 |	Hue Lights
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,575	| IOT007 |	In the last
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,599	| IOT007 |	Week
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| IOT007 |	It has been
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,463	| IOT007 |	It has responded when I asked it
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,231	| IOT007 |	To turn off the lights
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,815	| IOT007 |	It said okay but then it doesn't turn them off
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,935	| IOT007 |	It's it's kind of interesting I'm trying to figure out what is going on on the back end
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:11,519	| IOT007 |	Or maybe we need like a full reboot of the system
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,335	| IOT007 |	I don't know so
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,431	| IOT007 |	I reached out to Amazon to try to figure out what might be happening
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,967	| IOT007 |	On the back end
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,783	| IOT007 |	And I guess I should reach out to you as well
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,575	| IOT007 |	I'm just to see it because
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,623	| IOT007 |	And then I'm curious readers
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:32,767	| IOT007 |	I guess you could be listeners listeners noticing the same thing if you got this
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,047	| IOT007 |	You know tight end
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:37,119	| IOT007 |	Let me know info at iot podcast
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT007 |	Dot-com
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,399	| IOT007 |	Because
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,191	| IOT007 |	It's a little weird
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:43,519	| IOT007 |	Cuz it it had been working perfectly and now it's getting a little
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| IOT007 |	A little laggy and a little
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,311	| IOT007 |	Iffy
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,335	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,639	| IOT007 |	Silly silly Cloud systems
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,431	| IOT007 |	I know how do I reboot the cloud
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,039	| IOT007 |	Okay so we're going to start a new segment on the show
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:57,087	| IOT007 |	We're going to see how it works but we're calling it
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:01,183	| IOT007 |	It's in the spirit of it podcast and other clever naming
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,999	| IOT007 |	The 5-minute device review
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:10,399	| IOT007 |	What will it be let's see probably five minutes of device review
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,703	| IOT007 |	Where to take 7 minutes and talk about flowers
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,263	| IOT007 |	So this is
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,031	| IOT007 |	5 minutes
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| IOT007 |	On a device
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:21,663	| IOT007 |	I haven't actually time this so it may actually not be 5 minutes may take a little more a little less
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:24,223	| IOT007 |	But this week's device is going to be
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,991	| IOT007 |	The Mayo
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:28,063	| IOT007 |	And demaio is an armband
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,599	| IOT007 |	That you guys
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,135	| IOT007 |	You put it on your
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:31,647	| IOT007 |	Forearm
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:34,207	| IOT007 |	And it is a gesture control
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,719	| IOT007 |	Device
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,255	| IOT007 |	It is brand new
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| IOT007 |	Well it's actually not that day was about a year old
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:43,679	| IOT007 |	You can buy it now from Amazon and you have been able to buy it for the last
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| IOT007 |	Couple months
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:44,959	| IOT007 |	4
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:48,543	| IOT007 |	$199 it's from a company in Canada
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,079	| IOT007 |	And
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,103	| IOT007 |	It's called Thelma claves
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:59,039	| IOT007 |	And they sent me one because on Thursday they're announcing basically that you can now use them IO to control press
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,551	| IOT007 |	Presentations
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:04,159	| IOT007 |	I have been excited about the Mayo since it was announced back in like
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| IOT007 |	2013
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,999	| IOT007 |	Because I think gesture control is really fascinating
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,327	| IOT007 |	I've been playing with it all the way back in
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,095	| IOT007 |	2012
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,655	| IOT007 |	Thinking about like using
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,679	| IOT007 |	A disco
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:18,495	| IOT007 |	A disco kind of rmotion till I turn on my lights
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,055	| IOT007 |	Party boat I thought I'd be like
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,079	| IOT007 |	Superfine
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| IOT007 |	Even then Stacy was hooked on the lights
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,175	| IOT007 |	Even then yes
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,199	| IOT007 |	I'm I'm hard to live with
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:32,063	| IOT007 |	And in my disco our motion is is over-the-top completely
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,855	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,623	| IOT007 |	I just did
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:38,719	| IOT007 |	There's a place for gesture in the home and with the Internet of Things
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,767	| IOT007 |	So when they announced this I was like huh
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,559	| IOT007 |	This could be really interesting
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:46,655	| IOT007 |	So having tested it for only about an hour or so
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,751	| IOT007 |	I think it's too much money
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,311	| IOT007 |	To spend on a very limited use case
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,847	| IOT007 |	Unless
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,639	| IOT007 |	You have
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:59,199	| IOT007 |	Severe Mobility problems
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:06,879	| IOT007 |	The presentation thing was not as interesting to me because they don't give a lot of presentations that I actually think if you were giving a
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| IOT007 |	A lot of presentations
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,207	| IOT007 |	Some of the gestures like double tap in
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,767	| IOT007 |	Making a fist and rotating them
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,559	| IOT007 |	Would actually be very distracting
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,631	| IOT007 |	4 people watching you give the presentation
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,655	| IOT007 |	It would be kind of like
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:23,775	| IOT007 |	What what is she doing up there why is she doing that little weird mining dance thing with her arms
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,055	| IOT007 |	But
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,871	| IOT007 |	You can actually assign mouse keys to
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| IOT007 |	De Mayo
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,711	| IOT007 |	And keyboard keys to the Mayo
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,271	| IOT007 |	Fairly easily and that's what I was playing with
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,319	| IOT007 |	And so you can actually
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,391	| IOT007 |	Instead of like clicking on your mouse
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,671	| IOT007 |	You can actually
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,207	| IOT007 |	Assignment
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,767	| IOT007 |	This rotation so instead of a double tap
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,559	| IOT007 |	I assigned a fist rotation
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,375	| IOT007 |	Is that was actually kind of fun
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT007 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,191	| IOT007 |	Exactly practical
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,983	| IOT007 |	I think I would have to spend a lot more time
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,519	| IOT007 |	Figuring out the
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:59,615	| IOT007 |	Smoothest Jester and then training myself to actually
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,663	| IOT007 |	Instead of using a mouse just using
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,223	| IOT007 |	Tamao and my body
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:05,247	| IOT007 |	Right
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,807	| IOT007 |	We had a lot of promise and
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,831	| IOT007 |	Since I have
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:11,391	| IOT007 |	Especially towards the summer a lot of carpal tunnel
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:17,535	| IOT007 |	I thought it might be worth it cuz I actually spend 75 or 80 bucks on like a really fancy
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,351	| IOT007 |	Sideways Mouse
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| IOT007 |	Another hundred and something on
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,983	| IOT007 |	Dragon dictation software so
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:30,079	| IOT007 |	Yeah I think you're hitting the nail on the head I see this more as a
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,359	| IOT007 |	Essex
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,943	| IOT007 |	Tool for people have limited Mobility because this doesn't just
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:39,039	| IOT007 |	Just measure how your forearm itself is moving but as you said
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,575	| IOT007 |	You can make a fist you can
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,599	| IOT007 |	Do different
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,391	| IOT007 |	Gestures at the finger level
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,671	| IOT007 |	Because they're
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:46,207	| IOT007 |	Special
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,231	| IOT007 |	It has sensors that
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,023	| IOT007 |	Can actually track finger movement as well
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:55,423	| IOT007 |	So that there's a lot you could do with it and for somebody with limited Mobility I could see a lot of value here
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| IOT007 |	Exactly it
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,751	| IOT007 |	Because what it does is it
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,311	| IOT007 |	It rests right in your forearm and it's actually
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,591	| IOT007 |	It seems
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| IOT007 |	Pretty comfortable to me
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,919	| IOT007 |	I don't know how long the battery last
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,223	| IOT007 |	And it does take up a USB
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,015	| IOT007 |	Port for the Bluetooth
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,527	| IOT007 |	Connectivity
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,063	| IOT007 |	If your if
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:14,623	| IOT007 |	Short on ports that something to think about
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,440	| IOT007 |	End
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,256	| IOT007 |	Like the tapping there's there's
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| IOT007 |	The finger motion there's fist
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,096	| IOT007 |	And then there's like a
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,632	| IOT007 |	Lego
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,424	| IOT007 |	Forward backwards risk music
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,960	| IOT007 |	I meant with your hand that's kind of
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,520	| IOT007 |	Fun and useful and I'm not sure
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,032	| IOT007 |	Again
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:38,432	| IOT007 |	I haven't I haven't played with it enough for set up the right sequence that I would feel comfortable using it all day long yet
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:42,016	| IOT007 |	It's definitely worth playing with
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,064	| IOT007 |	Or something like that or even
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,392	| IOT007 |	I would be really interested in getting a physical therapist
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,440	| IOT007 |	Play with it and set up
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:54,560	| IOT007 |	Something for me or for someone who's having a hard time using it
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,840	| IOT007 |	I think that would be kind of
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,144	| IOT007 |	Definitely worth paying for it if you
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,936	| IOT007 |	Could set up something effectively
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:04,800	| IOT007 |	Sure I could see potential industrial uses as well robotics
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,336	| IOT007 |	Control and such like that
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:12,736	| IOT007 |	Picnic, collapsed at that you should get a full day use out of a single charge so the battery should last you all day but
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:15,808	| IOT007 |	I don't say how much of a day that is in constant use or
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,112	| IOT007 |	Occasionally yours about the day so
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,648	| IOT007 |	My mouse uses
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,928	| IOT007 |	Pretty constant so
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:24,768	| IOT007 |	I did not I did not have there is no Disco
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| IOT007 |	Disk arm movement
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,816	| IOT007 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,632	| IOT007 |	I'm going to have to wait for

EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,616	| IOT007 |	You make a product that
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:50,016	| IOT007 |	Actually I want I really wanted one of these for a while and I've tried a couple in have been a little disappointed in summer
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:53,856	| IOT007 |	A couple of yours but couple of other products in this kind of
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,136	| IOT007 |	World Of Products
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:58,464	| IOT007 |	So you make a connected doorbell that offers a camera
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| IOT007 |	And when someone
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,792	| IOT007 |	Ring the doorbell
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:06,656	| IOT007 |	It sends a notification to my phone and it also can send me a video
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:08,704	| IOT007 |	Yes exactly
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:14,336	| IOT007 |	Skybell is a wifi-enabled video doorbell and it replaces your current doorbell
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:17,152	| IOT007 |	And I don't actually have to be on my Wi-Fi network in that case
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:18,944	| IOT007 |	That's correct
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT007 |	Absolutely you can be
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:26,624	| IOT007 |	UPS guy just leave it at the door.
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:28,928	| IOT007 |	Sign for it
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,000	| IOT007 |	Exactly
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,792	| IOT007 |	Calling you if you don't leave it there
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:37,632	| IOT007 |	There were there we have it I could beg maybe it would happen
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:44,288	| IOT007 |	The skybell is available for 199 you can buy it on amazon.com
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,104	| IOT007 |	Bestbuy.com and if you want to see it in person
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:49,408	| IOT007 |	Have to go into a Best Buy store
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:54,016	| IOT007 |	We're having on the show because this week you guys actually just signed a really big deal or I think it's a big deal
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,064	| IOT007 |	You signed a deal with Comcast
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:02,976	| IOT007 |	And you are one of nine actual Partners in their Xfinity home business and
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,792	| IOT007 |	I thought it was kind of significant what did you think about this deal
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,584	| IOT007 |	I didn't get to marry
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,888	| IOT007 |	Significant

EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,560	| IOT007 |	You may be above all else.
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,096	| IOT007 |	Their attitude about the
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,376	| IOT007 |	Space

EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,864	| IOT007 |	So we wanted to be a part of that
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,656	| IOT007 |	Excited about it

EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,600	| IOT007 |	That's a big deal to so
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| IOT007 |	How are you kind of
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:41,280	| IOT007 |	Managing all these Partnerships are how are you kind of thinking about how you're going to sign these Partnerships going forward as a
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,072	| IOT007 |	Start up with kind of limited resources
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,120	| IOT007 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:49,216	| IOT007 |	The Apple announcement for homekit was
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:51,008	| IOT007 |	Almost a year ago now
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:51,520	| IOT007 |	It was
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| IOT007 |	Such a big moment
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,872	| IOT007 |	At that time
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,384	| IOT007 |	We work
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,944	| IOT007 |	Just barely under a year old

EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,304	| IOT007 |	It was a big validation for
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| IOT007 |	Geico
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,632	| IOT007 |	The device but I think also skybell

EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,528	| IOT007 |	Will let me see cuz
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,600	| IOT007 |	In previous conversations you've actually told me about
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:19,744	| IOT007 |	Kind of when apple called you up that first time to tell you about being a home kit partner asked you about it
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:24,864	| IOT007 |	Because you know they didn't put your name up on stage without letting you know first thank God you might have
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,144	| IOT007 |	I don't know what would have happened
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,728	| IOT007 |	So why don't you
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:33,312	| IOT007 |	Tell us about that because I mean for any company in this space
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:39,456	| IOT007 |	Having Apple give you a call and say hey you want to work together that's probably pretty cool
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:42,272	| IOT007 |	I don't know if they've never called me up and said hey you want to work
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:43,296	| IOT007 |	Together
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:46,112	| IOT007 |	Absolutely right
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,624	| IOT007 |	It was
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:48,928	| IOT007 |	Really cool I mean
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:52,000	| IOT007 |	That's that's what you want right so when we
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:56,352	| IOT007 |	Start a company
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,144	| IOT007 |	Next to Wi-Fi doorbell so
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,936	| IOT007 |	People can see who's at their door
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:03,520	| IOT007 |	We had an idea who we wanted to work with
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,312	| IOT007 |	And he's already I wouldn't it be nice
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,616	| IOT007 |	We did that
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:09,664	| IOT007 |	Basically
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,688	| IOT007 |	13 +

EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,256	| IOT007 |	Yes I have that happened
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,304	| IOT007 |	In between those two
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,072	| IOT007 |	X.

EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,216	| IOT007 |	I first had that conversation
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:35,008	| IOT007 |	And they come to you right
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,544	| IOT007 |	Track
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,336	| IOT007 |	Big they reach out to us
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:41,664	| IOT007 |	We were only a couple months old
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:45,248	| IOT007 |	It was just starting out an Indiegogo and finish
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:49,088	| IOT007 |	It was just amazing and we just didn't think that would happen
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,112	| IOT007 |	So quickly
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,160	| IOT007 |	And have them
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:54,208	| IOT007 |	Reach out to us to just save
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,232	| IOT007 |	We love what you're doing
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:56,512	| IOT007 |	And
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,352	| IOT007 |	Don't why don't we start having
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,376	| IOT007 |	Conversations
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:06,752	| IOT007 |	Curly it is
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:12,128	| IOT007 |	We just weren't we couldn't be happier in
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| IOT007 |	Incredible
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:21,088	| IOT007 |	So speaking of all of this I have to ask you and
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,368	| IOT007 |	When
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,392	| IOT007 |	When is Apple
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:26,208	| IOT007 |	Going to actually release their home kit product
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:29,024	| IOT007 |	Estates at the top one
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,840	| IOT007 |	I don't know if
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:35,424	| IOT007 |	I'm going to space where I can answer that for you I'm really sorry but
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:37,216	| IOT007 |	Yeah but have to plead the Fifth
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,288	| IOT007 |	Sofitel B
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,312	| IOT007 |	You have to kill me
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,336	| IOT007 |	Is that is that what I'm hearing
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:46,432	| IOT007 |	Yeah that's what I'm about
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:52,576	| IOT007 |	I even like how you're he won't even threatened to kill me here in the here on the podcast you're so that you're so nice
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:56,928	| IOT007 |	So I will wait for then I will I will keep my
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:59,232	| IOT007 |	My I will wait for my Apple products
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,000	| IOT007 |	And
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:02,560	| IOT007 |	Maybe maybe I'll cross him off my list of things I'm
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,608	| IOT007 |	I'm hoping for for Mother's Day
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,936	| IOT007 |	We're probably going to be waiting but
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,216	| IOT007 |	We want mines because
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:12,544	| IOT007 |	When it comes out we're just going to be like this is awesome
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,848	| IOT007 |	All right
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:15,872	| IOT007 |	What will keep that in mind
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:16,896	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,200	| IOT007 |	Let's let's talk a little bit about
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:25,600	| IOT007 |	Kind of the limited resources and we'll tie this in with the Apple stuff because you had mentioned
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:28,160	| IOT007 |	Set design apple has a huge focus on design
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:31,744	| IOT007 |	You guys have had a huge focus on design your your product is actually
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:32,512	| IOT007 |	Very attractive
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:37,888	| IOT007 |	It does not look like a 3D printed monstrosity that you know I've duct taped to my door
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:44,288	| IOT007 |	Actually my duct tape things to my door cuz that's just how I roll but my
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:44,800	| IOT007 |	Improperly
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,080	| IOT007 |	That's how he rolls
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:47,360	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:49,408	| IOT007 |	With the resources that you have
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:55,296	| IOT007 |	How have you made your decisions because a lot of the companies who are in the space that are startups
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,880	| IOT007 |	They did they don't have infinite resources so how do you make
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:01,952	| IOT007 |	Decisions on what to focus on cuz
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,232	| IOT007 |	Ace Hardware is hard
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,512	| IOT007 |	And so
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,840	| IOT007 |	What have you guys decided to focus on and why
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:11,424	| IOT007 |	Absolutely right Hardware
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,216	| IOT007 |	Hard work was hard enough
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,008	| IOT007 |	When you just needed to make a product
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,544	| IOT007 |	NL Hardware
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:21,152	| IOT007 |	A product that has to talk to you
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:23,968	| IOT007 |	Smartphones and has to talk to platforms
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,504	| IOT007 |	And servers and
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:29,088	| IOT007 |	Are the days of making a product and putting it on the shelf or
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:33,952	| IOT007 |	So it was just a couple years ago
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,024	| IOT007 |	Restart WiFi module
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,072	| IOT007 |	Everything that we met
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:39,584	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:44,704	| IOT007 |	Big thing for us is when we need to go going to be raised $600,000
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,984	| IOT007 |	That was very helpful
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,776	| IOT007 |	Getting us the resources that we need
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,616	| IOT007 |	Experience making Hardware before
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:54,944	| IOT007 |	So we've been able to do this pretty Lane
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:34:00,576	| IOT007 |	Breaking too much money at early-stage to get through the first Federation
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:05,184	| IOT007 |	Prioritize how do we make the best video doorbell
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,720	| IOT007 |	And I think
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:11,584	| IOT007 |	We did a good job at version 1 and then we took a lot of theoretical feedback that we got there
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:12,608	| IOT007 |	Indiegogo
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:16,448	| IOT007 |	Combine that with the real world that we got
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,240	| IOT007 |	Conversion wine
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,264	| IOT007 |	And then we released
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,800	| IOT007 |	Version 2
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,312	| IOT007 |	So
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:24,384	| IOT007 |	For us we just been focused on
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:25,664	| IOT007 |	The video doorbell
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:29,504	| IOT007 |	Even before we thought about Integrations with companies in other products
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,808	| IOT007 |	We just said we got to make
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:34,112	| IOT007 |	Skybell is great as it can be
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:38,976	| IOT007 |	Skip it to give his many the feature that people have told us that they want we got to get that to them
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:41,536	| IOT007 |	Before we even integrate with other people
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,584	| IOT007 |	So that Focus
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:45,632	| IOT007 |	Till a couple of months ago
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,680	| IOT007 |	Skydive Chicago skyline
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,776	| IOT007 |	Crazy distribution offers
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,592	| IOT007 |	Call Wendy great if you did this and
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,128	| IOT007 |	This is a separate
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:56,896	| IOT007 |	Completely
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:35:00,224	| IOT007 |	But it's always just been focused
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,528	| IOT007 |	Getting our progress
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,320	| IOT007 |	So that's that's how we do
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,624	| IOT007 |	If you can't make
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,648	| IOT007 |	Hyde Park
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,416	| IOT007 |	Same time
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:11,744	| IOT007 |	So we just went back to make one product extremely well
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:13,536	| IOT007 |	Animal
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,072	| IOT007 |	Next steps
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:16,864	| IOT007 |	And speaking of next steps
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:21,472	| IOT007 |	What kind of company where do you envision the company in a couple of years because
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,520	| IOT007 |	A lot of companies
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:25,312	| IOT007 |	In the space right now
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,336	| IOT007 |	Are stuck
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,640	| IOT007 |	Thinking about Amaya Product Company
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,944	| IOT007 |	Or am I really a data company
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,968	| IOT007 |	And I hear that a lot from
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:34,272	| IOT007 |	From start-ups so
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,064	| IOT007 |	Where do you kind of see
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,088	| IOT007 |	Skybell
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,136	| IOT007 |	What we are planning
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:40,928	| IOT007 |	Reaction
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,232	| IOT007 |	Smart Home
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,000	| IOT007 |	Security company
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,072	| IOT007 |	So you know what is home security look like
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:47,584	| IOT007 |	In the future
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:51,936	| IOT007 |	And that's sort of what we're focused on so we're starting with
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:54,496	| IOT007 |	You know about that
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:36:00,384	| IOT007 |	Gives you a great sense of security at your front door where a lot of people really want it and then
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:03,200	| IOT007 |	We do use data we do collect device
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,480	| IOT007 |	Status about weekend
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,040	| IOT007 |	Understand how people are
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,064	| IOT007 |	Actually using
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,880	| IOT007 |	And what's important for us
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:13,440	| IOT007 |	Limited resources you have limited power
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,488	| IOT007 |	So you can't do everything
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,048	| IOT007 |	So if I know users are
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:20,864	| IOT007 |	Are having longer video sessions or there
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:26,496	| IOT007 |	Then we can prioritize
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,032	| IOT007 |	How we allocate power outage
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,848	| IOT007 |	Or we can fireworks
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:33,664	| IOT007 |	Somewhere so that certain features
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:35,456	| IOT007 |	I'm a prominent and others
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,992	| IOT007 |	And we definitely done that
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:40,832	| IOT007 |	Still one example early honest we got feedback that people
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:43,648	| IOT007 |	Wanted the ability to turn off their indoor chime
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,440	| IOT007 |	So that
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,464	| IOT007 |	Baby bouncing house
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:50,304	| IOT007 |	FedEx UPS driver doesn't wake up their baby
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,120	| IOT007 |	Describe how you can hit a button
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:56,448	| IOT007 |	I don't know that turned off your indoor chime
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,520	| IOT007 |	That was all based off of user feedback
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,824	| IOT007 |	It's always
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:03,616	| IOT007 |	Great feature list
EDL	00:37:03,616	00:37:06,176	| IOT007 |	And so we just been doing that along the way and
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,712	| IOT007 |	It's been working out
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,992	| IOT007 |	I'm very well.
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,296	| IOT007 |	That's the word focuses and
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:14,112	| IOT007 |	Will keep using data to
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,136	| IOT007 |	Prioritize
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:20,256	| IOT007 |	Teachers of people want in the people we know the features that people are using
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:25,376	| IOT007 |	I like it yeah I love I love that idea
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:27,424	| IOT007 |	Using both data and user feedback
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,984	| IOT007 |	To actually prioritize your future releases
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,264	| IOT007 |	It helps
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:34,336	| IOT007 |	Mitigate kind of the most vocal user problem
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:40,736	| IOT007 |	Cuz sometimes they'll tell say something but you cannot now actually look and see what people are trying to do and then you're like oh
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,504	| IOT007 |	Let's do this
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,064	| IOT007 |	You brought up an interesting thing though
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:47,136	| IOT007 |	What do you think security does look like in fiber
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:48,672	| IOT007 |	Let's just say five years
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:51,232	| IOT007 |	Would I have a connected home for example
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:55,584	| IOT007 |	I have a lot of things my security is now automated in the sense that
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,656	| IOT007 |	Devices in my house talk to each other so when I'm not home
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:04,032	| IOT007 |	It takes on the role of turning lights on and off or turning my shades of down
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:07,360	| IOT007 |	I'm in all of those are triggered based on certain events happening
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:13,248	| IOT007 |	So I'm just kind of curious like how a doorbell might play into that or maybe
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:16,064	| IOT007 |	Maybe your version of security is very different I don't know

EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:43,616	| IOT007 |	But what I really want is I want to know who's at my front door
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,408	| IOT007 |	I want to let them in remotely
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:49,504	| IOT007 |	And maybe I want to censor the backyard and something on the garage

EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:15,104	| IOT007 |	Recently I think it was the Wall Street Journal there was a great article on this being kind of a bubble the smarthome bubble
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,128	| IOT007 |	It talked about
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:20,480	| IOT007 |	Products like connect to toothbrushes I I've actually tried one of those
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:23,296	| IOT007 |	There I think there was b-connected fart detector
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:25,856	| IOT007 |	That I have not tried
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:29,696	| IOT007 |	But if I were a teenage boy I would totally race race out its
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,208	| IOT007 |	Support that
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,280	| IOT007 |	As a company that is selling
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:34,560	| IOT007 |	You know
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:38,144	| IOT007 |	A connected device in thinking I'm sure you know
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:41,216	| IOT007 |	Probably think of yourselves as may be more valuable than
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:42,240	| IOT007 |	Connected fart
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:42,752	| IOT007 |	Detector
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:45,568	| IOT007 |	Little bit
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:54,016	| IOT007 |	I didn't think it's a good product for a certain demographic
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,576	| IOT007 |	Bubble in the space
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:41:00,416	| IOT007 |	I look at you know the ryzen platforms
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:03,488	| IOT007 |	Comcast is not making a secret of its interest here
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:07,072	| IOT007 |	Google has in a nest in his buying
