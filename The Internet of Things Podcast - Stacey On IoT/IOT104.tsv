EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:25,088	| IOT104 |	Not really
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:30,464	| IOT104 |	Smart Home Improvement although I do have a new Z-Wave lock on my front door replacing the front door as we speak right now
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:33,280	| IOT104 |	Rotted wood frames and whatnot but
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,560	| IOT104 |	Yeah
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:35,328	| IOT104 |	Sorry
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:37,376	| IOT104 |	So there may be a little background noise but

EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:46,848	| IOT104 |	Voice assistant
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,896	| IOT104 |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:51,456	| IOT104 |	I missed it by Google's voice assistant on the home
EDL	00:00:51,968	00:00:54,784	| IOT104 |	Tell me about the news about the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:55,296	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:01:00,928	| IOT104 |	Then we're moving out of the assistant territory we're going to talk about what happens to Zona
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:02,720	| IOT104 |	A company that was bought
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,768	| IOT104 |	It wasn't but we'll talk about it
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:10,400	| IOT104 |	And arm has some news they bought an NB iot company and they introduced a new architecture
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:11,936	| IOT104 |	So whoop whoop
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:12,960	| IOT104 |	And finally
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:15,008	| IOT104 |	Will end it with some SmartThings news
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,032	| IOT104 |	Because
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:18,336	| IOT104 |	All right

EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:30,784	| IOT104 |	What does a cell has experience in specialized expertise to help
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:35,648	| IOT104 |	Visit wolf ssl.com
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,440	| IOT104 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:41,024	| IOT104 |	She'll get it started with things that talk
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:43,072	| IOT104 |	Bruce Sterling came on the show a couple weeks back
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,096	| IOT104 |	Did he call these talking
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:48,448	| IOT104 |	And I kind of like the name he's like
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,752	| IOT104 |	Ghetto his idea was that
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:51,776	| IOT104 |	They don't do much
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| IOT104 |	I don't know if it was
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,616	| IOT104 |	They're stubborn
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,384	| IOT104 |	He called them talking
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,664	| IOT104 |	Chalky spray really did like the
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,432	| IOT104 |	The phrase
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,968	| IOT104 |	I don't know what do you think
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:05,600	| IOT104 |	I mean there's been a big push for voice assistants obviously since
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:09,184	| IOT104 |	Say sincere restarted although you feel all the way back to like
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| IOT104 |	Windows
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:13,792	| IOT104 |	Cee days are pocket PC with Microsoft ad voice actor
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,560	| IOT104 |	Washington Pediatrics
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:18,656	| IOT104 |	At that time the tech wasn't there for natural language processing
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:23,008	| IOT104 |	You had to literally record yourself saying a command and then assign
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,288	| IOT104 |	A command to that
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,312	| IOT104 |	Recording
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,336	| IOT104 |	Canal days
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,384	| IOT104 |	Yeah those were the days all right
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:33,504	| IOT104 |	Yeah but now it's obviously much better because you have natural language processing week.
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,808	| IOT104 |	Siri we've got Google Assistant
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| IOT104 |	You got
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,392	| IOT104 |	Echo devices letters lots of
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:43,744	| IOT104 |	Voice interface says I keep coming back to it being the invisible interface at something
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,280	| IOT104 |	Works for everybody
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,304	| IOT104 |	Buying large
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:50,400	| IOT104 |	Now Samsung wants to getting on the game although it's really
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:54,240	| IOT104 |	That's a second attempt because they already had S-Voice which was their version of a
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,568	| IOT104 |	Your phone assistant but now they've got
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,592	| IOT104 |	Bixby and
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:02,688	| IOT104 |	Bixby isn't quite what I expected it to be I don't know what you thought
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,760	| IOT104 |	But what did you think are you surprised by what Bixby is
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:10,624	| IOT104 |	I wasn't actually surprised because Bixby one I really like the name
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,184	| IOT104 |	It makes me think of like some friendly alien or something
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,720	| IOT104 |	Bixby or puppy
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| IOT104 |	But
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:22,143	| IOT104 |	What it does in kind of reminded me of which was
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,703	| IOT104 |	Created by the guys who actually did Siri
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:31,103	| IOT104 |	When you talk to the guys who created Viv they were thinking about building this kind of back-end infrastructure to help
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,639	| IOT104 |	Applications talk to each other
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:38,783	| IOT104 |	So having something that basically it kind of reminded me of Google Assistant
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,319	| IOT104 |	You could that ties things together
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,111	| IOT104 |	Hear your voice
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,391	| IOT104 |	Felt like it made a lot of sense to
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,439	| IOT104 |	Yes
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:48,511	| IOT104 |	It looks like it will do that it looks like it will also
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,303	| IOT104 |	Kind of
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:54,655	| IOT104 |	Take over some of the touchscreen interface of gotten used to over the last 10 years so that way
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,703	| IOT104 |	Anything you could do by
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,543	| IOT104 |	Touching a controller button on your phone or an app
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,567	| IOT104 |	Whatever might be
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:05,151	| IOT104 |	You should theoretically be able to do with Bixby via voice
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:08,479	| IOT104 |	So there's an interface aspect of it there's also what you would talk about
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| IOT104 |	Which is the
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,343	| IOT104 |	Getting apps to talk to each other which I think developers will actually have to
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:17,183	| IOT104 |	Kind of an able but I don't have the same technical details yet
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:21,023	| IOT104 |	But it seems more interface e to me then
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,559	| IOT104 |	AI to me
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,327	| IOT104 |	I supposed
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,607	| IOT104 |	Sational
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,959	| IOT104 |	Contextual
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,471	| IOT104 |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,287	| IOT104 |	Meaning of assistant that does things
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:36,127	| IOT104 |	That or gets information contextual information right time right place
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:42,527	| IOT104 |	That's what I think of more often with assistant but you could also say assistant will help you interact with an app or apps
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| IOT104 |	And it seems like
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,063	| IOT104 |	It's
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,855	| IOT104 |	Maybe a bit of both but I think more
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,623	| IOT104 |	More the latter
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,159	| IOT104 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:51,743	| IOT104 |	In that makes sense cuz that was the expertise they bought it wasn't
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:55,327	| IOT104 |	About like having a conversation in that way I mean
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,863	| IOT104 |	I think Google is
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,911	| IOT104 |	Probably the farthest to head on
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,983	| IOT104 |	The more conversational in assistant
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,495	| IOT104 |	Level stop
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:06,335	| IOT104 |	But it doesn't have kind of the chops on the
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,639	| IOT104 |	Controlling a variety of
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,407	| IOT104 |	Thanks site
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,687	| IOT104 |	That's her
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,735	| IOT104 |	So Samsung went the other way
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,063	| IOT104 |	We should know something
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,343	| IOT104 |	Casa
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,647	| IOT104 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:26,047	| IOT104 |	Yes I don't work on the IRT team but I do work as a consultant for Android
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:28,095	| IOT104 |	Chrome Enterprise type things so yes
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,631	| IOT104 |	So my my opinions are my own
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,399	| IOT104 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:30,911	| IOT104 |	And you know
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,447	| IOT104 |	He probably won't say anything
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,471	| IOT104 |	Play nasty about
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,007	| IOT104 |	Android Enterprise
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:39,359	| IOT104 |	Hopefully I won't say anything about it
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,175	| IOT104 |	Non-sequitur
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:48,575	| IOT104 |	All right so that's Samsung Bixby will find out more because it's next week that they're going to announce the
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| IOT104 |	Air show at the phone
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,463	| IOT104 |	The alleged I said I can neither confirm nor deny
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:07:00,863	| IOT104 |	That's correct so Samsung is having an event might be multiple locations I do know that they're having an event in New York
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,911	| IOT104 |	City I think it's the 28th
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| IOT104 |	Might be Wednesday of next week so
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,495	| IOT104 |	Unfortunately will be
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:10,079	| IOT104 |	Right around the time you record our weekly show so
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,615	| IOT104 |	What that may be put off
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,663	| IOT104 |	Talking about that till the following
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,015	| IOT104 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,319	| IOT104 |	So that's talking donkey number one
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,599	| IOT104 |	Talking donkey number two
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| IOT104 |	Is the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| IOT104 |	Now is
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:26,719	| IOT104 |	Final
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:31,583	| IOT104 |	And to be honest I mean we've already heard that some phones will have
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,863	| IOT104 |	Echo integration
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:36,703	| IOT104 |	Built in such as the Huawei maybe the mate
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,727	| IOT104 |	9 May 10th
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:44,639	| IOT104 |	That was enough CES I don't believe they've implemented that yet and I guess that's a take the place of Google Assistant will give you
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| IOT104 |	Options
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:49,759	| IOT104 |	But this is actually Amazon itself not a harbor partner Amazon itself saying hey
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,783	| IOT104 |	Replay
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,575	| IOT104 |	Echo smarts into your
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,183	| IOT104 |	Strange thing to me is they put it in the Amazon shopping app
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:02,047	| IOT104 |	Which makes sense if you want to track orders by voice or order things
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:06,143	| IOT104 |	But if you want general information like right before the show I used it to get the weather
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| IOT104 |	And it works
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,423	| IOT104 |	Fine
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:12,031	| IOT104 |	But I had to go to the Amazon shopping app so why not just just have it in the app
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,799	| IOT104 |	That has her name
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,871	| IOT104 |	I have like a dozen Amazon apps on my phone
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| IOT104 |	I have
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,711	| IOT104 |	Let's eat let's try calling or madam
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,503	| IOT104 |	So the day app
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,063	| IOT104 |	I have Amazon Kindle app
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| IOT104 |	Stop the music app
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,111	| IOT104 |	The Now app
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| IOT104 |	I think I have the shop
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,439	| IOT104 |	How is it going
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:33,023	| IOT104 |	Fastpitch bat actress
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,095	| IOT104 |	Wrong that's just wrong
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,399	| IOT104 |	Okay so I get I see where you're going
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT104 |	I get it
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:44,287	| IOT104 |	I have multiple Amazon apps as well just put in all the apps they're all going back to the same servers I'm in
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,615	| IOT104 |	You don't make it contextual in that I want to check
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,151	| IOT104 |	Shopping stuff via voice
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,687	| IOT104 |	Okay I'm going to go to the shopping
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,479	| IOT104 |	I want to control Smart
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,247	| IOT104 |	Home things
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,015	| IOT104 |	Voice
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,319	| IOT104 |	Put it into the one that does that
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,599	| IOT104 |	I mean
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,391	| IOT104 |	I want to control music
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,927	| IOT104 |	Through Amazon Prime music
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,207	| IOT104 |	Put it in the app that does
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:05,023	| IOT104 |	I don't understand why it's all in the shopping app
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,047	| IOT104 |	You seem silly to me
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,583	| IOT104 |	It no I'm with you
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:11,167	| IOT104 |	It's also very confusing
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,727	| IOT104 |	I don't I can't find it I don't have it so
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,751	| IOT104 |	If you're looking for this
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,311	| IOT104 |	Amazon shopping app which if you like me
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| IOT104 |	Maybe you haven't downloaded it
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:22,175	| IOT104 |	Go download it so you can talk to
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,687	| IOT104 |	I'm kind of like
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:24,991	| IOT104 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,527	| IOT104 |	Next up
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,319	| IOT104 |	Google
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,391	| IOT104 |	Google this week actually may have been last week
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| IOT104 |	On the Google home device
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,463	| IOT104 |	Had kind of a
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:39,327	| IOT104 |	Because it feels pretty intrusive what they did is as part of
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| IOT104 |	People's daily briefing
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,935	| IOT104 |	That you can get that tells you you're like weather traffic
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,727	| IOT104 |	Basically like your
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,031	| IOT104 |	Your morning radio kind of thing
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,055	| IOT104 |	On the Google home
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| IOT104 |	They inserted
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,151	| IOT104 |	An ad for Beauty and the Beast
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,199	| IOT104 |	Yeah the new movie
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,759	| IOT104 |	What's
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:02,367	| IOT104 |	Really crazy is when someone called them about it cuz somebody posted it on Twitter
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,671	| IOT104 |	Google decided that it wasn't
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:13,375	| IOT104 |	Correct correct so you're right it was part of the my day feature which kind of summarizes everything for you whenever you ask
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,399	| IOT104 |	And it kind of
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,191	| IOT104 |	It went at the very end it was a
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,959	| IOT104 |	Literally
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| IOT104 |	This is the tech
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| IOT104 |	That was spoken
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:22,591	| IOT104 |	By the way Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,639	| IOT104 |	And if there's a little bit of information about the movie
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,919	| IOT104 |	I mean
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:32,319	| IOT104 |	I guess I see but I see both sides are clearly if I'm a user and I do not own a Google home at 4
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:37,183	| IOT104 |	Echoside that's the route I went for various reasons just better support of the products I use
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,743	| IOT104 |	It's going to sound like a nap without a doubt
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:45,119	| IOT104 |	Google says was intended to be an ad it was just trying to write some helpful information about your day and
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| IOT104 |	Was kindly content
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,447	| IOT104 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:53,311	| IOT104 |	If it's not clear to the users then you got a question the decision to do it I think
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| IOT104 |	Well
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,591	| IOT104 |	1
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,407	| IOT104 |	Baseline did money change
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,479	| IOT104 |	Don't know so nobody knows
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| IOT104 |	Google has not said
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| IOT104 |	Disney has no
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,807	| IOT104 |	That's it
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:07,647	| IOT104 |	That's the first question right because the FTC
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,415	| IOT104 |	Even
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| IOT104 |	Even if users
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,743	| IOT104 |	Eventually the FTC would be like
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| IOT104 |	What are you doing
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| IOT104 |	But you
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,327	| IOT104 |	I think the shows a couple thing
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:15,839	| IOT104 |	Thanks one
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:20,703	| IOT104 |	It shows that dealing with ads in a voice assisted world
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,215	| IOT104 |	What is going to be
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,007	| IOT104 |	Really hairy
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,311	| IOT104 |	Annoy people
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,847	| IOT104 |	If it's not done well
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,663	| IOT104 |	But if it's done too well I think the FTC is going to be like
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,223	| IOT104 |	Did you really think you were serving
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,527	| IOT104 |	Sponsored
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,039	| IOT104 |	Kind of like they do
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,343	| IOT104 |	Instagram
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:44,511	| IOT104 |	So there's that there's a very fine line there it needs to be clear to users
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:50,655	| IOT104 |	Weather as you said you know it's sponsored Penny changed hands basically is this an ad or is this not a nap
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,703	| IOT104 |	Write it needs to be clear to end users
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,495	| IOT104 |	And I will say that there are ways
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,543	| IOT104 |	I am sure you guys don't
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,871	| IOT104 |	The Harry Potter
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,663	| IOT104 |	Fantastic Beasts movie came out
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,735	| IOT104 |	Google actually did and I think it still works
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,527	| IOT104 |	You could say lumos
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,807	| IOT104 |	You can say hey G
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,831	| IOT104 |	Lumos
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,111	| IOT104 |	And your phone flashlight with
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,159	| IOT104 |	Right
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,927	| IOT104 |	That lumos by the
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:16,767	| IOT104 |	Not Harry Potter
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:23,679	| IOT104 |	Very clear we don't want people thinking they can actually do this
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,191	| IOT104 |	It's magic
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,239	| IOT104 |	But you can actually do it on your
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| IOT104 |	I thought that was really fun it was clever
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:33,407	| IOT104 |	And I assumed money changed hands
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,455	| IOT104 |	I mean it felt kind of marks
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:38,271	| IOT104 |	Nothing but it felt like something a user opted into
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,551	| IOT104 |	Enby
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| IOT104 |	I guess
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,135	| IOT104 |	Mostly they felt like something a user opted into
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,695	| IOT104 |	So I guess
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,719	| IOT104 |	That's the first
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,047	| IOT104 |	You Can Be Clever ads and I think we're going to have to see how that gets
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:50,559	| IOT104 |	It's done for
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,607	| IOT104 |	2
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:55,167	| IOT104 |	This I really think Google needs to think about
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,727	| IOT104 |	Switching from an ad based company
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| IOT104 |	To a product
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,823	| IOT104 |	And I say this
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,103	| IOT104 |	Rather a services
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,151	| IOT104 |	And I say this because
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,223	| IOT104 |	Google's ad Revenue comes from the web
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:09,759	| IOT104 |	Predominantly
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,063	| IOT104 |	And we're going to stop looking so much at
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,111	| IOT104 |	And when it
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:17,951	| IOT104 |	Goes into a world where data matters and services matter
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,767	| IOT104 |	I think it should really start to position itself
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| IOT104 |	Not as an ad
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,583	| IOT104 |	Because people don't trust
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:29,471	| IOT104 |	And you're not saying anything that many analysts haven't said in the past I mean that's
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:29,983	| IOT104 |	Something that
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,519	| IOT104 |	Not an original
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,359	| IOT104 |	I'm saying that
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,383	| IOT104 |	A lot of people agree
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,455	| IOT104 |	And the fact is as you said a lot of those
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,015	| IOT104 |	Ads come over the web and now
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,807	| IOT104 |	The web
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,599	| IOT104 |	It's bigger than just
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| IOT104 |	Something in a browser
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,695	| IOT104 |	The data from the web is coming through devices
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:53,535	| IOT104 |	Through
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,327	| IOT104 |	Wearable devices
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,607	| IOT104 |	Home assistant
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:00,703	| IOT104 |	Connected other bands I mean there's so many more places
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,983	| IOT104 |	That the web is touching
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,751	| IOT104 |	Right
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:06,335	| IOT104 |	So now it becomes do you want to see ads on all those things
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,127	| IOT104 |	There's a whole mindset that needs to be
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,151	| IOT104 |	Figure it out here
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,455	| IOT104 |	Traditional old ad model
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:14,527	| IOT104 |	Will not work in a connected to a connected world with
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,319	| IOT104 |	Multiple screens or
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,599	| IOT104 |	Other interfaces such as voice
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,647	| IOT104 |	Yeah and having that data
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:24,511	| IOT104 |	Has-beens that could provide super super valuable services and
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,839	| IOT104 |	I guess maybe maybe the next step then is how to monetize
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,655	| IOT104 |	Ads for Beauty and the Beast at the end of
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:31,679	| IOT104 |	My day
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:32,703	| IOT104 |	Is probably not the
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| IOT104 |	Keep thinking
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:39,103	| IOT104 |	Okay let's move on
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,383	| IOT104 |	Wouldn't really quick
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| IOT104 |	Purple
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,687	| IOT104 |	We'll try this in audio category
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,063	| IOT104 |	A smart home
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,831	| IOT104 |	That was
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:51,135	| IOT104 |	Controlled by an Ocarina which is
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,671	| IOT104 |	That weird
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,951	| IOT104 |	How much is a pipe
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,767	| IOT104 |	Hey I guess it's an instrument
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:01,119	| IOT104 |	Yeah well doesn't this will have to be electronic I mean in in the Zelda games
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,399	| IOT104 |	Electronic butt
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,959	| IOT104 |	Sounds like they have electricity there
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,727	| IOT104 |	No no
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:08,543	| IOT104 |	So he basically created a smart home that was controlled by
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| IOT104 |	Ocarina
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:12,127	| IOT104 |	Because he has a huge Legend of Zelda fan
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,431	| IOT104 |	And he basically built
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,735	| IOT104 |	You put a microphone on a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,271	| IOT104 |	How many plays in Ocarina certain
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,807	| IOT104 |	Sound phrases
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,087	| IOT104 |	Trigger certain things.
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:25,695	| IOT104 |	To happen with Wi-Fi control devices in his house he built all these himself so this is not something
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,487	| IOT104 |	Yeah you're not going to go buy this
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,767	| IOT104 |	But
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,791	| IOT104 |	How fun was that
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,071	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,119	| IOT104 |	Talk about it interesting parking app
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:35,423	| IOT104 |	Opportunity that actually what we're saying
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,191	| IOT104 |	What's Google +
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,007	| IOT104 |	Opportunities to tie into
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,287	| IOT104 |	Movies in
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:40,799	| IOT104 |	And products
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:42,847	| IOT104 |	With
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:47,711	| IOT104 |	Baby smart things at different commands and remember how when I got back from Harry Potter world and I was so sad that I could
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,223	| IOT104 |	Can use my wand
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:55,135	| IOT104 |	Okay I was going to bring that up because they're to go there's a perfect do it yourself just pointed at certain smart
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:58,719	| IOT104 |	Home devices and have him go on and go off the lawn to know you could do that
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,559	| IOT104 |	I can't because it's the one has
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,095	| IOT104 |	It's not NFC
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| IOT104 |	I think it's a
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,423	| IOT104 |	I already
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,471	| IOT104 |	I think it's
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| IOT104 |	But it's proprietor
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,551	| IOT104 |	Cannabis
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,087	| IOT104 |	So so think about that marketing
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,879	| IOT104 |	There might be some fun to be had there
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,183	| IOT104 |	Alright let's talk about arm
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,951	| IOT104 |	Because there were two things
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:34,047	| IOT104 |	What has more relation to the iot than others
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:38,911	| IOT104 |	So last month arm acquired two companies that provide NBA
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,423	| IOT104 |	Technology
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,727	| IOT104 |	For those of you guys are like
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,847	| IOT104 |	Is one of the low-power wide area network
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:50,943	| IOT104 |	Works so basically you can send small signals small amounts of data
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT104 |	Over
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,735	| IOT104 |	Huge areas
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:56,319	| IOT104 |	Cool thing about NB iot is that it cellular
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:02,975	| IOT104 |	So the cellular companies are looking at this in AT&T Verizon orange it said
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,535	| IOT104 |	Everybody's looking at this to provide like
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,607	| IOT104 |	Put your sensors in your smoke detectors talk to the cellular
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,167	| IOT104 |	But it's cheaper
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:15,775	| IOT104 |	Your mentioning cellular have they changed the name of nb-iot 2
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,567	| IOT104 |	How to say LTE
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,103	| IOT104 |	Andy one
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,127	| IOT104 |	Oh so there's two
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| IOT104 |	Two versions
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:24,479	| IOT104 |	Of course they're Hispanic
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,783	| IOT104 |	And then herself
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| IOT104 |	Cat 1
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| IOT104 |	Okay
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,367	| IOT104 |	Nb-iot
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:34,719	| IOT104 |	Is the download speeds are 250 km per sec
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,279	| IOT104 |	I'm in Uplink is
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:38,559	| IOT104 |	Also too
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,119	| IOT104 |	Until it's y'all
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,655	| IOT104 |	Very very
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:49,055	| IOT104 |	Very small like it'll tell your device state or something like that I mean if they were talking small bits of information
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,079	| IOT104 |	It's on us
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,359	| IOT104 |	It really love how
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,919	| IOT104 |	An LTE cat M1
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT104 |	Is
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,735	| IOT104 |	1 megabit per second
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,039	| IOT104 |	So that's
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:02,367	| IOT104 |	It's not video but maybe it's something a little bit more steady state
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,647	| IOT104 |	BiggerPockets
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,159	| IOT104 |	More price
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:10,303	| IOT104 |	Little bit different they're both incredibly low power both designed to go over wide areas
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,839	| IOT104 |	Both going to be implement
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,607	| IOT104 |	Bike carriers
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,935	| IOT104 |	And we're still waiting for pricing form
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| IOT104 |	AT&T and Verizon
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,471	| IOT104 |	For both of these
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,519	| IOT104 |	Scratch
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,079	| IOT104 |	Set alarm purchased two companies then
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,591	| IOT104 |	Two companies
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,383	| IOT104 |	They are
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| IOT104 |	Next
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,175	| IOT104 |	G
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,199	| IOT104 |	Cam
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,247	| IOT104 |	They do
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| IOT104 |	NBA
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,527	| IOT104 |	Coyote
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| IOT104 |	Software
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,831	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,855	| IOT104 |	Missed base
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,391	| IOT104 |	Which does the actual chip
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,183	| IOT104 |	The physical layer so
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,719	| IOT104 |	The lowest part in the stack
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| IOT104 |	What does the radio stuff
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,327	| IOT104 |	Together these two basically give arm
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,887	| IOT104 |	The ability to design in NB iot
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,679	| IOT104 |	This matters
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| IOT104 |	Because
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:52,799	| IOT104 |	There's also a bunch of other stand standards out there in the low-power wide area network
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,103	| IOT104 |	World which like Laura
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,663	| IOT104 |	We talked about all the time on the show
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,943	| IOT104 |	There's things like sick Fox
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,503	| IOT104 |	And there's other
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:03,551	| IOT104 |	Proprietary things like ingenue
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,111	| IOT104 |	I think wait list is still floating around out there
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,927	| IOT104 |	The idea here is
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:15,583	| IOT104 |	Nb-iot that the back of the cellular carriers if they come up with a business model it looks like arm is like yeah we're going to support that
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:18,399	| IOT104 |	I was just going to say me nothing against the
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:21,471	| IOT104 |	Competing standards and product makers but
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,263	| IOT104 |	Arm already has such a big
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:27,359	| IOT104 |	Footprint in the mobile industry's got the backing of practically everybody
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,919	| IOT104 |	If anybody can push towards
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:32,223	| IOT104 |	Fewer standards I would think it would be an arm
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,551	| IOT104 |	You know there's other
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,599	| IOT104 |	Big news
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,879	| IOT104 |	But I think it's fake
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:44,255	| IOT104 |	What time it is
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| IOT104 |	Dynamic
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,559	| IOT104 |	And that's like
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,095	| IOT104 |	Got super
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,863	| IOT104 |	The last IQ
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,655	| IOT104 |	The last
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:53,215	| IOT104 |	Yeah the last two letters
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:56,287	| IOT104 |	Know the last two letters of the word dynamic and they're brand new
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:56,799	| IOT104 |	IQ
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,335	| IOT104 |	And there
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:02,175	| IOT104 |	Basically they're saying it's Works painting possibilities for artificial intelligence
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:06,783	| IOT104 |	Tell me why you think this is a big deal maybe you'll convince me
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,063	| IOT104 |	Okay so
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:12,159	| IOT104 |	What they done here is arm has actually changed its architecture
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:12,927	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,695	| IOT104 |	They have
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,023	| IOT104 |	Redesigned the way they're going to make their
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| IOT104 |	Cortex a core
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,863	| IOT104 |	These are their bigger fatter meteor
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,423	| IOT104 |	Chords for smartphones for performance
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,471	| IOT104 |	Not the M class which is what
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,335	| IOT104 |	Shut all that stuff aside
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| IOT104 |	Sha
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,895	| IOT104 |	So what they done
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,175	| IOT104 |	When is
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:37,759	| IOT104 |	The architecture they chosen is going to let you run eight different
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,295	| IOT104 |	Horse in a cluster
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,111	| IOT104 |	That are all going to be able to run at 2
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,647	| IOT104 |	Clock speed so different frequency
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,695	| IOT104 |	So you can have one that's like
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:48,511	| IOT104 |	Super high-power like 1.2 gigahertz going
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:53,375	| IOT104 |	Chugging full out then you can have one you know what 500 gigahertz that's like
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,911	| IOT104 |	Only waking up till late
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,191	| IOT104 |	Listen for a voice
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,959	| IOT104 |	Anderson
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,543	| IOT104 |	Alright so I'm gonna stop you there and ask a question
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:04,383	| IOT104 |	To me it does not seem very different from their
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:07,455	| IOT104 |	Big little architecture and they already had
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:11,807	| IOT104 |	Multiple corre processes running at different speeds
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,367	| IOT104 |	So big little was introduced in
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:16,416	| IOT104 |	2011 that was there last
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:19,744	| IOT104 |	Forehead what that does is
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,768	| IOT104 |	Impaired
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,048	| IOT104 |	A big core
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,328	| IOT104 |	Like the massive
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,864	| IOT104 |	Powerful one with a
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,888	| IOT104 |	Metalcore
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,912	| IOT104 |	Less powerful
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:30,240	| IOT104 |	The big core wood handle like mobile phones and stuff like that
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:33,056	| IOT104 |	So the difference here is in this feels very slight
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,336	| IOT104 |	Is
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:37,664	| IOT104 |	With big little you had one that was on or off
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,944	| IOT104 |	And the other
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:42,528	| IOT104 |	It was on or off but you couldn't choose like different frequencies for
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:47,136	| IOT104 |	Taken throttle them based on the performance load required
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,928	| IOT104 |	And also you can only put four of them in
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,744	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,280	| IOT104 |	You can individualize
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,304	| IOT104 |	Every single one
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:56,096	| IOT104 |	So do you guys have all
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,608	| IOT104 |	A little
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,656	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:02,752	| IOT104 |	I think the the cores in the cortex is now.
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,032	| IOT104 |	2
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:04,800	| IOT104 |	Throttle
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,592	| IOT104 |	Based on performance load
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,360	| IOT104 |	I could be wrong
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,640	| IOT104 |	I'll give you some more
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| IOT104 |	Cuz now we're getting home
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:16,832	| IOT104 |	So are you didn't actually give a whole lot of technical
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:22,208	| IOT104 |	We're going to see that later when they actually introduce a new cortex design
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,488	| IOT104 |	With this Ark
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,768	| IOT104 |	Temperature later this year
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,072	| IOT104 |	They also did two more things
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,352	| IOT104 |	Mentioning
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,936	| IOT104 |	Changed it so
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,472	| IOT104 |	The bus now works
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,520	| IOT104 |	An accelerator
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,032	| IOT104 |	Much faster
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,104	| IOT104 |	And they also added some
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:44,480	| IOT104 |	And this is real nebulous are like some resiliency thing so it works for automotive in robotics
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:47,552	| IOT104 |	And I don't know if you remember they actually introduced a core
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,064	| IOT104 |	Last year
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,392	| IOT104 |	A core I think was a 57 or they 53
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:55,488	| IOT104 |	That was more resilient in design for these kind of industrial
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,000	| IOT104 |	Situation
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,072	| IOT104 |	But they're also changing the instruction set
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:05,728	| IOT104 |	And this gets into the AI stuff they're adding some instructions to the instruction set to make it work better for
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:06,752	| IOT104 |	Intelligence
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:09,824	| IOT104 |	That is the final amount of excretion
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:14,432	| IOT104 |	This was more of a press release in a product launch sandwich
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:16,480	| IOT104 |	It's fine I had no issue with that
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:20,320	| IOT104 |	They just seems very evolutionary to me in that
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:23,136	| IOT104 |	As we said big little architecture which was a big step forward
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,952	| IOT104 |	Back in 2011 this just seems like
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,256	| IOT104 |	Again maybe a half step forward on that
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,536	| IOT104 |	Andrea Lee
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:36,448	| IOT104 |	It's yes there are new instruction sets that will help with a I I don't know what those instructions will be in and what they will bring us
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:36,960	| IOT104 |	Sweet we'll see
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:43,872	| IOT104 |	I mean it's almost like we're taking our old architecture to adjust a little bit and say Nathan is Rai
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,432	| IOT104 |	I'm just not I guess I'll wait and see
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,224	| IOT104 |	What Hardware
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,504	| IOT104 |	Manufacturers do with this
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:54,112	| IOT104 |	Just to see how much of a big deal is really is but it again it seems very evolutionary to me
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,160	| IOT104 |	This will end up more in phones
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,952	| IOT104 |	It does feel kind of Apple
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,744	| IOT104 |	I can see why you think that
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:02,816	| IOT104 |	I think we'll see it first in phones
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:06,144	| IOT104 |	Because you can actually dedicate a lot of tasks to specific
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,424	| IOT104 |	Processors in a way that
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,960	| IOT104 |	I think would be compelling
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,544	| IOT104 |	The other thing it'll be good for is
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,312	| IOT104 |	Networking
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,640	| IOT104 |	On the other networking site cuz you could really amp up your
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:21,504	| IOT104 |	Networking in because you're dealing with so much for so many more flows of information
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| IOT104 |	We're going to see
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,832	| IOT104 |	The accelerator side of that also come
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,184	| IOT104 |	That is the arm
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,232	| IOT104 |	Wait and see
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:36,864	| IOT104 |	Text hubby and we'll move on from the deeply nerdy to the
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,144	| IOT104 |	Deeply sad
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:39,936	| IOT104 |	All right
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,704	| IOT104 |	Last week
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,984	| IOT104 |	I broke a story
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,800	| IOT104 |	I'm Zana which is the company that
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:47,872	| IOT104 |	Does software integration for lots of other companies
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:50,176	| IOT104 |	Including the Staples connect home that is now the phone
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:53,248	| IOT104 |	The song FeFe Tacoma home
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:55,552	| IOT104 |	Automation stuff
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,576	| IOT104 |	Several Lake
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,088	| IOT104 |	Common products
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,368	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,648	| IOT104 |	Zana
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:02,208	| IOT104 |	I had heard that they've been for sale
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,744	| IOT104 |	For a little while and
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:10,912	| IOT104 |	Basically at a deal had fallen through Honeywell was one of the potential requires that they were in talks with and and that
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:11,680	| IOT104 |	That did not happen
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,472	| IOT104 |	But
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,776	| IOT104 |	After a deal to buy them fell through
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:19,360	| IOT104 |	Ring the maker of a connected doorbell basically said
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,456	| IOT104 |	Will extend everyone who works it's on us
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,040	| IOT104 |	And most everybody is on olfaction
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:30,624	| IOT104 |	Kittens on us former CEO Mike Harris
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,672	| IOT104 |	Has confirmed to me that he is now a
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| IOT104 |	Head of the
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,256	| IOT104 |	Ring Philadelphia office
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,536	| IOT104 |	Which
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,816	| IOT104 |	Now exist
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:46,496	| IOT104 |	Enough was in my backyard in Malvern if I recall correctly
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,008	| IOT104 |	Pennsylvania
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:54,944	| IOT104 |	Oh so is that where the ring Philadelphia office is at sitsa Philadelphia suburb that's why
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,456	| IOT104 |	It just
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,480	| IOT104 |	Exist
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:00,064	| IOT104 |	There might
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,856	| IOT104 |	Presumably right now
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,648	| IOT104 |	For the 80
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,464	| IOT104 |	Or so the 70 to 80s on us employees that are now
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:07,744	| IOT104 |	Every
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,328	| IOT104 |	So really interesting story
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:17,728	| IOT104 |	Really cool that ring came in and offer these people jobs and really cool that they all wanted to stay together and take it
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,496	| IOT104 |	Because you know
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:21,824	| IOT104 |	People who understand device integration which is what saint of does
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,128	| IOT104 |	It's actually a pretty valuable skill right now
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,712	| IOT104 |	They could have found jobs elsewhere
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,760	| IOT104 |	And so this feels like
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,064	| IOT104 |	Good news for ring
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,832	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,624	| IOT104 |	The people who used to work at sauna
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,672	| IOT104 |	My big question is
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,720	| IOT104 |	What happened
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,768	| IOT104 |	Tazanna which is what I don't know
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,280	| IOT104 |	I feel like
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:45,632	| IOT104 |	There still an asset out there they still have products like sawed-off was
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:49,472	| IOT104 |	Still supporting all of the people who still have Staples connect devices
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,592	| IOT104 |	No one comes on off no one from its investors
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,360	| IOT104 |	Has called me
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:58,688	| IOT104 |	Dark rather I called them and they haven't returned any of my calls
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:02,784	| IOT104 |	I don't actually know what happens to those customers that
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,320	| IOT104 |	ReliOn sign up support
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:10,720	| IOT104 |	That's a good question and as the mean as you alluded to the Staples home connectors got into Funk so in those people
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:13,280	| IOT104 |	Already in the Lurch I don't know what's really going on there
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:20,192	| IOT104 |	Indiana will they continue to do that that's going to be up to ring I suppose
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,472	| IOT104 |	I know it'll be up to Zana
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,520	| IOT104 |	Ring only hired
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:30,432	| IOT104 |	So who's left the question to actually make those decisions
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,712	| IOT104 |	Xander support these things
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| IOT104 |	So everyone
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,016	| IOT104 |	Asana
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,528	| IOT104 |	Got a job
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,856	| IOT104 |	So who's left at Solana
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,208	| IOT104 |	What's left is that of might be the right question
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,744	| IOT104 |	Now not everybody took
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,048	| IOT104 |	Looks like everybody
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,608	| IOT104 |	The people who didn't aren't working at Sonic
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:55,520	| IOT104 |	I've been trolling Pacer to find out if there has been a bankruptcy
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,288	| IOT104 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:02,432	| IOT104 |	That is an open question if any of you guys want to tell us what's happening feel free to
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:03,968	| IOT104 |	To drop us a line Casino
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,016	| IOT104 |	I used to love the Staples today
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:08,064	| IOT104 |	I thought it was the best home hub out there
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,856	| IOT104 |	For a really long time
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,136	| IOT104 |	Because
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,672	| IOT104 |	It was user-friendly
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,208	| IOT104 |	It had a lot of Integrations
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:14,720	| IOT104 |	Interesting
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:21,376	| IOT104 |	I like the display because the display showing all the products that Staples actually had put together through TV is on off
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:26,496	| IOT104 |	Because it showed people how these things interact in a very simple to understand way
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:29,056	| IOT104 |	So there's that
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,592	| IOT104 |	Finally
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,872	| IOT104 |	Two bits of things for smart
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| IOT104 |	1
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:36,736	| IOT104 |	If you guys have gone in your SmartThings app lately
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,528	| IOT104 |	Or if you're a new buyer
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:39,808	| IOT104 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,624	| IOT104 |	Discovery now is amazing
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,416	| IOT104 |	It just goes through your house
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,696	| IOT104 |	Echo Steakhouse
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:53,120	| IOT104 |	It goes on your Wi-Fi not working it basically Auto discovers anything on your Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,656	| IOT104 |	Which for me was a lot of stuff
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,704	| IOT104 |	Including my Sonos is
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:58,752	| IOT104 |	Or is it so nice
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,408	| IOT104 |	So it discovered all of that
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,944	| IOT104 |	It discovered
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,736	| IOT104 |	A bunch of stuff it was really nice
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,504	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,296	| IOT104 |	Discovery is way better at it that's a brand new
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,088	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,904	| IOT104 |	I finally got my SmartThings and Lutron Thing 2
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,696	| IOT104 |	Work and I have to tell you
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| IOT104 |	That
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,256	| IOT104 |	I apparently was the only one who had
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:20,768	| IOT104 |	Problems
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:24,352	| IOT104 |	And it was not because of SmartThings it was because
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:26,400	| IOT104 |	I had a ghost Lutron hub
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,168	| IOT104 |	On my network
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,960	| IOT104 |	I know
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:32,544	| IOT104 |	Solutran benezra like why do you have two Bridges I was like I don't have to
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| IOT104 |	A Darkness you do
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,432	| IOT104 |	Here's what I think happened
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:38,944	| IOT104 |	It's because
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:44,576	| IOT104 |	I actually discovered that I have a phantom will call it a phantom Logitech Harmony Hub
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,880	| IOT104 |	I'm a phantom Nest Thermostat
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:53,536	| IOT104 |	So I was like as I discovered all of these weird Phantom things in my accounts
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:57,120	| IOT104 |	I thought it might have to do with the fact that I took my Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,632	| IOT104 |	Offline
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:58,656	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,216	| IOT104 |	To test some new Wi-Fi networks in
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,520	| IOT104 |	Then I brought it back on
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,824	| IOT104 |	And so I'm wondering if
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,152	| IOT104 |	That process created
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:09,920	| IOT104 |	Alternative
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,432	| IOT104 |	Bridges
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:13,248	| IOT104 |	I have no idea how all these came about
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,528	| IOT104 |	The companies themselves.
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,552	| IOT104 |	How old is
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,672	| IOT104 |	So this this emphasizes how weird my house
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,488	| IOT104 |	Now that I've tried to smart thing
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,304	| IOT104 |	I can tell you that it is awesome
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,608	| IOT104 |	It is a cloud the cloud
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,144	| IOT104 |	Integration and I was actually really worried about that
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,960	| IOT104 |	I don't know what magic
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,520	| IOT104 |	Blackmagic Lutron and SmartThings have done but
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,312	| IOT104 |	There is not
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:37,824	| IOT104 |	Noticeable
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:38,848	| IOT104 |	Latency
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,384	| IOT104 |	In commanding
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:40,896	| IOT104 |	My stuff
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,176	| IOT104 |	From the app
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,712	| IOT104 |	Through Google home
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,504	| IOT104 |	And through the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,552	| IOT104 |	All of those work
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:51,648	| IOT104 |	Seemingly at the same speed maybe a millisecond slower
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,416	| IOT104 |	But not so you
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:57,280	| IOT104 |	Interesting that you mention latency because I didn't
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:02,144	| IOT104 |	Say I was going to do some of that show but I did do this between the last showing out I
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,680	| IOT104 |	Got a wink Hub 2
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:08,032	| IOT104 |	And I noticed much less latency which is very good
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:12,896	| IOT104 |	Nope Anthem devices rounds afraid that when I transfer all my stuff from the one to the other
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,944	| IOT104 |	Create issues
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,712	| IOT104 |	Oh yeah that way
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:19,552	| IOT104 |	So what are you going to do with your old wink
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:20,832	| IOT104 |	Cuz I have a wink 1 and I don't know what
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:25,952	| IOT104 |	I have a teammate out in Mountain View who wants to know
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:27,744	| IOT104 |	Smarthomes I'm like hell just send you a link
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,144	| IOT104 |	Send somebody awake
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,680	| IOT104 |	Go for it
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:37,472	| IOT104 |	I have a spare wink hub
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,264	| IOT104 |	Okay we're going to do this for a week
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:43,104	| IOT104 |	Send me an email at info at ioc podcast.com
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,640	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,432	| IOT104 |	I got a bunch
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:50,784	| IOT104 |	I will do a random generator or I will randomly pick one of y'all and you can have my old
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,576	| IOT104 |	This is Wings version one hub
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:53,856	| IOT104 |	So if you want it
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,392	| IOT104 |	Send me an email
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,928	| IOT104 |	And will
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:59,744	| IOT104 |	Do it before the next show so
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,512	| IOT104 |	Actually let's say
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:02,560	| IOT104 |	Before the end of the day on
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,328	| IOT104 |	Monday night
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,376	| IOT104 |	Which is March
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,400	| IOT104 |	27
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,424	| IOT104 |	And then
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,192	| IOT104 |	U2
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:08,960	| IOT104 |	Could have a wink one
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:11,264	| IOT104 |	That feels good
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:13,824	| IOT104 |	Let's do the guest
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,128	| IOT104 |	Kevin thank you
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,664	| IOT104 |	Everyone else
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:22,784	| IOT104 |	Stay tuned for Vint Cerf talking about what the problems are with
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,320	| IOT104 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,600	| IOT104 |	And how he thinks that's going to work out
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:29,696	| IOT104 |	But first a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:33,536	| IOT104 |	Everyone we are taking a break for The Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:37,632	| IOT104 |	For a message from our sponsor this week sponsors Samsung art
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,680	| IOT104 |	And I have syrupy chair
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:41,216	| IOT104 |	Samsung
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:44,288	| IOT104 |	What Samsung is doing
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:51,200	| IOT104 |	Hi Sarah ICC I'm so glad you're here today so can you tell me what Samsung
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:57,600	| IOT104 |	In the industrial internet let me start by saying that Samsung is a very large manufacturer
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:33:02,720	| IOT104 |	Connected products today a lot of people know Samsung through the mobile phone to tablet
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:05,024	| IOT104 |	Wearables and many more connected products
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:07,584	| IOT104 |	Samsung video
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:11,936	| IOT104 |	Chasing and understanding a lot of the challenges that other manufacturers have
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:14,752	| IOT104 |	Trying to improve off by guillotine for json downtime
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:18,080	| IOT104 |	And deliver reading high quality connect
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:20,384	| IOT104 |	Json pretty demanding customers
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,176	| IOT104 |	Samsung manufacturer
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:26,016	| IOT104 |	And with all Arctic iot platform we're helping
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:28,832	| IOT104 |	Manufacturers like Samsung to get better
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,880	| IOT104 |	Insights into that productivity
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,672	| IOT104 |	Boca helping industrial OEM
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,720	| IOT104 |	To deliver connected products
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,768	| IOT104 |	And connected services
EDL	00:33:37,280	00:33:38,560	| IOT104 |	Awesome see you
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:42,400	| IOT104 |	Perspective what is the future of manufacturing
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:45,216	| IOT104 |	Countries already created
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:51,104	| IOT104 |	Massive quantities of data so that's not something that's new I think the s*** that we going to see is more in the usage
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:53,664	| IOT104 |	All that data
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:56,480	| IOT104 |	Pink shed more effectively between applications
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:34:01,088	| IOT104 |	Beautiful and also shared with other parties to have outside
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,112	| IOT104 |	The factory
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:08,512	| IOT104 |	Medieval efficiencies that haven't been delivered yet and also we going to see that day to being shown or delay
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:11,072	| IOT104 |	David down to the machines or to the people
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:14,912	| IOT104 |	Really need it and they're going to be getting that dates of when they need it most
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:20,032	| IOT104 |	So what are some common mistakes that you see people making is they try to add intelligence to their face
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:23,104	| IOT104 |	I think one challenge
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:29,248	| IOT104 |	Industrial iot implementation to security it's always a big concern or industrial customers
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:32,832	| IOT104 |	And it's important to design that security in from the outfit
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:35,392	| IOT104 |	Rather than added in as an afterthought
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,672	| IOT104 |	Security is a big issue
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:40,000	| IOT104 |	Also a graphic shifts that make automation
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:41,536	| IOT104 |	Manufacturing
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:48,448	| IOT104 |	In the manufacturing and production for teaching in the US says there a lot of very highly skilled and experienced workers who going to
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,984	| IOT104 |	I'll be retiring this problem
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:54,080	| IOT104 |	Patisserie challenging for petroleum Engineers of the utility worker
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,104	| IOT104 |	Big fraction
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:57,408	| IOT104 |	What does what forces are going to be retiring
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:58,688	| IOT104 |	In the next 5 years
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:01,504	| IOT104 |	And with that big of a cold
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,784	| IOT104 |	Great shift change
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:04,576	| IOT104 |	We potentially going to lose a lawsuit
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,368	| IOT104 |	Intelligence and knowledge
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:12,000	| IOT104 |	Expertise in industrial processes so we need to find ways of capturing this expertise
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:14,560	| IOT104 |	And one way to approach it is to
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:19,424	| IOT104 |	Collect more data and analyze that data more effectively to try and codify some of this knowledge
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:22,240	| IOT104 |	To find out more about Samsung
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:23,008	| IOT104 |	Arctic
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:27,104	| IOT104 |	And how it can help your iot development strategy

EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:50,656	| IOT104 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your house Stacy Higgins
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:53,216	| IOT104 |	Bottom and today I have with me Vint Cerf want to be
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:55,520	| IOT104 |	What is called the father of the internet
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,824	| IOT104 |	One of the fathers of the internet here with me
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,616	| IOT104 |	So - are you doing
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:02,432	| IOT104 |	Well right now I'm absorbing Austin reign
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,968	| IOT104 |	Unexpectedly
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:08,832	| IOT104 |	It always rains during South by at least one day before it turns beautiful again
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:13,440	| IOT104 |	That case I don't feel like anybody dumped on me but it's a pleasure to chat with you today
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,512	| IOT104 |	It is wonderful to talk to you I'm really excited
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,280	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,816	| IOT104 |	Let's just get it started with
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,352	| IOT104 |	How do you define The Internet of Things
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,168	| IOT104 |	I think that the most Broad
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:26,240	| IOT104 |	Is generalization would be anything that's programmable
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,520	| IOT104 |	And perhaps something with
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:29,312	| IOT104 |	Also has communication capability
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:36,224	| IOT104 |	This extends well beyond the classic sorts of appliances around the house and around the office
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:38,272	| IOT104 |	Sir in the car or on your person
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,320	| IOT104 |	I even think of
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:46,464	| IOT104 |	Fast training systems on the stock exchange is it kind of Internet of things as piece of software that takes real-world input
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:50,560	| IOT104 |	Juice it up for a while and then does something which has a real-world effect
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:59,776	| IOT104 |	So I'm very general notion of communicating software that that takes in real-world information in
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,056	| IOT104 |	Has an effect on the real world
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,872	| IOT104 |	For most people whoever is a device
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,896	| IOT104 |	Programmable
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,200	| IOT104 |	All right
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,480	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:11,040	| IOT104 |	Why would you say that this is a big deal
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:11,808	| IOT104 |	Right now forever
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:15,136	| IOT104 |	But perhaps the biggest deal about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:18,208	| IOT104 |	Is that our people are rushing to build
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:18,720	| IOT104 |	Products
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,000	| IOT104 |	They have these
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:22,560	| IOT104 |	Characteristics Communication in computation
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,328	| IOT104 |	Kobe mentality
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:29,984	| IOT104 |	The trouble is you're not paying as much attention to access control security privacy safe
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:33,824	| IOT104 |	And frankly autonomy by which I mean
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:40,224	| IOT104 |	Ability to operate successfully even if the Internet isn't available that what you don't want is your house doesn't work at
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:41,248	| IOT104 |	The Internet isn't connected
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:43,296	| IOT104 |	That would not be a good design
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:44,832	| IOT104 |	But already have
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,392	| IOT104 |	Sense to me on a daily basis with my internet
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,160	| IOT104 |	Flips out
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,928	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,720	| IOT104 |	What's actually skip to architecture
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,024	| IOT104 |	What kind of underlying technology
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:54,560	| IOT104 |	Do you think we need to
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:55,072	| IOT104 |	To think about
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:56,352	| IOT104 |	4
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:58,656	| IOT104 |	I guess scaling out this distributed
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,424	| IOT104 |	Intelligent Network
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:03,776	| IOT104 |	Well first of all there has been and I would say
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:04,800	| IOT104 |	Anna parents
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,568	| IOT104 |	Common
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:08,384	| IOT104 |	Choice to use the Internet Protocol is
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:09,408	| IOT104 |	Circle fundamental
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,456	| IOT104 |	Mechanism for moving database
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:12,224	| IOT104 |	Back and forth
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:13,248	| IOT104 |	IP version 6
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:14,784	| IOT104 |	Is preferable because it is
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| IOT104 |	Scam
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:21,440	| IOT104 |	But the underlying transmission systems could vary all over the rod and they do to slow pan
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,232	| IOT104 |	Why fine
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:29,632	| IOT104 |	LTE not you can rattle off lights in Germany's Bluetooth and Bluetooth low energy so we're going to see a proliferation
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,400	| IOT104 |	Variation
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:34,240	| IOT104 |	In the underlying transport mechanism and that's okay cuz the IP protocol
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,032	| IOT104 |	Amor
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:38,848	| IOT104 |	Critical question is what happens above the IP layer
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:44,224	| IOT104 |	And here we also see a lot of variation among the producers
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:45,248	| IOT104 |	These devices
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:49,344	| IOT104 |	And we're probably going to see that variation for a while to come
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,416	| IOT104 |	I think it's important to achieve some standard
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:55,744	| IOT104 |	Especially when we get up into the space of semantics
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:59,584	| IOT104 |	What can I tell what device what can the device tell me
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,352	| IOT104 |	If I have to
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:04,960	| IOT104 |	Somehow managing Ensemble of devices that come from multiple
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:06,240	| IOT104 |	Manufacturer is more
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:06,752	| IOT104 |	Brands
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,312	| IOT104 |	Standardization is your friend here
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,616	| IOT104 |	Because then you can write applications that
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:12,640	| IOT104 |	Consistent
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:16,992	| IOT104 |	If you have to write something different for every possible manufacturer
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:21,600	| IOT104 |	Equipment is going to be hard fixing things that don't work is going to be
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:23,136	| IOT104 |	Speaking of which
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:27,232	| IOT104 |	Another big challenge is how long these devices are going to be in the field
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,536	| IOT104 |	How long will they be maintainable
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:34,144	| IOT104 |	Will the companies that made them go out of business and leave you with a house that doesn't work anymore
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:40,800	| IOT104 |	What if there's a bug in the software that causes a your malfunction or a breach of privacy or some other thing
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:42,336	| IOT104 |	Who's going to fix that
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:44,896	| IOT104 |	How will the software get downloaded into the
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:51,296	| IOT104 |	Did you buy sell the device novocaine from a legitimate Source how do we know if the update hasn't been modified
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,576	| IOT104 |	Integrity
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:54,112	| IOT104 |	The list of questions
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:55,648	| IOT104 |	Is very long
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:40:01,792	| IOT104 |	And most people who are doing these devices are not thinking so much about that they're thinking about I have an app
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,096	| IOT104 |	And I have a device and that's it
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,120	| IOT104 |	End of story
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:09,216	| IOT104 |	And at some point even the consumers are going to recognize that there is more meat
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:12,544	| IOT104 |	So right now at the kind of
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:14,080	| IOT104 |	Device Communications level
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,128	| IOT104 |	Upstanders like iotivity
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:18,432	| IOT104 |	We should all join now we have
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,968	| IOT104 |	Got. So that's that layer
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:21,760	| IOT104 |	Some of the other thing
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:22,784	| IOT104 |	Things that you were talking about
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:26,112	| IOT104 |	We really don't have a standard zeffert around them to
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:26,880	| IOT104 |	To my knowledge and I
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,648	| IOT104 |	I'm thinking of things like
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:31,488	| IOT104 |	I guess authentication of a device all the way through the network or even
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,280	| IOT104 |	Being able to monitor changes
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:35,840	| IOT104 |	Do we have anything like that on the internet
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:38,400	| IOT104 |	Not anything that's so so so
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:40,192	| IOT104 |	Pacific to the device
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:42,752	| IOT104 |	I think advice should be
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,776	| IOT104 |	Paranoid gently
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:48,640	| IOT104 |	Not accepting control or updates or willingness to release
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:50,944	| IOT104 |	Software release date
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:57,856	| IOT104 |	Unless it has good reason to believe that the party that is asking it for the data or commanding it to do something is
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,624	| IOT104 |	Legitimate
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:03,232	| IOT104 |	Which means probably in almost certainly some kind of cryptographic Exchange
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,536	| IOT104 |	Digital signature style thing
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:10,400	| IOT104 |	It has to be workout but then that leads to all kinds of questions about how easy or hard is it
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,936	| IOT104 |	Configure the device to do that
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,472	| IOT104 |	I worry about
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:15,776	| IOT104 |	Scenarios like I have a house full of this stuff
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,568	| IOT104 |	And I've invited guests over
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:20,640	| IOT104 |	How long does it take me to introduce my gas to the house
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:23,456	| IOT104 |	And give the gas the authority to
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:24,992	| IOT104 |	Turn the lights off and on and flush the toilet
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:31,904	| IOT104 |	And then when they leave how do I make sure that I revoke the privilege is so that the fifteen-year-old in the family doesn't do something
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:36,000	| IOT104 |	So there are these scenarios
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:38,048	| IOT104 |	I think you're not adequately
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:38,816	| IOT104 |	Address
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:39,840	| IOT104 |	We don't have
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:43,168	| IOT104 |	Not coming agreement see at the even that these are the right problems
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,960	| IOT104 |	Solve it alone how to solve them
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:49,568	| IOT104 |	So my guess is going to be chaotic
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:50,080	| IOT104 |	For a while
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:53,407	| IOT104 |	But the consumers eventually are going to get
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:56,991	| IOT104 |	The point that they don't want equipment in the house that isn't reliable
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:59,039	| IOT104 |	Did they don't consider it
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:41:59,551	| IOT104 |	To be safe
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:03,903	| IOT104 |	That fails to work at the Internet isn't available in the old series
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,927	| IOT104 |	Expectations
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:10,047	| IOT104 |	Will eventually rise to the surface and either the producers
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:11,071	| IOT104 |	Will have to respond
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,375	| IOT104 |	Or their products won't be
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:15,167	| IOT104 |	Purchased and they will go out of business
EDL	00:42:15,935	00:42:16,703	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:18,495	| IOT104 |	There will be pressure in the long night
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:24,383	| IOT104 |	To solve the problems you achieve standards and everything else but not before a fair amount of turmoil
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:25,151	| IOT104 |	Experience
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,967	| IOT104 |	What is everything didn't talk
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:28,479	| IOT104 |	2B internet
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:31,295	| IOT104 |	What is each house had its own internet
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:32,575	| IOT104 |	And then
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:33,343	| IOT104 |	Your platform
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,623	| IOT104 |	Provider let it out
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:37,439	| IOT104 |	And did something like that does that feel like a viable solution
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,975	| IOT104 |	It's not an open web thing
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:44,351	| IOT104 |	I think it depends a great deal on what it is you were expecting this
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,375	| IOT104 |	Classify
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:51,775	| IOT104 |	To do I mean if you want remote monitoring for example when you're away and you want to be apprised of what's going on
EDL	00:42:51,775	00:42:53,311	| IOT104 |	Turn around in an emergency
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:59,711	| IOT104 |	The house is on fire the fire departments on the way should they have access to the webcams and the temperature sensors
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:00,991	| IOT104 |	In order to
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:04,831	| IOT104 |	Find people who have collapsed or places where the fire is obviously burning
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,111	| IOT104 |	The brightest
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:08,159	| IOT104 |	And then you don't want them to have access app
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,183	| IOT104 |	The fire is out in summer
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:11,999	| IOT104 |	So I can understand
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,791	| IOT104 |	Local communication which I think is needed
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:20,703	| IOT104 |	You don't want to have to go all the way out to the public internet and back again in order to control the house so they're Cleveland
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,471	| IOT104 |	I need to be an internal
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:23,775	| IOT104 |	Communications capability
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:26,847	| IOT104 |	And that introduces the possibility of a hoverboard
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,615	| IOT104 |	Control over something
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:30,943	| IOT104 |	There's an organization that's called iotx
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,223	| IOT104 |	Which is trying to help people
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:33,759	| IOT104 |	The disparities
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:34,527	| IOT104 |	Protocol
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:41,439	| IOT104 |	Find a way to allow interaction to happen anyhow maybe with protocol translation which everybody gags at including
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,487	| IOT104 |	Me or with some other mechanism
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:44,767	| IOT104 |	So that
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:49,375	| IOT104 |	Even in the presence of all the diversity it's possible to organize things in a
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,399	| IOT104 |	Maura West
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:50,911	| IOT104 |	Consistent
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,447	| IOT104 |	At somewhere
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:52,959	| IOT104 |	In the Arctic
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:44:00,127	| IOT104 |	So I don't think that isolating things in the house exclusively it does salt
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:03,455	| IOT104 |	The problem and certainly doesn't satisfy many people's expectation
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:04,223	| IOT104 |	What this can do
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:07,039	| IOT104 |	What about the industrial iot
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:09,855	| IOT104 |	How should I think about that differently than
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:10,623	| IOT104 |	Make it the Smart Home
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:16,767	| IOT104 |	Well several things occurred to me one of them is it in an in an industrial setting you may have
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| IOT104 |	Tens of thousands
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:18,815	| IOT104 |	Devices
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:25,215	| IOT104 |	But you're operating at a scale where you presumably can have expertise in the company or accessible
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:28,543	| IOT104 |	The company that can help organize configuring maintaining update
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:33,151	| IOT104 |	You also could have some discipline within the organization about access
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:37,247	| IOT104 |	You might insist on two-factor authentication really times a mechanism
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:40,063	| IOT104 |	That limit the potential hazards
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,087	| IOT104 |	Abuse
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,879	| IOT104 |	Or invasion
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,391	| IOT104 |	Of the system
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:49,023	| IOT104 |	And so it's the usual thing in an in a corporate setting in a government setting in an inch
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:51,327	| IOT104 |	Situational setting mothers in top-down control
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:53,887	| IOT104 |	You may be able to and introduce
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,655	| IOT104 |	Practices
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:57,983	| IOT104 |	That makes system a lot more safe and secure
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,775	| IOT104 |	In a household setting though
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:05,663	| IOT104 |	It's another story because we're ordinary Mortals and we're not very disciplined and so the system has to help us
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:09,759	| IOT104 |	Behave better or at least prevent our Worst Behavior from damaging
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:10,783	| IOT104 |	Ourselves
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,063	| IOT104 |	Arlington
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:14,879	| IOT104 |	It's true sometimes I use the same
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,391	| IOT104 |	Change password
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:19,743	| IOT104 |	Two apps and I feel every time I'm like that's the wrong thing
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:20,767	| IOT104 |	Okay
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:21,791	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:24,607	| IOT104 |	This is felt a little not dark but just hard
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:31,007	| IOT104 |	Let's talk about what makes this worth it so what are the opportunities what is this really enable
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,055	| IOT104 |	So there are several things that I am
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:39,455	| IOT104 |	Firmly convinced will make a big difference the first one and obvious one is that with the right kinds of equipment in
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:40,479	| IOT104 |	Monitoring and sensing
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:47,391	| IOT104 |	You could do a better job of energy use and other resources in a house or in an office building and you see
EDL	00:45:47,391	00:45:49,695	| IOT104 |	GED and I'll lead buildings
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:51,487	| IOT104 |	Are getting more and more popular these days
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:56,095	| IOT104 |	Probably because there's some tax advantages and other things about investing
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:57,887	| IOT104 |	In this kind of structure
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,423	| IOT104 |	So at home
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:00,447	| IOT104 |	You may save money
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,727	| IOT104 |	On your resources bills
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:04,543	| IOT104 |	Another possibility is remote monitoring
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:05,567	| IOT104 |	For safety
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:10,687	| IOT104 |	Here we get into whether it's Access Control security or fire prevention or fire detection
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:14,527	| IOT104 |	The third possibility which is perhaps a bit more in
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:20,927	| IOT104 |	Is that tell you may be able to use it home which has been outfitted with this capability
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:21,951	| IOT104 |	How do you monitor your angel
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:26,559	| IOT104 |	And here we got the notion of continuous monitoring where the information
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:28,863	| IOT104 |	Where
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:35,007	| IOT104 |	An estimate can be made of your normal condition so that if you drift away from normal that can be a signal
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:37,055	| IOT104 |	You should go
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:40,639	| IOT104 |	Go to the doctor call husband Larry call 911 or do something
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,687	| IOT104 |	So take your vitamin pill
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:48,575	| IOT104 |	So this idea of being able to gather information and assemble it and make it useful
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:51,903	| IOT104 |	Even to the extent of your own health is it is valuable
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:55,487	| IOT104 |	I often wonder whether or not
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:58,303	| IOT104 |	Having the house is fully instrumental
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:01,119	| IOT104 |	Can also make it a lot more comfortable on adaptable
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,447	| IOT104 |	There are lots of attempts now meme
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:05,727	| IOT104 |	Voice interaction
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:12,895	| IOT104 |	To control my house some of it is almost certainly as stimulated by one Star Trek episodes where you could say
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:15,199	| IOT104 |	Malaysian play Beethoven
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:16,991	| IOT104 |	I am
EDL	00:47:16,991	00:47:22,367	| IOT104 |	Still a little unsure about how successful The Voice interactions are going to be but some of the applications
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:29,791	| IOT104 |	I am being able to get the house to adapt to your preferences in an easy way it's supposed to running around pooping
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,071	| IOT104 |	Ip65 dimmer switch
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:33,375	| IOT104 |	It has a certain amount of appeal to it
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,423	| IOT104 |	It is totally awesome
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,703	| IOT104 |	I have many
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,983	| IOT104 |	Voice settings better
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:38,495	| IOT104 |	Like party mode
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:40,031	| IOT104 |	Dinner mode
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:40,799	| IOT104 |	So
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:41,823	| IOT104 |	We talked a lot about
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,127	| IOT104 |	Cool things that happened
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:45,151	| IOT104 |	Standards in architecture
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:46,687	| IOT104 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:52,575	| IOT104 |	How we're going to pull this together in a way that works for the consumer and the possibility of Regulation
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:54,111	| IOT104 |	Because
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,391	| IOT104 |	There's a lot of data running around
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:56,415	| IOT104 |	Security issue
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:58,207	| IOT104 |	What role
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:59,743	| IOT104 |	Should the government play
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:01,023	| IOT104 |	In this whole Realm
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:05,375	| IOT104 |	Well Chris the normal reaction in the private sector is the government
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:05,887	| IOT104 |	Go away
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:08,191	| IOT104 |	I think that's not going to be
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:08,959	| IOT104 |	Possible
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:09,727	| IOT104 |	To sustain
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:14,591	| IOT104 |	People are going to be relying increasingly on these devices. Where
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:18,687	| IOT104 |	At some point they're going to have to be some kind of certifications
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:20,735	| IOT104 |	The software level on the hardware
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:21,503	| IOT104 |	So we need
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:22,783	| IOT104 |	Cyber Underwriters lab
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:30,207	| IOT104 |	I think that there may also be potential liabilities associated with negligence
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,231	| IOT104 |	Deployment
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,255	| IOT104 |	Equipment
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:33,023	| IOT104 |	Breakfast
EDL	00:48:33,023	00:48:37,375	| IOT104 |	For example the situation that Gaming Corporation found itself in
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:41,983	| IOT104 |	When whatever was a half-a-million webcams were all aimed at the same destination
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:49,151	| IOT104 |	How could this possibly happen while there wasn't any access control built into the devices or the access control was widely known
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:51,967	| IOT104 |	Username and passwords were constant in the same everywhere
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:54,783	| IOT104 |	To assembling a botnet was no big deal
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:56,831	| IOT104 |	I consider that to be near your responsible
EDL	00:48:57,343	00:49:03,743	| IOT104 |	However to be fair to everybody people made those things probably weren't thinking about the possibility that they were all online
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:05,791	| IOT104 |	The same time on the internet and therefore
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:07,071	| IOT104 |	Compromisable
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,863	| IOT104 |	And we saw what happened
EDL	00:49:09,631	00:49:10,911	| IOT104 |	So just go
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,679	| IOT104 |	Seat belts
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:18,847	| IOT104 |	Warren until the law said if we catch you driving now to seatbelt over there's an accident without a seatbelt there will be time
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:20,895	| IOT104 |	Same as smoking
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:24,735	| IOT104 |	So you find all the Persuasions about good behavior
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:27,039	| IOT104 |	Are backed up by some kind of incentive
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:31,903	| IOT104 |	And I want to use the word incentive here and not necessarily legislation and regulation
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:34,207	| IOT104 |	When we have incentives
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:34,975	| IOT104 |	To do the right thing
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:36,255	| IOT104 |	Then
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:38,303	| IOT104 |	Generally speaking the right thing happens
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:44,703	| IOT104 |	The question is how do we formulate the incentives in order to get that to happen and how do we agree on what the right thing is
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:46,751	| IOT104 |	I thought you were going to tell me
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:50,079	| IOT104 |	One of the other things
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:51,871	| IOT104 |	I think it's worth considering here
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:53,151	| IOT104 |	Is
EDL	00:49:53,151	00:49:57,503	| IOT104 |	Those cameras many of them were manufactured in China so even if we had
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,271	| IOT104 |	The right incentive
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:50:03,391	| IOT104 |	People in China they don't have necessarily so there's an internationalisation
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:06,207	| IOT104 |	I don't know what to think about it
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:10,303	| IOT104 |	Well there have been a lot of discussions about International cyber
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:11,327	| IOT104 |	Agreements
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:15,935	| IOT104 |	On one side you agree not to attack each other's basic infrastructure and on the other
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:18,495	| IOT104 |	Not to ship you know hazardous gear
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:23,359	| IOT104 |	A couple of thoughts come to mind one of them is the the certification question
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:24,639	| IOT104 |	I actually have some
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:29,503	| IOT104 |	Saline Ciara suppose you couldn't sell a product unless you could at least reveal the source code
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:31,551	| IOT104 |	Some party who agrees
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:34,623	| IOT104 |	Private boat so handsy
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:41,279	| IOT104 |	But Sadie credibility to have said we ran into a series of tests we did and everything else we believe this
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:42,047	| IOT104 |	This device to me
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:43,327	| IOT104 |	Say
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:45,375	| IOT104 |	Another observation is to
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:50,239	| IOT104 |	Inhibit the device's ability to communicate outside of the of the house except
EDL	00:50:51,775	00:50:54,591	| IOT104 |	This gets back to you earlier thought about today
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:57,663	| IOT104 |	A local conductivity that doesn't extend outside the house
EDL	00:50:58,431	00:51:00,735	| IOT104 |	So I think that there are are serious
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:02,015	| IOT104 |	Supply chain question
EDL	00:51:02,783	00:51:09,183	| IOT104 |	That arise an example of a scenario that really worries me is somebody building a device throwing in random pieces
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:11,231	| IOT104 |	Source operating system
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:11,999	| IOT104 |	Code
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:17,119	| IOT104 |	And not particularly caring about whether you'll ever be maintained or not just I just want to sell the device
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:23,007	| IOT104 |	Answer that leaves another open question in my mind about commitments to maintaining
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:29,151	| IOT104 |	These kinds of devices over. Of time cuz some people will buy them with the expectation that they're going to work for
EDL	00:51:29,151	00:51:30,431	| IOT104 |	Period of a decade or more
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:32,991	| IOT104 |	And what is the company goes out of business
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:37,343	| IOT104 |	You know within six months because it wasn't the popular product and yet you want
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:38,111	| IOT104 |	To keep it in use it
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:40,671	| IOT104 |	So maybe they're asking Arrangements
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:42,463	| IOT104 |	With regard to the source code
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:45,023	| IOT104 |	There I think there's room for quite a bit
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:48,863	| IOT104 |	Domestic and potentially International exploration
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:50,655	| IOT104 |	Of agreements
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:53,215	| IOT104 |	The United States because of his
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:54,239	| IOT104 |	Extraordinary
EDL	00:51:54,751	00:51:55,775	| IOT104 |	Consuming power
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:59,359	| IOT104 |	Isn't it is a place where they will be even
EDL	00:51:59,359	00:52:02,687	| IOT104 |	Higher risk factors just because we acquire all this stuff
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:03,455	| IOT104 |	Music
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:09,087	| IOT104 |	That's West true and places that are not spending as much of their discretionary income on gadgets like this
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:10,879	| IOT104 |	Over a long period of time
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:13,695	| IOT104 |	All these gadgets will become available to everybody
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:14,975	| IOT104 |	Things to reduce cost
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:22,143	| IOT104 |	Unless of course attorney sounds we've all concluded these things you're so hazardous and dangerous and annoying and they don't work with
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:23,423	| IOT104 |	Supposed to anyway
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:24,959	| IOT104 |	And we all decide to hell with it
EDL	00:52:24,959	00:52:25,983	| IOT104 |	Go back to the light switches
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:27,775	| IOT104 |	You can pry my light switch
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:29,311	| IOT104 |	My cold dead hands
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:31,871	| IOT104 |	Alright so
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:33,407	| IOT104 |	Given all of this
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:36,223	| IOT104 |	Do you have any smart devices in your home
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:37,503	| IOT104 |	I have a few
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:39,295	| IOT104 |	My wife
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:45,695	| IOT104 |	For frankly they have a 747 worth of light switches and dimmers so that she knows exactly which ball butt is itchy
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:46,463	| IOT104 |	Controller
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:52,863	| IOT104 |	On the other hand I'm not a few Lutron programmable things that I like a lot because you talk about it
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:54,143	| IOT104 |	That's not up for you
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:56,959	| IOT104 |	I have a custom Entertainment System
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:59,263	| IOT104 |	And that's a good example of
EDL	00:52:59,263	00:53:04,127	| IOT104 |	Hazardous right because when it doesn't work have to call up a guy that lives on in miles away to come out and fix it
EDL	00:53:04,895	00:53:08,735	| IOT104 |	It's a good example of why customization may not necessarily be the smartest thing in the world
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:11,295	| IOT104 |	I have some of the
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:13,599	| IOT104 |	Alphabet Nest thermostats in the house
EDL	00:53:14,111	00:53:20,511	| IOT104 |	And I also have a system to monitor the temperature humidity in light levels in every room in the house is a mess
EDL	00:53:20,511	00:53:21,279	| IOT104 |	Network money
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:22,815	| IOT104 |	6lowpan
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:23,839	| IOT104 |	Every 5 minutes
EDL	00:53:23,839	00:53:26,399	| IOT104 |	Information to a server in the basement
EDL	00:53:26,399	00:53:27,167	| IOT104 |	And
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:32,287	| IOT104 |	The Wine Cellar is instrumented so that if the temperature goes up to 60° Fahrenheit
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:35,103	| IOT104 |	SMS in my mobile telling me my wine is warming up
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:42,271	| IOT104 |	So the next step is to put RFID tags on all the bottles so I can do an instantaneous inventory make
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:44,319	| IOT104 |	Make sure that when I'm away no bottle is left
EDL	00:53:44,319	00:53:45,343	| IOT104 |	Seller without my permission
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:47,903	| IOT104 |	So the answer is we have a little bit
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:48,927	| IOT104 |	Automation
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:54,047	| IOT104 |	Did you build your light and temperature sensing in your wine cellar stuff yourself
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:59,423	| IOT104 |	No this is not me in the garage with a soldering iron I actually got commercial equipment
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:00,447	| IOT104 |	Every case
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:02,239	| IOT104 |	Use for that
EDL	00:54:03,263	00:54:05,311	| IOT104 |	Yeah I mean whose equipment did I use
EDL	00:54:06,079	00:54:08,639	| IOT104 |	Well let's see the thermostats come from there
EDL	00:54:09,407	00:54:14,527	| IOT104 |	The temperature sensor Mesh networking from archrock which was acquired by Cisco Systems
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:18,879	| IOT104 |	The RFID detector was a startup company
EDL	00:54:18,879	00:54:21,951	| IOT104 |	Where I bought it in and bought some of their equipment
EDL	00:54:22,463	00:54:25,279	| IOT104 |	Lutron controls are commercial
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:28,863	| IOT104 |	RN program by the same guy that did mine
EDL	00:54:28,863	00:54:29,887	| IOT104 |	Entertainment System
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:36,799	| IOT104 |	Entertainment System itself is a kind of a dog's breath waste of equipment coming from a variety manufacturers all
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:37,567	| IOT104 |	Wife together
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:40,383	| IOT104 |	I am being driven by
EDL	00:54:40,383	00:54:41,919	| IOT104 |	Fairly sophisticated
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:42,431	| IOT104 |	Software package
EDL	00:54:43,199	00:54:46,271	| IOT104 |	So is it all commercial that some of it is
EDL	00:54:46,783	00:54:47,551	| IOT104 |	Let me say cuss
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:48,831	| IOT104 |	Don't
EDL	00:54:48,831	00:54:50,367	| IOT104 |	Awesome thank you so much
EDL	00:54:51,391	00:54:56,255	| IOT104 |	Happy to have a chat I'm just hoping that we have a chat 10 years from now hopefully I'll still be around
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:55:02,399	| IOT104 |	10 years now to to assess where are we in the space in which which one could we driven into this.
EDL	00:55:03,167	00:55:06,751	| IOT104 |	I'm hoping we're flying free and easy because I'm That Kind of opt
EDL	00:55:06,751	00:55:07,263	| IOT104 |	Tumescent
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:09,311	| IOT104 |	Well so am I but I'm trying to be
EDL	00:55:11,359	00:55:12,127	| IOT104 |	All right
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:18,527	| IOT104 |	Well that's it for another episode of The Internet of Things podcast please join us next week when we have another
EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:24,927	| IOT104 |	Amazing show for you and if in the meantime you are hankering for some iot news sign up for mine
