EDL	00:00:08,704	00:00:12,288	| IOT043 |	Hey everyone it is the Internet of Things podcast did I am your host
EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:13,568	| IOT043 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,568	00:00:14,848	| IOT043 |	And this is your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,848	00:00:15,616	| IOT043 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,128	00:00:18,688	| IOT043 |	We've got a great show for you today
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:20,224	| IOT043 |	If you are ready to just be
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:23,040	| IOT043 |	Just so scared of all the can
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:24,832	| IOT043 |	Connected devices to your home
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:26,368	| IOT043 |	Just so scared
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:27,136	| IOT043 |	Okay
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:27,904	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:00:27,904	00:00:31,232	| IOT043 |	We have iot security blows
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,000	| IOT043 |	IHOP
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:33,024	| IOT043 |	Couple stories
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:38,144	| IOT043 |	One is a non-story so we're going to briefly mention it and tell you not to worry
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:39,680	| IOT043 |	That is that
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:41,216	| IOT043 |	Your your nest device was
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:43,264	| IOT043 |	Transmitting your ZIP code
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,544	| IOT043 |	That you inserted in
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:46,080	| IOT043 |	Told the nest
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:49,152	| IOT043 |	So I can get weather information it was actually giving that to
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:52,736	| IOT043 |	Was called leaking this data in the
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:53,504	| IOT043 |	Packet header
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,016	| IOT043 |	Information
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:58,880	| IOT043 |	In some cases it was your ZIP code in some cases it was the zip code of the weather station
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:00,416	| IOT043 |	This has since been fixed
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:01,696	| IOT043 |	The weather station
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,256	| IOT043 |	So don't worry about it
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,024	| IOT043 |	A lot of people were
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,584	| IOT043 |	Mine is deleting my personal data
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:10,400	| IOT043 |	Sunday morning
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:11,168	| IOT043 |	Is not anymore
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:15,776	| IOT043 |	It's not dated this particular personal there were some bad security practices such as
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:16,800	| IOT043 |	Putting that
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:17,312	| IOT043 |	Information in
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:19,872	| IOT043 |	But you know
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:23,200	| IOT043 |	Nest is no longer doing that hopefully they've learned a valuable lesson
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:28,064	| IOT043 |	But there is maybe a little bit of something more
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:28,832	| IOT043 |	Worrisome out there
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:34,720	| IOT043 |	This happened a couple of days back and I had never heard of this particular search
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,256	| IOT043 |	Vengeance I'm just going to say it and
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,304	| IOT043 |	If it's not familiar to you will explain what it is
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,328	| IOT043 |	It's showdown
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,376	| IOT043 |	Shodan
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:45,216	| IOT043 |	And apparently a search engine for like iot things
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:49,056	| IOT043 |	What you can do with show Dad is actually kind of scary you can
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,592	| IOT043 |	Have it
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:54,688	| IOT043 |	Search for unprotected open webcams
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:02:00,320	| IOT043 |	Send their pictures of people's babies sleeping and so on that were found via show Dan in that
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,856	| IOT043 |	Really bad
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,368	| IOT043 |	Okay so
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,672	| IOT043 |	I'm going to do a quick reality check
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:10,304	| IOT043 |	This is going to be Stacy the geek talking as opposed to Stacy the worried mother of
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,120	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,912	| IOT043 |	Shootings been around since 2009
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,728	| IOT043 |	It is a search engine for connected devices
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:22,336	| IOT043 |	And for a long time people have used it as a way to
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,128	| IOT043 |	Find open ports on the internet
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,408	| IOT043 |	Check out
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:28,992	| IOT043 |	What they recently did was add an image search
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:32,832	| IOT043 |	And now you can actually search for sleeping babies
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,344	| IOT043 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:37,952	| IOT043 |	What you can also do is you go in and you don't actually
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| IOT043 |	You actually have to
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,024	| IOT043 |	To type in passwords to
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| IOT043 |	Kodak Kodak
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,328	| IOT043 |	Cameras and stuff
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,352	| IOT043 |	Usually it's
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,448	| IOT043 |	Basic default passwords for these things so like
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,984	| IOT043 |	Admin or password
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:50,752	| IOT043 |	Password one
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,056	| IOT043 |	Usually get you in a lot of these things
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:56,384	| IOT043 |	So it's maybe a little harder than you might
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,920	| IOT043 |	Think and
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,224	| IOT043 |	The other thing to know about shooting
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:04,320	| IOT043 |	And is it's not like just some sort of creepy like place where you can go see
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,856	| IOT043 |	Sleeping children
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| IOT043 |	It's also kind of a neat
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:09,952	| IOT043 |	Place where you can go and see all these cool connected devices
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| IOT043 |	If you're like
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| IOT043 |	Myself
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:17,120	| IOT043 |	So I don't want it and I'm like a cool there's like weather stations you can
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,144	| IOT043 |	See your there's
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,704	| IOT043 |	View connected devices in
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:25,056	| IOT043 |	Actually one of our former colleagues yonko used it to track
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,336	| IOT043 |	Actually I think it was like
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,384	| IOT043 |	I was looking at app download
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,408	| IOT043 |	What's on Roku boxes
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,200	| IOT043 |	Is it again it is
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,992	| IOT043 |	It is like a Google for can
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:33,504	| IOT043 |	Connected devices
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,296	| IOT043 |	Right
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,320	| IOT043 |	That's just me
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,136	| IOT043 |	I know people are like
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:39,904	| IOT043 |	But
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,184	| IOT043 |	We don't have to freak out totally
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,256	| IOT043 |	Play freak out a little bit and change your password
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:47,328	| IOT043 |	I grew that I don't I don't think I should be freaking out it's just
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,608	| IOT043 |	Disconcerning number one
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:52,448	| IOT043 |	Mainstream people are not going to be going to this
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,800	| IOT043 |	Search engine in the end knowing what to do with it and so on it it's it's kind of the Geeks like awesome
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,128	| IOT043 |	I almost hesitated even bring it up but you know what I mean
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:06,528	| IOT043 |	Chances are people already know about the people who want to know about it already do so it's really I think the message here is to make sure that you
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,880	| IOT043 |	Your devices are secure as you can make them on the user side
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,928	| IOT043 |	And also from a
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,720	| IOT043 |	Turn a device maker standpoint
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:21,631	| IOT043 |	You know try and lock these things down give you some control some security control to the users make sure that it's not going through
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,167	| IOT043 |	Open ports and such
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,727	| IOT043 |	This is a good time to bring up a couple things
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,263	| IOT043 |	Thanks Cuz also in his arse
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,567	| IOT043 |	On once you get past
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,591	| IOT043 |	Sleeping baby wipe
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,687	| IOT043 |	Such a nice-looking baby though I have to say
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| IOT043 |	Is it a nice looking baby
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,527	| IOT043 |	We can't see the
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,039	| IOT043 |	The baby
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,855	| IOT043 |	Light blanket in crib
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:48,511	| IOT043 |	It's a sleeping baby in Canada I didn't realize I was even going across the border here
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:55,935	| IOT043 |	So it's worth mentioning that we've had on the podcast folks from this group is called I Am the calvary
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:58,495	| IOT043 |	I'm here Josh Korman who is one of the
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,007	| IOT043 |	The founders effect
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:04,127	| IOT043 |	Since it's a bunch of security researchers and they actually
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| IOT043 |	2014 released
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,223	| IOT043 |	Anything about connected vehicles in
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,759	| IOT043 |	It was a framework
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,295	| IOT043 |	They created with
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:14,879	| IOT043 |	The industry with the government in the whole goal was to
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,183	| IOT043 |	Kind of come up with again a framework
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,487	| IOT043 |	For how we should think about securing connect
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,255	| IOT043 |	Vehicles
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:23,327	| IOT043 |	And what they're doing actually is creating one for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,351	| IOT043 |	Which is been a long time
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,167	| IOT043 |	In the story in ours that willing to in the show no
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:32,287	| IOT043 |	Has a bunch of really awesome stuff in there so we're going to have to get
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,567	| IOT043 |	Them back on the show
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,871	| IOT043 |	The guy who's doing this is Brian nox
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,431	| IOT043 |	Have to have them come and talk about what they're doing here
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,223	| IOT043 |	It's pretty sweet
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT043 |	And with you
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:46,367	| IOT043 |	Took bunch of best practices that are in consumers interest here with internet security and privacy in
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,415	| IOT043 |	I do remember the I am the cavalry
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,695	| IOT043 |	Creed or Mantra that they
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,999	| IOT043 |	Check offering a couple years back and
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,791	| IOT043 |	I think it's great neck that's long overdue
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:54,815	| IOT043 |	That's ultimately
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,863	| IOT043 |	Picture here is Sweeney Todd
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:59,935	| IOT043 |	I need to start locking the stuff down a little bit better as an industry
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,959	| IOT043 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,471	| IOT043 |	Is all others
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:05,823	| IOT043 |	She's a little bit there's three under security so it's secure by default
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,103	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,663	| IOT043 |	No default password share between devices
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| IOT043 |	Advanced features
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:14,015	| IOT043 |	That are used by only a few users should be turned off
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,551	| IOT043 |	That's under secure by default
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,319	| IOT043 |	Then you have
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| IOT043 |	Secure by Design
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,415	| IOT043 |	And that's things like sperm or should be locked down
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:24,767	| IOT043 |	Other memory and storage nand memory storage medium should be protected with
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:27,839	| IOT043 |	Epoxy ball socket so the memory can't be removed in.
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,655	| IOT043 |	Obzedat's physical security
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,679	| IOT043 |	On the actual silica
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,495	| IOT043 |	Security is selca
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,335	| IOT043 |	So the devices should not rely on the network
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| IOT043 |	Provide security
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:40,895	| IOT043 |	Rather
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,919	| IOT043 |	The devices
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,431	| IOT043 |	Security model
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,455	| IOT043 |	Summa Network
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,319	| IOT043 |	If the cloud goes down you don't want your devices on
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,367	| IOT043 |	Secure insecure because the clouds down
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,647	| IOT043 |	Bright
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,463	| IOT043 |	So those are under security and then there's some
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,511	| IOT043 |	There's four things for privacy
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:03,935	| IOT043 |	Quibble I think when we get them on the show talk about this but kind of privacy they have consumer Pi is not shared with manufacturers
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:08,031	| IOT043 |	Partners usage data on individual consumers is never shared with

EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:14,175	| IOT043 |	Anonymous data for buckets of users on usage patterns is acceptable
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:18,527	| IOT043 |	As long as it's proven but not traceable back to the individual consumers
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:24,159	| IOT043 |	And then for data collection policy type of data collected in usage of data
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| IOT043 |	Is clearly documented
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,231	| IOT043 |	On-site
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,559	| IOT043 |	So what's your quivalizer curiosity I know we'll get them on the show an answer
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| IOT043 |	What is it
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:35,167	| IOT043 |	Well so it kind of the framework addresses this a little bit but
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:40,031	| IOT043 |	Buddhist concept of consumer pii which is personally identifiable information
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:43,871	| IOT043 |	I think that's kind of an archaic notion in a world where we have
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,663	| IOT043 |	Such advanced
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,175	| IOT043 |	Data mining
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,295	| IOT043 |	Because you can basically identify a person
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:54,367	| IOT043 |	From about three or four pieces of information has been kind of
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,415	| IOT043 |	Consistently proven
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,695	| IOT043 |	And so
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,767	| IOT043 |	I feel like Pi I could be really anything
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,791	| IOT043 |	Now in
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| IOT043 |	3 they say
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,887	| IOT043 |	Anonymous data for buckets of users
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,703	| IOT043 |	Can't be traceable back to individual
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,751	| IOT043 |	Consumers which kind of takes care of
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:14,079	| IOT043 |	So maybe that's okay but it a lot of
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,847	| IOT043 |	Like laws are written
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,383	| IOT043 |	And they they just
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,943	| IOT043 |	Shove pii
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,967	| IOT043 |	And I'm kind of like
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,783	| IOT043 |	Okay but I hear you
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,135	| IOT043 |	Two-level said everybody this is not the final version of
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,695	| IOT043 |	Are the criteria this is preliminary
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:32,255	| IOT043 |	That brand Nelson in the group is not
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,279	| IOT043 |	Formally
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:37,631	| IOT043 |	I guess there was like a public with cuz obviously it's available but they're still working on this
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:38,911	| IOT043 |	Yes and
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,447	| IOT043 |	You know it is just a frame
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,263	| IOT043 |	You know it's not like
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,055	| IOT043 |	They they call themselves I am the cavalry
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,591	| IOT043 |	It's not like the horses are
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,639	| IOT043 |	Come charging out in anyone with anything
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,711	| IOT043 |	They also do note in the story
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,247	| IOT043 |	Which I'm really sad
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| IOT043 |	Again
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,807	| IOT043 |	I'm really sad that the story like
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,367	| IOT043 |	If you don't read all the way down you're going to miss
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,415	| IOT043 |	A lot of really great stuff because
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:04,511	| IOT043 |	They talk about the ftce starting to consider how they're going to like
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:07,071	| IOT043 |	Are they going to do civil fines for this witch
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,095	| IOT043 |	All the way back
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,655	| IOT043 |	In 2013 when the FTC was looking at this
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| IOT043 |	You know they had
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| IOT043 |	People talking to them saying
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,287	| IOT043 |	Dude this isn't going to be secure and you
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| IOT043 |	Find people
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,079	| IOT043 |	You know the rest into
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,967	| IOT043 |	And you know the people who are on the panel advocating for this for sale
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,503	| IOT043 |	Is it there's going to be nothing else
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| IOT043 |	Do you need a stick
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,855	| IOT043 |	Yeah beat people with a stick because right now
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| IOT043 |	Consumers don't pay for privacy
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,415	| IOT043 |	And they don't
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,231	| IOT043 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,511	| IOT043 |	They have no incentive to
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,279	| IOT043 |	Put it in there
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,047	| IOT043 |	Tyranitar
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,839	| IOT043 |	And it's expensive
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| IOT043 |	How to track an
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,887	| IOT043 |	Keep that going south
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:45,215	| IOT043 |	I'm not going to say regulation is the answer to everything cuz it certainly isn't
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:45,983	| IOT043 |	But
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,543	| IOT043 |	I can't think of anything else that can keep
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,823	| IOT043 |	The manufacturers in line
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,359	| IOT043 |	So I don't
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,639	| IOT043 |	Have a problem with this
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| IOT043 |	Yet
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:58,271	| IOT043 |	If the FTC does really get involved depending on the details and what they're going to do obviously
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,415	| IOT043 |	What else is there
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| IOT043 |	I mean the cost of your devices
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:10,815	| IOT043 |	All right
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:13,887	| IOT043 |	It's in everyone's best in
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:18,495	| IOT043 |	Because once we get past this like oh my God it's not secure
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,799	| IOT043 |	People normal people may feel more Trust
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| IOT043 |	And by the
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,639	| IOT043 |	Okay sorry
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,455	| IOT043 |	I said we were moving along then what did I do I kept talking about it
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| IOT043 |	That's all right
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:33,855	| IOT043 |	It's because I can't find my way back to Archie two things were still talking about
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,135	| IOT043 |	Cute cards
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,695	| IOT043 |	Cue cards Cayenne it's so hot right now
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,279	| IOT043 |	All right
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,559	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,607	| IOT043 |	I've been talking Kevin you talk for a little while.
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:50,495	| IOT043 |	Sure we literally out and talk about my devices not stay safe devices not my devices but
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:55,871	| IOT043 |	The company called my devices. Com they have some news out today that they were recording a show
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:02,271	| IOT043 |	I think they actually pronounce this in the past but I'm not 100% sure on that or what they've done is they are launching kayak
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,343	| IOT043 |	I am the world's first and I don't know if it's true but
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,415	| IOT043 |	It is a drag-and-drop iot project Builder
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:13,023	| IOT043 |	Not sure on the whole world's first bit don't think it is actually say she never talked about it before the show
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:16,607	| IOT043 |	Essentially this is very specific to Raspberry Pi devices
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:21,727	| IOT043 |	And that's interesting to me because I because I have a Raspberry Pi but be because
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,263	| IOT043 |	It's an affordable solution you can use it
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:26,591	| IOT043 |	For prototyping you don't need to have a ton of money to
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,359	| IOT043 |	Develop
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,431	| IOT043 |	I have two devices if you can use a pie and some other things such as
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:33,247	| IOT043 |	List some Dragon drop iot project Builder
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,527	| IOT043 |	Essentially
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| IOT043 |	When is a dragon drop
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,599	| IOT043 |	This is a bunch of
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,367	| IOT043 |	Widgets
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,135	| IOT043 |	Tekken
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:45,279	| IOT043 |	Be viewed on a website or a mobile device through iOS or Android have an app coming it's a dashboard it's a dashboard
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:48,351	| IOT043 |	Set of sensors are reading data from sensors that are attached
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,887	| IOT043 |	Perhaps to your Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| IOT043 |	You know it's
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,983	| IOT043 |	A low-cost way to I think development
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,519	| IOT043 |	A10 create
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| IOT043 |	Iot devices so
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,847	| IOT043 |	I think it's interesting
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,871	| IOT043 |	Worth trying
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,663	| IOT043 |	I will say it looks a lot like
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,431	| IOT043 |	Freeboard
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,479	| IOT043 |	Rio from bug labs
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,319	| IOT043 |	Which is actually the developer platform that Verizon is using in it
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,159	| IOT043 |	Things space Cloud but other people can use it to sew
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:16,511	| IOT043 |	Looks like that the GUI interface that it has kind of reminds me of node red
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,071	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,887	| IOT043 |	And again I like all of this stuff so
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,215	| IOT043 |	Yes make it easier for everyone to play with the inter
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,543	| IOT043 |	So we like to Tinker so I'm in
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,871	| IOT043 |	You know something that's cheap and easy to use that we can just go
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:34,431	| IOT043 |	Have fun with for a couple hours on a weekend
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,735	| IOT043 |	Looks like that kind of thing to me so I'm excited
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,503	| IOT043 |	Yasso
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,319	| IOT043 |	Music let us know what you think
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,087	| IOT043 |	And
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,111	| IOT043 |	I will say
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,415	| IOT043 |	You know what we should talk about though
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,487	| IOT043 |	Now what we should talk about this because it happened
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,511	| IOT043 |	A week ago
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,535	| IOT043 |	But after we were
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:55,935	| IOT043 |	Recorded the show but Amazon did some news and this one actually doesn't relate to she who shall not be named
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,703	| IOT043 |	This is
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,239	| IOT043 |	Is Dash replenishment
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:58,751	| IOT043 |	Service
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| IOT043 |	So everyone knows
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,055	| IOT043 |	Does the Dasher
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| IOT043 |	You don't know
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,151	| IOT043 |	There are probably some
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:08,479	| IOT043 |	You guys out there I'm sure there are never seen a dash button
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:12,319	| IOT043 |	You know I've actually never seen a dash button believe it or not cuz I don't have anything yet
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,623	| IOT043 |	All Dash buttons
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:20,511	| IOT043 |	I'm your pretzel there internet-connected and it automatically orders one item so
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,071	| IOT043 |	A specific item that is pictured on the dash bus
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:26,655	| IOT043 |	But it also has something I'm far more significant
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:30,495	| IOT043 |	Which is the dash replenishment service which is basically just a
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,031	| IOT043 |	It's a backend
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,103	| IOT043 |	Cloud replenishment service to Amazon
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,127	| IOT043 |	E-commerce
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,455	| IOT043 |	System so
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,479	| IOT043 |	What it is is
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,807	| IOT043 |	If you're a manufacturer like brother printers
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:44,575	| IOT043 |	You
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,111	| IOT043 |	Basically have a sensor
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,671	| IOT043 |	And some code that connects
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,719	| IOT043 |	To Amazon's backend
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:51,999	| IOT043 |	And
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:54,815	| IOT043 |	When that sensor detects like that you're out of ink
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,839	| IOT043 |	In a Brother printer
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,119	| IOT043 |	It just
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:59,679	| IOT043 |	Calls Amazon it says yo I'm out of ink
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,215	| IOT043 |	In Amazon
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| IOT043 |	Yeah I ate so it's it's kind of like a
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,687	| IOT043 |	The dash button from cells I think they were like $5 or whatever
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:14,015	| IOT043 |	Date of Easter Focus towards consumers you buy one like maybe the
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:20,415	| IOT043 |	The tide wasn't sticking on your washing machine when you're running though you just hit the button and more time is on its way
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:23,231	| IOT043 |	Getting disintegrated into actual products where it makes sense
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,767	| IOT043 |	Cenotes a totally different play
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:29,375	| IOT043 |	I like this better I think than the manual press the button for consumers just order one thing
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,655	| IOT043 |	It's a very specialized
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:35,519	| IOT043 |	Integrated Service say with the Brother printer that use bait you use as an example
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:38,079	| IOT043 |	So here's where I'm going to blow your mind
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,127	| IOT043 |	Hello my mind go for it
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,455	| IOT043 |	So this is for consumers this could be for businesses
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:45,247	| IOT043 |	But it really just takes
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,271	| IOT043 |	Sensor
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,063	| IOT043 |	And
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:53,951	| IOT043 |	Like 10 lines of code is what Amazon tells me last week they open this program up
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,487	| IOT043 |	Anyone
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,023	| IOT043 |	So if you are
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,559	| IOT043 |	A big-time developer like it
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,095	| IOT043 |	GE which has a smartwatch
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| IOT043 |	Machine
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,143	| IOT043 |	Dance to this
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,191	| IOT043 |	Or you're like a hobbyist like myself
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,983	| IOT043 |	And let's say you have like
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,519	| IOT043 |	I don't know a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,335	| IOT043 |	And a sensor and you want to build like
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,383	| IOT043 |	I would love to build a connected dog food thing
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:18,783	| IOT043 |	Instead of buying my own so you could actually this is open enough that you could grab the code yourself and put it on your pie with a sin
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,063	| IOT043 |	Answer to your dog bowl
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,367	| IOT043 |	Basically or my dog probably my dog feeder
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,671	| IOT043 |	Food storage
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,767	| IOT043 |	I got you I got
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:31,839	| IOT043 |	The giant Tupperware
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:34,655	| IOT043 |	So exactly
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT043 |	You could do this
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| IOT043 |	I could do this
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,031	| IOT043 |	For big companies
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,055	| IOT043 |	She is doing this
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| IOT043 |	So yes
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,383	| IOT043 |	So that I thought was really freaking sweet
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,687	| IOT043 |	What are the big companies are already involved
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| IOT043 |	So Brita
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,783	| IOT043 |	They're doing it for their water
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,623	| IOT043 |	Samsung's one I think Samsung is one
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:56,159	| IOT043 |	There's a company called G mate
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:16:01,023	| IOT043 |	Which makes a smart blood glucose monitor which will reorder
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:01,791	| IOT043 |	The little
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,327	| IOT043 |	Prickly things in the
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| IOT043 |	Testing strips
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,119	| IOT043 |	Spritz little
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,911	| IOT043 |	Glucose monitor Purell
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,471	| IOT043 |	Four hand sanitizer things
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:13,311	| IOT043 |	Cleverpet I don't know if you saw my CES video where
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,615	| IOT043 |	Play with the cleverpet device
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,639	| IOT043 |	I'm it's a pet food
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,199	| IOT043 |	August
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,735	| IOT043 |	The lock company
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,271	| IOT043 |	Which embedding is batteries but I do
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,319	| IOT043 |	For sure that make sense
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,599	| IOT043 |	Sealed air
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,879	| IOT043 |	I'm not sure what field are is going to
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,719	| IOT043 |	I don't know
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:36,351	| IOT043 |	So there's a lot of companies and hopefully we'll start seeing a lot more because it was a close program for now
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:41,727	| IOT043 |	I'm so so I know who I want to see integrated this thing and that is the folks make the
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,287	| IOT043 |	Keurig coffee machines
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,567	| IOT043 |	Always run out
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| IOT043 |	And then I'm kind of
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,919	| IOT043 |	That would be interesting because
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,967	| IOT043 |	You have to do it on your storage
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:57,343	| IOT043 |	Pod correct it wouldn't be in the coffee maker have to be wherever the storage pods or maybe they make like a
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,903	| IOT043 |	A little container for those and monitor it and
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,695	| IOT043 |	You keep taking them out
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,743	| IOT043 |	Recognize
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,279	| IOT043 |	Hey that would be cool
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,559	| IOT043 |	So Kevin
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,607	| IOT043 |	You can actually
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,631	| IOT043 |	Temecula
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,167	| IOT043 |	Scale
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,215	| IOT043 |	Weekend project
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,311	| IOT043 |	See we get too excited about this dividing people
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| IOT043 |	Because I freak people out about that Nina
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,383	| IOT043 |	We probably free
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| IOT043 |	Just anybody
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,015	| IOT043 |	I thought was worth noting
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,039	| IOT043 |	So why do a couple
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,319	| IOT043 |	Quick newsie items
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,623	| IOT043 |	And then we'll end on a question
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,903	| IOT043 |	For everyone to think about
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,183	| IOT043 |	Alright Sony
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,255	| IOT043 |	Is buying Altair which is a Moto Maker for a 200
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,535	| IOT043 |	$12
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:43,167	| IOT043 |	Cuz it was 212 I would have paid sooner 13in
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:48,287	| IOT043 |	You're like I want to go to make sure I don't know why I want to have a Semiconductor Company
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,871	| IOT043 |	One for you and one for you
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:59,807	| IOT043 |	LG modems are basically cellular
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:03,135	| IOT043 |	Is there really useful for The Internet of Things presumably
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,183	| IOT043 |	What do you think Sony is going to do with this
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,207	| IOT043 |	Put modems in
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,743	| IOT043 |	What cameras
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,023	| IOT043 |	You know
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,815	| IOT043 |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,375	| IOT043 |	So he's actually been struggling on the mobile side
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,911	| IOT043 |	These days they do pretty much
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,679	| IOT043 |	I want to say
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| IOT043 |	Onda
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:19,775	| IOT043 |	Camera sensor market for mobile devices but it says I think that's actual
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,567	| IOT043 |	Pretty accurate is everybody uses
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,383	| IOT043 |	Most many many major manufacturers use them
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,919	| IOT043 |	They're not doing well in smartphones
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,431	| IOT043 |	Tablets
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,711	| IOT043 |	Xiamen
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:30,783	| IOT043 |	Is this the kind of modem that could integrate into say
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:34,367	| IOT043 |	System-on-a-chip from somebody else other than Qualcomm cuz right now these Qualcomm
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,391	| IOT043 |	Yeah they can
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,023	| IOT043 |	What about for VR
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,839	| IOT043 |	I mean would you use that you would want to use sedative for
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,935	| IOT043 |	Alright well we'll throw that up as a
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:52,799	| IOT043 |	We'll have to do something and let's let's do something and think about it somewhere I'm curious what they might do with us
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,079	| IOT043 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| IOT043 |	I can
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:58,431	| IOT043 |	Connecting anything with lenses for computer vision would be really powerful
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:01,759	| IOT043 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| IOT043 |	Johnson Controls
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,063	| IOT043 |	Band Tycho
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,343	| IOT043 |	We're like what
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,647	| IOT043 |	So this is an industrial internet
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,695	| IOT043 |	Also worth noting because
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,279	| IOT043 |	Johnson Controls competes with Honeywell
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,047	| IOT043 |	Competes with
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:20,447	| IOT043 |	A lot of Honeywell GE etcetera on the smart building side and it had kind of an old-school
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:24,031	| IOT043 |	Kind of smart building automation software package called medisys
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,847	| IOT043 |	It was a little bit more closed off
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,407	| IOT043 |	Meanwhile Tyco they actually own
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:32,735	| IOT043 |	Faucets I can never pronounce it but it's a line of smart home sensors
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,783	| IOT043 |	And they also had
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,807	| IOT043 |	Their own
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,599	| IOT043 |	Kind of it's called Tyco on
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,879	| IOT043 |	Which was a
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:39,903	| IOT043 |	Much more open
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,951	| IOT043 |	Fire & Security pack
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,719	| IOT043 |	CH4
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| IOT043 |	Against
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| IOT043 |	Building automation
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,071	| IOT043 |	Let 3rd party integrators
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| IOT043 |	Integrate with them
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,375	| IOT043 |	And so I'm really excited about this
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| IOT043 |	2 million dollar deal
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,983	| IOT043 |	And it's kind of a cool deal
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,775	| IOT043 |	In that
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,799	| IOT043 |	I'm hoping
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:00,383	| IOT043 |	We see Johnson Controls take a page from Tycho
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:01,151	| IOT043 |	An open up
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,967	| IOT043 |	It's also worth talking about only because
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,759	| IOT043 |	I'm really curious
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,039	| IOT043 |	This still makes me think about
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:12,159	| IOT043 |	The overlap between the operational side of building automation solake
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,183	| IOT043 |	All the sensors
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,999	| IOT043 |	In the facilities management aspects of it
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,303	| IOT043 |	And how that's going to bridge with the it side
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,583	| IOT043 |	Because
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,143	| IOT043 |	Both of these are very traditional
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:24,191	| IOT043 |	Operational companies oot
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:28,287	| IOT043 |	And I'm like
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,359	| IOT043 |	Or do they partner to get it
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| IOT043 |	Because
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| IOT043 |	A big rival of there
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,943	| IOT043 |	GE has been
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,735	| IOT043 |	Find databases
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,271	| IOT043 |	Bind database
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,039	| IOT043 |	Companies in
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,575	| IOT043 |	I'm kind of getting Cloud expertise
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,111	| IOT043 |	In building that up
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:43,647	| IOT043 |	Itself
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,183	| IOT043 |	Do they need to spend the money
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:49,279	| IOT043 |	To get the expertise the GE has or can you partner to get it
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,815	| IOT043 |	Where does that kind of
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,583	| IOT043 |	Need to take place
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:53,887	| IOT043 |	Thoughts
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,959	| IOT043 |	But that's not the question we want to leave you
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,239	| IOT043 |	No it's not
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,775	| IOT043 |	It's a good question
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,335	| IOT043 |	The question was it
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:06,943	| IOT043 |	The last show we talked about the potential for smaller Amazon echos
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:10,015	| IOT043 |	Yes Echo Junior
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,039	| IOT043 |	We don't know any
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,343	| IOT043 |	Baby
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:17,184	| IOT043 |	We don't know anything more about other than reports that it's coming
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:20,256	| IOT043 |	Should be about the size of a beer can can't tell if it's a 12
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:20,768	| IOT043 |	16 answer
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,840	| IOT043 |	But we were talking about how we wanted that
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:26,656	| IOT043 |	In the house in different rooms because of the voice activation
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,704	| IOT043 |	What do we have interesting
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,472	| IOT043 |	Comment
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:33,312	| IOT043 |	Flash question from Brian one of our listeners he says
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:35,616	| IOT043 |	Regarding the smaller Amazon Echo
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:37,920	| IOT043 |	The wearable seems like a better solution
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:44,576	| IOT043 |	The Siri function on the Apple watch is activated by a gesture which is slightly less creepy than always listening function
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,136	| IOT043 |	And still more convenient than hitting a button which
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,416	| IOT043 |	The
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:51,232	| IOT043 |	Portable Amazon Echo report illegal have to hit a button
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,256	| IOT043 |	If it's not.
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,048	| IOT043 |	Turning batteries
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,840	| IOT043 |	And he says princess
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,888	| IOT043 |	Also not confined to a room or a
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:03,264	| IOT043 |	Building and you know when I when I saw that I'm liking what Bryant that is a really good point not one that I have thought of
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:06,592	| IOT043 |	You could Amazon or does Amazon these are they thinking about
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,360	| IOT043 |	Kooding
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:11,968	| IOT043 |	Amazon voice Services until wearable that people would want to buy and where
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:15,040	| IOT043 |	And it's kind of a tough market for that right now if you're not a
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:20,928	| IOT043 |	Google or an apple or Microsoft because you got the whole software platform that
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:22,720	| IOT043 |	Typically goes along with that and
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:25,792	| IOT043 |	You know Amazon doesn't have that they forked Android
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,816	| IOT043 |	So that way they can have the
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:27,840	| IOT043 |	Fire stuff
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,864	| IOT043 |	There's no
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,168	| IOT043 |	Android Wear from Google that they can
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,192	| IOT043 |	In 4 coming out
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:35,776	| IOT043 |	That's kind of propriety everything that's not as open as Android itself
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,104	| IOT043 |	I don't know how they would do that but you know what if you could
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,128	| IOT043 |	Find a way to get
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,432	| IOT043 |	The echo voice services on your wrist
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,968	| IOT043 |	It is less creepy
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,784	| IOT043 |	Especially when you can just you know it's not always listening
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:53,184	| IOT043 |	And forget the apps you just do it through cloud services I'm thinking if it's an interesting point that Brian makes it where you think
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,720	| IOT043 |	So you could because
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,744	| IOT043 |	You can actually
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:59,328	| IOT043 |	Add Alexa voice services to
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,096	| IOT043 |	Other
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| IOT043 |	Amy the Amazon Hazmat test
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,912	| IOT043 |	2K available so you could
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,680	| IOT043 |	Put it on
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,448	| IOT043 |	Device
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,472	| IOT043 |	It just
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:05,984	| IOT043 |	And it doesn't have to
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:12,384	| IOT043 |	So if Brian if you're really like excited about this idea you can make it
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,712	| IOT043 |	Meeting
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,272	| IOT043 |	Tens of dollars on Kickstarter I don't know
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:22,368	| IOT043 |	I should have worn Brian Stacy is very good at giving homework assignments
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,160	| IOT043 |	It's true
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,440	| IOT043 |	Hallmark
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,464	| IOT043 |	I would buy one
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| IOT043 |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,048	| IOT043 |	Caveat there
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,072	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,352	| IOT043 |	I like this idea
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:37,216	| IOT043 |	If it's actually I wear at Pebble and people have told me it looks like a medical device on my way
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:39,520	| IOT043 |	Wrist though
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:41,312	| IOT043 |	Yeah yeah yeah so if you have
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:44,384	| IOT043 |	I mean that's the nice thing about an SDK
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:45,152	| IOT043 |	It's not as
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,944	| IOT043 |	Maybe nice is an API but
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:48,224	| IOT043 |	And you can add it to a lot of
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,272	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,296	| IOT043 |	It's not
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,832	| IOT043 |	Crazy talk
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,344	| IOT043 |	To Envision
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,136	| IOT043 |	Something like that
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:58,464	| IOT043 |	Knowing and it might give people more of a purpose to
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,512	| IOT043 |	To buy such a wearable because right now
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,792	| IOT043 |	Just my observation
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,816	| IOT043 |	Smart watches
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:06,400	| IOT043 |	Yes sales are growing but it's not taking off I don't think the way people attic
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,936	| IOT043 |	Expected and
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| IOT043 |	The third-party apps are just
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,752	| IOT043 |	It's not there yet there isn't
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,848	| IOT043 |	A ton of reasons to go and get this type of accessory for your wrist
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,872	| IOT043 |	Holy cow
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,176	| IOT043 |	I just realized
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,200	| IOT043 |	What you could put
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:22,528	| IOT043 |	Alexa voice services on a drone
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,344	| IOT043 |	You could build a skill
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:26,368	| IOT043 |	And you could call it back
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,928	| IOT043 |	Do you actually would have to go to school you could just call the Drone back to
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,720	| IOT043 |	How awesome would this be
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,744	| IOT043 |	That would be cool
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:36,096	| IOT043 |	I'm good I'm in the
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,888	| IOT043 |	There's lots of potential here and then
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:41,984	| IOT043 |	You know this is why I keep saying Amazon I think it's one of the best
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,776	| IOT043 |	Position companies
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,544	| IOT043 |	Spore
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,592	| IOT043 |	I'll sail East consumer Internet of Things
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,224	| IOT043 |	Am I pretty
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,784	| IOT043 |	I have an idea Stacy
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,064	| IOT043 |	You could make one
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:01,184	| IOT043 |	Homework 2 Chainz
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,720	| IOT043 |	More I get more assignments
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| IOT043 |	From Kevin
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,792	| IOT043 |	Yeah I will introduce Our Guest

EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,616	| IOT043 |	He is actually going to talk about
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| IOT043 |	Ux

EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:37,792	| IOT043 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,328	| IOT043 |	And I have Whitney Scott
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,096	| IOT043 |	Jensen
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,376	| IOT043 |	Hi Scott how are you
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,656	| IOT043 |	I'm fine thank you
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,984	| IOT043 |	And Scott is a ux designer
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:48,032	| IOT043 |	For the Chromecast team at Google
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:53,408	| IOT043 |	And Scott is gracious enough to join us not because he's going to talk to us about Google
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,688	| IOT043 |	But because he
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:57,760	| IOT043 |	Writes a lot of really good stuff as a designer
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,552	| IOT043 |	On the Internet of Things
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,856	| IOT043 |	So getting started let's talk about kind of
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,136	| IOT043 |	What's wrong with the boring bits
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,160	| IOT043 |	Let me sell it to you guys
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,696	| IOT043 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,464	| IOT043 |	What happened
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,024	| IOT043 |	When we start connecting our houses
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,560	| IOT043 |	We spent a lot of time talking about like
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,096	| IOT043 |	Hey
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,168	| IOT043 |	Really cool things we can do I talk about my lights all the time
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:19,264	| IOT043 |	You guys are told me to stop talking about my lights all the time so Scott here is going to talk about
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,568	| IOT043 |	Saving money
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,592	| IOT043 |	Let's do it Scott
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:26,688	| IOT043 |	So excited by the end of the things they instantly go to the hole
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,224	| IOT043 |	Automation side effects
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:33,088	| IOT043 |	Excited about is what the iot enables
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,624	| IOT043 |	Base level
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:37,440	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:43,328	| IOT043 |	Your house so that you only have power at the outlets and the ceiling for lights you can replace all the wiring to your switches
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,888	| IOT043 |	And you wouldn't even know is my auntie house
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:50,496	| IOT043 |	But it'll be probably 40% cheaper on
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,032	| IOT043 |	Listen to get so excited
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:54,848	| IOT043 |	And I think that's in a course you could do peyote like things
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:27:02,016	| IOT043 |	Turn on 17 lights
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,112	| IOT043 |	I was seeing you hate this concept of a digital Butler
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:08,160	| IOT043 |	You're like forget cheese I think
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,208	| IOT043 |	What is either the title or subtitle in one
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:13,024	| IOT043 |	Jesus must go
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,560	| IOT043 |	Viz idea is that
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,328	| IOT043 |	We are
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,608	| IOT043 |	So excited
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,144	| IOT043 |	About the idea of automation
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,168	| IOT043 |	And the factory
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:22,496	| IOT043 |	That we don't really appreciates
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| IOT043 |	Weather makes sense
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,080	| IOT043 |	I just think that humans are
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,848	| IOT043 |	Sponge
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:29,152	| IOT043 |	Poetic Nessie
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:31,712	| IOT043 |	We can't be reduced down to 15 if then else clause
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:39,648	| IOT043 |	And there's so many things that people try to do that break down so I just think we need to have a little bit more
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,440	| IOT043 |	Humanitarian
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:46,304	| IOT043 |	Treat this with respect it deserves and there's lots of ways you can talk about
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:51,424	| IOT043 |	True I once spent probably a good for week
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:51,936	| IOT043 |	Trying to
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:55,520	| IOT043 |	Creative mode change an automatic mode change in my
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,824	| IOT043 |	For go to sleep
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,872	| IOT043 |	And it started with like a simple
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:00,896	| IOT043 |	When I turn off
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:04,224	| IOT043 |	In my house
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:04,992	| IOT043 |	About to sleep
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:07,040	| IOT043 |	Because
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:10,880	| IOT043 |	I would turn off those lights but my husband would be downstairs reading and then all the lights
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,184	| IOT043 |	So then I was like okay
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:17,792	| IOT043 |	When those lights go out plus there's no motion downstairs
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:18,304	| IOT043 |	15 minutes
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,352	| IOT043 |	And that didn't work
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:20,864	| IOT043 |	Because he'd be watching
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,144	| IOT043 |	So then I was like
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:25,472	| IOT043 |	Downstairs
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,240	| IOT043 |	And
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,032	| IOT043 |	It's after a certain time
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:29,056	| IOT043 |	Like a really late time
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,592	| IOT043 |	I didn't work for whatever reason
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,920	| IOT043 |	When I read your diatribe against
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,200	| IOT043 |	Digital Butler
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:39,296	| IOT043 |	Yes that's exactly because it never it never came to pass that I could
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,600	| IOT043 |	I could program a digital Butler
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,904	| IOT043 |	Or like an automation for this mode change
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:48,256	| IOT043 |	You're right humans are messy and it might work like 4 nights out of the way
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,304	| IOT043 |	But those other three it was
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:53,120	| IOT043 |	Absolutely aggravating for
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:55,168	| IOT043 |	Either him or me or
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,728	| IOT043 |	Maybe my daughter when she was sick and
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,520	| IOT043 |	You know trying to find us in the middle of the night
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,824	| IOT043 |	Lights were coming on ER
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,616	| IOT043 |	Good morning setting was coming on and she
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:07,200	| IOT043 |	In the morning and I feel sick and
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,760	| IOT043 |	DeSoto what's the saying good morning
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,296	| IOT043 |	Weathersby
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,344	| IOT043 |	In the coffee pot starts Brewing
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:13,856	| IOT043 |	Its 3
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:22,304	| IOT043 |	Forget or don't appreciate that with automation comes lack of concern
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:28,448	| IOT043 |	And it's usually even though it works 90% of the time you have to work 35% of the time
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:32,288	| IOT043 |	To be in your house and you have no control isn't terrible feeling
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,336	| IOT043 |	And so that's why I'm a big
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:40,736	| IOT043 |	Follower of Douglas engelbart who wrote years ago
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,760	| IOT043 |	An argument
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:45,856	| IOT043 |	That I think that we need to think about our houses as having different
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:48,160	| IOT043 |	Types of systems
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,208	| IOT043 |	Coeur d'Alene is fairly simple.
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:54,048	| IOT043 |	No one's going to get too upset before wedding comes on
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:58,656	| IOT043 |	What's ceiling
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,960	| IOT043 |	Or happy
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:05,568	| IOT043 |	The intention was to be a little bit more
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,848	| IOT043 |	Humanitarian
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,128	| IOT043 |	If no one's around
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,944	| IOT043 |	Then it should
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:15,552	| IOT043 |	Actually warned you work send a video to your phone or use voice commands Ark
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,320	| IOT043 |	Something so
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:21,696	| IOT043 |	Augmentation base system
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| IOT043 |	Magic
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,792	| IOT043 |	I'm in control
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| IOT043 |	Interesting
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,728	| IOT043 |	A lot about and you tweet a lot about is this idea
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:35,264	| IOT043 |	Identity and
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:37,056	| IOT043 |	Devices having identities
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,080	| IOT043 |	And basically
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:45,504	| IOT043 |	Because right now a lot of things
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:47,552	| IOT043 |	Connected devices are signed to
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,832	| IOT043 |	You was a person
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,856	| IOT043 |	And not like
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,880	| IOT043 |	Your family
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:54,976	| IOT043 |	Which would be probably preferable since that's tends to be who lives in houses
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:59,072	| IOT043 |	And you were telling me before the show that your house actually now has
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:30:59,840	| IOT043 |	Gmail account
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:00,864	| IOT043 |	Which
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,728	| IOT043 |	I would think the only thing I can come up with because if I'm going to hardwire
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:06,752	| IOT043 |	Smart lights
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:12,128	| IOT043 |	It's one thing to have an Alexa with you that's fine
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,664	| IOT043 |	So there's a rule on this show
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,688	| IOT043 |	Because so many of
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:16,992	| IOT043 |	So many of our listeners have an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,760	| IOT043 |	We cannot say her name
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,784	| IOT043 |	She is she who shall not be
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:23,136	| IOT043 |	Of course sorry about that
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:30,816	| IOT043 |	Amazon
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,168	| IOT043 |	Requires an account
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,472	| IOT043 |	With my email account so when I sell my house
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,032	| IOT043 |	What do
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,992	| IOT043 |	No sense
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,016	| IOT043 |	Printing a house
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:50,784	| IOT043 |	Email account
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,648	| IOT043 |	Gold Exchange the
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,696	| IOT043 |	Passwords on the Gmail account and
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:01,280	| IOT043 |	They will have access to everything and it'll work out of the box now
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:03,072	| IOT043 |	I'm not happy with the solution
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,192	| IOT043 |	I did Lutron
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,496	| IOT043 |	Light switches and they were actually design
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,264	| IOT043 |	The ground up
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,800	| IOT043 |	To convey with a house
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:16,128	| IOT043 |	So there is an account associated with Neutron
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,688	| IOT043 |	They're not associated with the switch themselves
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,200	| IOT043 |	Which
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,040	| IOT043 |	With the thermostat
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,064	| IOT043 |	I have
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:27,392	| IOT043 |	Actually had to learn how to reset the nest
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:30,464	| IOT043 |	Thermostat in my ecobee thermostat just so
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,488	| IOT043 |	EBay
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:34,304	| IOT043 |	And I was actually a debate we had actually couple years ago was like
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:38,144	| IOT043 |	If you spend $250 on one of these thermostats
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,424	| IOT043 |	Is that something that you
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,984	| IOT043 |	Take out and take with you or do you
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:46,336	| IOT043 |	In your house and then do you how do you
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,640	| IOT043 |	Say that to the owner that they now have to
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,176	| IOT043 |	Connect to thermostat they have
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:54,784	| IOT043 |	Think about your dishwasher your washing machine
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,088	| IOT043 |	It send
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| IOT043 |	Yeah I was at CSN
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:01,952	| IOT043 |	And I was like oh like your Amazon account
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,232	| IOT043 |	And ordering their own
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:04,768	| IOT043 |	Stop
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:07,840	| IOT043 |	So imagine imagine the paperwork that goes with your new house now
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:16,800	| IOT043 |	Best part of the issue is it and how much it has to get reset because again I feel like this layering is
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,344	| IOT043 |	You think that we want to
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:32,160	| IOT043 |	Have some type of nuanced iot
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,440	| IOT043 |	Closed system concept
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:35,744	| IOT043 |	So that doesn't work
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:39,072	| IOT043 |	See certain devices now anything that requires
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:45,472	| IOT043 |	External control obviously sugar
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:47,264	| IOT043 |	Twerking in some kind of closed
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:49,056	| IOT043 |	Mechanism
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:51,104	| IOT043 |	And I don't think we talked about that enough
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,640	| IOT043 |	Let's think about this
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,408	| IOT043 |	Because
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,432	| IOT043 |	There's a couple different ways
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,528	| IOT043 |	You build a closed loop system
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,296	| IOT043 |	Around
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,576	| IOT043 |	The physical place
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,856	| IOT043 |	Like the house
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,136	| IOT043 |	Much like you have
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:05,696	| IOT043 |	Your power so your power is associated with
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:06,720	| IOT043 |	Your physical address
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,816	| IOT043 |	So you have to think about
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:11,840	| IOT043 |	Who's going
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,608	| IOT043 |	To manage that
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,656	| IOT043 |	Aarhus kind of the guarantor
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:15,936	| IOT043 |	Behind that right
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,728	| IOT043 |	Or I don't know how you would think
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:20,544	| IOT043 |	What you going to pay my relationship and you got to deliver relation
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,080	| IOT043 |	So the power comes in
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,664	| IOT043 |	Right in the end of everything work
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:34,368	| IOT043 |	The payment with delivery of control
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,440	| IOT043 |	Okay great
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,208	| IOT043 |	So then
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,744	| IOT043 |	So in this closed system
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:41,536	| IOT043 |	Possible
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:44,096	| IOT043 |	Maybe those are the same thing maybe they're not
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,144	| IOT043 |	Cuz I think we got to figure out
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:46,912	| IOT043 |	Right
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,704	| IOT043 |	Figure out what devices
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:51,520	| IOT043 |	Makes sense in that
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,544	| IOT043 |	Physical space
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,336	| IOT043 |	So light switches make sense
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:55,616	| IOT043 |	Do thermostats
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,920	| IOT043 |	Do dishwashers
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:58,688	| IOT043 |	MN
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:01,504	| IOT043 |	What other relationships are you going to have with them
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,272	| IOT043 |	Because like
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,576	| IOT043 |	And then how did those get managed
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,720	| IOT043 |	We can talk about
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,560	| IOT043 |	You can talk about my life
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:21,728	| IOT043 |	Wired and certain ways you could somehow create a closed loop
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:23,264	| IOT043 |	When these things are built
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:26,080	| IOT043 |	Together they each other in such a way that
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:30,944	| IOT043 |	There's are fine in their permanent than you bring in a new Samsung microwave and you wanted to communicate
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,552	| IOT043 |	Vanessa will call Nicole the Multi-Device Direct
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:39,648	| IOT043 |	Working America
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:42,976	| IOT043 |	And I want you to come to my house
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,512	| IOT043 |	I want you to unlock
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,048	| IOT043 |	The door by don't want you to accept
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:46,560	| IOT043 |	My file system
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:55,008	| IOT043 |	And again right now the answer is just giving you no account and you're done but it supposed to sing
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:57,824	| IOT043 |	Here's a residence of yours the owners of yours the kids
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:01,664	| IOT043 |	I need the controls that might survive the house being sold
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,200	| IOT043 |	Right
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:04,224	| IOT043 |	And So It Goes
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| IOT043 |	Control and you sell the house
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:17,024	| IOT043 |	And I don't think it would talk about this act like how can we do what we funded for you and step it up a level
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,816	| IOT043 |	To actually provide
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,376	| IOT043 |	Access
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,144	| IOT043 |	Beyond belief
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:32,896	| IOT043 |	Pull a lot of now I see a lot of that happening at the network level so like I see a lot of companies
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,688	| IOT043 |	Adding data access layer
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,712	| IOT043 |	Would like a Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:38,272	| IOT043 |	In software accompanying the Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:39,808	| IOT043 |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,088	| IOT043 |	So that that is like a
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,624	| IOT043 |	Cited trend
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,136	| IOT043 |	What is happening
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,928	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:46,464	| IOT043 |	You know and being able to say
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,024	| IOT043 |	If you're a guest you have access
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,304	| IOT043 |	The following devices
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,584	| IOT043 |	You have access
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:52,352	| IOT043 |	Cast of The Following
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| IOT043 |	Whatever permission
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:55,168	| IOT043 |	Which is very much what happens like
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:55,680	| IOT043 |	Corporate
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,104	| IOT043 |	Define gas
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,920	| IOT043 |	And then there for Augusta.
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,712	| IOT043 |	I said this and by default you are a guest
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:11,552	| IOT043 |	And that's quite a simplistic model that but it's so easy to break out of the gas
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,344	| IOT043 |	Open my front door
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,880	| IOT043 |	How do we handle a problem
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,416	| IOT043 |	Brain okay
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:19,488	| IOT043 |	I guess you could create different Airbnb guest verses
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:23,584	| IOT043 |	Hunting opportunities for identity broker
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:28,704	| IOT043 |	Stop being so for example Airbnb could easily become the Facebook of home automation in the sense that
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:32,288	| IOT043 |	If you had all devices can support Airbnb accounts and then you can just
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,616	| IOT043 |	Bill's got access in Beaumont to go but
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,944	| IOT043 |	Single monolithic identity
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,088	| IOT043 |	Struggling with
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:48,416	| IOT043 |	How do we have a Federated identity system so that you could
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,952	| IOT043 |	Poltergeist people
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,488	| IOT043 |	Well yeah because
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:54,560	| IOT043 |	There's identity for the people
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,096	| IOT043 |	Like there's my identity
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,888	| IOT043 |	Which changes obviously
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:00,960	| IOT043 |	Depending on where I am but there's also the device identity
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,728	| IOT043 |	And commission
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,520	| IOT043 |	And those are very different
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:06,080	| IOT043 |	And I know that I mean there's
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:10,944	| IOT043 |	Airbnb is working with various I want to say it's working with August but maybe
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,968	| IOT043 |	A different
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:14,016	| IOT043 |	Home company working with
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,296	| IOT043 |	August or a difference
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,320	| IOT043 |	Lock Company
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:20,672	| IOT043 |	Kevo perhaps I can't remember to create these kind of like
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,744	| IOT043 |	You know permissions
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,280	| IOT043 |	So like when you sign up
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,608	| IOT043 |	For Airbnb then you automatically get
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,120	| IOT043 |	Codes
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,912	| IOT043 |	Which is very happy
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,496	| IOT043 |	But yeah that is like
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,872	| IOT043 |	Pacific Market
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,760	| IOT043 |	Manufacturers of door locks
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,368	| IOT043 |	Say things like where you can give a key to your
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,392	| IOT043 |	House cleaner
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,184	| IOT043 |	And you know they can get in
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:58,560	| IOT043 |	Delegate
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:01,376	| IOT043 |	What's up
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,144	| IOT043 |	I'm questioning
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,168	| IOT043 |	I'm just questioning
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:05,984	| IOT043 |	What am I
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,032	| IOT043 |	What am I more famous
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:11,360	| IOT043 |	Articles talk about this idea of value greater than pain
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,176	| IOT043 |	Desiigner as long as
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,968	| IOT043 |	You know you'll do something
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:21,344	| IOT043 |	The problem is that's awesome painter sohi
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,880	| IOT043 |	Are nice things early valuable
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,232	| IOT043 |	Do it
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,328	| IOT043 |	Ramblin the space part of it is
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:32,608	| IOT043 |	I don't think you'll appreciate
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,680	| IOT043 |	Be quiet
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:38,496	| IOT043 |	Yeah cuz if you had like Universal standard
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,520	| IOT043 |	You could have like
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:41,824	| IOT043 |	A way to implement
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:43,616	| IOT043 |	Permissions with your life
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:45,152	| IOT043 |	Unlock code with your door
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,944	| IOT043 |	Which would be really interested
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,480	| IOT043 |	So
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:53,600	| IOT043 |	When you got your key from a Kevo or an August or whomever
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,136	| IOT043 |	Along with that
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,952	| IOT043 |	You could unlock a variety of experiences
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,512	| IOT043 |	You could customize as the
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:03,328	| IOT043 |	Omar you can customize that users access
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,096	| IOT043 |	As you were getting them
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:06,400	| IOT043 |	But that would require
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:09,984	| IOT043 |	The door lock company to build that experience
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:12,800	| IOT043 |	It would require some sort of standardization
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,848	| IOT043 |	Across all of their connect
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:15,616	| IOT043 |	Two devices
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,384	| IOT043 |	That would be awesome
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,712	| IOT043 |	It would be and I think of you are probably taking
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,992	| IOT043 |	One of the more difficult problems
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:25,344	| IOT043 |	And important part of my
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:32,000	| IOT043 |	Which is simplified wiring automated lighting
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:36,096	| IOT043 |	Things like that that would be really really valuable and not near me
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,912	| IOT043 |	So that's where I think
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:40,960	| IOT043 |	Appreciate
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,128	| IOT043 |	True
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,408	| IOT043 |	Let's pick a less
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:51,456	| IOT043 |	Problem I've already using
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:52,736	| IOT043 |	The wiring is
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:55,808	| IOT043 |	I'm assuming you're talking about things like Bluetooth lights
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:57,856	| IOT043 |	For getting rid of wiring
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:58,880	| IOT043 |	Yes
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:08,352	| IOT043 |	I'm going to to Bluetooth
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,168	| IOT043 |	Classic license
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,192	| IOT043 |	Baby always
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:12,704	| IOT043 |	You're going to
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:18,080	| IOT043 |	I am considering that right now
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,872	| IOT043 |	Jefferson Township
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,968	| IOT043 |	I'd like I'm Pro Lutron light switch
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,016	| IOT043 |	Although it's an old school standard
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,904	| IOT043 |	And I use them to replace light switches where
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:35,744	| IOT043 |	No light switch it says so I don't have to go into the walls and say
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,280	| IOT043 |	Hello
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:40,096	| IOT043 |	Let me do it expensive renovation project in my brand new home
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:42,912	| IOT043 |	So I'm already taking advantage of the boring bits
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:43,680	| IOT043 |	Yay
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,192	| IOT043 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,728	| IOT043 |	So thinking about
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,496	| IOT043 |	Other
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,520	| IOT043 |	Small problems
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,032	| IOT043 |	Sore
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,056	| IOT043 |	Things
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:55,711	| IOT043 |	I tried to take what have you done in your own home that you're like this is a perfect use case
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,991	| IOT043 |	Of low-hanging fruit
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:57,503	| IOT043 |	For the internet
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:05,695	| IOT043 |	Well actually what my wife doesn't hate is the thing that can and I will admit you think it's a little boring but
EDL	00:42:05,695	00:42:10,303	| IOT043 |	It's just simply being able to have light switches that behave like light switches
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,351	| IOT043 |	Like
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,119	| IOT043 |	Smart device
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,399	| IOT043 |	So that life with a light switch
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,447	| IOT043 |	Turn on
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:20,799	| IOT043 |	So I can kind of get rid of these for arthritis
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,591	| IOT043 |	Gang of four switches my kitchen
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:25,151	| IOT043 |	Turn on each of the individual Banks lights
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:26,687	| IOT043 |	Work 90
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:28,223	| IOT043 |	Percent of the time there's a
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,759	| IOT043 |	Two things I want to do
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:32,831	| IOT043 |	And so by being able replacing light switches
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:33,855	| IOT043 |	Get rid of that turned
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:38,463	| IOT043 |	And yet I can use the
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,255	| IOT043 |	So I am now in the process
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,535	| IOT043 |	Rewiring the
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:44,863	| IOT043 |	And stuff so that nobody even knows
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,143	| IOT043 |	This is a Smart House
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:47,167	| IOT043 |	It's important.
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:48,703	| IOT043 |	Having better lighting
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,007	| IOT043 |	And I love the fact that I can have
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:53,055	| IOT043 |	Sling plug into socket
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:56,639	| IOT043 |	And having a spotlight be controlled with
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:59,711	| IOT043 |	Australian painting with light
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:04,319	| IOT043 |	See guys this is why
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:06,879	| IOT043 |	I spend so much time talking about lighting on the show
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:09,439	| IOT043 |	Because it's it's one of the easiest things to mess with
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,719	| IOT043 |	It's really smart
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:12,767	| IOT043 |	So Scott you're not doing anything with Smart Lipo
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,535	| IOT043 |	Don't say anything like that yet
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:15,839	| IOT043 |	I am
EDL	00:43:15,839	00:43:17,887	| IOT043 |	Smart light bulbs
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:23,007	| IOT043 |	Spot because you're fighting the fact
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:26,847	| IOT043 |	And so to me I think I should be in sweat
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:27,871	| IOT043 |	My current
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:28,895	| IOT043 |	Siri
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,175	| IOT043 |	We can argue
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:32,223	| IOT043 |	Will argue about that
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:39,391	| IOT043 |	Okay. Thank you so much for coming on the show for making me think Deep Thoughts
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,671	| IOT043 |	Rather early in the morning
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,695	| IOT043 |	And
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:43,231	| IOT043 |	Conjuring identity and
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:44,767	| IOT043 |	Standards and
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,047	| IOT043 |	At the end of
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:46,559	| IOT043 |	My Jeepster
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:57,311	| IOT043 |	That's it for this week's show thanks for listening and we'll see you back here next week
