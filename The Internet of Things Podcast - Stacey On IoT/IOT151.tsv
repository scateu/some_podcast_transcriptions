EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:49,152	| IOT151 |	But first
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:52,224	| IOT151 |	Let's hear a message from our sponsor this week sponsor is
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:54,272	| IOT151 |	Ring
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:01:00,672	| IOT151 |	Ring the connected doorbell and security camera maker Rings mission is to make neighborhood safer today
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:07,072	| IOT151 |	They over a million people use the ring video doorbell to help protect their hopes ring nose at home security
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:13,472	| IOT151 |	Who's at the front door but it doesn't end there so now they're extending the same level of security to the rest of your home with the ring floodlight cam
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:19,872	| IOT151 |	The floodlight cam is a motion-activated camera and floodlight that connects right to your phone
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:26,272	| IOT151 |	With HD video 2-way audio and more so you can see and speak to visitors and even set off an alarm
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:32,672	| IOT151 |	Rate from here I have tried the ring doorbell but I have not tried the ring floodlight cam
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:39,072	| IOT151 |	And I will say that I really enjoyed my ring doorbell it did its job super well with ring
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:45,472	| IOT151 |	You're always home so for listeners of our show save up to $150 on a ring
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:51,872	| IOT151 |	Ring security kit when you go to ring.com Stacey Stacey
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:54,688	| IOT151 |	So go to ring.com / Stacy
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:59,040	| IOT151 |	As you can get $150 off your ring security
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,088	| IOT151 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,368	| IOT151 |	We are back
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,160	| IOT151 |	With what are we going to
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:09,024	| IOT151 |	Machine learning at the edge we have to start with chips cuz that's your thing
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:10,560	| IOT151 |	I love that
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| IOT151 |	Meet you
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| IOT151 |	Potato chips
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,400	| IOT151 |	Keauhou
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,424	| IOT151 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:17,216	| IOT151 |	Corn chips
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,008	| IOT151 |	Okay I'm sorry
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:19,776	| IOT151 |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,080	| IOT151 |	I am a little hungry but we're actually talk
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,104	| IOT151 |	Talking about
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,128	| IOT151 |	Doctors because
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,176	| IOT151 |	Who doesn't love a good semiconductor story
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:32,320	| IOT151 |	Basically what's happening is this week arm said that it is going to build a new architecture
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,624	| IOT151 |	For machine learning at the
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,136	| IOT151 |	The edge
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,416	| IOT151 |	In
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,184	| IOT151 |	This is
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,744	| IOT151 |	You don't just like mess up your architecture
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,024	| IOT151 |	For no apparent
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:45,888	| IOT151 |	But what they've decided is they need massive parallel processing
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| IOT151 |	At the edge
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,680	| IOT151 |	At a very low power
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:50,752	| IOT151 |	They're doing this in a couple different ways
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:52,288	| IOT151 |	They're going to launch two different
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:55,872	| IOT151 |	Flavors of this when is an object detection flavor which is
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,664	| IOT151 |	For computer vision specifically
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,968	| IOT151 |	And then the other is just generic machine
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,760	| IOT151 |	The Edge and
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:03,040	| IOT151 |	Ho Kevin
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,088	| IOT151 |	Let's talk about why machine learning at the edge isn't
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:10,208	| IOT151 |	Well let me kick that all sin with a question to you
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,744	| IOT151 |	In terms of
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,280	| IOT151 |	Edge devices
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:18,656	| IOT151 |	What do you think these will find their way into
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,168	| IOT151 |	Cameras
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,984	| IOT151 |	I think also maybe some smart speakers
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,288	| IOT151 |	You probably will also see them
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,872	| IOT151 |	What cameras and smart speakers for the first initial
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,384	| IOT151 |	Wave of them
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,712	| IOT151 |	And I'll say that because cameras need to
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,784	| IOT151 |	If you can do object detection at the edge
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,088	| IOT151 |	And the other thing is we should say
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:38,880	| IOT151 |	There's two flavors of machinery
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:41,440	| IOT151 |	There's the training portion where you
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,232	| IOT151 |	Train the computer how to
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,256	| IOT151 |	Nice something in that takes
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,792	| IOT151 |	Typically is dead in the car
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,096	| IOT151 |	Because it takes massive computing
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,144	| IOT151 |	King Power massive parallel processing you should
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:50,912	| IOT151 |	Peter thousand
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,192	| IOT151 |	Thousands of images in there like
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| IOT151 |	Learn how to recognize a dog versus a
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,312	| IOT151 |	And then there's the execution the inference
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,128	| IOT151 |	And that basically
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:05,248	| IOT151 |	Once you've trained a computer you've built a model and then that model gets executed at the end
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:12,416	| IOT151 |	So it's important to know that what are missing is they will actually be able to do both execution and some info
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,952	| IOT151 |	Prince at the edge
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,559	| IOT151 |	It is because you mentioned that you know the cloud
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,375	| IOT151 |	Approached I noticed in arms documentation
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:24,703	| IOT151 |	They have discussed neural network Frameworks and they
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:28,031	| IOT151 |	They say there no network software Translate
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,079	| IOT151 |	Google tensorflow for example
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,359	| IOT151 |	Which is
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,895	| IOT151 |	The big machine learning
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:37,503	| IOT151 |	Backbone of Google nearest tensorflow everywhere you wouldn't see it or hear call tensorflow
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:44,415	| IOT151 |	But a product delivers is coming to a lot of devices so I'm wondering and I know we don't discuss these on on the show
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:48,767	| IOT151 |	Show that much I'm wondering how many phone makers will integrate this and we see it first there
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,047	| IOT151 |	As it
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,327	| IOT151 |	Comes out to Iowa
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,655	| IOT151 |	T-Type devices the only reason I say that is because I know that
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,727	| IOT151 |	I said Huawei with their Kirin processors have
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,239	| IOT151 |	Some
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,775	| IOT151 |	Aai chip
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:02,591	| IOT151 |	In the now as well as
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,127	| IOT151 |	Who else is working on that
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:07,455	| IOT151 |	I want to say Samsung but not have any products right now
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,479	| IOT151 |	So I'm just wondering if
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,831	| IOT151 |	Bissell filter out through phones first and then float further to the edge
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:17,183	| IOT151 |	I imagine they will I also would say that we will see these for sure in 6
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:22,047	| IOT151 |	And possibly drones actually drones has a really interesting use
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,559	| IOT151 |	Case for something like
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:26,399	| IOT151 |	So I should correct something though because they have the two
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:29,727	| IOT151 |	Machine learning and then they have the object detection processors
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:33,055	| IOT151 |	The object detection processor will only do
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,871	| IOT151 |	Inference so basically that's not going to be training
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,407	| IOT151 |	You can't train enough
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,431	| IOT151 |	Section at the
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:42,527	| IOT151 |	Right so that's going to be providing the information
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:43,551	| IOT151 |	Royal
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,599	| IOT151 |	Rap
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,623	| IOT151 |	That's okay though
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:49,439	| IOT151 |	Weather saying this can do is they're going to have
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,207	| IOT151 |	You can show
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,743	| IOT151 |	People the direction they're facing
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,559	| IOT151 |	Hindu gesture and pose
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:58,911	| IOT151 |	And this is all based the object detection is based on their acquisition of apical
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| IOT151 |	Colwich
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| IOT151 |	I had
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:03,775	| IOT151 |	Talk 2 years ago was like super excited about him so pumped when are
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,103	| IOT151 |	I'm glad to see that acquisition finally met
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,735	| IOT151 |	And I don't know what else to tell you guys about this other than
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,111	| IOT151 |	They're not alone there's a lot of
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:25,023	| IOT151 |	In a moment this is called project Trillium so if you see
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,047	| IOT151 |	References to that
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:29,375	| IOT151 |	You guys we should see the object detection processor
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:32,191	| IOT151 |	We're not going to expect any silicon-based on this
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,983	| IOT151 |	Until mid-to-late 2019
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,263	| IOT151 |	At the earliest
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,055	| IOT151 |	So that means it's not actually good
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,847	| IOT151 |	B&N products
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,359	| IOT151 |	Until like
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,175	| IOT151 |	So this is far-reaching
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,991	| IOT151 |	Right because arm doesn't make chips they just create the
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,271	| IOT151 |	The architecture of that
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,039	| IOT151 |	Jamaica reviews
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| IOT151 |	Call Apple
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:54,207	| IOT151 |	Immediate acne
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,511	| IOT151 |	Aura Plano license and they will
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:02,143	| IOT151 |	This might not sound like it's related but I'm going to it is something to mention it
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,679	| IOT151 |	Apparently the hive
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,983	| IOT151 |	Camera uses a first generation
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,287	| IOT151 |	OD chip from based on arm
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,335	| IOT151 |	This is the second OD
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,639	| IOT151 |	Generation chip from arm or architecture
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| IOT151 |	From our mission say
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,223	| IOT151 |	Alan just wondering I'm not familiar with the hive
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:16,991	| IOT151 |	Camera
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:22,367	| IOT151 |	Send wondering what kind of object detection that has Hive is from British gas it's there
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:26,719	| IOT151 |	It's sold in the UK and that's because this isn't actually from our mats from Apple
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,743	| IOT151 |	Which is the company that
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| IOT151 |	Icing
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:32,095	| IOT151 |	Yes it does have object detection
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,863	| IOT151 |	It is
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:33,887	| IOT151 |	I think it's
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| IOT151 |	Facial
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| IOT151 |	I think it's facial
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:37,215	| IOT151 |	Ignition
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,287	| IOT151 |	But I don't know beyond much beyond that
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,847	| IOT151 |	Curious hi-vis actual
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,359	| IOT151 |	Planning
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,943	| IOT151 |	They're trying to build their US
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,783	| IOT151 |	It's a subscription-based service.
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,575	| IOT151 |	That was so it's you get the hardware and you
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,087	| IOT151 |	Pay the money
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,367	| IOT151 |	It's lovely
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,927	| IOT151 |	Little bit about that okay
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| IOT151 |	Let's move on to
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| IOT151 |	Amazon
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,327	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,935	| IOT151 |	But Amazon is actually so the big news this week was
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:10,495	| IOT151 |	Last December when Amazon acquired
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,311	| IOT151 |	Blink which was the wireless the battery
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,079	| IOT151 |	Empowered
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,847	| IOT151 |	Camera
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,383	| IOT151 |	And they also make a doorbell
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:21,247	| IOT151 |	So when Amazon acquired blank it was a deal valued at about 90 million dollars which
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| IOT151 |	Pets
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:27,647	| IOT151 |	The interesting thing is and I said this last December is that blink is not just a camera maker
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| IOT151 |	It actually made a
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,207	| IOT151 |	Add imagery
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,975	| IOT151 |	Ignition chip
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,535	| IOT151 |	Ecology a video it's actually a video processing
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,583	| IOT151 |	Chip and
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,375	| IOT151 |	It did it at super low power
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT151 |	Empathize
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,191	| IOT151 |	Buy the chip company
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,519	| IOT151 |	Me and we're selling these chips for like five bucks to like DVD Maker
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,287	| IOT151 |	And this is
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,567	| IOT151 |	No prop
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,847	| IOT151 |	Just terrible business for
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:50,431	| IOT151 |	So they were like what else could we use this more and they decided to build a video game
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,735	| IOT151 |	I want to make use of their technology
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,527	| IOT151 |	And that's how blank was for
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,855	| IOT151 |	So Amazon when they bought link they got that shipped
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,671	| IOT151 |	In addition to that
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:06,559	| IOT151 |	The information is reporting that Amazon is developing a chip design for artificial intelligence
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,839	| IOT151 |	Twerk on the echo
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,607	| IOT151 |	Other Hardware
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,911	| IOT151 |	Powered by Madame
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:15,263	| IOT151 |	So is story if any information is talking about Amazon's acquisition of a
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,567	| IOT151 |	Company a couple years ago called Annapurna
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:22,943	| IOT151 |	Annapurna was doing networking chips and they were dealing primarily with a software layer of
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,223	| IOT151 |	Networking
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,271	| IOT151 |	So creating basically they call it a fabric
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,855	| IOT151 |	Fabrics are used to manage
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,415	| IOT151 |	Moving information around the chip is probably the
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,439	| IOT151 |	Best way to describe it
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,719	| IOT151 |	You think that's fair
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,255	| IOT151 |	Lancaster
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,303	| IOT151 |	Okay so Annapurna is a fabric
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,119	| IOT151 |	And when you're talk about machine learning
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,423	| IOT151 |	This is super important because
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:48,287	| IOT151 |	When I talk about machine learning it keeps saying the word massively parallel processes
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,359	| IOT151 |	And that's exactly how these jobs are divided up so you
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,127	| IOT151 |	You send
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,455	| IOT151 |	One job to One Core another job to another core in
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:58,015	| IOT151 |	So on and so on but you need a fabric to manage all
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| IOT151 |	Until annapurna's good at that
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| IOT151 |	And then we got it
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| IOT151 |	The blink
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,671	| IOT151 |	Video processing so that makes sense
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,719	| IOT151 |	And then Amazon has its own chip design
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,231	| IOT151 |	Singer sew
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,791	| IOT151 |	I think we're going to see is some
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,095	| IOT151 |	Intelligence at the edge
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| IOT151 |	Happening
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,679	| IOT151 |	And it sounds like it's going to happen both from
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:21,311	| IOT151 |	Companies that are traditional ship providers but also if you're going to be building consumer Hardware you're going to need to do it yourself
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,151	| IOT151 |	And I'm wondering a couple things about this
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,967	| IOT151 |	Totally see where this is going on agree with you
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,295	| IOT151 |	The first thing I thought I could ever was talking about Otis
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,879	| IOT151 |	Speed this is going to bring to Matt amazed responses is going to be amazing
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,415	| IOT151 |	Everybody kept focusing on that and like
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:43,327	| IOT151 |	Oh yeah but also I think there may be something here when you push a lot of that intelligence away from the cloud down
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:43,839	| IOT151 |	The edge
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,143	| IOT151 |	You improved
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,167	| IOT151 |	Perception of privacy
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:52,543	| IOT151 |	And that's something that right now all of these smart speakers
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,567	| IOT151 |	SAR fighting
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:57,151	| IOT151 |	You know nobody wants these always on microphone send me all the information on the cloud
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:00,479	| IOT151 |	If you can do all of it with ML at the edge
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| IOT151 |	And not rely on the cloud
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,319	| IOT151 |	That really helps with that area I think
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:07,135	| IOT151 |	It does the question then becomes what data does get
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,903	| IOT151 |	Pushed off bridge
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,671	| IOT151 |	Cuz you do need
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,719	| IOT151 |	And eventually when you can actually do
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,791	| IOT151 |	Training at the edge then you actually
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| IOT151 |	Get the opportunity
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,631	| IOT151 |	Personalized Services until then
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,399	| IOT151 |	Depersonalization.
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,215	| IOT151 |	Right right
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:27,359	| IOT151 |	And the other thing that jumped out at me on this is a definite Trend you're obviously I didn't know about the on Trillium when this
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,383	| IOT151 |	Amazon news came out
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:32,735	| IOT151 |	But it relates back to that everybody seems to be making
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:35,295	| IOT151 |	Chips for the edge for their own products
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:41,695	| IOT151 |	Such as apple is using its A8 processor from the iPhone 6 or 7 I forget which
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,975	| IOT151 |	In the homepod freezing
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,815	| IOT151 |	Now you'll see Amazon devices eventually have this
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,607	| IOT151 |	Google has been
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,631	| IOT151 |	Talk about with
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| IOT151 |	Creating their own
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| IOT151 |	Soces and such
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| IOT151 |	Need the visual
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| IOT151 |	That's right they did they did which is
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,847	| IOT151 |	At the TV is exact
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:03,455	| IOT151 |	Exactly so it's definitely a trend and I'm wondering in Amazon
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| IOT151 |	Case particular
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,831	| IOT151 |	Will this be limited to Amazon Hardware only and I'm going to guess
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| IOT151 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,135	| IOT151 |	And the reason I'm saying yes
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:14,719	| IOT151 |	As a guess is because they let you freely use
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:20,351	| IOT151 |	Maddie Mae's voice services but there are very specific features and functions that are not on
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,679	| IOT151 |	Non Amazon devices with matinees voice services
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:26,495	| IOT151 |	I'm just under the wondering if Amazon keeps that chip
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| IOT151 |	Feature set
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,311	| IOT151 |	In the house
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:38,271	| IOT151 |	Well it but then again they also cut off potential Hardware partner such as you know the Sonos example has Madame a in it
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,319	| IOT151 |	I can't do everything that an echo can do but I do
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,343	| IOT151 |	90% of it
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,367	| IOT151 |	What date
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,903	| IOT151 |	Want to
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| IOT151 |	Check all these Hardware manufacturers off
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,583	| IOT151 |	That's a good thing to think about Kevin
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,143	| IOT151 |	All right I will I will think about it
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| IOT151 |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,471	| IOT151 |	We will move on to Google
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:00,031	| IOT151 |	Hiring a Samsung executive
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,335	| IOT151 |	To focus on iot
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| IOT151 |	Specifically
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,127	| IOT151 |	In the cloud
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:10,271	| IOT151 |	And not just any executive either this is the guy his name is in John R E
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:13,343	| IOT151 |	He used to be the EVP and head of Samsung pay
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:19,999	| IOT151 |	This goes back about two-and-a-half years ago and he was instrumental with Bixby
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,279	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,071	| IOT151 |	And it's interesting because I
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:25,887	| IOT151 |	What did I read I read something this week oh I don't know it was
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,447	| IOT151 |	There's an interview with Google Rick osterloh
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:33,311	| IOT151 |	There's a really good interview about getting Google AI into all of Google's product
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:36,895	| IOT151 |	The one question I didn't see asked or maybe was asking was an answer his
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,223	| IOT151 |	What is a think of Madame a in Bixby and other
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:44,319	| IOT151 |	Named you no assistance I want to name them all because I don't set a resources up
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:49,183	| IOT151 |	I'd be very curious to see what Google thinks but now that got somebody who's coming from the Bixby fold
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,207	| IOT151 |	Indeed
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,487	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,767	| IOT151 |	I think this is a good
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,815	| IOT151 |	Story Samsung actually has built
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,839	| IOT151 |	A really good
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,143	| IOT151 |	Cloud business believe it or not
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:01,471	| IOT151 |	There used to be Arctic now it's SmartThings cloud
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,543	| IOT151 |	Their focus on connecting everything
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,335	| IOT151 |	Is a neutral third party
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,407	| IOT151 |	It is really easy to use even I have actually use
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:15,551	| IOT151 |	I'm kind of stunned by that but it's a good implementation and I know I talk to people who are
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,319	| IOT151 |	Using them
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:16,831	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,391	| IOT151 |	To the extent of this guy worked on
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,671	| IOT151 |	The Knox security system
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,695	| IOT151 |	Spigen Samsung
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:26,047	| IOT151 |	How much time he spent on their Cloud stuff
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,815	| IOT151 |	But
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,143	| IOT151 |	If you can bring that Samsung really is trying to be this neutral
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:37,055	| IOT151 |	Play right so if you can bring some of that okay coming from inside
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,615	| IOT151 |	Google and I know I can talk about this plus my own just
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,151	| IOT151 |	Research into this
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:44,735	| IOT151 |	Samsung is very very good at
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,759	| IOT151 |	Acting neutral
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:46,783	| IOT151 |	But
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:52,671	| IOT151 |	In the real world at the end of the day same songs in it for Samsung and I say that because
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,231	| IOT151 |	They often recreate things that
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,023	| IOT151 |	Android already has
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,047	| IOT151 |	Maybe doesn't do well
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,607	| IOT151 |	A lot of what's in Android actually did
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:04,191	| IOT151 |	Come from Samsung split screen multitasking on a phone
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:06,495	| IOT151 |	Samsung did it first with their Galaxy Note 2
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:07,775	| IOT151 |	Eventually
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:09,055	| IOT151 |	Android just accepted it
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:13,407	| IOT151 |	Samsung's Knox which is there security system for Android devices
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| IOT151 |	In the Enterprise
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,735	| IOT151 |	That was competing head-to-head with
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,503	| IOT151 |	Google
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,039	| IOT151 |	Android Enterprise stop
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,599	| IOT151 |	Sure enough after about 2 or 3 years of competing
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,159	| IOT151 |	Google said you know we're going to be working agreement out
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,951	| IOT151 |	An integrated Knox
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,231	| IOT151 |	Features into
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:29,279	| IOT151 |	Android not to still separate but
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| IOT151 |	Google
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,631	| IOT151 |	Subsumes a lot of what Samsung does and obviously Samsung
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,911	| IOT151 |	Compensated for that
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,959	| IOT151 |	And I'm wondering in this case
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:41,823	| IOT151 |	I'm wondering if either part of their Cloud business if they got some expertise that Google doesn't have
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,359	| IOT151 |	Or with their digital assistant
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:48,735	| IOT151 |	If there are some things Bixby does more efficiently or or does that Google Assistant doesn't do
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:53,343	| IOT151 |	You watch give it a year or so and it'll get subsumed into Google
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,367	| IOT151 |	Okay well that's
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,135	| IOT151 |	That doesn't
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,903	| IOT151 |	Sound terrible
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,231	| IOT151 |	Oh no not at all not at all
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:04,095	| IOT151 |	No knocks when I say this I don't mean don't expect Bixby replace Google Assistant
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:08,703	| IOT151 |	Probably still live on its own on Samsung devices
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,239	| IOT151 |	Or unless
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,519	| IOT151 |	And best case I think for users
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,847	| IOT151 |	Bixby and Google Assistant just become the best
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,127	| IOT151 |	Read in one product
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:21,759	| IOT151 |	And that product would be Google Assistant course and it would go on all Samsung phones and
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:25,343	| IOT151 |	Bixby would essentially disappear inside of Google Assistant
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,879	| IOT151 |	I need weather
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:31,231	| IOT151 |	I have three in my room right now so yes I agree
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:34,303	| IOT151 |	Netflix PS3 controller systems
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,095	| IOT151 |	You could have four
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:40,191	| IOT151 |	Galaxy S8 yes but I'm not going to do that right now
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,471	| IOT151 |	Okay
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,751	| IOT151 |	Moving on from
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,567	| IOT151 |	Google Samsung the Mysteries they weave
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:48,127	| IOT151 |	Let's talk about a new radio in Wareham
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:55,295	| IOT151 |	Yeah this surprise me I don't really know too much I just got a press release before the show from Altair semiconductor
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:59,391	| IOT151 |	And they announced their collaboration with Ericsson and Sony mobile
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,415	| IOT151 |	What they're going to do it
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,231	| IOT151 |	Mobile World Congress is demonstrate
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,511	| IOT151 |	A new wearable device
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:09,119	| IOT151 |	Well it's a wristband for diabetic patients that connects to a continuous glucose monitoring device
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:16,287	| IOT151 |	The interesting part is we seen these kinds of things before they're using Altair's lte-m chips
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,079	| IOT151 |	Set for cellular connectivity
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,359	| IOT151 |	Without so you can
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,383	| IOT151 |	Center data back
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,663	| IOT151 |	Cheetah monitoring system
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,943	| IOT151 |	Without having your phone
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:25,247	| IOT151 |	It's always interesting because when we talk about
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,295	| IOT151 |	You know Cat 1 ml tem Etc
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,623	| IOT151 |	We talked about a lot of devices at the edge that
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:33,951	| IOT151 |	Run for long time on a battery so that's why
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,743	| IOT151 |	You know they use low-power radios and so on
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:39,071	| IOT151 |	Not wearable devices so this is kind of interesting to me
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,119	| IOT151 |	I agree and you fight
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:43,935	| IOT151 |	I mean you got your Apple watch with its own
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,959	| IOT151 |	Sim and
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:45,983	| IOT151 |	Is 4 G
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:52,383	| IOT151 |	It's not yet said at least 10 with an LTE connection
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:55,711	| IOT151 |	It makes sense to have this direct line out
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,479	| IOT151 |	4
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,527	| IOT151 |	You got to send that data
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,551	| IOT151 |	To the cloud to be monitored
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,599	| IOT151 |	And I assume
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,623	| IOT151 |	Especially for like
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| IOT151 |	Elderly or children
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:08,767	| IOT151 |	You actually don't want to just collect in store for a while cuz if something's wrong you need to be able to
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:13,887	| IOT151 |	Writes the funny thing is he just only cuz you brought the Apple watch
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:20,799	| IOT151 |	Apps and really not been built to take advantage of the LTE Connection by that I mean I leave my phone at home and I'll go
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,335	| IOT151 |	Go out for a few hours at a time
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:25,919	| IOT151 |	Sure I get messages I get phone calls I can chat with you Stacy him
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| IOT151 |	Cetera
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:31,551	| IOT151 |	When I go run for example all that data is captured with GPS heart rate and so on
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,367	| IOT151 |	I have to actually go back home and
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,927	| IOT151 |	Think it over through to my phone
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,231	| IOT151 |	I can't do that remotely
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:42,559	| IOT151 |	You can't go to it may make sense for now from ABBA
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,583	| IOT151 |	Perspective
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,887	| IOT151 |	Not a lot of data
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:50,751	| IOT151 |	People use anything set for phone calls use it for a phone call I can tell you
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:53,823	| IOT151 |	You lose 1% per minute on a phone call that's why
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:57,663	| IOT151 |	If you are not spending our on the phone you're going to lose 60% of your
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| IOT151 |	Apple watch battery life
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:02,783	| IOT151 |	And I mean that is another example though
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:07,647	| IOT151 |	You're still get it's not much data but every little bit counts I mean if I start thinking
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,671	| IOT151 |	At the data that just goes back
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,207	| IOT151 |	IPhone to the cloud
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,255	| IOT151 |	Right as rain
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:18,399	| IOT151 |	True beauty but even so you could optimize like in a health situation cuz it's modern my my heart rate
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:23,007	| IOT151 |	It doesn't need to send all that heart rate data back to the cloud or anywhere until I get home anyway
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:26,847	| IOT151 |	Unless maybe there's a some smarts in there says hey
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,151	| IOT151 |	This guy might be having a heart attack or something right now
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,967	| IOT151 |	That day and you ain't get sent on the always-on connection
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,247	| IOT151 |	You don't have to send all the day
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,039	| IOT151 |	That's true and that's where we're
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,063	| IOT151 |	See some really cool stuff
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:37,855	| IOT151 |	The hierarchy
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,391	| IOT151 |	Activation
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,951	| IOT151 |	Is what they call it and it's basically you have a chip
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,231	| IOT151 |	It senses something
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,535	| IOT151 |	And that it's it takes the next action so
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:49,887	| IOT151 |	You have something that says oh this is a trigger I recognize that that is a trigger
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:53,215	| IOT151 |	And it's important and I'm going to wake up something else so I can wake up the
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,751	| IOT151 |	Modem and say
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,287	| IOT151 |	Home
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,615	| IOT151 |	I got to bring back the machine learning in the chips back into this
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,407	| IOT151 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,687	| IOT151 |	I know you're disappointed with
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,199	| IOT151 |	Apps
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,527	| IOT151 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,343	| IOT151 |	Something fun that we missed last week
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| IOT151 |	List two things last
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,159	| IOT151 |	1
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,463	| IOT151 |	We missed Intel smart glasses which were about to talk about
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:14,975	| IOT151 |	Into
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,023	| IOT151 |	We miss celebrating our hundred
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,535	| IOT151 |	50th Park
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,327	| IOT151 |	That's right we did
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,167	| IOT151 |	So let's talk about those glasses
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:26,751	| IOT151 |	Yeah and I was very interested in this only because I
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,311	| IOT151 |	Purchase. I was reimbursed for it through work
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,359	| IOT151 |	Google Glass back in 2014
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:36,479	| IOT151 |	Still have them don't use them obviously not a successful product at least in the way that
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,503	| IOT151 |	Google might have holes
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,783	| IOT151 |	It has been used in
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,087	| IOT151 |	Certain verticals in Enterprise right now but
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,855	| IOT151 |	Other than that
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,391	| IOT151 |	Nope can't buy everything
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:47,231	| IOT151 |	Intel smart glasses are similar but different and are different enough
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,535	| IOT151 |	To have a lot more potential in my opinion
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:50,815	| IOT151 |	Because they do less
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,095	| IOT151 |	What I mean by that is
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:52,863	| IOT151 |	They
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,887	| IOT151 |	Willie r a
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,655	| IOT151 |	A notification
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,935	| IOT151 |	Open system for the most part
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,727	| IOT151 |	They're also don't look like
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:01,311	| IOT151 |	Anything from futuristic they look like regular glasses frames
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:06,943	| IOT151 |	Are all of the chips and battery and connectivity inside the side of the frames
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:13,343	| IOT151 |	You can't even see them there's no prism display actually sticking out from these things like Google Glass head instead there's a prism
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,623	| IOT151 |	Built into the glass
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,647	| IOT151 |	And IT projects
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:18,464	| IOT151 |	Using a low-power laser right on your retina
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,768	| IOT151 |	From the prism notifications
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,816	| IOT151 |	It does one thing and one thing
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,864	| IOT151 |	Very well and it doesn't look
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,376	| IOT151 |	Outrageous
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,936	| IOT151 |	So I'm looking forward to seeing what
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:33,568	| IOT151 |	Might be done with them this isn't something until it's going to sell that you're going to have a developer
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:36,384	| IOT151 |	Preview where people can try and write apps for it later this year
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:37,920	| IOT151 |	And
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:42,784	| IOT151 |	I'm countries have even come to Market because there was talk about until selling off its AR
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:45,856	| IOT151 |	Group elements I guess I will have to say
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:49,696	| IOT151 |	Do you know to me this I know people could be like Oar but I'm just like
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:51,232	| IOT151 |	Let's just talk about the
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,536	| IOT151 |	Power of a heads-up display for
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,584	| IOT151 |	Ito think about turn-by-turn directions
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,632	| IOT151 |	You know when you're walking around the city
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:00,704	| IOT151 |	Right now my phone will vibrate but I still don't know if I'm supposed to turn right or low
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,544	| IOT151 |	I just look at the Sun
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,104	| IOT151 |	How awesome would it be to be talking to someone in
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,640	| IOT151 |	Have some sort of indication of
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,152	| IOT151 |	Who this is
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:10,688	| IOT151 |	That's just me cuz I
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,224	| IOT151 |	Faces really well
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:15,808	| IOT151 |	Well you even also need a camera for that nice have no camera
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,344	| IOT151 |	Okay that is true
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,136	| IOT151 |	You know who people are based on their
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,160	| IOT151 |	Pair Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,696	| IOT151 |	We're not supposed to
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,024	| IOT151 |	Best part of that privacy of
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,328	| IOT151 |	Okay so no camera
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,864	| IOT151 |	I will be sad I will be sad
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,168	| IOT151 |	A little while ago speakers no mic
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,936	| IOT151 |	Oh so I can talk to
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,472	| IOT151 |	I don't believe so
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:39,616	| IOT151 |	This reminds me of the Amazon Echo cuz when it came out very early all it did was you
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| IOT151 |	Yeah
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:49,600	| IOT151 |	I remember the search engine so it couldn't answer that many questions I couldn't control Smart
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:51,904	| IOT151 |	I'm devices it just basically played music and
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:54,720	| IOT151 |	Set timers for lights why I didn't buy one man
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:23:00,096	| IOT151 |	You didn't buy one but enough people did in the use case became gradually soap
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:00,608	| IOT151 |	Compelling
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,400	| IOT151 |	Look at us now
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:08,288	| IOT151 |	Oh yeah once once they made it smarter you know switch on the troll that's when I go bowling absolutely
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,824	| IOT151 |	And so I I like
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:12,640	| IOT151 |	Having some of my favorite devices just do something really well
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,200	| IOT151 |	I think there's a lot of power
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,248	| IOT151 |	So I'm Nina on
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:17,760	| IOT151 |	This
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,296	| IOT151 |	Especially someone who wears glass
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:22,880	| IOT151 |	All right
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:25,696	| IOT151 |	Let us move on to Z home pod
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:27,232	| IOT151 |	Because
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,512	| IOT151 |	Kevin
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,584	| IOT151 |	Neither of us really wanted to order it
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,120	| IOT151 |	But we decided we had to
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,144	| IOT151 |	Because you guys
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,168	| IOT151 |	Really have a lot of questions
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:42,336	| IOT151 |	Either it's funny and it just goes back to what I just said I didn't
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,640	| IOT151 |	Want to buy the Echo and first came out
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,944	| IOT151 |	For the same reason or reasons that I
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,760	| IOT151 |	Don't want it by VIN by the homepod when it came out
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:53,856	| IOT151 |	There's two things to talk about with alpine obviously there's the sound
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,136	| IOT151 |	And then there's the smarts
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:59,744	| IOT151 |	Unfortunately in my opinion the smarts actually went into the sound meaning
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,280	| IOT151 |	Sonically engineered
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,816	| IOT151 |	Apple did an excellent
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,840	| IOT151 |	Excellent job
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,120	| IOT151 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:09,984	| IOT151 |	Doesn't blow me away like it did the early reviewers and a lot of early reviewers
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:13,568	| IOT151 |	Got a I'm just going to say they got a dog and pony show from Apple
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:20,480	| IOT151 |	An apple showed off the speaker and compare it to certain other speakers but I have since found out the set up on those was not the same
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,528	| IOT151 |	I'm like one of those speakers with setup for Bluetooth
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,320	| IOT151 |	Instead of Wi-Fi I mean so
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,392	| IOT151 |	I get why Apple does that and appreciate that but
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:33,280	| IOT151 |	It just doesn't blow me away it is really really good for a single unit device
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:38,656	| IOT151 |	I don't want a single speaker because it has multiple speakers at 7 tweeters and and 1 woofer
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,448	| IOT151 |	And it does sound good
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:43,264	| IOT151 |	It's got the smarts the intelligence to auto-tune itself
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:47,616	| IOT151 |	When you first put it down it will sample sound in the room you don't even hear it
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:51,200	| IOT151 |	And it will consider yourself for the room that you're in which is great
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:53,504	| IOT151 |	It'll do that again every time you move it
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,016	| IOT151 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:58,368	| IOT151 |	I don't see the benefit of that because you plug this thing and you're not going to move it that much so
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,416	| IOT151 |	That's neither here nor there
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,000	| IOT151 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,536	| IOT151 |	My daughter
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:08,096	| IOT151 |	Takes her Amazon Echo it's in her room
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,936	| IOT151 |	And she brings it into the bathroom for getting ready
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,960	| IOT151 |	And bats
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,728	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,008	| IOT151 |	She actually moves her Echo back
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,568	| IOT151 |	Because she doesn't have a tap
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,968	| IOT151 |	That's what I do I use the tap the tap I move around all the time
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,296	| IOT151 |	The point there is it psychic
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,344	| IOT151 |	Case where someone
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:33,696	| IOT151 |	No doubt no doubt I don't think the majority of
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,976	| IOT151 |	Imposter going to be moving
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,000	| IOT151 |	Is my point
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,816	| IOT151 |	But anyway
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,328	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:42,400	| IOT151 |	Just one more point about the sound before I talk about the smarts
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,984	| IOT151 |	I did a blind listening test with
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,776	| IOT151 |	Different music genres
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,592	| IOT151 |	I did the best I could to make it as equal as possible
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:56,480	| IOT151 |	Setting the sound levels to be the same now I did it with the homepod and I did it with a pair of Sonos ones
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,016	| IOT151 |	And one of my
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:00,576	| IOT151 |	Tech savvy friends came over listen and he's like
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| IOT151 |	Using two speakers
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,136	| IOT151 |	I am
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,672	| IOT151 |	Musical ly
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:07,488	| IOT151 |	Because they're the same price and he's like when you can
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,280	| IOT151 |	Put that into the equation instead of course you can
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:12,352	| IOT151 |	I said you have $349 to buy a
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:13,632	| IOT151 |	Homepod
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,936	| IOT151 |	Then you need to compare to what else do you get free money
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,728	| IOT151 |	Temperature in $49 you can get to sauna
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:23,104	| IOT151 |	He couldn't really tell much of a difference nobody really could affect people who had a preference
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,896	| IOT151 |	Amazon
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,688	| IOT151 |	It was the best speaker but it was
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,480	| IOT151 |	The preferred sound for them
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,784	| IOT151 |	Was actually the pair of Sonos once more often than not
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,344	| IOT151 |	So I don't know that surprises people or
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,928	| IOT151 |	Whatever but Sonos is the pioneers of smart speak
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:39,232	| IOT151 |	They've been doing
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,280	| IOT151 |	Similar things to this for
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| IOT151 |	4 years
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:46,144	| IOT151 |	Yeah they have and I'll say I'll give Apple Credit here
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,728	| IOT151 |	Insulate improve the experience in terms of setup it's very simple
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,008	| IOT151 |	In terms of
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:54,336	| IOT151 |	Using integration with apple music obviously it
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,616	| IOT151 |	That's all integrates with right now
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:59,712	| IOT151 |	That just works with Sonos it does that but it kind of
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,016	| IOT151 |	There's like Steps wooden steps to do that right
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:08,160	| IOT151 |	So they offer more but still more complicated if you just want to drop dead simple plug it in and start playing Apple music
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:11,232	| IOT151 |	From a smart standpoint I am shocked
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:14,048	| IOT151 |	And I said this in my written review
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:16,352	| IOT151 |	Siri is fragmented now
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:19,424	| IOT151 |	Siri does not work the same or does it have the same features
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,216	| IOT151 |	From an iOS device to the homepod
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:26,080	| IOT151 |	And that just boggles my mind there are things you can't do you can't set two timers you can't
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,384	| IOT151 |	Access your calendar create an event
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,920	| IOT151 |	It's just really strange
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:36,320	| IOT151 |	It just seems like it's Half Baked and the kind of goes along with some of the other features that aren't there that are coming in that is
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,600	| IOT151 |	Multi-room audio and
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,904	| IOT151 |	Blinking Twitty's for stereo
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| IOT151 |	That's coming but
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,464	| IOT151 |	It's just odd to me but
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:45,536	| IOT151 |	Siri is very responsive as you'd expect
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,560	| IOT151 |	Besame
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,096	| IOT151 |	A trip inside
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:48,864	| IOT151 |	The
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,912	| IOT151 |	Microphones for listening
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,704	| IOT151 |	Apple Mail. You can
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,496	| IOT151 |	You don't have to yell even if the music is
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,264	| IOT151 |	Is crank way up
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,032	| IOT151 |	It's really good
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,312	| IOT151 |	But again
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,616	| IOT151 |	If you aren't in apple music if you're not
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,408	| IOT151 |	On iOS if you're not using homekit
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:04,224	| IOT151 |	This just isn't going to be able to buy the father
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,016	| IOT151 |	It does not appeal to me
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:13,184	| IOT151 |	What the funny thing is I actually do use iOS and I am an apple music subscriber family is
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,512	| IOT151 |	But I still wouldn't buy this right now
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:20,352	| IOT151 |	At this is again it's just like the Amazon Echo I wouldn't buy when it first came out
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,144	| IOT151 |	It wasn't compelling enough for the time
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:25,728	| IOT151 |	Alright well if you have homekit questions for Kevin
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,776	| IOT151 |	And gosh I bet you do

EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:36,640	| IOT151 |	Is there a way that I can change.
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:39,456	| IOT151 |	Music
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,224	| IOT151 |	Sitel
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:43,040	| IOT151 |	I'm playlist to calendars on Outlook
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,904	| IOT151 |	Okay Sam
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,184	| IOT151 |	This is a
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:51,488	| IOT151 |	Pain point near and dear to my heart
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,256	| IOT151 |	Heart
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:56,608	| IOT151 |	Because I have been trying to use my Spotify account on Amazon Echo
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:58,400	| IOT151 |	Without using only mine
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,424	| IOT151 |	I've been trying to let my daughter
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,472	| IOT151 |	Use hers cuz we have the
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,496	| IOT151 |	Premium Spotify
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,288	| IOT151 |	Has multiple accounts
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,312	| IOT151 |	By golly it doesn't work
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:08,896	| IOT151 |	So I hate to tell you this you're going to have to either lie
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,664	| IOT151 |	Or
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,176	| IOT151 |	Supper
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,296	| IOT151 |	Depending on their ages
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:16,576	| IOT151 |	Depending on their ages
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:21,184	| IOT151 |	So my daughter is under the age of 13 so the only thing she can be
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:22,720	| IOT151 |	In the Amazon Echo universe
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,000	| IOT151 |	Is
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,024	| IOT151 |	Part of my household
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:26,560	| IOT151 |	But she can't actually
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:30,144	| IOT151 |	Have her email affiliated with anything except for allowances
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,192	| IOT151 |	And her Kindle like
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:34,240	| IOT151 |	The free time Kindle Freetime stuff
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,008	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:35,776	| IOT151 |	I can't
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,824	| IOT151 |	Associate her email address with
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,360	| IOT151 |	The calendar or with
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,128	| IOT151 |	R Spotify
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,432	| IOT151 |	Because she's underage
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,968	| IOT151 |	After she's 13
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,040	| IOT151 |	Cuz of the Copa act the
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,320	| IOT151 |	Children's online
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,856	| IOT151 |	Protection privacy protection
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,416	| IOT151 |	Danny Amazon can take her email
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,440	| IOT151 |	I guess start
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,232	| IOT151 |	Mission Mater
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,768	| IOT151 |	Then she can use it
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:31:03,424	| IOT151 |	So in that case all you have to do is register those devices for each of your daughters
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,704	| IOT151 |	To their account
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:07,520	| IOT151 |	So you would have to have an Amazon account
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:11,104	| IOT151 |	You would register those devices and then you would link
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,640	| IOT151 |	All of your accounts is a
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,152	| IOT151 |	Family
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:17,760	| IOT151 |	Kind of complicated but to register the device you go into the
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,528	| IOT151 |	Anime app
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,576	| IOT151 |	You going to settings
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:24,160	| IOT151 |	And you're going to see all of the different Amazon Echo devices in your
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,672	| IOT151 |	Household
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:25,952	| IOT151 |	There
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,280	| IOT151 |	It's Going Down Under about it'll say the device is registered
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:29,792	| IOT151 |	Burgess Owens
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,584	| IOT151 |	If it's registered to you
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,912	| IOT151 |	Because which it probably is if you bought it just deregister it
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,960	| IOT151 |	When you do that
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,240	| IOT151 |	You're going to
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,008	| IOT151 |	Connected to
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:39,520	| IOT151 |	Your daughters are
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,848	| IOT151 |	And I did actually brings up a point that I
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,640	| IOT151 |	Probably should have mentioned in the homepod
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,920	| IOT151 |	That because
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:52,320	| IOT151 |	This is a lot like iCloud in Family Sharing iOS I wanted to mention that the homepod only supports one
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:56,416	| IOT151 |	User One Voice one iCloud account right now so multiple people in the home
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,952	| IOT151 |	Will not be recognized
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,744	| IOT151 |	Everybody's one user
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,792	| IOT151 |	And that's a problem for your personal information
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:02,816	| IOT151 |	Oh that is a problem
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,864	| IOT151 |	And you find the
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:08,192	| IOT151 |	Household like you find the area about who you're at a household with
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,240	| IOT151 |	Under the same settings menu
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,032	| IOT151 |	But instead of going to each and
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,104	| IOT151 |	Official twice she keep scrolling and scrolling until you get to
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,152	| IOT151 |	There's a section that says in a household
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,432	| IOT151 |	With these people
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:21,504	| IOT151 |	I believe you have to set up your household
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:25,088	| IOT151 |	From the Amazon account itself on the web
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,624	| IOT151 |	You can't do it for
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,136	| IOT151 |	Fitness app
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| IOT151 |	So that is
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:32,256	| IOT151 |	That is how I've done it I don't see a way to do it otherwise
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:35,328	| IOT151 |	I may be wrong but it makes sense actually the
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:36,864	| IOT151 |	Tear
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,680	| IOT151 |	And I believe it has to be mutual
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:41,728	| IOT151 |	Excommunication but
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,008	| IOT151 |	About setting up
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,080	| IOT151 |	The benefit is you can share your Kindle books
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,152	| IOT151 |	Guess that's
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:53,248	| IOT151 |	That is our answer for you
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,296	| IOT151 |	If any of you have questions
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:57,344	| IOT151 |	Give us a call at 5 1/2
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,368	| IOT151 |	6 to 3
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,648	| IOT151 |	742 4
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,184	| IOT151 |	And now
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,976	| IOT151 |	I believe it is time for us to
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:07,584	| IOT151 |	Say goodbye to each other Kevin and move along to our guests this week
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:11,424	| IOT151 |	Who is Alexandra spiritos the CEO of resin IO
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,704	| IOT151 |	It sounds esoteric
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:15,264	| IOT151 |	It's he doesn't his company does containers at the edge
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,288	| IOT151 |	Basically
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:19,104	| IOT151 |	The whole conversation is about what people are using
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,176	| IOT151 |	To build their iot devices on
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,736	| IOT151 |	And what it takes to actually create
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,296	| IOT151 |	Something that's resilient enough for the Internet of Things
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,344	| IOT151 |	Musical guest so stay tuned
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:39,328	| IOT151 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:42,144	| IOT151 |	This is your house Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:45,728	| IOT151 |	Is Alex burritos who is the CEO of
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,752	| IOT151 |	Resin IO
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:56,224	| IOT151 |	I am super excited because
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:00,832	| IOT151 |	Is super pumped because we're going to be talking about development platforms
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:03,648	| IOT151 |	Industrial Enterprise
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:06,208	| IOT151 |	And there's a whole lot of stuff change
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,488	| IOT151 |	Like a whole lot of stuff on the market now
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,816	| IOT151 |	Before we get into that
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:15,680	| IOT151 |	We want to let people know who you are so why don't you tell us a little bit about resume
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:16,704	| IOT151 |	And
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:17,984	| IOT151 |	What you're doing there
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,544	| IOT151 |	Tono Rosario is a
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,848	| IOT151 |	Containerized payloads
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,640	| IOT151 |	Two embedded devices attached devices
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,712	| IOT151 |	So we built all of it to again
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:30,016	| IOT151 |	You need to really get
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:31,552	| IOT151 |	Golang for structure of the way
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,112	| IOT151 |	And just deploy code to your devices wherever they aren't
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:37,696	| IOT151 |	The big idea here is containers at the edge
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,768	| IOT151 |	And we should probably explain a little bit about
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,048	| IOT151 |	Why that matters so much
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:43,584	| IOT151 |	Coyote
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,352	| IOT151 |	Oh absolutely
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| IOT151 |	We were
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,168	| IOT151 |	Developers at work
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:49,472	| IOT151 |	Focus on cloud Technologies
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:51,264	| IOT151 |	We kind of had landed on this project
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:55,872	| IOT151 |	What we call today as confused and this was a biggest problem with sound
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,408	| IOT151 |	Updating this device is managed
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,480	| IOT151 |	Incredibly difficult
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,784	| IOT151 |	While in the cloud we had this
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,296	| IOT151 |	Credibly
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,832	| IOT151 |	Great experience
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:07,136	| IOT151 |	Wish you no single command so if they ever
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,160	| IOT151 |	Everything at the same time
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,208	| IOT151 |	The devices we actually we're back
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:12,768	| IOT151 |	The eighties we were literally going around
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,536	| IOT151 |	USB sticks
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:16,864	| IOT151 |	Egg containers
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,400	| IOT151 |	We found essentially the loop
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:19,680	| IOT151 |	Well that allows us to
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:22,752	| IOT151 |	Through that half all of us
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,032	| IOT151 |	Toddler clothes that we know and love
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:25,568	| IOT151 |	Tootie's devices
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,616	| IOT151 |	So which containers we can update the device
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:29,152	| IOT151 |	Without rebooting them if something goes
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:29,920	| IOT151 |	What's wrong
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,456	| IOT151 |	You can put update them again
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:33,760	| IOT151 |	There's a host operating system underneath
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,576	| IOT151 |	If anything goes wrong
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,600	| IOT151 |	And that level of
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:39,392	| IOT151 |	Virtualization react
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,184	| IOT151 |	It's for my personalization that we
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,208	| IOT151 |	We're never able to have
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,000	| IOT151 |	Previously on his devices
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:45,536	| IOT151 |	It really
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,560	| IOT151 |	Changes development
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,840	| IOT151 |	Entirely
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,632	| IOT151 |	Feel while not identical
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:52,192	| IOT151 |	To Cloud developments that's feel a lot more like it
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:55,008	| IOT151 |	Flexibility a little bit of
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:56,544	| IOT151 |	Comfort
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,384	| IOT151 |	I want to say certainty because nothing really
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,920	| IOT151 |	Miss World
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,272	| IOT151 |	Who are they
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:08,320	| IOT151 |	Who are our customers with
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:10,368	| IOT151 |	Colton Fleet owners they are people
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,392	| IOT151 |	We're like
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,184	| IOT151 |	Used to be house
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,464	| IOT151 |	$100,000
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,048	| IOT151 |	They need to manage and they are
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,072	| IOT151 |	Geographically
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:25,728	| IOT151 |	So they have this problem on their hands and honestly they don't want to focus on if they have other things they need to
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:29,056	| IOT151 |	Development of the machine learning or the digital signage or
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,872	| IOT151 |	Tidal turbines or whatever it is that
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,896	| IOT151 |	Pair device
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:33,920	| IOT151 |	To do that software
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:34,688	| IOT151 |	Not
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,480	| IOT151 |	Focus on how do I get my
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:39,040	| IOT151 |	Container from A to B how do I make sure I keep running
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:44,160	| IOT151 |	So when you guys started out one of the cool things that you did was reported a doctor
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,696	| IOT151 |	Container to arm basilica
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,232	| IOT151 |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:49,024	| IOT151 |	Is determined
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,560	| IOT151 |	What does audience mean
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,864	| IOT151 |	We were very privileged
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:53,632	| IOT151 |	Because we
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:54,656	| IOT151 |	Really we're building for RC
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:59,008	| IOT151 |	So our initial Vision was actually we need to build Heroku variety
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,288	| IOT151 |	We need this one command
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:00,800	| IOT151 |	That you
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,360	| IOT151 |	So baidu
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,920	| IOT151 |	Pulling on that thread will realize the Roku was using
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,456	| IOT151 |	Innerstand docker
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:09,248	| IOT151 |	Was very early days anyway
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,528	| IOT151 |	0.40
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,552	| IOT151 |	6 I mean
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:12,576	| IOT151 |	2013
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,600	| IOT151 |	So we found that
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:17,184	| IOT151 |	When you that this was going to be big but it wasn't
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:17,952	| IOT151 |	Support arm
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,720	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,744	| IOT151 |	We essentially
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:22,560	| IOT151 |	Are we going to do our own thing or are we going to try to make
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,376	| IOT151 |	We decided we were a small teams in
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:26,912	| IOT151 |	Want to really reinvent the wheel
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:28,960	| IOT151 |	So
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,240	| IOT151 |	We decided to just
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,520	| IOT151 |	Primate Docker work
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,544	| IOT151 |	That's that's what we do
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,408	| IOT151 |	Time again
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,688	| IOT151 |	And that's really how I
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,200	| IOT151 |	People start noticing
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,480	| IOT151 |	Because of her
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,248	| IOT151 |	Got sort of
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:43,040	| IOT151 |	The first Sterling better container
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,320	| IOT151 |	It's okay if working
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:45,856	| IOT151 |	Of course in the beginning
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:47,136	| IOT151 |	Confused about why would you even
EDL	00:37:47,136	00:37:48,672	| IOT151 |	I want to do this
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:50,464	| IOT151 |	I like now we know why
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,000	| IOT151 |	Cuz now we're all
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,048	| IOT151 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:58,400	| IOT151 |	So right now you're in a unique position to see
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:00,704	| IOT151 |	What people are put in your platform
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:03,776	| IOT151 |	As they try to start building
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:06,592	| IOT151 |	So what kind of development platforms are
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:07,872	| IOT151 |	Using
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:14,016	| IOT151 |	So we would definitely see something that I think a lot of people are seeing but maybe you're not realizing how intense it is
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:16,064	| IOT151 |	Which is at the Raspberry Pi is just in
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| IOT151 |	Incredibly
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:19,648	| IOT151 |	So we will see you at
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:20,928	| IOT151 |	Of course I mean
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,208	| IOT151 |	Basic projects
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,488	| IOT151 |	Makers
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,512	| IOT151 |	Universal students
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:26,560	| IOT151 |	I will also see it in the biggest companies
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,352	| IOT151 |	In the world and prototyping
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,120	| IOT151 |	We will see you then
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:29,888	| IOT151 |	In startups
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:31,424	| IOT151 |	And then we see it in product
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,448	| IOT151 |	Tamuct production
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:35,776	| IOT151 |	Let me see it a lot further along than anybody ever imagine
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,824	| IOT151 |	So that's definitely something that if you
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:41,152	| IOT151 |	UCR for athletes that start with B
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:41,664	| IOT151 |	A very visible
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,200	| IOT151 |	But stand out
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,736	| IOT151 |	There is definitely
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:47,552	| IOT151 |	Another Trend there around the in Tillamook
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,832	| IOT151 |	Which is something that Intel did
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,904	| IOT151 |	Thinking about it exactly this way but this is
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:56,768	| IOT151 |	To the space if you just things that nobody thought cut that way this is used when you want more power
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,304	| IOT151 |	More processing power
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:01,888	| IOT151 |	Look you know what size 5x7
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:02,656	| IOT151 |	Computers
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:09,056	| IOT151 |	Yes in French
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:10,080	| IOT151 |	See
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:13,408	| IOT151 |	Exactly I think it needs a next unit of computing
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,688	| IOT151 |	That is exactly what it mean
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:20,064	| IOT151 |	See another very exciting
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:22,112	| IOT151 |	Picking up which is
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:23,392	| IOT151 |	Around the Nvidia RTX
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,416	| IOT151 |	Pontiacs to family
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,208	| IOT151 |	So you have it
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:30,048	| IOT151 |	Essentially a fairly powerful arm chip but then a very very powerful GPU there
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:31,584	| IOT151 |	Baidu deep learning
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:33,888	| IOT151 |	These ones haven't scheduled yet
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,424	| IOT151 |	So we have a lot of people were
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,192	| IOT151 |	Working on them
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,728	| IOT151 |	First stage of the project but
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:40,032	| IOT151 |	Velocity we see behind that is something
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:40,800	| IOT151 |	That's a mistake
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:43,872	| IOT151 |	We do not see that other device types other than
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:45,664	| IOT151 |	And the on the pie
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,200	| IOT151 |	And so if I tried
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:47,968	| IOT151 |	Divide these
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:49,248	| IOT151 |	If I'm doing a
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:53,856	| IOT151 |	Prototyping early stage
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:56,928	| IOT151 |	Device or is this something that's actually being used
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:57,440	| IOT151 |	Real production
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:01,280	| IOT151 |	Me realize is that
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:03,584	| IOT151 |	People will push prototyping
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:04,608	| IOT151 |	Out into
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,376	| IOT151 |	Production as far as
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:12,032	| IOT151 |	While yes canonical EBC it in prototyping we actually do cereal product build battle
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:13,568	| IOT151 |	Include a Raspberry Pi inside them
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,640	| IOT151 |	Multiple Raspberry Pi's depending on the
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:19,200	| IOT151 |	But we do we kill the people going out with hundreds
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| IOT151 |	Sometimes.
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:21,504	| IOT151 |	Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,016	| IOT151 |	This is
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:24,320	| IOT151 |	Surprising but I never left
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:28,928	| IOT151 |	Are there downsides to that I mean like when I think about Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:31,232	| IOT151 |	It's a basic arm chip I don't think of it as
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,256	| IOT151 |	Particularly Harden
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:34,048	| IOT151 |	For a security perspective
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:38,144	| IOT151 |	Right I mean the issues with the Raspberry Pi really are
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:39,936	| IOT151 |	Three and they're kind of big
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:40,960	| IOT151 |	There is the
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:42,240	| IOT151 |	Working aspect
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:43,264	| IOT151 |	Support 5 gigahertz
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,544	| IOT151 |	He works a lot of busy
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:47,360	| IOT151 |	Is a power aspect
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,640	| IOT151 |	You know you have a USB
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:50,176	| IOT151 |	Mini
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:52,224	| IOT151 |	High voltage
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:54,528	| IOT151 |	And then of course there's a story.
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,576	| IOT151 |	Take whatever you have an SD card and I might get lost
EDL	00:40:57,088	00:40:58,880	| IOT151 |	Corrupted you know all of that stuff
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,160	| IOT151 |	Which all of these
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:02,720	| IOT151 |	Perfect sense what are Raspberry Pi Foundation
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,536	| IOT151 |	They're trying to make an educational classroom
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:07,328	| IOT151 |	Spread the love
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,608	| IOT151 |	Computing we should have succeeded
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,448	| IOT151 |	Exactly
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:15,008	| IOT151 |	On the security front
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:17,568	| IOT151 |	Yes there are three high does not have you know that
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,848	| IOT151 |	TPM Awards
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:19,872	| IOT151 |	Computing
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:21,152	| IOT151 |	Extensions
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:23,712	| IOT151 |	I mean exposing at least to the users
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,480	| IOT151 |	But then again
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,296	| IOT151 |	It's not like
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:29,344	| IOT151 |	Most others in the mud are in The Spinners
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,624	| IOT151 |	Play
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:33,184	| IOT151 |	Appetizers capabilities but there are subtle flaws that make them
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:36,000	| IOT151 |	Usable I think over the next few years will
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:37,280	| IOT151 |	Phoebe thinks I'm out I really
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,328	| IOT151 |	We're really excited for them
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,376	| IOT151 |	But I wouldn't say that they're at the Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:43,424	| IOT151 |	Significantly worse State than
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:44,960	| IOT151 |	Most of the classes
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:48,800	| IOT151 |	So that's the pie so
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:49,568	| IOT151 |	People are using it
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:51,872	| IOT151 |	Little walkie
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,663	| IOT151 |	With the the Intel Nook
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:55,199	| IOT151 |	Have you seen this
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:59,807	| IOT151 |	News from the early days
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,575	| IOT151 |	People
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,343	| IOT151 |	Really
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:05,439	| IOT151 |	Industrial context you know if your in the universe
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:09,023	| IOT151 |	Press your arm you probably will grab a Raspberry Pi
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:12,351	| IOT151 |	If you're in an industrial setting in
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:15,679	| IOT151 |	I literally call it the Raspberry Pi of the Industrial
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:19,519	| IOT151 |	It's it's very accessible price point which is like
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,799	| IOT151 |	Get it for me
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:22,335	| IOT151 |	$300 or something like that
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:25,919	| IOT151 |	What's the basic models are out
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:27,711	| IOT151 |	Is very accessible for an industrial pump
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:29,503	| IOT151 |	Set reminder
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:32,319	| IOT151 |	The number so they make him available to their engineers
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:32,831	| IOT151 |	Send a lot of
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:34,879	| IOT151 |	Project.
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:36,927	| IOT151 |	Also for
EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,207	| IOT151 |	Digital signage
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:39,487	| IOT151 |	Which needs
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:42,047	| IOT151 |	A lot of GPU power
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:48,191	| IOT151 |	One screen to screen in a 4K Graphics all that stuff also the Nook is very very popular
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:51,519	| IOT151 |	Oh that makes sense that they just in January
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:55,103	| IOT151 |	Said that they were doing a new one with the graphics card
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:57,919	| IOT151 |	It's pretty impressive that can do 4K and
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:43:00,991	| IOT151 |	Some other fun stuff I was wondering why you needed all that
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,575	| IOT151 |	Machine learning but
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:05,087	| IOT151 |	I didn't think about this
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:07,647	| IOT151 |	Weather
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:14,303	| IOT151 |	But a lot of the cases that we see in resin are actually what I kind of
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:19,679	| IOT151 |	Call
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,447	| IOT151 |	Time it's just
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:21,727	| IOT151 |	Already there
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:23,775	| IOT151 |	Digital sign smart meters
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:25,823	| IOT151 |	Industrial Equipment that's been there for decades
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,615	| IOT151 |	And just bring it to the next level
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:28,639	| IOT151 |	In the next level in that
EDL	00:43:30,431	00:43:32,991	| IOT151 |	Internet-connected having containers
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:37,599	| IOT151 |	Operating a lot more like a server in a Datacenter than a old-school embedded my
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,927	| IOT151 |	Efficient
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,951	| IOT151 |	I remember
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:44,767	| IOT151 |	How many people it took to manage
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,607	| IOT151 |	1 to a hundred used to be amazing
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,167	| IOT151 |	Lord only knows what Google
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:52,703	| IOT151 |	It's probably pretty
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:58,591	| IOT151 |	Exactly minutes that. Same curve is playing out at
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:03,967	| IOT151 |	Yes we must come at the edge
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,271	| IOT151 |	DS
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,063	| IOT151 |	Exactly it is either or you to
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:09,343	| IOT151 |	Guitarist Ora
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:12,671	| IOT151 |	Let's go to India
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:15,999	| IOT151 |	And machine learning because this is
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:19,327	| IOT151 |	This feels very much like the future so I really want to dig into
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:22,911	| IOT151 |	What types of applications are they doing that with who's doing it
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:23,935	| IOT151 |	What can you do
EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,727	| IOT151 |	Coming back to you.
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,775	| IOT151 |	German what it means
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:29,055	| IOT151 |	A lot of people
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,847	| IOT151 |	Essentially started
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:31,615	| IOT151 |	Because they wanted to
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:34,175	| IOT151 |	To filter data between
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:35,455	| IOT151 |	Small and cheap devices that work
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:37,247	| IOT151 |	May be dispersed
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:40,575	| IOT151 |	Around the factory or something like that and Cloud so they
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,599	| IOT151 |	I couldn't eat it all.
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:44,671	| IOT151 |	Too much they would put these the gateways in
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,743	| IOT151 |	So where's the Nvidia boards come in and really make
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:48,511	| IOT151 |	Another
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,279	| IOT151 |	Is
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:50,303	| IOT151 |	When you can do learning
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:54,143	| IOT151 |	Or at least deploy machine learning model that you have pretrained somewhere else
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:57,215	| IOT151 |	Because you can actually intelligently choose what the
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:45:00,287	| IOT151 |	The cloud needs to know you know what is interesting out of all of these
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:01,823	| IOT151 |	Closest Mission I got
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:04,383	| IOT151 |	You can compress if you can filter it without a technology
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:06,431	| IOT151 |	But I using Universe kind of
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:07,455	| IOT151 |	Rotational power
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:10,527	| IOT151 |	You can actually start doing applying models to it and doing a lot more
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:14,111	| IOT151 |	Before it ever reaches the cloud and sometimes
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,903	| IOT151 |	You can't even make decisions on
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:18,463	| IOT151 |	If something is looking really strange
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,487	| IOT151 |	You don't have time
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:24,095	| IOT151 |	From the clouds you can make a decision yourself
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,119	| IOT151 |	Anzac
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:25,887	| IOT151 |	Yusuke's
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:28,191	| IOT151 |	Is actually one where we live the tx2
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,751	| IOT151 |	Tupac running boards really well
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:34,591	| IOT151 |	Is for driving in a smart cars and all that stuff
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:36,383	| IOT151 |	You caught really think about it
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,407	| IOT151 |	Very intuitive
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:37,919	| IOT151 |	Call Kuwait
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:39,967	| IOT151 |	To decide what you going to do
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:42,271	| IOT151 |	With your car until there to the cloud
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:45,343	| IOT151 |	You have to make a decision on the spot with
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:47,391	| IOT151 |	Serious intelligence if you have was in the car
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:48,927	| IOT151 |	That is true
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:49,695	| IOT151 |	And that
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:50,719	| IOT151 |	Latency
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| IOT151 |	Everything would be terrified
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:52,767	| IOT151 |	Tariff
EDL	00:45:54,047	00:45:58,143	| IOT151 |	Exactly medicine going into tunnel vision connectivity and then
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,447	| IOT151 |	Where is Ski Apache
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,471	| IOT151 |	To travel really slowly.
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:13,247	| IOT151 |	Like you could only go to take you places
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:13,759	| IOT151 |	At 20 miles an hour
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:18,879	| IOT151 |	Exactly once people start deployment
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:23,231	| IOT151 |	What are some of the pitfalls the things that they're trying to do
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:24,511	| IOT151 |	Walden University
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:25,279	| IOT151 |	Sweet sweat
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:29,119	| IOT151 |	You're going to have her Roku for the edge what are the things you're going to first try to do
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:33,215	| IOT151 |	The first thing you do no problem you haven't actually won one of the place
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:38,591	| IOT151 |	I'm so happy I found you guys because I was really not sure how it go
EDL	00:46:38,591	00:46:39,871	| IOT151 |	Going to do this is in the fact
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:41,919	| IOT151 |	Even for you get out there how do I
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:42,943	| IOT151 |	Classes device
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:44,479	| IOT151 |	Each one is unique
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,247	| IOT151 |	Which one is
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:48,831	| IOT151 |	Tagged in a way that when it starts up in my customers
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:49,855	| IOT151 |	Factory
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:53,951	| IOT151 |	Or wherever it is intended to go buy it actually checks back in its
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,231	| IOT151 |	Authenticated I don't have to do
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,023	| IOT151 |	Maneuver
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:57,535	| IOT151 |	What's my customer
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,607	| IOT151 |	Show all of that died of the
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,119	| IOT151 |	Work clothes
EDL	00:47:01,631	00:47:03,935	| IOT151 |	Can get really complicated if you haven't really built it.
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,495	| IOT151 |	Timer
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:12,895	| IOT151 |	And then in production it's really a lot of the same things you kind of want to do with server spread you want to
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:14,943	| IOT151 |	Unless you want to bring them up in an orderly fashion
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:17,759	| IOT151 |	You want to make sure that is
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,783	| IOT151 |	Something
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:21,087	| IOT151 |	Goes wrong either in your code or maybe so
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:24,159	| IOT151 |	New Linux kernel exploit gets published
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:26,207	| IOT151 |	You need to update yesterday
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:29,023	| IOT151 |	Do that really well
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:30,559	| IOT151 |	Having button down
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,583	| IOT151 |	The next thing you wanted
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:33,631	| IOT151 |	Application performance
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:36,703	| IOT151 |	Is anything unexpected happening and that's where you want to see
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:39,007	| IOT151 |	The logs and as you figure things out
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:41,567	| IOT151 |	You learn things you don't no plan survives contact
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:42,847	| IOT151 |	Also
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:47,967	| IOT151 |	Software and devices to ask you learned you want to keep
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:49,759	| IOT151 |	Evolving that software
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,807	| IOT151 |	Update my devices
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,831	| IOT151 |	Something that is
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:53,855	| IOT151 |	Is one of the core
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| IOT151 |	How to use S4
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,695	| IOT151 |	Okay how is it not
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:48:00,255	| IOT151 |	Like servers what is unique about industrial Eren
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:01,023	| IOT151 |	Enterprise on fire
EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:05,119	| IOT151 |	Commence this is actually one of the questions we get a lot and then one of them
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:07,679	| IOT151 |	Because I really don't
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:08,959	| IOT151 |	You can't really just
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:09,983	| IOT151 |	Hate technology
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,263	| IOT151 |	Transplant
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:13,823	| IOT151 |	Resync it for the edge
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,591	| IOT151 |	Think about it
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,871	| IOT151 |	It's like you're taking
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:21,247	| IOT151 |	Machines that lets say they would be in a Datacenter but you are standing at the center to call cover the whole globe
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:23,295	| IOT151 |	Turn Down The Walls in your sort of
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:24,575	| IOT151 |	Growing at 5000
EDL	00:48:24,575	00:48:26,367	| IOT151 |	All the sudden you have
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:29,695	| IOT151 |	Challenges one is at the machines themselves are not as power
EDL	00:48:29,695	00:48:31,487	| IOT151 |	Muffuletta server
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:33,535	| IOT151 |	Is not as powerful as what runs innovative
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:36,863	| IOT151 |	It's further away
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:41,983	| IOT151 |	How much longer can you could also be you know some kind of dodgy Wi-Fi connection
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,007	| IOT151 |	Which Yukon
EDL	00:48:43,007	00:48:45,055	| IOT151 |	So you have to start thinking
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:47,103	| IOT151 |	For yourself
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:48,127	| IOT151 |	Make sure
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:48,639	| IOT151 |	It can react
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:49,919	| IOT151 |	Do opossums
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:52,223	| IOT151 |	Situation without knowing that I can get back
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:54,271	| IOT151 |	Then the other thing is
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:55,807	| IOT151 |	Climate
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:57,087	| IOT151 |	You don't have guaranteed powers
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:59,135	| IOT151 |	Pull the plug on me all the time
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:00,927	| IOT151 |	Which again are sings that are
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,719	| IOT151 |	Unheard of
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:06,047	| IOT151 |	So there's only sort of environmental situation
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:09,887	| IOT151 |	You need to think about it differently and then the other part is more so
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:11,167	| IOT151 |	Philosophical
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:13,215	| IOT151 |	Heard before of the cattle versus
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:15,519	| IOT151 |	Analogy where you know
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:18,079	| IOT151 |	We used to have our servers like they were pets
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:20,895	| IOT151 |	And then with mutual's now like kubernetes
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:23,711	| IOT151 |	See the message
EDL	00:49:23,711	00:49:25,503	| IOT151 |	Undifferentiated CEO
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,271	| IOT151 |	Purchasing power
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:29,599	| IOT151 |	And if one goes down it doesn't matter we can bring up another one
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:31,647	| IOT151 |	Etymology doesn't actually
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:34,207	| IOT151 |	Work for the edge right when I have a Smart Lock
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:34,719	| IOT151 |	My house
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:35,999	| IOT151 |	I don't want
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:38,303	| IOT151 |	The container that's on it to have less
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:41,119	| IOT151 |	And it's gone somewhere else because the somewhere else
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:42,399	| IOT151 |	Free actually want
