EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:09,536	| IOT88 |	Okay Kevin
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,584	| IOT88 |	Stacy
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:14,656	| IOT88 |	Start off with in the certification front
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,704	| IOT88 |	Bluetooth 5 is out
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,496	| IOT88 |	What aspect this is
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,800	| IOT88 |	So Bluetooth is the
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,824	| IOT88 |	For those of you guys who
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,896	| IOT88 |	I don't know don't know it it is in your phone
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,944	| IOT88 |	It is in like
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:29,760	| IOT88 |	Your wearables in speakers it's basically
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,552	| IOT88 |	Really low data rate
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,904	| IOT88 |	And a really short distance Wireless
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,696	| IOT88 |	So things don't go very far
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,488	| IOT88 |	I don't really go super fast
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,000	| IOT88 |	But
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| IOT88 |	That's changes
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,864	| IOT88 |	So Bluetooth 5 this spec
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,376	| IOT88 |	Has
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:50,496	| IOT88 |	Lots of new things the biggest things it's going to have that you guys are going to notice
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,776	| IOT88 |	Is it's going to be
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,824	| IOT88 |	Longer-range
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:58,432	| IOT88 |	Right now Bluetooth says that it's devices can go out to
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:01,760	| IOT88 |	The current Bluetooth stack goes out to about a hundred meters
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:04,320	| IOT88 |	I personally find it actually goes to about 20
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,344	| IOT88 |	If that
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,696	| IOT88 |	Yeah it depends on so many different things
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:13,280	| IOT88 |	Basically Engineers are going to have the choice of
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,816	| IOT88 |	Increasing the range
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,352	| IOT88 |	At
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,120	| IOT88 |	The risk of
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,400	| IOT88 |	Decreasing throughput
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,448	| IOT88 |	So basically the farther out it is
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,472	| IOT88 |	The slower the data
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:22,752	| IOT88 |	Which is an
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,544	| IOT88 |	Terrible because
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,128	| IOT88 |	You don't you might not be able to do audio but you could do notify
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:28,640	| IOT88 |	Applications
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:34,784	| IOT88 |	It's actually I think perfect for synchronizing wearables and
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,344	| IOT88 |	Getting iot notifications as you said
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,648	| IOT88 |	Because of short bursts of information they're they're not
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,184	| IOT88 |	Filled with data
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,696	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,744	| IOT88 |	You don't need a lot of
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,024	| IOT88 |	Truth what you just need
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,072	| IOT88 |	And then you
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,400	| IOT88 |	I love it because I have a Bluetooth ring
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,960	| IOT88 |	Talk to my phone
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:56,544	| IOT88 |	And it's great except for if my phone's a little too far away it no longer work
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:00,128	| IOT88 |	Works also good for light bulbs bluetooth light bulbs right now
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,896	| IOT88 |	If you're in your house
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:05,760	| IOT88 |	You know you could too far from your light bulb you can actually turn it off for the phone and then you're like
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,272	| IOT88 |	This was dumb
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,344	| IOT88 |	Borax
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,624	| IOT88 |	The range
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,904	| IOT88 |	Yay
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:16,256	| IOT88 |	The other thing that we should be excited about is there's going to be a little speed boost
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:22,655	| IOT88 |	And this will be great for things like when your syncing data or doing updates to like a wearable from your phone it'll just be a little bit
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,423	| IOT88 |	Pastor
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:26,495	| IOT88 |	You don't have to sit there looking to screen going sinking device
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,311	| IOT88 |	Loading
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:29,823	| IOT88 |	Bloating
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,943	| IOT88 |	Those things are great to know the other thing that is
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,015	| IOT88 |	Advertising rates and I kind of wish they didn't
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:41,855	| IOT88 |	Call it this but basically with Bluetooth beacons what happens is
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,879	| IOT88 |	They call it advertising
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:45,439	| IOT88 |	Pekin will send out a signal to your phone
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,487	| IOT88 |	And the phone then says
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,815	| IOT88 |	Here's a URL in the case of like Google ID Stone
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| IOT88 |	Once every object have
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| IOT88 |	URL
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:57,983	| IOT88 |	Or if you're in a store at might be like 50% off shoes cuz I'm standing near the shoes
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:04,383	| IOT88 |	What's going to happen here is there increasing the amount of data that can be sent by 8
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,407	| IOT88 |	Time switches
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,431	| IOT88 |	Much
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,223	| IOT88 |	Richer so instead of just being like
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,015	| IOT88 |	You're Something
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| IOT88 |	Now to be like
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,343	| IOT88 |	You're Something here's a picture that something
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,879	| IOT88 |	There's a lot of data about that something
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,719	| IOT88 |	The way they're calling it advertising
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:24,607	| IOT88 |	Yeah but I I sort of understand why because there's been broadcasting
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:27,167	| IOT88 |	It's an ad obviously many can be used for ads but
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,983	| IOT88 |	They're their advertising that something is available
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| IOT88 |	Write what we matter what is
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,567	| IOT88 |	Data picture a URL
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,639	| IOT88 |	So I sort of get that I just wish they'd called
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,663	| IOT88 |	Broadcasting
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| IOT88 |	Then maybe people
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,503	| IOT88 |	Still probably not enough
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:47,391	| IOT88 |	Right right right right that's that's going to be really interesting because I think it'll
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,951	| IOT88 |	I really think there's a lot of potential
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,999	| IOT88 |	With broadcasting via Bluetooth
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| IOT88 |	Especially if it's not just
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:06:01,727	| IOT88 |	Things broadcasting at your phone but your phone broadcasting out because think of all the preference data you could keep on your phone
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,799	| IOT88 |	You know you could have learned a restaurant to say
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| IOT88 |	Hey I have an allergy
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:09,663	| IOT88 |	Like when you get in there at your table they could be like table 10 has
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,223	| IOT88 |	Nut allergy
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,527	| IOT88 |	Which is really actually kind of
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,807	| IOT88 |	Cool and interesting
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,319	| IOT88 |	We're not there yet
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,367	| IOT88 |	And actually
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:24,767	| IOT88 |	And say this is not there yet it is this is aspect onata not a natural product so people are going to see the speck
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:26,815	| IOT88 |	Introduced in Bluetooth products
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:29,887	| IOT88 |	They say within two to six months is the expectation so
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:33,727	| IOT88 |	Don't expect all these changes in your next Bluetooth device if you go out tomorrow night 1
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,519	| IOT88 |	If you go out
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,543	| IOT88 |	Next year in by when
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| IOT88 |	And some of them
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:42,687	| IOT88 |	A lot of the speed and throughput and range things are chip
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:47,551	| IOT88 |	Related so a lot of things go has been floating around for a while
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,855	| IOT88 |	So some of the chip makers have
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,879	| IOT88 |	Already built
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,647	| IOT88 |	Products
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,159	| IOT88 |	Should be
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,719	| IOT88 |	Yeah I was actually just going to
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,255	| IOT88 |	Say this may not
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:59,071	| IOT88 |	I mean you need to buy a new device if you
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,631	| IOT88 |	If you want to take advantage Bluetooth but
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:04,447	| IOT88 |	You're you're going to hang that depends on the bed
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,215	| IOT88 |	Do not disturb
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,775	| IOT88 |	Alright so album
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,823	| IOT88 |	Actually I am going to assume
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:16,735	| IOT88 |	I assume that there will be demonstrations of this technology at CES
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| IOT88 |	There are going to have
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,319	| IOT88 |	Apple Bluetooth
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,367	| IOT88 |	Whole Foods with Arena
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,135	| IOT88 |	As they often do
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:26,207	| IOT88 |	Experience the Bluetooth experience
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,255	| IOT88 |	The final thing that they are
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,071	| IOT88 |	Doing with Bluetooth which is worth noting
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:34,399	| IOT88 |	For all of you guys who are frustrated with the pairing experience
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| IOT88 |	They are
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,519	| IOT88 |	Rapping over 400 known
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,823	| IOT88 |	Issues with Bluetooth into the spec
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:44,383	| IOT88 |	And people now have the option to
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| IOT88 |	Fix them
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:48,991	| IOT88 |	So if you've had a device that just doesn't seem to work
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| IOT88 |	Distracted
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,855	| IOT88 |	And they've wrap that in here so you can hopefully
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,159	| IOT88 |	Not have that experience
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:00,255	| IOT88 |	Going for it so it's also
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| IOT88 |	I've done some Spectrum
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:05,119	| IOT88 |	Management kind of techniques in here so basically
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:07,935	| IOT88 |	Your Bluetooth won't interfere with your LTE
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:10,239	| IOT88 |	Things are going to be a little bit more efficient
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:10,751	| IOT88 |	In
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,031	| IOT88 |	Terms of
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,311	| IOT88 |	Set the channels they're using for sin
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,407	| IOT88 |	These are really highly technical things in
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:20,991	| IOT88 |	The idea behind it is basically that when you pair your going to be able to pair
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,807	| IOT88 |	Any Bluetooth device to any Bluetooth device
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:26,623	| IOT88 |	And it's not going to interfere with other wireless devices
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:34,047	| IOT88 |	Kind of the way it should be. You shouldn't have to
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,095	| IOT88 |	You got to adjust
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:36,607	| IOT88 |	Totally agree
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,679	| IOT88 |	Big big
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,959	| IOT88 |	News
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,263	| IOT88 |	From Google what hole
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,823	| IOT88 |	What's the new Google home
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,151	| IOT88 |	Connected speaker digital assistant
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,687	| IOT88 |	Is finally at
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,735	| IOT88 |	Home features
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| IOT88 |	Or a
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,319	| IOT88 |	I don't know what to call it it's not a skill
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,647	| IOT88 |	It's a waiver developers disconnect
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:04,767	| IOT88 |	Products to Google home so now you should be able to control a wide variety
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,535	| IOT88 |	BF things
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| IOT88 |	Through Google home
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,631	| IOT88 |	It's a developer program
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,167	| IOT88 |	Google home
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,983	| IOT88 |	Details are scant as we're recording this
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,519	| IOT88 |	But it is
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,823	| IOT88 |	Going to be one of the big missing pieces
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:20,127	| IOT88 |	That Google home had compared to the
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| IOT88 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,991	| IOT88 |	There are lots of companies that are coming out with
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,015	| IOT88 |	Chatbots
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,831	| IOT88 |	Waste Control devices and so this should be
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,111	| IOT88 |	Actually pretty cool
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,391	| IOT88 |	I can't wait
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:38,303	| IOT88 |	Yeah this is good news to me because it's one of the reasons I didn't buy a Google home and back I just bought 1/4
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,583	| IOT88 |	Echo yesterday or
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:42,655	| IOT88 |	Just received it yesterday because of all the
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,983	| IOT88 |	Things that work with it all the services that you can use with it
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:49,567	| IOT88 |	I can't do that with a home so I've kind of held off
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| IOT88 |	You might be purchasing a
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:57,759	| IOT88 |	I just might as I I didn't even this last week in my newsletter
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,271	| IOT88 |	Which guys
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,551	| IOT88 |	Stacey on iot
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:00,831	| IOT88 |	DACA
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,111	| IOT88 |	You should sign up for
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,951	| IOT88 |	I talked about the challenges of the voice ecosystem
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,231	| IOT88 |	Because right now we are
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,535	| IOT88 |	Is there something in this place where I'd like
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,351	| IOT88 |	Oh do I ask she who shall not be named
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| IOT88 |	Or should I ask
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:19,519	| IOT88 |	It's funny you say that because I've seen a couple videos putting around with people have
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,615	| IOT88 |	A Google home talking to an echo talking
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,407	| IOT88 |	Go to Siri in like a loop
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| IOT88 |	The talking to each other
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,735	| IOT88 |	Eric white circles are awesome
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,271	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| IOT88 |	I have not said anything up like that beat
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| IOT88 |	Because I
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,855	| IOT88 |	Don't want to annoy me
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,647	| IOT88 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,671	| IOT88 |	Crazy
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| IOT88 |	But
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| IOT88 |	I will say that it is
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,767	| IOT88 |	My poor daughter is like
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:46,143	| IOT88 |	Okay see you should not be named play this or do this and I'm like no.
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,655	| IOT88 |	You got a school
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| IOT88 |	And she's like
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:54,335	| IOT88 |	Samurai
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:59,711	| IOT88 |	Also I spent this week testing
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:05,343	| IOT88 |	Various light bulbs with both the home and the echo through different platform
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,135	| IOT88 |	Because I'm Batman
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,671	| IOT88 |	That's what I do in my spare time you guys
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,047	| IOT88 |	A lot of people told me they felt the Google home with Snappy
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| IOT88 |	In
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,375	| IOT88 |	I actually did not
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| IOT88 |	Have that Xperia
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,959	| IOT88 |	Actually was about the same
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| IOT88 |	When chewing
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,007	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,823	| IOT88 |	Philips Hue on both is integrated
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,335	| IOT88 |	Directly to both
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,151	| IOT88 |	In Philips Hue same
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,919	| IOT88 |	Exact
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,431	| IOT88 |	Response time
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| IOT88 |	As I would Excel
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,343	| IOT88 |	What is cool with Google home is you can say
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,903	| IOT88 |	Hey hey G
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,695	| IOT88 |	Turn my living room lights pink
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| IOT88 |	And that works
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,511	| IOT88 |	In your living room lights turn
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:48,863	| IOT88 |	What I did notice though is it doesn't recognize
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:49,375	| IOT88 |	The scene
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,959	| IOT88 |	So any of the scenes you say to
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,727	| IOT88 |	Google home
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,239	| IOT88 |	Didn't work
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:55,775	| IOT88 |	Now
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| IOT88 |	The echo
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,359	| IOT88 |	Does not do colors
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,151	| IOT88 |	But it does do
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,663	| IOT88 |	See
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,711	| IOT88 |	I know
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:08,063	| IOT88 |	Okay so she won't seem to need to talk to this device
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| IOT88 |	Message McCullers you talk to that device
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:12,671	| IOT88 |	This is what a wonderful future we live in
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,719	| IOT88 |	So there's
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,231	| IOT88 |	That
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,791	| IOT88 |	So that was the Philips Hue experience humble
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,095	| IOT88 |	Then I connected SmartThings
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,631	| IOT88 |	With a couple light bulbs
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,399	| IOT88 |	To the echo
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,703	| IOT88 |	Because not everybody wants
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| IOT88 |	Wichita
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,031	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,615	| IOT88 |	3 smart things you can control osram lightify you control
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| IOT88 |	Cree
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,943	| IOT88 |	And you can control lifx lights
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:38,015	| IOT88 |	And all of those actually worked really well in
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,039	| IOT88 |	Very quickly
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,831	| IOT88 |	Through Google home
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,135	| IOT88 |	Which is again a native support thing it's not
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:49,279	| IOT88 |	It's not like using if this then that or something else that would add attention rain
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:52,351	| IOT88 |	So you're doing Google SmartThings
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:53,887	| IOT88 |	Issue
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,423	| IOT88 |	Right
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,959	| IOT88 |	So that was kind of fun
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,775	| IOT88 |	You can also control SmartThings through the echo
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:01,823	| IOT88 |	Also
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:08,223	| IOT88 |	Google Assistant has supposedly done something with if this then that so it's a lot
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,991	| IOT88 |	Faster
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,551	| IOT88 |	I have yet to encounter that with
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,623	| IOT88 |	And that could be wink
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,647	| IOT88 |	We could be at going through
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| IOT88 |	I'm not real sure
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| IOT88 |	Cuz when I did the wink
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,255	| IOT88 |	Moonshine
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:20,767	| IOT88 |	Ifft
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:26,143	| IOT88 |	Too many moving parts
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,679	| IOT88 |	A protein which is fine
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,471	| IOT88 |	I totally expected you know
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,495	| IOT88 |	That's that's a lot of
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:36,639	| IOT88 |	That was kind of delighting experience of all of
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,687	| IOT88 |	I really liked
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:44,831	| IOT88 |	Color-changing thing on the Google home with the Hues that was kind of fun and nice
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:46,879	| IOT88 |	Pretty sure
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:52,767	| IOT88 |	There has to be weighed maybe if I named the rooms in Google after something like dinner party I
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| IOT88 |	I could set some more
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,327	| IOT88 |	Definitive settings
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:56,607	| IOT88 |	Objects.
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:01,727	| IOT88 |	Cuz it would be nice to say you know like at cuz I have an echo thing
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,007	| IOT88 |	Dinner party
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,799	| IOT88 |	And that's already set but that's through.
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,663	| IOT88 |	I guess I could do it through SmartThings scenes through smart
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,271	| IOT88 |	The good old days of a physical switch and wire
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,295	| IOT88 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:20,671	| IOT88 |	Movie Ride Along that was that was that experience for those of you guys who are
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,695	| IOT88 |	Looking at that
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:30,399	| IOT88 |	Well actually it is very telling though it tells you that we can talk about all the stuff
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,167	| IOT88 |	For several years but
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:34,751	| IOT88 |	It's still maturing it's still not where it needs to be
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:38,591	| IOT88 |	Lots of services Latta devices lots of interfaces
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,639	| IOT88 |	Yasso
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,711	| IOT88 |	That is actually killing all right
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,015	| IOT88 |	Personal assistant in the home front
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,319	| IOT88 |	Wired had a wonderful article
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,367	| IOT88 |	These guys recording app
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,391	| IOT88 |	Can you say
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:58,815	| IOT88 |	You're freaked out about that probably shouldn't buy one but if you're freaked out about it and you want to delete your stuff the article which I weigh
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,327	| IOT88 |	Building 2
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,375	| IOT88 |	Offers you lovely tips
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,655	| IOT88 |	Which is nice
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,679	| IOT88 |	Indonesia
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,495	| IOT88 |	The ability to delete your
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,079	| IOT88 |	Voice recordings has been available on a lot of these services
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,639	| IOT88 |	Beginning for privacy reasons
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| IOT88 |	I want people to be secure
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:18,527	| IOT88 |	It's kind of funny to me you buy these devices that are always listening
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,807	| IOT88 |	Or you wouldn't buy them
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,575	| IOT88 |	Obviously
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:25,951	| IOT88 |	And then you go and delete your recording history but you know what you just going to fill it up again

EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:26,879	| IOT88 |	Dismay infection of Google homes personalization features because it essentially wipes its
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:32,255	| IOT88 |	And that's right that's why you want to leave this on because it gets better

EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,703	| IOT88 |	It's adoption
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:44,543	| IOT88 |	Before the echo you have to visit amazon.com
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,567	| IOT88 |	Slash

EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,607	| IOT88 |	But it's possible
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,119	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,655	| IOT88 |	There you go
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,703	| IOT88 |	One more little thing I just want to mention it be
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,359	| IOT88 |	Okay I'm not
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,151	| IOT88 |	Weird she who shall not be named
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:23,967	| IOT88 |	The Voice service
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,527	| IOT88 |	Will show you a picture
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,319	| IOT88 |	It's like a
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:28,831	| IOT88 |	What did you say
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,111	| IOT88 |	Credit score
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:33,695	| IOT88 |	It's like a quidditch goal it's a round light
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,487	| IOT88 |	Yes around lights
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,023	| IOT88 |	That stands on its side
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,583	| IOT88 |	Ion little bass and it has
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,631	| IOT88 |	People Services of
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,423	| IOT88 |	Her built-in
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:50,079	| IOT88 |	It just looks weird to me the price they sale will be lower in cost than
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,359	| IOT88 |	Traditional Echo
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,151	| IOT88 |	Which is $180
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:59,295	| IOT88 |	You know sitting on someone's bedside table and if this has the function of like the GE
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,831	| IOT88 |	Lights
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,343	| IOT88 |	You know our
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,183	| IOT88 |	That work with circadian rhythms maybe this is
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,999	| IOT88 |	Kissing a baby
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,023	| IOT88 |	And we love it
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,327	| IOT88 |	Samso
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,351	| IOT88 |	No late don't need a light
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,191	| IOT88 |	So this kind of consolidate baidu
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,983	| IOT88 |	And it sits on a WeMo switch and I can
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:21,311	| IOT88 |	Until.the. To shut the light off iPhone is really cool
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,591	| IOT88 |	But it looks
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:26,943	| IOT88 |	But my light looks like a light not a quidditch goal
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,551	| IOT88 |	Okay so we just wanted to mention that
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,063	| IOT88 |	Because
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,343	| IOT88 |	Dang it looks funny
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,647	| IOT88 |	Would be curious about y'all's opinion
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,951	| IOT88 |	All right
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:41,023	| IOT88 |	Big news coming from Amazon
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,327	| IOT88 |	Kevin you want to talk about this
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:50,495	| IOT88 |	Yes this is the reason I am finally going to make a trip out to Seattle I think just to go buy a can of tuna fish
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| IOT88 |	Amazon
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,311	| IOT88 |	Go
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,079	| IOT88 |	The
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,639	| IOT88 |	Prototype store of the future was just
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,687	| IOT88 |	Announce a couple days ago
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,967	| IOT88 |	And it's
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,503	| IOT88 |	It's a very interesting concept
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:06,111	| IOT88 |	It reduces friction for shopping because there is no checkout line
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:08,415	| IOT88 |	There's only a check in line with sounds
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,183	| IOT88 |	Kind of weird
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:14,047	| IOT88 |	But if you think about it you check into the supermarket with Amazon go use your smartphone
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:17,375	| IOT88 |	You then go and grab whatever off the shelves
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,423	| IOT88 |	But you want to buy you just put it in your little
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| IOT88 |	Bag
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,215	| IOT88 |	And you walk out
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,727	| IOT88 |	When you're done
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,775	| IOT88 |	What happens is
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,287	| IOT88 |	Through
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,335	| IOT88 |	They call it a I but
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,127	| IOT88 |	I'm assuming it's a lot of sensors
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,919	| IOT88 |	Cameras and so on
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:32,223	| IOT88 |	Whatever you buy whatever you put in your bag or your
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:32,991	| IOT88 |	Your card
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| IOT88 |	Is automatically
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,319	| IOT88 |	Tallied up in a shopping list and
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:41,183	| IOT88 |	You pay for it through Amazon in the app you could receipt right if you walk out of the store
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,975	| IOT88 |	So there's no checkout at all I just
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,023	| IOT88 |	Magically Hotel mini bar fridge with
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,535	| IOT88 |	The sensors in it
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,071	| IOT88 |	Only
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,351	| IOT88 |	Grocery store
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| IOT88 |	And not everything has liquor in it
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:53,983	| IOT88 |	Astoria
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,775	| IOT88 |	So what yeah I think this is
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,055	| IOT88 |	Awesome
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:00,383	| IOT88 |	I'm very curious like how much it cost per square foot
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| IOT88 |	This is
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,455	| IOT88 |	You don't just
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,247	| IOT88 |	But that time is it
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:09,599	| IOT88 |	It's also going to be raining right now grocery store margins are at 3
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,111	| IOT88 |	3%
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,951	| IOT88 |	So this
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:16,767	| IOT88 |	Eliminate some of the labor cost I think kind of
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,071	| IOT88 |	Illuminates like Checkers and that sort of thing
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,863	| IOT88 |	To a certain extent I'm sure they're still good
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,887	| IOT88 |	Happy helpers
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,911	| IOT88 |	In the story to help
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,423	| IOT88 |	Define things
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:24,959	| IOT88 |	But
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,751	| IOT88 |	It also
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,311	| IOT88 |	Has technical cost that I'm unsure of
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,591	| IOT88 |	Wright's Auto
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| IOT88 |	Who's
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:36,479	| IOT88 |	Affixing night I assume it's RFID labels but who's affixing those whose
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,807	| IOT88 |	Packaging cost how much did those go up
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,367	| IOT88 |	I love the idea I'm very excited as a
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,903	| IOT88 |	Consumer but I'm like Boo
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,439	| IOT88 |	How does the Shifty economics
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:51,839	| IOT88 |	Yeah but you know what it's an Amazon approach they don't worry so much about the
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,375	| IOT88 |	Costs in the margins and all that
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,935	| IOT88 |	You're buying a lot of their products there
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:58,239	| IOT88 |	Other electronics like a Kindle
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:04,127	| IOT88 |	As a Gateway for you to buy more things so you might be getting the devices at cost or less right
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:09,503	| IOT88 |	So it's it's a typical Amazon approach and what I sort of like about it is
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:12,831	| IOT88 |	A they want to own the customer experience which is Central to
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,855	| IOT88 |	Amazon
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,623	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,647	| IOT88 |	Secondly
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,440	| IOT88 |	I think they're tired of waiting
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,208	| IOT88 |	4
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:21,024	| IOT88 |	Beacons and all kinds of other Technologies
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:25,888	| IOT88 |	To be implemented in stores in a mish-mosh way interested to know what we're going to show you how to do it cuz we can
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| IOT88 |	I need it
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:29,216	| IOT88 |	And I can't wait for the day that I go in and bye-bye
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,776	| IOT88 |	My kind of Cherry Garcia
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,336	| IOT88 |	And a bottle of wine when I get home Amazon
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,896	| IOT88 |	You look like you need a rom-com Stacy
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,712	| IOT88 |	How about Sleepless in Seattle
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,040	| IOT88 |	Exercise TV
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,552	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,624	| IOT88 |	Brave New World
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:49,440	| IOT88 |	Alright let's see what else do we have we have
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,464	| IOT88 |	Fitbit
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,536	| IOT88 |	Can we all mourn for a moment
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,328	| IOT88 |	Because market and reports that
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:58,400	| IOT88 |	Well it's part of the deal where Fitbit is buying
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,168	| IOT88 |	Pebble for
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,216	| IOT88 |	Reported 40 million dollars now this is all
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| IOT88 |	Still in the rumored stage
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,288	| IOT88 |	This has not been
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT88 |	Satellite
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,640	| IOT88 |	But the latest news
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:09,920	| IOT88 |	This
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:14,016	| IOT88 |	Piece of news is that backers of the pebble time 2
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,040	| IOT88 |	And the
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,064	| IOT88 |	Core
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,392	| IOT88 |	I'll probably just going to get a refund instead of their device
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:23,488	| IOT88 |	It's sad you know how excited
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| IOT88 |	Core which was
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:27,328	| IOT88 |	It was going to have the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:30,912	| IOT88 |	Services and Spotify
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:34,496	| IOT88 |	So I could just take this tiny little iPod Nano looking device on my
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,032	| IOT88 |	Send off
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,568	| IOT88 |	I remember
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,384	| IOT88 |	I don't think that's happening
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:46,528	| IOT88 |	I was so excited that I think about it everyday while walking
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,040	| IOT88 |	My dog
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:50,368	| IOT88 |	There's another there was another Kickstarter project actually
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:58,816	| IOT88 |	You know it's it is it's really sad in the sense that pebble
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:04,704	| IOT88 |	Not to use this as a pun though about it but I'm going to say it they can be essentially kick-started the wearables market here
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,496	| IOT88 |	Literally and figuratively
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,288	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:13,408	| IOT88 |	They've done some really nice work in the space that got some great products that aren't too expensive
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:18,784	| IOT88 |	And to be honest of the kind of products that aren't overly complicated to the appeal to a mass audience
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,296	| IOT88 |	But
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:24,416	| IOT88 |	I don't know the economics of their particular challenges but apparently they've been
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,720	| IOT88 |	Hurting for money and letting people go and
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,256	| IOT88 |	Fitbit is also another very
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,048	| IOT88 |	Popular and successful
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,584	| IOT88 |	Demon is Faison
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:39,008	| IOT88 |	It's especially sad because Pebble actually had in 2015 and offer for 740
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,520	| IOT88 |	$10
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| IOT88 |	And this was from watchmaker
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,336	| IOT88 |	Citizen
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:43,360	| IOT88 |	Which
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,664	| IOT88 |	And then
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:49,760	| IOT88 |	In until had made a reported offer of 70 million
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:52,064	| IOT88 |	Right before the launch of the pebble 2
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:54,880	| IOT88 |	So that was that was Intel's effort
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:58,208	| IOT88 |	The CEO just was like nope we got it
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:23:59,232	| IOT88 |	And so
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:02,560	| IOT88 |	I guess he does not happen
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,864	| IOT88 |	I would hate to be a CEO
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,192	| IOT88 |	An offer like that I mean you're just like
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,032	| IOT88 |	I mean cuz you don't start a company thinking well
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,592	| IOT88 |	Play some people start companies thinking someone will just buy the
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,640	| IOT88 |	But you start a company because you were right
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,176	| IOT88 |	We all miss you got to have
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:20,736	| IOT88 |	Crazy confidence crazy belief
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,528	| IOT88 |	And then to say
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,320	| IOT88 |	Okay
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| IOT88 |	Ocelot to you
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,416	| IOT88 |	Looking for Dennis Duffy
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,440	| IOT88 |	Dropcam to neston
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:30,976	| IOT88 |	Really regretted
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,512	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,024	| IOT88 |	They're sure
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,840	| IOT88 |	Children and negative stories always ReSound
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:36,352	| IOT88 |	Much more
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,912	| IOT88 |	You waited much more heavily
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,424	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,216	| IOT88 |	Here is that tire
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| IOT88 |	Pebble news
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:43,776	| IOT88 |	So sorry you guys I
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:45,056	| IOT88 |	We can have like a little
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:47,104	| IOT88 |	Lots of people fans out there
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,384	| IOT88 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,552	| IOT88 |	Chew other qwikbetz a news there is a brand new energy monitoring device is not going to be out until 2017 but
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,576	| IOT88 |	What I'm talking about it
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,344	| IOT88 |	Because I
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,672	| IOT88 |	I think it's probably the Least Complicated energy monitoring device out there
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,464	| IOT88 |	Well it's not out there
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,232	| IOT88 |	And that's why I want
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:07,584	| IOT88 |	That's why I won't work because this looks very simple
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,608	| IOT88 |	Works in
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:09,888	| IOT88 |	They bought a company called
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,168	| IOT88 |	Whisker
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,680	| IOT88 |	Laughs
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,960	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,496	| IOT88 |	Through this they're doing
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:19,616	| IOT88 |	It basically looks like a stick on thing that you stick on your circuit box
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:20,128	| IOT88 |	Roxanne
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,176	| IOT88 |	It starts measuring
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,200	| IOT88 |	Electricity
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,736	| IOT88 |	You spy your devices in you
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:28,832	| IOT88 |	The details are little late right now so in the product
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:29,856	| IOT88 |	Actually
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,160	| IOT88 |	Arrives I'll be very curious how they're doing that
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:39,072	| IOT88 |	With just like a box on the circuit breaker
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:39,840	| IOT88 |	Sum of the measure
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,144	| IOT88 |	This actually gets into light
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,168	| IOT88 |	Ocean noises
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,728	| IOT88 |	We'll just call it a fancy out
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,800	| IOT88 |	Has been tested
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,104	| IOT88 |	There's different ways of doing your fancy outdoor
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:53,664	| IOT88 |	Actually talked to hit like Mario
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,176	| IOT88 |	Curb
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,504	| IOT88 |	Those guys felt like how they're doing it
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,064	| IOT88 |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,880	| IOT88 |	Verdigre is another company that does this
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:07,488	| IOT88 |	Did you have something installed in your circuit
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,096	| IOT88 |	Curb yes
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,912	| IOT88 |	Actually one of them to come out
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,264	| IOT88 |	I didn't pay for it
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:21,312	| IOT88 |	So when I test a device
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,104	| IOT88 |	Sugar Act
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,456	| IOT88 |	I think it was $650
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,992	| IOT88 |	Pair device in your
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:30,784	| IOT88 |	Circuit
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,576	| IOT88 |	Foxo1 device measured
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,088	| IOT88 |	1 Circle
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,880	| IOT88 |	Can I have 3
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,392	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,720	| IOT88 |	Yeah that's the stuff I not cheap
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:42,048	| IOT88 |	And I do remember looking at these folks as I install their app
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:47,936	| IOT88 |	Because it works with the green button which is a initiative to get your actual energy data
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,728	| IOT88 |	From your electricity provider and
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:54,080	| IOT88 |	There for you match the two data points and you learn more about your energy usage so
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:57,152	| IOT88 |	Fortune my provider is not supported so I don't use curb
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,992	| IOT88 |	Someday Maybe
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:04,576	| IOT88 |	This week a device called
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,600	| IOT88 |	Plume
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:08,672	| IOT88 |	Launched this is plume WiFi
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,208	| IOT88 |	This is
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:13,792	| IOT88 |	A twist it Twist on the idea of mesh Network
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:17,376	| IOT88 |	Working these are tiny little pods that you stick around your home
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:19,424	| IOT88 |	Traditionally with a router
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,216	| IOT88 |	And things like that you Rose
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:25,568	| IOT88 |	Mesh networks or a traditional router you have kind of a brain
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:28,128	| IOT88 |	In your router that handles the routing tasks
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,920	| IOT88 |	And you have the radios
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:34,784	| IOT88 |	What happens with blue Ms you have the radios but the brain lives in the
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,296	| IOT88 |	Cloud
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,088	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,624	| IOT88 |	Each one of these pods
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:41,440	| IOT88 |	Is plugged into an outlet
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:47,072	| IOT88 |	In your home and you're supposed to have in a three-bedroom home should have six to eight plumes
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:50,144	| IOT88 |	And Kevin you should probably get the pricing while I
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,168	| IOT88 |	If you don't mind
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,752	| IOT88 |	Yes actually pretty expensive if I recall
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,800	| IOT88 |	But I'll get the exact
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,080	| IOT88 |	So these are
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:00,128	| IOT88 |	In your house and they
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:06,272	| IOT88 |	Adapt to how you use your Wi-Fi network so I actually installed mine but I was kind of late on my insta
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:09,600	| IOT88 |	So I'm not going to talk about how it's working
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,368	| IOT88 |	Because
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:12,160	| IOT88 |	I'm supposed to let it sit for
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,184	| IOT88 |	Take a couple days
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,280	| IOT88 |	It kind of learn a little bit more before
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:17,792	| IOT88 |	I start doing
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,608	| IOT88 |	Performance testing so what I can tell you
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:27,008	| IOT88 |	Is the install itself they have an IOS and Android app if you have the ability to install it using I
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,592	| IOT88 |	IOS do it because the Android app is pretty bare-bones
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,616	| IOT88 |	It takes about
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,152	| IOT88 |	Maybe
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,432	| IOT88 |	15 minutes in a day
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:39,552	| IOT88 |	It's me running around upstairs
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,600	| IOT88 |	So you basically
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,624	| IOT88 |	You plug it into your
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,696	| IOT88 |	You plug the first one into your router
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,744	| IOT88 |	Into the wall
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,840	| IOT88 |	I will say I had to find a longer
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,352	| IOT88 |	Ethernet cable
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:58,240	| IOT88 |	A little higher than my outlets on the ground
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:00,544	| IOT88 |	Problem
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:04,896	| IOT88 |	Once you do that it established you
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,920	| IOT88 |	Name your network
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,432	| IOT88 |	If you
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,224	| IOT88 |	Are replacing it make sure you
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,760	| IOT88 |	Get the exact same SSID
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,040	| IOT88 |	Like me
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,320	| IOT88 |	End
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:16,928	| IOT88 |	Your password and then you run around your house just plugging in these other things
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,696	| IOT88 |	Are the other pods
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:20,256	| IOT88 |	You know different rooms
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:22,304	| IOT88 |	Can the pods get
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:22,816	| IOT88 |	Discovered
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,352	| IOT88 |	Eminem and
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,680	| IOT88 |	You're done
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:30,496	| IOT88 |	Yeah and paws are not that expensive
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,520	| IOT88 |	If you bite me.
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:34,080	| IOT88 |	$69 for a single pod
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:36,640	| IOT88 |	3 pack is $180
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,456	| IOT88 |	And a six-pack is 300 +
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,736	| IOT88 |	$30
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,016	| IOT88 |	Probably will want
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,040	| IOT88 |	Lose people
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:43,808	| IOT88 |	In a home
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,112	| IOT88 |	Will probably start with the six
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,672	| IOT88 |	Like I have 7in
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,208	| IOT88 |	House and it's a
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,304	| IOT88 |	Help me come to my home bring a six pack
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,840	| IOT88 |	That's my motto
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,120	| IOT88 |	As a guest I do try
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:03,264	| IOT88 |	Next week I'll tell you I'll do some actual
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,288	| IOT88 |	Performance testing
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:07,872	| IOT88 |	Until you already the coverage is good throughout the home
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:10,176	| IOT88 |	I haven't noticed anything
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:12,736	| IOT88 |	Weird dead spots or
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:13,248	| IOT88 |	Any
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,040	| IOT88 |	Terrible things
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,064	| IOT88 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,904	| IOT88 |	After all of that
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,672	| IOT88 |	We have
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,768	| IOT88 |	News from Kevin
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,376	| IOT88 |	Sorry we're just going to add this right here

EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:42,432	| IOT88 |	I'm just reading out loud now Temple is no longer able to operate as an independent entity
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:48,064	| IOT88 |	We've made a tough decision to shut down the company and no longer manufactured Pebble devices
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:56,000	| IOT88 |	I'm going over to the update section of the
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:57,792	| IOT88 |	Pebble site
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:06,496	| IOT88 |	Temple devices will continue to work as normal no need changes to the user experience will happen at this time however Pebble Junction
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,312	| IOT88 |	Cellular service quality may be reduced in the future
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:13,408	| IOT88 |	There's some information on refunds for people of recently ordered as well
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,432	| IOT88 |	Sonu Kaur
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:19,040	| IOT88 |	Pebble time to Pebble core in Pebble time round Kickstarter Edition
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| IOT88 |	So no further
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,720	| IOT88 |	You will automatically get
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,232	| IOT88 |	Refunded from you
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:34,656	| IOT88 |	So here's something because actually this will affect me refunds are automatic payment card the original Kickstarter pledge was placed
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,032	| IOT88 |	Packers must contact their financial institution that issued the

EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:58,208	| IOT88 |	It kind of stinks at our first breaking news is actually sadness
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,768	| IOT88 |	That is terrible and it'll be breaking you know tomorrow
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,280	| IOT88 |	Tomorrow when you
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:03,840	| IOT88 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,424	| IOT88 |	Sad
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,704	| IOT88 |	Into podcast
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:15,104	| IOT88 |	Let's take a break for a message from our sponsor and then we will go to Peter's or you
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,128	| IOT88 |	Who's going to talk about
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,408	| IOT88 |	Changing your business model
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,432	| IOT88 |	After
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,992	| IOT88 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:29,184	| IOT88 |	Guys last week I was talking about the August doorbell and I mention their plan to charge users
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:32,000	| IOT88 |	For access to their Clips after certain amount of time
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,304	| IOT88 |	I told you the wrong time
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:36,864	| IOT88 |	Find the actual amount of time that you will have
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:37,376	| IOT88 |	4
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:41,472	| IOT88 |	Free access to your existing clips from the doorbell is one month
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,288	| IOT88 |	So that's a lot longer than what I thought
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:48,384	| IOT88 |	And said last week now you know
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:54,528	| IOT88 |	Hey everyone we are breaking into the Internet of Things podcast with a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:57,856	| IOT88 |	This week sponsor is Samsung and I have Abi
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:00,160	| IOT88 |	Who is director of product marketing
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,208	| IOT88 |	With Samsung
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:04,000	| IOT88 |	Arctic Cloud first off
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,536	| IOT88 |	Tell me what is
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,048	| IOT88 |	Arctic
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:11,168	| IOT88 |	Samsung artik Cloud is an open data exchange platform for the iot
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:16,032	| IOT88 |	It's a relatively new commercial iot Cloud offering from Samsung
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,056	| IOT88 |	For Enterprises
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:22,176	| IOT88 |	We provide Enterprises a super-fast way of connecting
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:25,504	| IOT88 |	Siloed devices and enabling Deluxe developer
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,552	| IOT88 |	To deliver new services and application
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,832	| IOT88 |	How are people use
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:30,624	| IOT88 |	ICloud
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,928	| IOT88 |	Take Healthcare and building automation
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:39,328	| IOT88 |	It has good patients are increasingly generating their own health data using blood pressure monitor
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,608	| IOT88 |	Pulse oximeter
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:42,400	| IOT88 |	Fitness trackers in salon
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,960	| IOT88 |	These devices were never designed to work together
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,752	| IOT88 |	What's the site with make it very hard
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,800	| IOT88 |	Florida Healthcare payroll provider
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,104	| IOT88 |	To build a consistent view of the patient's health
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,896	| IOT88 |	Cumberland building
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:59,296	| IOT88 |	It's very hard for the building manager to build a consistent view of how energy is being used
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,320	| IOT88 |	Throughout the building
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,368	| IOT88 |	When the HVAC system the lighting
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:04,672	| IOT88 |	System the plug load occupancy sensors
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:08,768	| IOT88 |	The weather feed air quality or don't talk to each other
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:12,352	| IOT88 |	It's breaking down the silos is where Samsung artik Cloud company
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:15,424	| IOT88 |	Alright and when I actually signed up for Samsung art
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:19,520	| IOT88 |	Which any developer can do I was surprised that the
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:21,056	| IOT88 |	This is not a traditional
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:25,152	| IOT88 |	Hey you point your device to this cloud and it takes in the data and does things with it
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,200	| IOT88 |	This is very much a connecting
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:29,248	| IOT88 |	Can you talk about how
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:31,040	| IOT88 |	Samsung artik Cloud
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,552	| IOT88 |	Is different
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,112	| IOT88 |	Then maybe some of the other things
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:34,880	| IOT88 |	They're out there
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:41,280	| IOT88 |	Svcrt cloud is very different from what you see with other iot platforms and services
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,304	| IOT88 |	On the market
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:45,632	| IOT88 |	Underscore artik cloud is a collection of ready-to-use
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:50,240	| IOT88 |	Apis and sdks that are open that are easy to use that are enterprise-grade
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:53,824	| IOT88 |	It when we look at other iot Solutions out there
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:54,848	| IOT88 |	We see the
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,664	| IOT88 |	We see us as different alarm three key dimensions
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:00,224	| IOT88 |	The forces we are integrated
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:03,552	| IOT88 |	We've integrated all the key iot Services you need
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,856	| IOT88 |	Device connectivity data collection
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:09,184	| IOT88 |	An aggregation device interoperability data access
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,464	| IOT88 |	Security
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:12,512	| IOT88 |	Into one single platform
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:15,072	| IOT88 |	And we expose those as API
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,120	| IOT88 |	The second is rebirth in
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:22,240	| IOT88 |	A number of services around interoperability the ability to connect two different clouds
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:27,104	| IOT88 |	The ability to manage identity permission data privacy
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,152	| IOT88 |	All that is built in out of the box
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:32,992	| IOT88 |	The third thing is we've kept Developers front-and-center
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,296	| IOT88 |	When we've designed and built Arctic cloud
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,064	| IOT88 |	We've made it
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:40,160	| IOT88 |	Extremely easy for developers to use our API SDK sore tooth
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:41,440	| IOT88 |	Because we know that
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:44,000	| IOT88 |	Developers are the ones who will actually use
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:44,768	| IOT88 |	Are products
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,536	| IOT88 |	And
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,584	| IOT88 |	Business news services and app
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:51,424	| IOT88 |	That make iot more pervasive more useful
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:52,704	| IOT88 |	Abby
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:54,240	| IOT88 |	How can I find out more
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:59,872	| IOT88 |	You can learn more and sign up for article out at Arctic. That's a r

EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:21,632	| IOT88 |	Hey everyone we are back with the
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:24,960	| IOT88 |	The Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:26,496	| IOT88 |	And today we have with us
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:29,568	| IOT88 |	Peter zornio who is the chief strategy officer for
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,360	| IOT88 |	Automation Solutions at Emerson
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,152	| IOT88 |	Hey Peter how are you doing today
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:36,480	| IOT88 |	Hi Stacy it's a great pleasure to be with you today
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,272	| IOT88 |	I am super thrilled
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:42,368	| IOT88 |	Last time we talked I went to Emerson's
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:45,952	| IOT88 |	Guys have a nice little demo area here in Austin Texas
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:47,232	| IOT88 |	And we talked about
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:49,280	| IOT88 |	All kinds of things but mostly
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:53,120	| IOT88 |	Turning your products business into a Services business
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,888	| IOT88 |	On the industrial-size
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:59,776	| IOT88 |	Indeed we did when you walk through a number of demonstrations and we showed you some of the
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:03,104	| IOT88 |	The application that we are working on it exactly that area
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:09,248	| IOT88 |	I found an awesome to talk to you because you've been doing this a while and I'd love for you just to take the audience really quickly through
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,832	| IOT88 |	Kind of the stages of Industrial Automation because
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,136	| IOT88 |	Automated
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,160	| IOT88 |	70s
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:17,440	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:18,976	| IOT88 |	Where where are we and where are we going
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:24,352	| IOT88 |	Okay Stacy thanks I agree that very much is the case when we look at
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:27,168	| IOT88 |	Industrial and specifically the
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:30,496	| IOT88 |	The process industries that we tend to work with Industries like
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:33,312	| IOT88 |	Chemicals in oil and gas in Pulp
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,592	| IOT88 |	Paper and pharmaceuticals
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:39,200	| IOT88 |	These are industries that you know have had this idea of sensors
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,736	| IOT88 |	All over the place
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:43,552	| IOT88 |	Reporting on real-time data that is happening in the process
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:49,184	| IOT88 |	Being fat into computers and then those computers actually taking action to control those processes
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:52,000	| IOT88 |	That's happened now for probably a good
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,536	| IOT88 |	40 years ever since the first
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:58,144	| IOT88 |	Microcomputer based systems were put in place in the late 60s
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:37:59,936	| IOT88 |	Mid-seventies
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:04,544	| IOT88 |	Some of the fundamental principles of people talked about in iot the idea of
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:10,688	| IOT88 |	Sensory feeding real-time data to computers making decisions while that's that's kind of old hat for us
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,456	| IOT88 |	The new thing
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:18,112	| IOT88 |	Is yeah we've been doing that a long time but we've been doing it very specifically around controlling those processes
EDL	00:38:18,112	00:38:21,440	| IOT88 |	And it's historically been gone just on site
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:27,072	| IOT88 |	You know by instrumentation and Computing resources that are on site you know kind of very much like the
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:30,144	| IOT88 |	The computer that controls the engine in your car as you drive around
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,424	| IOT88 |	What's
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:34,240	| IOT88 |	Certainly do when the whole Industrial internet-of-things
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:38,336	| IOT88 |	Is a number of things number one the idea of using the internet
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:42,432	| IOT88 |	To take that data and also additional sensor data that you might add
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:47,296	| IOT88 |	And feeding that to anyone in the world or any application anywhere in the world
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:51,392	| IOT88 |	For analysis and decisions as to what actions to be taken
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:56,512	| IOT88 |	And then another big changes the tools we have available to us obviously with
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:00,352	| IOT88 |	Things like cloud computing and Big Data statistical analysis and
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:07,264	| IOT88 |	The ability to handle many different types of data other tools and Technology we have to apply to analyze that day didn't come
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:09,568	| IOT88 |	Come up with answers is dramatically
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:11,872	| IOT88 |	Differences and it's been 30 years ago
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:15,968	| IOT88 |	And then perhaps what I think is maybe the biggest change of all
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:21,344	| IOT88 |	Is this idea of the whole new business model of the connected service or the
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,368	| IOT88 |	Iot service
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:25,184	| IOT88 |	With that data goes to a third party
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,208	| IOT88 |	Not the customer
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,744	| IOT88 |	For analysis
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:29,024	| IOT88 |	And you know
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:33,888	| IOT88 |	Overall computational analysis together with an expert looking at the data
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,424	| IOT88 |	A coming back with
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:39,264	| IOT88 |	Actions coming back with this is what you need to do or this is how the problem
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,288	| IOT88 |	Should be corrected
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:43,360	| IOT88 |	Traditionally our customers have always done that themselves
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:45,408	| IOT88 |	I mean so that idea of
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:49,760	| IOT88 |	I really turning something that you know they did themselves
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:53,344	| IOT88 |	Using tools and technology that they purchased from companies like us
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,880	| IOT88 |	Into a service
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:58,976	| IOT88 |	Something where we actually deliver the outcome to them where we've analyzed the data
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:03,072	| IOT88 |	That's probably the biggest change of all I'd say in the industrial space
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:06,144	| IOT88 |	Man Peter you are riding my Segway is for me
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,936	| IOT88 |	Because that's my next question
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:11,776	| IOT88 |	You guys are trying to move into this kind of service aside and I'm
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| IOT88 |	Really curious about what that
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,104	| IOT88 |	Looks like
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:15,872	| IOT88 |	4 Emerson
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,920	| IOT88 |	How you kind of structure
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,200	| IOT88 |	The shift
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:20,736	| IOT88 |	From product to service
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,272	| IOT88 |	And then I'd like to talk about
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:24,064	| IOT88 |	The value that the customer gets in
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:24,576	| IOT88 |	What they say
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:32,000	| IOT88 |	Cure for a company like us that's traditionally been a technology supplier we had service offerings before
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,536	| IOT88 |	The service offerings
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,840	| IOT88 |	Have been ones where we've come out
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,352	| IOT88 |	To help
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,424	| IOT88 |	Install and startup and configure our equipment
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:43,008	| IOT88 |	Where we've come out and help to maintain and
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:46,336	| IOT88 |	Baby continue to provide some lifecycle value out of it
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:48,640	| IOT88 |	But we've never been the operator
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:52,736	| IOT88 |	Of the equipment right we always provided the equipment to end users
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:57,344	| IOT88 |	Who did the final operation and use the data coming from it to
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:40:58,624	| IOT88 |	Can make analysis site
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:02,720	| IOT88 |	I used a very simple analogy that you know we're always
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:07,328	| IOT88 |	The guys that you know sold and serviced your lawn mowers for you and
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,864	| IOT88 |	You went out mold your lawn
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:11,424	| IOT88 |	Now we're lawn mower service
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:14,240	| IOT88 |	Will tell you hey if you like is a turnkey Manor
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:18,080	| IOT88 |	Will put this equipment in will take the data will analyze it and will even
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:22,432	| IOT88 |	In some cases take action for you in addition to just providing you
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,200	| IOT88 |	With information
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,528	| IOT88 |	That's a big business model shift
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:28,320	| IOT88 |	For you know traditionally
EDL	00:41:28,832	00:41:31,904	| IOT88 |	Technology or product supplier company like ourselves
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,184	| IOT88 |	Let's break that down a little
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:35,744	| IOT88 |	So when making this shift
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,792	| IOT88 |	You don't do it all at once
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:39,584	| IOT88 |	Crossroad whole portfolio
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,120	| IOT88 |	How do you
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:42,400	| IOT88 |	Target and start
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:42,912	| IOT88 |	A process like
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:46,496	| IOT88 |	One of the first things that we have done
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,800	| IOT88 |	Is we tried to identify
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:55,455	| IOT88 |	The applications that we know will for sure deliver business value to our customers and we've had a
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:58,271	| IOT88 |	A very big focus on making sure as we talked about
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:02,623	| IOT88 |	Industrial internet-of-things that we always start the conversation from
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:06,719	| IOT88 |	Here's what's in it for you Mr customer from a business value perspective
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:12,095	| IOT88 |	And we've also made sure to look at areas where we think customers will be comfortable
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:17,471	| IOT88 |	With this idea of about sourcing the function is someone like ourselves
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,007	| IOT88 |	So what does that mean
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:20,287	| IOT88 |	What are some of the criteria
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:21,567	| IOT88 |	Okay well number one
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:24,127	| IOT88 |	Because we're going to be asking too
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:26,431	| IOT88 |	Do collect data from their sites
EDL	00:42:26,943	00:42:29,503	| IOT88 |	And have it looked at by our people
EDL	00:42:29,503	00:42:30,271	| IOT88 |	Well
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:36,671	| IOT88 |	Most of our customers are understandably has a big concern around their intellectual property what that data might be
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:42,559	| IOT88 |	Medium from a privacy and intellectual property point-of-view so we start by looking at applications where we think
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:43,839	| IOT88 |	The data itself
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:47,679	| IOT88 |	Is dated at the Comfort that the customers are comfortable
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,727	| IOT88 |	Having a third party
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:53,311	| IOT88 |	Owner having it not all about having a 3rd party look at it analyzed
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,591	| IOT88 |	Okay
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,871	| IOT88 |	So not the secret formula
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:59,199	| IOT88 |	It's not the secret formula exactly next
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:02,527	| IOT88 |	We look for areas that we have
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:04,063	| IOT88 |	Great domain expertise in
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:07,647	| IOT88 |	Because I'm a big believer when you look at
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:09,695	| IOT88 |	Industrial internet-of-things when you look at
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:10,975	| IOT88 |	Just
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:13,279	| IOT88 |	You know operation Improvement in general
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:14,303	| IOT88 |	Really it's
EDL	00:43:14,815	00:43:16,095	| IOT88 |	All about
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:17,119	| IOT88 |	Domain expertise
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:19,167	| IOT88 |	Either in the form of
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:19,679	| IOT88 |	Experts
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:25,567	| IOT88 |	Encapsulated domain expertise in the form of algorithms or software
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:30,175	| IOT88 |	Or learn to Domaine expertise that you got by running big-data stuff to
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:30,943	| IOT88 |	Define
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:32,223	| IOT88 |	You know correlations
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:33,503	| IOT88 |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:34,783	| IOT88 |	This is just
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,343	| IOT88 |	Yet another deployment model
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:38,879	| IOT88 |	For how you
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:40,415	| IOT88 |	Applying and deliver
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,951	| IOT88 |	Domain expertise
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:45,535	| IOT88 |	2 solving a problem and improving operational performance
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:48,607	| IOT88 |	And I think that's true when you look at
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,887	| IOT88 |	You know other
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:51,167	| IOT88 |	Iot
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:55,263	| IOT88 |	Areas as well I mean if you look at the medical field right you know when
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:44:00,383	| IOT88 |	If you have a Fitbit and your got all this great date of being collected about your personal hell
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:05,759	| IOT88 |	Who would you like to have at the other end of that Fitbit while you'd like to have the world's leading expert on
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:09,087	| IOT88 |	You know Cardiology your you know performance
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:11,903	| IOT88 |	Exercising performance or whatever it may be
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:13,183	| IOT88 |	So
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:15,743	| IOT88 |	Customers are going to trust
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:20,095	| IOT88 |	Someone who they believe has great domain expertise in an area
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,887	| IOT88 |	For this Outsource
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:23,167	| IOT88 |	Service kind of model
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:27,263	| IOT88 |	So we will get areas where we have that domain expertise can we go to Costco
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:30,847	| IOT88 |	Okay so you guys are looking for when you
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:33,663	| IOT88 |	Service is a good business
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:34,175	| IOT88 |	Your customer
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:39,551	| IOT88 |	And something that you guys know more about than any
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:42,111	| IOT88 |	So now here gets the fun part
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:43,647	| IOT88 |	Pick something
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:46,719	| IOT88 |	The customer seems like they might go for something like this
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:48,255	| IOT88 |	Easier so hopefully
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:53,119	| IOT88 |	And now how do you implement something like this because
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:56,191	| IOT88 |	You got to think about contracts like how do you contract
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:58,495	| IOT88 |	When you're selling a service versus a product
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,543	| IOT88 |	In at the lifetime of this product
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:02,079	| IOT88 |	What it entails how you
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:02,591	| IOT88 |	Renegotiate
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:05,407	| IOT88 |	What are some of those considerations
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:07,455	| IOT88 |	So that permeates
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:10,015	| IOT88 |	Just about every aspect of how we do our business
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:12,319	| IOT88 |	It starts from selling
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:15,647	| IOT88 |	Okay so again if you're a traditional
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:18,975	| IOT88 |	Product or technology sales kind of organization
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,279	| IOT88 |	You know you kind of live by the
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:24,863	| IOT88 |	Project or the demand that a customer has created
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:29,215	| IOT88 |	And you go in and you try to differentiate your technology or product
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,751	| IOT88 |	Compared to the other guys
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:31,519	| IOT88 |	Here
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:33,567	| IOT88 |	It's more of a demand creation model
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:37,407	| IOT88 |	You have to go to a customer and be able to sell them
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:41,503	| IOT88 |	On the business case in the value of of what you're providing
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:43,807	| IOT88 |	You have to in some cases
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:49,439	| IOT88 |	Be willing to move to morva outcome-based Performance contract do you have to
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:52,511	| IOT88 |	Not just say hey I'm going to show you a product but actually be willing
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:56,095	| IOT88 |	To stand behind what the results for the outcome may be
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:58,143	| IOT88 |	Of the particular service that you're delivering
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:02,239	| IOT88 |	You get into lots of aspects around
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:03,519	| IOT88 |	The data itself
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:06,591	| IOT88 |	Where the data is stored is the data connected to
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:08,895	| IOT88 |	Securely security of course has a big D
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:12,479	| IOT88 |	Concern sometimes what we've done in that particular area
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:15,295	| IOT88 |	Is we've partnered with Microsoft because
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:16,575	| IOT88 |	You know
EDL	00:46:16,575	00:46:21,439	| IOT88 |	Data storage and rules around who owns data vary tremendously across the globe
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:27,071	| IOT88 |	There has been a lot of focus on that just brought from cloud computing overall so we'd rather just
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,607	| IOT88 |	Partner with somebody
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:32,959	| IOT88 |	Who can address at least that aspect of it very directly and has a lot of experience in that
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:37,567	| IOT88 |	So generally where we land there is the data always belongs to the customer
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:39,359	| IOT88 |	But any knowledge
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:42,687	| IOT88 |	That we gain from working with that data
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:46,271	| IOT88 |	That knowledge that application if you will belongs to us
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:50,879	| IOT88 |	You have to dress contractually what you're going to do if the customer
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:57,023	| IOT88 |	Is done with the service and you know wants to cancel it for whatever reason and says hey I want to have all my data back
EDL	00:46:57,535	00:47:03,167	| IOT88 |	You have to agree who in your organization is going to have access to that data and for what purposes are going to have it
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:04,703	| IOT88 |	Let's talk about pricing
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:05,727	| IOT88 |	Because this is a big
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:09,055	| IOT88 |	Issue I mean going from selling a physical product
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:11,359	| IOT88 |	Presumably you sell once
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:14,175	| IOT88 |	To selling a recurring Revenue stream
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:16,735	| IOT88 |	Recurring service not only is it a different type of sales cycle
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,527	| IOT88 |	But it's also a different way of
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:20,063	| IOT88 |	Accounting for it
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:20,575	| IOT88 |	Pricing app
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,367	| IOT88 |	So how do you guys
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:24,415	| IOT88 |	How did you think about pricing
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:26,207	| IOT88 |	When you were sitting price
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:28,511	| IOT88 |	So you
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:33,631	| IOT88 |	Generally always want to work from the value delivered back so you want to look at
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:36,191	| IOT88 |	What would this particular service
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:39,519	| IOT88 |	Do for a customer what would it cost them
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:42,335	| IOT88 |	If they didn't have it what are you saving them
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,103	| IOT88 |	If they
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:44,127	| IOT88 |	Didn't have it
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:45,919	| IOT88 |	What do you potentially
EDL	00:47:45,919	00:47:49,247	| IOT88 |	What kind of down time or maintenance
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:53,087	| IOT88 |	Expanse would they have to be spending themselves if they didn't have this service
EDL	00:47:53,087	00:47:54,111	| IOT88 |	And then work
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,391	| IOT88 |	Into
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:59,231	| IOT88 |	You know what a good price would be that looks like it's an equitable sharing
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:02,815	| IOT88 |	Are the benefits that you're delivering to the customer and as you can imagine
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:05,375	| IOT88 |	There's always a lot of back and forth with a customer on
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:08,447	| IOT88 |	Assumptions you're making about what might happen
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:11,007	| IOT88 |	Versus assumptions that they might have about what
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:12,287	| IOT88 |	What happened with or without
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,055	| IOT88 |	How to service
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:17,151	| IOT88 |	So right now you guys are not selling like you are not having to deal with
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:18,431	| IOT88 |	Like I sell you a valve
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:21,247	| IOT88 |	As part of a service without actually
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:22,783	| IOT88 |	Selling someone the physical valve
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:24,831	| IOT88 |	What we are
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:27,903	| IOT88 |	So we are dealing in some cases where
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:34,047	| IOT88 |	We sell just the service and Princeton star steam trap monitoring service is a good example of that
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:37,119	| IOT88 |	So we're not in the steam trap
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:38,399	| IOT88 |	Business per se
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:41,983	| IOT88 |	But we know a lot about steam traps because we
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,519	| IOT88 |	Make specific sensors
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:45,823	| IOT88 |	That go on steam traps
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:47,359	| IOT88 |	And have built-in
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:50,687	| IOT88 |	Algorithms built-in analytics inside of them
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:56,831	| IOT88 |	That are capable of identifying the acoustic signature that tells you what's happening with that particular string trap
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:49:01,439	| IOT88 |	So in that case we actually go out and we sell a specific service
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:05,023	| IOT88 |	Where we would go in and put the sensors on your steam traps
EDL	00:49:05,535	00:49:07,583	| IOT88 |	Bring them back to our
EDL	00:49:08,095	00:49:10,143	| IOT88 |	Pervasive sensing Center where we
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:11,935	| IOT88 |	Analyze what's going on
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,727	| IOT88 |	And then we
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:20,127	| IOT88 |	Tell you which Team traps are failed are likely to fail and which ones to go out and do work on or we can even go and do a
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:20,895	| IOT88 |	Good for you
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:24,735	| IOT88 |	Are cell so there's an example where we actually are selling
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:26,527	| IOT88 |	Just the service
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:28,831	| IOT88 |	On equipment that
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:29,855	| IOT88 |	We don't manufacture
EDL	00:49:30,879	00:49:31,903	| IOT88 |	And in that case
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:35,743	| IOT88 |	Talking about you know transforming from selling products to selling services
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,071	| IOT88 |	That's an interesting financial application for
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:39,839	| IOT88 |	Just because
EDL	00:49:39,839	00:49:43,167	| IOT88 |	There we may go in and install all the equipment to run that service
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:49,567	| IOT88 |	Well that's Capital Equipment that you know we're going to carry on our books for a prescribed length
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,615	| IOT88 |	The charm of that of that sales contract
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:55,967	| IOT88 |	And that's a very different kind of financial business model for us where were
EDL	00:49:55,967	00:49:59,039	| IOT88 |	You know Manufacturing Company we're used to looking at things like
EDL	00:49:59,551	00:50:04,927	| IOT88 |	Cost of goods sold and inventory and include things like that we try to keep our capital costlow
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:07,231	| IOT88 |	Here's a case where in order to get a
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:10,047	| IOT88 |	A recurring annuity kind of service
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:12,607	| IOT88 |	We're actually going to have to take on some additional
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:15,935	| IOT88 |	Capital that we hold on our books in order to
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:17,727	| IOT88 |	Enable Unity service
EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:20,031	| IOT88 |	And what's interesting here
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:21,311	| IOT88 |	Is
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:25,407	| IOT88 |	This isn't a crazy model that got if I think about cloud computing right now
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:25,919	| IOT88 |	You know
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:29,247	| IOT88 |	Basically Amazon took all the capital expenditures and
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:30,271	| IOT88 |	Google and Microsoft
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:31,807	| IOT88 |	To turn
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:33,855	| IOT88 |	Computing power into objects for
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:37,695	| IOT88 |	Now if I take this though to Industrial manufacturer
EDL	00:50:39,231	00:50:40,511	| IOT88 |	That doesn't feel
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:44,863	| IOT88 |	A sensor or a valve is in a fungible resource like
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:46,143	| IOT88 |	Computer is
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,959	| IOT88 |	Basically a virtualized server
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:52,799	| IOT88 |	So that gets into some kind of just basic economics of
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:54,847	| IOT88 |	Can we see
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:57,407	| IOT88 |	Hey can you guys financially do this
EDL	00:50:57,919	00:50:58,943	| IOT88 |	For everything
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:50:59,711	| IOT88 |	For what things I don't
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,247	| IOT88 |	And then
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:04,319	| IOT88 |	Can this really have the type of impact that like cloud computing
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:10,975	| IOT88 |	Yeah I think that's a great analogy I think what's interesting when you think about cloud computing also
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:13,023	| IOT88 |	Is that those companies
EDL	00:51:13,791	00:51:17,631	| IOT88 |	Truck capability you know Computing horsepower
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:22,751	| IOT88 |	But they were not the providers of right other companies were the providers of that at the time
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:24,543	| IOT88 |	You know whether it was
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:28,127	| IOT88 |	Is Dell or HP or whoever it was that was in the server business right
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:31,967	| IOT88 |	But then they became the one that was the service provider of it
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:32,735	| IOT88 |	Okay
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,015	| IOT88 |	Nnr case
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:37,599	| IOT88 |	You know where they the Capital Equipment provider it's not
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:39,903	| IOT88 |	Possible just as you said that's a great
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:40,415	| IOT88 |	Distinction
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:45,535	| IOT88 |	To relocate that right that valve that steam trap that whatever piece of process
EDL	00:51:45,535	00:51:46,047	| IOT88 |	Office equipment
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:48,351	| IOT88 |	Have to be physically there
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:49,119	| IOT88 |	At the plant
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:50,911	| IOT88 |	But the
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:55,007	| IOT88 |	Uptime of it and they making sure that it's available on demand
EDL	00:51:55,007	00:51:55,775	| IOT88 |	Perform
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:57,567	| IOT88 |	The job that is supposed to perform
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:52:02,943	| IOT88 |	You know that's the service that we would be offering going forward and extended to it
EDL	00:52:03,455	00:52:04,991	| IOT88 |	Ultimate end
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:06,527	| IOT88 |	You could see it
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:10,879	| IOT88 |	Yes being turned into something like what we never even sell you a valve in the first place
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:16,767	| IOT88 |	We saw you valve uptime right course that's the example that's used a lot with like aircraft engine
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:19,583	| IOT88 |	It's right that you moved from buying an aircraft engine
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:22,911	| IOT88 |	Do you move it you move to stress by the hour or whatever maybe
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:23,679	| IOT88 |	Recall
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:27,263	| IOT88 |	I don't see that happening with with everything because
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:29,823	| IOT88 |	You know
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:33,151	| IOT88 |	Not every capital expenditure is a
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:35,967	| IOT88 |	Is is giant hand in marriage that sort of I think
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:38,271	| IOT88 |	Model being built around it
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:40,063	| IOT88 |	But for sure
EDL	00:52:40,063	00:52:45,439	| IOT88 |	The idea that the maintenance of the uptime and the availability of that of that asset being
EDL	00:52:45,951	00:52:47,999	| IOT88 |	Being there when it's called upon
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:51,071	| IOT88 |	I can see a lot of things moving that model
EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:53,887	| IOT88 |	Cuz it really boils down to
EDL	00:52:53,887	00:52:56,191	| IOT88 |	What are the things that the
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:58,495	| IOT88 |	End-users the manufacturers
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:01,567	| IOT88 |	Want to spend their precious time and resources
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:02,335	| IOT88 |	On
EDL	00:53:02,847	00:53:04,895	| IOT88 |	Keeping going and where do they View
EDL	00:53:04,895	00:53:08,479	| IOT88 |	Are there domain expertise and what are they better at
EDL	00:53:08,479	00:53:10,783	| IOT88 |	Let's get into the concept of security
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:13,855	| IOT88 |	Because we talked about this a lot on the show
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:16,671	| IOT88 |	A lot of the most recent discussion is been around
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:18,719	| IOT88 |	Consumer and smart home and
EDL	00:53:18,719	00:53:20,767	| IOT88 |	Mirai botnet and all those kind of fun things
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:24,863	| IOT88 |	But it is kind of a crazy place to think about
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:26,655	| IOT88 |	Bad security practices
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:28,959	| IOT88 |	So I would love to get a sense from you
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:30,495	| IOT88 |	How your customers are
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:31,775	| IOT88 |	This
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:37,407	| IOT88 |	First of all they absolutely Dulce security as a very important thing we've run a number of
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:39,967	| IOT88 |	Daddies are just questionnaires with our customers
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:43,807	| IOT88 |	As well as looked at a number of ones that other people done the industrial space
EDL	00:53:44,319	00:53:47,903	| IOT88 |	And you know what usually number 1 and number 2 and
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:50,719	| IOT88 |	Switches in order sometime around Industrial iot
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:53,279	| IOT88 |	Is what's the business case
EDL	00:53:53,279	00:53:55,071	| IOT88 |	And then the other one is always security
EDL	00:53:55,583	00:53:57,887	| IOT88 |	Obviously in the industrial space
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:53:59,935	| IOT88 |	It doesn't help
EDL	00:53:59,935	00:54:03,775	| IOT88 |	The term iot is used broadly
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:07,871	| IOT88 |	Whether we're talking about industrial iot or home iot
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:10,175	| IOT88 |	Or iot in cities or
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:14,271	| IOT88 |	You know smart instrumented people it's all called iot
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:16,063	| IOT88 |	And then they read in the news
EDL	00:54:16,063	00:54:19,391	| IOT88 |	Statue at A candle wiped out
EDL	00:54:19,391	00:54:23,231	| IOT88 |	The internet on the eastern half of the United States cuz
EDL	00:54:23,743	00:54:28,095	| IOT88 |	Your internet enabled Barbie doll and home thermostat
EDL	00:54:28,607	00:54:31,423	| IOT88 |	You know had very poor Security in the first place
EDL	00:54:31,423	00:54:32,191	| IOT88 |	So that
EDL	00:54:32,191	00:54:37,311	| IOT88 |	Sort of Cassidy a shadow over into the industrial space
EDL	00:54:37,823	00:54:40,639	| IOT88 |	But in reality what happens in the industrial space
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:42,943	| IOT88 |	Is you are dealing
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:48,831	| IOT88 |	With very professional it organizations that have been working in the security area
EDL	00:54:49,599	00:54:55,231	| IOT88 |	Since computers have been around and certainly with a greater emphasis in the last 10 or 15 years
EDL	00:54:55,231	00:54:56,767	| IOT88 |	There's no way
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:54:58,303	| IOT88 |	They're going to put in
EDL	00:54:58,303	00:55:02,399	| IOT88 |	Iot infrastructures and iot connected devices
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:06,239	| IOT88 |	Without going through every aspect of what the
EDL	00:55:06,239	00:55:08,031	| IOT88 |	Security is an insuring
EDL	00:55:08,031	00:55:09,823	| IOT88 |	That the security is
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:14,175	| IOT88 |	Up to Snuff it is what it needs to be they are very highly concerned about that
EDL	00:55:14,175	00:55:15,199	| IOT88 |	Okay and in fact
EDL	00:55:15,711	00:55:22,111	| IOT88 |	When you look at the stuff that we provide you know to enable iot like RR wireless sensor for
