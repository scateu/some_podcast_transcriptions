EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:12,032	| IOT025 |	Things podcast
EDL	00:00:12,032	00:00:12,800	| IOT025 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,824	00:00:14,592	| IOT025 |	Is your co-host
EDL	00:00:14,592	00:00:15,360	| IOT025 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:17,408	| IOT025 |	Today's podcast we have
EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:20,224	| IOT025 |	So much stuff for you we promised we talked about Apple
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:22,528	| IOT025 |	A crazy access
EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:23,808	| IOT025 |	Point from Samsung
EDL	00:00:23,808	00:00:24,576	| IOT025 |	And we have
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:26,880	| IOT025 |	Salesforce getting into the Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:27,904	| IOT025 |	And
EDL	00:00:28,928	00:00:31,744	| IOT025 |	Kevin we get to find out about his onhub router
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:32,256	| IOT025 |	Experience
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:34,304	| IOT025 |	Yes
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:36,352	| IOT025 |	And our guest this week is Paul Masson
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:41,216	| IOT025 |	And he is with Ping Identity and we're going to talk about creating and identity layer for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:43,264	| IOT025 |	Okay so let's start with Apple
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,800	| IOT025 |	What did we hear from Apple
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:47,872	| IOT025 |	At home kit about their show that we were so eager for
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:48,640	| IOT025 |	Last week
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:49,408	| IOT025 |	Kevin
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:51,456	| IOT025 |	I can sum it up in one
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,224	| IOT025 |	Word
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:53,248	| IOT025 |	And that where it is
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,272	| IOT025 |	Nothing
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:54,784	| IOT025 |	Yeah
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:57,600	| IOT025 |	It was a real bummer I'm going to be honest
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:00:59,648	| IOT025 |	It's it's kind of it
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:03,744	| IOT025 |	Interesting him and what does it say about where they're at with the platform in
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:06,304	| IOT025 |	You've written several stories in the past several months
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:09,120	| IOT025 |	About how the challenges are with the
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:15,264	| IOT025 |	The platform requirements Apple security requirements the hardware that's needed to be home to get certified
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:16,032	| IOT025 |	And
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:22,176	| IOT025 |	Apple you know it's probably said no everything's fine you know we're just we're just had flow products at WWDC
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,248	| IOT025 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,272	| IOT025 |	I would have thought
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:32,672	| IOT025 |	Especially with the new Apple TV that they did announce as well as new iPhones new iPads and everything else and watch over
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:33,440	| IOT025 |	Os2
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:36,256	| IOT025 |	Oh I thought they would have done
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:40,096	| IOT025 |	Homekit demo at some Home Care partner and some announcements
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:47,008	| IOT025 |	In fairness though I don't know if you saw the event Stacey but it was about two and a half hours log there was a lot of stuff
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:52,640	| IOT025 |	In it so it's possible that it just wasn't enough to Warrant a spotlight on the stage
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:53,920	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,456	| IOT025 |	What I'm hearing is
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,992	| IOT025 |	There's been a lot of back-and-forth
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,552	| IOT025 |	There's been a lot of
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,832	| IOT025 |	Between the Apple
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:02,368	| IOT025 |	The chip suppliers
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,672	| IOT025 |	And the actual vendors of the
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,696	| IOT025 |	Connected products
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:08,000	| IOT025 |	What's been going on behind the scenes
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,280	| IOT025 |	What is people have been
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,816	| IOT025 |	Building and testing
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,888	| IOT025 |	During the test things have come back
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:14,912	| IOT025 |	Not working the way there
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:17,216	| IOT025 |	And so they have to go back to the drawing
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,008	| IOT025 |	Not all the way back
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,032	| IOT025 |	Necessary that the chip layer
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:24,384	| IOT025 |	But this is a lot harder basically what's happening is Apple's trying to build
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,944	| IOT025 |	An entire ecosystem
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,224	| IOT025 |	Behind the curtains
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:31,040	| IOT025 |	It certainly does seem like apple is trying to
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,368	| IOT025 |	Round up a herd of cats to some degree
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| IOT025 |	But
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,160	| IOT025 |	I kind of put
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:39,744	| IOT025 |	The burden on them they're the ones who brought all the cats into the
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,512	| IOT025 |	Yard to play
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,632	| IOT025 |	Maybe is not it I mean
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| IOT025 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,680	| IOT025 |	Can I see all the cats
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,472	| IOT025 |	Sounds like actual cats peas
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,776	| IOT025 |	Maybe maybe the dogs that are really trying to
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,592	| IOT025 |	Did you want to work with
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,616	| IOT025 |	Destiny want to make this
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,128	| IOT025 |	Work so
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:59,712	| IOT025 |	I think we're actually going to see a big Improvement
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,504	| IOT025 |	From what I hear from people
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,064	| IOT025 |	Is this next iteration of homekit
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,088	| IOT025 |	We should see
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:06,880	| IOT025 |	Improvement
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:08,416	| IOT025 |	And features in usability
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:08,928	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:15,328	| IOT025 |	What I am looking for an iOS 9 which should come out of beta you said maybe tomorrow
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:21,984	| IOT025 |	I'm on the day after recording this podcast by the time everybody hears this podcast it will be available
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| IOT025 |	Think about too many things I live
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:27,872	| IOT025 |	So we're going to see some really interesting things like triggers
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| IOT025 |	Which
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:34,784	| IOT025 |	You know most of our audience who actually has smart home devices are probably pretty familiar with but these are things like
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,832	| IOT025 |	Location so
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,392	| IOT025 |	When you're coming to an area
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,208	| IOT025 |	Your location actually triggers like a light to come on
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,536	| IOT025 |	A certain device or sensor going off
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,072	| IOT025 |	Can trigger
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,608	| IOT025 |	Something else to happen so
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:52,704	| IOT025 |	When my garage door opens for example it triggers my porch lights to come on
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,240	| IOT025 |	We talked about that on the show
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,264	| IOT025 |	Schedule
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,544	| IOT025 |	Time is also a trigger
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:00,384	| IOT025 |	So those are things that we should see their support for that in iOS 9
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:07,040	| IOT025 |	And I'm actually really interested to see how Apple has created the programming interface for that
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,344	| IOT025 |	Because that's one of those things that
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,392	| IOT025 |	Make-or-break kind of things
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,160	| IOT025 |	Consumers I think
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:15,488	| IOT025 |	If it's too complicated people won't use it and
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:20,863	| IOT025 |	Honestly Apple does try to extract the complexity away from things so I think they'll succeed in that area
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,631	| IOT025 |	I'm hoping
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,935	| IOT025 |	I'd like that is like one of the first things
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:32,127	| IOT025 |	Yeah I mean this was a big event and apple apple typically has to fall events one in September for the iPhones
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:35,711	| IOT025 |	And whatever else and then in October that generally have
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,247	| IOT025 |	And IMAX
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,271	| IOT025 |	Anything else
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,063	| IOT025 |	Kind of thing so it's possible
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,111	| IOT025 |	But they still have an October event
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,159	| IOT025 |	Even though the announce the iPads
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| IOT025 |	In September
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| IOT025 |	It is
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,975	| IOT025 |	India
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:51,583	| IOT025 |	So the other thing that was a little strange and it was kind of awkward for Apple I thought
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:56,703	| IOT025 |	Was that when they did the iOS beta put up a website after the event for iOS 9
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,727	| IOT025 |	In-Home Care
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,031	| IOT025 |	And at the bottom of that website
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:03,615	| IOT025 |	They actually had a link that said find homekit enabled products
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:08,479	| IOT025 |	The Apple site for homekit enabled products and if you click that link
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,527	| IOT025 |	Took you to the Apple Store
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,807	| IOT025 |	For any of their home
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:16,415	| IOT025 |	Even the non-home Chipmunks gas so I spent like the night
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,463	| IOT025 |	Went last Wednesday I spent that evening
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,791	| IOT025 |	Emailing everybody I do on that page
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,327	| IOT025 |	Are you home yet certified all of a sudden
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,631	| IOT025 |	And basically everyone came back
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,911	| IOT025 |	Me and said
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,191	| IOT025 |	No not yet but we will be
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,215	| IOT025 |	Stay tuned
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,055	| IOT025 |	A lot of the results like Phillips for exam
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| IOT025 |	The makers of the Hue Lights
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:37,151	| IOT025 |	They actually updated their developer page
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:43,295	| IOT025 |	The day before or maybe it's two days before the Apple event saying that they would be releasing a new SDK for Developers
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,087	| IOT025 |	Before October
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:48,927	| IOT025 |	So they were hoping sometime in September and before October
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:54,559	| IOT025 |	And my hunch is that that's going to have homekit support so we should see Phillips hopefully before October
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,863	| IOT025 |	Anticipating that
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,911	| IOT025 |	We should see idevices switch actually made
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,215	| IOT025 |	Splash at CES
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,031	| IOT025 |	Maybe even connectsense
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,591	| IOT025 |	Have devices very soon
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,127	| IOT025 |	They're homekit certified
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,639	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,431	| IOT025 |	At this point
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:14,271	| IOT025 |	The insteon the newest insteon Hub is homekit certified
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,551	| IOT025 |	The insteon
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:16,831	| IOT025 |	They have a hub
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:24,511	| IOT025 |	Sorry I'm trying to think of who has hugs at our home gets her to find I can't think of any others but you may know some
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| IOT025 |	And Neutron both have
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,559	| IOT025 |	Subs that are certified
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,863	| IOT025 |	And
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:33,983	| IOT025 |	That is if it's elegado has a sensor Bluetooth sensor kit that is
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,519	| IOT025 |	Certified and then ecobee
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,311	| IOT025 |	As its
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:42,943	| IOT025 |	Thermostat ecobee 3 thermostat that is homekit certified
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,759	| IOT025 |	They've been the same for products for the last
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,319	| IOT025 |	3ish months I would say
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,903	| IOT025 |	And nothing else is come on
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:55,743	| IOT025 |	It is now default time frame so we are expecting some new ones
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,767	| IOT025 |	Yay
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:00,607	| IOT025 |	Reaching out to people that that time frame seems to be reasonable
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:05,727	| IOT025 |	I have seen though that some companies have actually pulled back
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,519	| IOT025 |	From certification so Lake
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:11,615	| IOT025 |	We talked to Alex Hawkinson a couple weeks ago in the podcast and
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,663	| IOT025 |	They actually did not get there
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| IOT025 |	Home hub
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,199	| IOT025 |	Certified
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:15,967	| IOT025 |	With SmartThings
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,783	| IOT025 |	They may one day do that but they aren't
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,807	| IOT025 |	Going that route right now
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:26,207	| IOT025 |	Ian said that he had told Mashable in an interview that he'd prefer to cover the open route
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,999	| IOT025 |	Yeah so that's that
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,791	| IOT025 |	So you know
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,303	| IOT025 |	That was kind of
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,607	| IOT025 |	I'm surprised they will still support iOS
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| IOT025 |	And you know
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,447	| IOT025 |	Maybe one day they can always add
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,983	| IOT025 |	Hardware for
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,007	| IOT025 |	It support if they were
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,823	| IOT025 |	So we'll see
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:44,895	| IOT025 |	So that's the homekit news for everybody who is like me in
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,175	| IOT025 |	I can't wait
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,479	| IOT025 |	Equating
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,247	| IOT025 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,527	| IOT025 |	Maybe you'll see
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:54,111	| IOT025 |	Maybe next week is the week that I will be able to try
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,975	| IOT025 |	It didn't even get a mention with the Apple TV which
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:03,839	| IOT025 |	If you go to Apple support site for the Apple TV it says it is a homekit gateway for remote access
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:08,703	| IOT025 |	It's not the only one who can do it also through iCloud from what I'm hearing and things up
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:12,031	| IOT025 |	That is true that that's one of the things that
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,543	| IOT025 |	That I've been
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,615	| IOT025 |	That was one of the things that
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,127	| IOT025 |	I was kind of a sticky
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| IOT025 |	All right
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:25,343	| IOT025 |	Let's see what else have we learned this week isps are adding third-party devices which is good if you
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,623	| IOT025 |	Rely on
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:31,231	| IOT025 |	Comcast or AT&T to provide your home automation setup or you're interested in going to
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,815	| IOT025 |	Comcast or AT&T to get a home automation setup
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,399	| IOT025 |	Because they do have that Network installers and they will do it for you
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| IOT025 |	So yeah
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:43,775	| IOT025 |	Comcast has added Chamberlain garage door opener to MyQ
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,567	| IOT025 |	Iona
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,335	| IOT025 |	In love
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| IOT025 |	Chewits
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:52,223	| IOT025 |	Network of third-party devices it's also going to add sometime next year the Arlo
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:56,063	| IOT025 |	Camera which is from Netgear this is actually a wireless camera
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:59,135	| IOT025 |	The wireless camera that can go inside or out
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:02,975	| IOT025 |	Side and an AT&T their Digital Life home they are going to support the nest
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,511	| IOT025 |	They don't have as many
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,071	| IOT025 |	Devices is Comcast is supporting
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,399	| IOT025 |	Comcast is now going to support through Xfinity home 11 devices
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:18,079	| IOT025 |	Correct me if I'm wrong Xfinity home platform users out there but I don't believe any of them are actually supported
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| IOT025 |	Today
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,919	| IOT025 |	Believe support is coming in the next few weeks for most of them
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,967	| IOT025 |	I think it's a good solution for people who are like
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:29,855	| IOT025 |	I kind of want something cool devices out there but I really don't want to install a bunch of motion sensors and other stuff in my house
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,391	| IOT025 |	Yeah like
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:37,791	| IOT025 |	I get what you're saying and I know that again I said I was before you and I are edge cases would rather get her roller sleeves up and break up the toolbar
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| IOT025 |	Boxing install these things
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,607	| IOT025 |	It's getting to the point where
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:45,983	| IOT025 |	It's not that difficult to install these things and if it is then there's something wrong with the product itself I think
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:52,127	| IOT025 |	Yeah and Comcast has charge like $40 a month but with that $40 a month you do get monitored security
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,663	| IOT025 |	And a lot of people are really excited
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,687	| IOT025 |	Like that so
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,247	| IOT025 |	I can't not people for
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,551	| IOT025 |	You know I know
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,879	| IOT025 |	I just spent like 2 hours this weekend playing with freaking light
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,463	| IOT025 |	There are get it
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:14,399	| IOT025 |	Lucy Samsung they have a new
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,423	| IOT025 |	A new access point
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,191	| IOT025 |	Tell us about that
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:21,823	| IOT025 |	We don't know too much yet because there's nothing that I could find on Samsung's official new site or anyting
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,871	| IOT025 |	Whoever is this Korea
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,151	| IOT025 |	Which is based in
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,663	| IOT025 |	What do you think
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| IOT025 |	I'm going with South Korea
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,223	| IOT025 |	You are correct
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:31,551	| IOT025 |	They have put out a story that on the 14th
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,111	| IOT025 |	September Samsung released an iot access point
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,671	| IOT025 |	That has the support with three radios
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| IOT025 |	Zigbee
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,463	| IOT025 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,999	| IOT025 |	An Bluetooth
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,559	| IOT025 |	Wi-Fi is 802 11 AC
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,607	| IOT025 |	Say it sounds to me like this is
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:50,751	| IOT025 |	I want to say it this is kind of like an Uber access point because they already make access points for your home network
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:54,335	| IOT025 |	And they're able to 11ac access point so they will
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:58,431	| IOT025 |	Extend your current Network further to get onto the nooks and crannies of your house
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,015	| IOT025 |	It seems to me like this is the same thing only data Bluetooth
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,295	| IOT025 |	Nzb
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,343	| IOT025 |	To help with iot
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,903	| IOT025 |	Networking site coverage as well in your home
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,695	| IOT025 |	And I thought this was going to be accessed
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| IOT025 |	Picacho car if you
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,583	| IOT025 |	So yes that's exactly what this
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,375	| IOT025 |	Siri can do that for you
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,143	| IOT025 |	Siri
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,423	| IOT025 |	That'd be a really fun thing
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| IOT025 |	High breathalyzer
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| IOT025 |	2 Series sew in
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| IOT025 |	Take the breathalyzer
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:28,383	| IOT025 |	If this then that if this is what alcohol level is greater than .08
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:33,503	| IOT025 |	Contact Yellow Cab Company and send my location
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,831	| IOT025 |	That baby
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,623	| IOT025 |	Make it so
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,159	| IOT025 |	Desiree
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:43,487	| IOT025 |	That's really all we know about this but I like the fact that
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:47,839	| IOT025 |	Companies in surprise that Samsung mean they're making a big iot push right now
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,887	| IOT025 |	I like the type of companies are
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| IOT025 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:56,031	| IOT025 |	Creating additional useful radios in traditional devices access points for example for Wi-Fi networks
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,103	| IOT025 |	This week is dreamforce which is like
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:02,175	| IOT025 |	Someone said it's the Super Bowl of it conferences
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| IOT025 |	Fair enough
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:09,599	| IOT025 |	I would agree considering that it when it's in town in San Francisco I mean they shut down so blocks
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,135	| IOT025 |	Yeah I went stayed in like
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,927	| IOT025 |	The crappiest Hotel I've ever stayed at
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,207	| IOT025 |	Because
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:14,975	| IOT025 |	For same here
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,023	| IOT025 |	It was like a blanket on top of a card
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,535	| IOT025 |	Box
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,119	| IOT025 |	It was 50
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,007	| IOT025 |	Alright so Salesforce introduce today it's
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,031	| IOT025 |	Iot cloud
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,847	| IOT025 |	And that is iot cloud with a
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,359	| IOT025 |	Kelsey
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,919	| IOT025 |	And what this is basically
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,711	| IOT025 |	It's a data Repository
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,991	| IOT025 |	So what you do is
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:41,087	| IOT025 |	Companies can send their data through any of the Salesforce
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,879	| IOT025 |	Apps so any of the apps
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,695	| IOT025 |	I said so if you got Salesforce running if your company
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,743	| IOT025 |	You can have it all of your
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,559	| IOT025 |	Salesforce data going into this iot cloud
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,583	| IOT025 |	If any of your
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,375	| IOT025 |	Force.com apps
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| IOT025 |	Can also
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| IOT025 |	Center data in there
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,215	| IOT025 |	And it can link up with other
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,007	| IOT025 |	Companies that also are using
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,311	| IOT025 |	Salesforce and iot Cloud
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:06,175	| IOT025 |	So it's very similar in concept to something IBM actually launched a year ago
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,455	| IOT025 |	Called
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,735	| IOT025 |	Iot Foundation
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,783	| IOT025 |	They're really good with these names
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,623	| IOT025 |	Like I said I can't mock this because I have something
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,391	| IOT025 |	Called the iot podcast
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,719	| IOT025 |	Salesforce's iot cloud
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,255	| IOT025 |	IBM's iot foundation
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,327	| IOT025 |	And pussy Salesforce has partnered with Cisco
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,887	| IOT025 |	Dively which is a very
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| IOT025 |	LogMeIn product
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,495	| IOT025 |	And all of these are very enterprise-focused
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:31,519	| IOT025 |	And
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:35,103	| IOT025 |	It's basically a place where you can run a lot of data analytics
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,615	| IOT025 |	Really quickly
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:38,431	| IOT025 |	And I'm trying to think what else people might want to know about the
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,967	| IOT025 |	What would you want to know about this
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:42,527	| IOT025 |	Well it's Enterprise so probably not much
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:49,439	| IOT025 |	I don't know I'm kind of surprised that Salesforce is getting into iot it just doesn't seem like a
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:49,951	| IOT025 |	Natural
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:56,351	| IOT025 |	A natural fit horses love the internet of things since time immemorial because really
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,167	| IOT025 |	What they can do I mean this is all about data
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:02,239	| IOT025 |	And The Internet of Things is all about making
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,031	| IOT025 |	Your data accessible
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,055	| IOT025 |	All to you
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| IOT025 |	Collecting all this data from customers anyway
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:10,431	| IOT025 |	And now it's basically to try to find a way to monetize
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,711	| IOT025 |	August 8th
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,223	| IOT025 |	And
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,527	| IOT025 |	Then offer people
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:18,111	| IOT025 |	Once it's got the data in there at connect let you buy additional software
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,903	| IOT025 |	So you can see the data
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,927	| IOT025 |	So you can analyze
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,975	| IOT025 |	It's all about the money
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,815	| IOT025 |	It is the nice thing is once you have is data in there
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:30,143	| IOT025 |	You can offer people infinite services to like let them
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,423	| IOT025 |	Do things with a
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,263	| IOT025 |	People aren't going to want to lose that data all around
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| IOT025 |	And
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,311	| IOT025 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:41,151	| IOT025 |	Garage Motel rate once it's in there you really don't want to let it out
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:47,807	| IOT025 |	And because it's Salesforce and you got a million other people and companies using this data
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,087	| IOT025 |	If you have someone else
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,623	| IOT025 |	If I make widgets
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,903	| IOT025 |	And you make
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,439	| IOT025 |	Okay let's not use which
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,975	| IOT025 |	Craigslist
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,999	| IOT025 |	Pekin actual price
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,559	| IOT025 |	So let me make light bulbs
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,351	| IOT025 |	Jose I make light bulbs
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| IOT025 |	What's in you make
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,143	| IOT025 |	Lamps
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,447	| IOT025 |	So we have a partnership
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,239	| IOT025 |	Because my light bulbs are really great in your land
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,311	| IOT025 |	I can start sending you data
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,847	| IOT025 |	About my light bulbs in
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:14,431	| IOT025 |	I'm sure you would probably send me your data about the customers buying
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| IOT025 |	Your lamps
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,503	| IOT025 |	I can share
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:20,319	| IOT025 |	The dated about the light bulbs that fit in your lamps
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| IOT025 |	With you
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,927	| IOT025 |	And you can share the data about the customers buying your lamps
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,439	| IOT025 |	With my light bulbs
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:31,839	| IOT025 |	And we can actually only share that sub segments of data that relates to our shared partnership base
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,887	| IOT025 |	Basically in bills like really
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:38,239	| IOT025 |	Partnerships or sales strategies around it
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,799	| IOT025 |	And that's a great business tool
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,127	| IOT025 |	That's kind of what Salesforce is trying to sell
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| IOT025 |	I was kind of a
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| IOT025 |	I don't know if that was a great
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:53,855	| IOT025 |	No no I get it I get it now I just surprise me I don't think of them as a kind of company in iot company but I probably should
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,647	| IOT025 |	Considering all the big data that they handle
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,439	| IOT025 |	You know I have to use going to
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:00,767	| IOT025 |	Lots and lots and lots of little bits of data and it's going to be
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,095	| IOT025 |	Hard to manage that into something useful so
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,679	| IOT025 |	Speak about it like nobody wants to be a lamp come
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,983	| IOT025 |	They want to be a Services Company
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,543	| IOT025 |	And that date is going to allow you to then
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| IOT025 |	Offer people services
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:19,455	| IOT025 |	What's wrong with you being a limb company because lamp companies they just sell a product once you want to get
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,479	| IOT025 |	Recurring Revenue
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,551	| IOT025 |	That's why the cords break after 3 months
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,623	| IOT025 |	Oh come on built-in obsolescence
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,159	| IOT025 |	Come on alright
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,559	| IOT025 |	I think it's time though
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,351	| IOT025 |	For the onhub router
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:39,423	| IOT025 |	Because I really want to hear
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,703	| IOT025 |	Got to say about this
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,007	| IOT025 |	Goodwill and ordered it
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:49,407	| IOT025 |	Literally right before he started the prior show week ago it was supposed to be here in 2 days and it came after the next day
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:49,919	| IOT025 |	It was awesome
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:53,247	| IOT025 |	Thank you bestbuy.com I did buy this out of pocket
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,551	| IOT025 |	I got to say after having setup
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:17:00,671	| IOT025 |	Taylor modems and routers and bridges and hubs for the past however many years
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| IOT025 |	This was by far the
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,487	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| IOT025 |	Google
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,815	| IOT025 |	Kudos you have succeeded in that area
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,863	| IOT025 |	It was drafted Temple Italy from
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,959	| IOT025 |	The time I open the box till the time I had the network up and running
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:13,471	| IOT025 |	What's 5 minutes
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,751	| IOT025 |	That was it
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,031	| IOT025 |	Super simple
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,567	| IOT025 |	Super Simple Songs
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:22,943	| IOT025 |	Onhub app is available for IOS and Android I had an iPhone in my hand at a time so
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,735	| IOT025 |	I use my iPhone very simple
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:31,135	| IOT025 |	You actually you actually set it up like the echo your how you connect a device to
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:34,975	| IOT025 |	To the echo via Wi-Fi to set up the Echoes Wi-Fi
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,511	| IOT025 |	You do the same thing here
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:43,167	| IOT025 |	Got it. That's how you set up a Wi-Fi network on the onhub router you actually connected Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi Direct
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,471	| IOT025 |	To set it up in terms of
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:45,983	| IOT025 |	Using the app
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:53,151	| IOT025 |	You can only set up one network and I actually have multiple networks on my prior router so that was a little
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,455	| IOT025 |	Disappointing the reason I do that is probably
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:18:00,575	| IOT025 |	Not something everybody needs because I do video show that I co-host on Wednesdays
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:04,927	| IOT025 |	I have a dedicated Network just for my online video
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,231	| IOT025 |	Cleanscapes Connection in Summit
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:10,815	| IOT025 |	Actually cheated was using that for my 4K video streaming as well bits
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:16,447	| IOT025 |	Regardless I just have one network out that Ashley brings a little more Simplicity as well because now everybody in the house is like
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:20,031	| IOT025 |	Do I connect to a or b they don't ask me that anymore there's just one network
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,615	| IOT025 |	One of the downsides and I'm finding is that it's a little too simple
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| IOT025 |	You can't
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:28,735	| IOT025 |	Really control things and I know you would ask this question we talked about this
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,551	| IOT025 |	Before there's no parental controls you can't say
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,831	| IOT025 |	Limitless device
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:39,487	| IOT025 |	To access the internet until 10 p.m. after that it can't go out so you couldn't shut off the kids devices for sample
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:42,047	| IOT025 |	The only thing you can do on a device level
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:44,351	| IOT025 |	AC in real time and historically
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| IOT025 |	How much
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,911	| IOT025 |	Been with her using up and down
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,215	| IOT025 |	And you can actually prioritize
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:52,031	| IOT025 |	Traffic fast track it is what it called it to a device
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:56,127	| IOT025 |	For a set amount of time so if I know I'm going to be watching 4K TV
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,175	| IOT025 |	And I don't want anybody to mess with my stream
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,735	| IOT025 |	I prioritize the TV
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,759	| IOT025 |	That way I got the best connection
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:05,343	| IOT025 |	That's about it there's not a lot of advanced features here
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:10,207	| IOT025 |	Are people who are tinkering with the routers installing your own firmware this is not a device for you
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:12,767	| IOT025 |	This is more for a mainstream home
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:16,351	| IOT025 |	That may have not great coverage or not have the fastest
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,119	| IOT025 |	Speeds
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,655	| IOT025 |	Tenda WiFi router
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,167	| IOT025 |	Because
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:25,823	| IOT025 |	Contrary to some of the reports on reading I'm having no problems with coverage and signal and Steve it's actually working
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,639	| IOT025 |	Better than my old 802 11 AC router is that was
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,663	| IOT025 |	I thought that 2 years ago
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,223	| IOT025 |	So I'm very happy with the performance
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:38,367	| IOT025 |	I think some people will be disappointed in that it's not Advance you can't do too much to it or with it
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:42,719	| IOT025 |	And yes it is limited to only have one available ethernet port
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:46,303	| IOT025 |	I actually thought I was going to use that for a smart home hub but I'm not
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:50,655	| IOT025 |	I forgot I have a network printer that I connected with her either not to router
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,959	| IOT025 |	So that's what's taking up my extra
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:53,983	| IOT025 |	Ewnetwork
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,543	| IOT025 |	Luckily the wink Hub that I use
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:20:02,175	| IOT025 |	Runs over Wi-Fi so it doesn't need to be connected to a router so I didn't lose any smart home functionality as a result of that
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,223	| IOT025 |	Philips Hue hub
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:10,623	| IOT025 |	Which is not working right now because I don't have a place to put it yes I can get a bridge and all that but you know out of the box
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,903	| IOT025 |	You're right I'm I'm kind of stuck
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| IOT025 |	Maybe I'll send you a switch
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,815	| IOT025 |	This was a hundred and was it 199
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:24,447	| IOT025 |	It is 199 99 I know I've got to return. With Best Buy that I can send it back but
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,007	| IOT025 |	I don't think I will I mean it looks nice but then again
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,799	| IOT025 |	My Broadband comes in
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,567	| IOT025 |	In the
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,847	| IOT025 |	Second floor
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:33,151	| IOT025 |	In a far corner of the home so nobody can see this
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:36,479	| IOT025 |	If I have a broadband connection the middle of my home
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,271	| IOT025 |	Yeah I need this thing out looks great
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,295	| IOT025 |	But I don't
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:41,343	| IOT025 |	Okay and you've got a
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:43,391	| IOT025 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,671	| IOT025 |	An Amazon Echo so
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,719	| IOT025 |	Next to the echo
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| IOT025 |	Is it the same size
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,279	| IOT025 |	It looks just like
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,327	| IOT025 |	Yeah it's it's shorter
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,607	| IOT025 |	And it's wider
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:56,191	| IOT025 |	And the Ridley does have a ring of light at the top just like the echo does but
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| IOT025 |	That ring is always on
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:02,335	| IOT025 |	And that's because it has four different colors to tell you am in setup mode and BM
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:05,151	| IOT025 |	Working fine or see there's a problem and so on so
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,711	| IOT025 |	Again it's hassle-free
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:10,527	| IOT025 |	I don't need to switch networks when I'm having problems I don't need to
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,807	| IOT025 |	Seek out the best network
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:12,831	| IOT025 |	It's all just happening
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,879	| IOT025 |	And I have no complaints
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,928	| IOT025 |	I want to say full disclosure
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| IOT025 |	There are so many variables
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,768	| IOT025 |	Two wireless network signals that
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:24,608	| IOT025 |	What is working well in my house at my architecture and my setup
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,400	| IOT025 |	May not work for everybody I just
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| IOT025 |	I got to say that because
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:30,752	| IOT025 |	I don't want people thinking this is going to be the best thing since sliced bread
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,824	| IOT025 |	And they have no Faraday cages are at their house and it's not working so
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,128	| IOT025 |	But those of you who live in tinfoil houses
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,992	| IOT025 |	Boat Fender tip about buying from Best Buy with a good sword
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,552	| IOT025 |	Return policy and restocking fee
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:49,184	| IOT025 |	Oh I don't think so I don't think I've ever paid a restock fee
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:51,744	| IOT025 |	Alright Kevin thank you and

EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,984	| IOT025 |	And Paul
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,264	| IOT025 |	Thanks for coming on the show today
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:36,800	| IOT025 |	I'm happy to be here
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,848	| IOT025 |	I'm really excited to have you here
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,616	| IOT025 |	Because
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:43,712	| IOT025 |	I follow you on Twitter and you get into some really interesting discussions and
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,296	| IOT025 |	Unlike some of them are a little above my head so I'm going to have you
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,136	| IOT025 |	Probably keep it down a notch at the hits ale People level for me
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,696	| IOT025 |	But I go I go all levels
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,280	| IOT025 |	All levels all layers of the stack
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,816	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,888	| IOT025 |	Let's just get it started with kind of let's frame the issue
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:05,728	| IOT025 |	Because I know my issue with identity and then another thing
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,496	| IOT025 |	Switches
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,520	| IOT025 |	Well there's there's a couple
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:08,800	| IOT025 |	My issue is
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:09,824	| IOT025 |	1
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:12,128	| IOT025 |	I find it very hard
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:12,640	| IOT025 |	2
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:13,920	| IOT025 |	Enter
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:16,736	| IOT025 |	My identity and password across
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,552	| IOT025 |	Like the 30 to 40 devices that I've got
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:21,856	| IOT025 |	I got different passwords for different Services cuz
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,672	| IOT025 |	God help me I know I'm not supposed to have the same password
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,440	| IOT025 |	Search for everything right
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,744	| IOT025 |	That in theory and Theory
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,792	| IOT025 |	I'm going to confess that
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:32,608	| IOT025 |	I have a certain limited number of passwords
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,376	| IOT025 |	It's because
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,144	| IOT025 |	Your humans
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,448	| IOT025 |	I am human I'm not a machine
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:40,288	| IOT025 |	And I don't have like one password or any of those things running on all my devices
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,336	| IOT025 |	That's
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,616	| IOT025 |	I don't do they even do that
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:48,736	| IOT025 |	No I don't think of you right girl optimized for the web We Have Nots
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:51,296	| IOT025 |	That's one issue that I know I have I'm like
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,832	| IOT025 |	I feel kind of guilty about it
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,880	| IOT025 |	So there's that
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,160	| IOT025 |	But there's also
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,184	| IOT025 |	The issue of
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,720	| IOT025 |	The identity of
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:02,816	| IOT025 |	There's my identity but then there's other people who are accessing these devices
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,352	| IOT025 |	And I have to share my
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:08,960	| IOT025 |	Current passwords for some of these devices with them and sometimes they get their own password
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,728	| IOT025 |	Depending on the device
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:10,752	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:12,032	| IOT025 |	There's like
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| IOT025 |	My family's idea
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:14,848	| IOT025 |	And there's also
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,616	| IOT025 |	Guess I did
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,152	| IOT025 |	And I don't know if we're going to talk about that on the show
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:22,784	| IOT025 |	Play I hope we do because it's yeah let me know if those use cases are going to become more and more important
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:26,112	| IOT025 |	And as you say sharing a password
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| IOT025 |	Weather for you
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,160	| IOT025 |	Wifi router alert
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,464	| IOT025 |	For that things in your house
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:33,536	| IOT025 |	Doesn't scale well maybe it works when it's just your rotor
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:38,144	| IOT025 |	But when you want to allow your houseguests to play through your
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,680	| IOT025 |	Sound system
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,960	| IOT025 |	Can you connect two speakers
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,752	| IOT025 |	Beginning of your
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,872	| IOT025 |	Can you search he's got a couple of points
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,688	| IOT025 |	Ux constraints
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,456	| IOT025 |	These things and
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,272	| IOT025 |	And as bad as passwords are
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,064	| IOT025 |	Typing into websites
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:59,904	| IOT025 |	And now they're infinitely worse if you have to try to enter them directly in
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:05,280	| IOT025 |	Yeah. There's one issue how do we get around the usability
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,048	| IOT025 |	Limitations
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,352	| IOT025 |	Clearly that
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,888	| IOT025 |	Songs that we have
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,400	| IOT025 |	Offer
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,960	| IOT025 |	Something there right we are going to be
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,264	| IOT025 |	Used to connecting
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:17,056	| IOT025 |	Devices and things
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,360	| IOT025 |	With the assistance of our phones
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:21,408	| IOT025 |	So there's opportunities there
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,944	| IOT025 |	Far easier to
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,480	| IOT025 |	Buying
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:26,784	| IOT025 |	Non-existing identity to a device
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,064	| IOT025 |	Leave your phone
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:31,904	| IOT025 |	Trying to type it directly into your thermostat or what have you
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,000	| IOT025 |	But separately from just the pain passwords and entering them
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:38,816	| IOT025 |	Is Sir the reality or the recognition that
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:41,632	| IOT025 |	I don't always want to have to create a new identity
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,168	| IOT025 |	For everything
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,960	| IOT025 |	I bring into the house
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:48,544	| IOT025 |	We've been through that on the web right where every site
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,824	| IOT025 |	45 years ago
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:53,664	| IOT025 |	Command that you create your own account unique account with
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,944	| IOT025 |	Usernames and passwords are
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,760	| IOT025 |	And just the number of accounts
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,552	| IOT025 |	That implies for users
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,600	| IOT025 |	Dragon scale on the web
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:04,672	| IOT025 |	So we count ways to use existing ID
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,464	| IOT025 |	To get into application
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:08,000	| IOT025 |	Can I take that model
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,280	| IOT025 |	Is going to be necessary
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,816	| IOT025 |	On the iot as well
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:14,656	| IOT025 |	Rather than create a new account for some
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:20,032	| IOT025 |	Speaker or light bulb when I bring it into the house I'm going to be able to use my
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,824	| IOT025 |	Existing identity
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:26,432	| IOT025 |	Either out of social provider like a Facebook or Google or maybe some
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,456	| IOT025 |	Iot platform
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:27,968	| IOT025 |	I've already
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,760	| IOT025 |	Soda created
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,040	| IOT025 |	Start a relationship with
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:31,808	| IOT025 |	You're my provider
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,624	| IOT025 |	Okay so we're talking about something like
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,440	| IOT025 |	Lego watch which is like hell Facebook
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| IOT025 |	Twitter
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:39,744	| IOT025 |	That's what they use right
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,768	| IOT025 |	2
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:41,792	| IOT025 |	Facebook
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:44,608	| IOT025 |	Exactly that sort of experience
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,888	| IOT025 |	Login with app
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,424	| IOT025 |	We're exes
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,448	| IOT025 |	Some providers
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,728	| IOT025 |	I already feel comfortable with
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,032	| IOT025 |	Should have already invested in the relationship
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,568	| IOT025 |	You want to use their
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,104	| IOT025 |	Version of you
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:57,152	| IOT025 |	To interact with that thing rather than something new
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,712	| IOT025 |	No I already do that with
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,992	| IOT025 |	A bunch of my device
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:07,136	| IOT025 |	What's interesting is I'm not just logging into these devices but I'm also giving certain
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,904	| IOT025 |	Permissions
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| IOT025 |	To those
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:12,512	| IOT025 |	Like what will go to examples because
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,304	| IOT025 |	What is the easiest thing in the world
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,328	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,632	| IOT025 |	I log into
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,936	| IOT025 |	My Nest thermostat and they have
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,752	| IOT025 |	Works with Nest their developer program
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,288	| IOT025 |	Bright and when I
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:27,104	| IOT025 |	Link my Nest thermostat to
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,128	| IOT025 |	My
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,176	| IOT025 |	Wink hub for example
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,224	| IOT025 |	I log into my
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,992	| IOT025 |	Nest
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:33,760	| IOT025 |	Tlingit
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,528	| IOT025 |	To my wink
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,808	| IOT025 |	Home hub
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,088	| IOT025 |	And when I do that
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,368	| IOT025 |	I'm giving
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,416	| IOT025 |	The wink system of variety of
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:42,208	| IOT025 |	Permissions associated with the nest
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,768	| IOT025 |	We can see the temperature
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:45,792	| IOT025 |	It lets me I think
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,840	| IOT025 |	Turn it up and down from the
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:51,168	| IOT025 |	Wink app as opposed to the nest app
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,704	| IOT025 |	Write in a get certain
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,240	| IOT025 |	Can a data access
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,288	| IOT025 |	Permissions but it also doesn't get
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:56,800	| IOT025 |	Other things
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| IOT025 |	Right now today though
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| IOT025 |	I'm not exactly clear
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,200	| IOT025 |	In all cases
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:05,504	| IOT025 |	What it can and can't do
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,016	| IOT025 |	In like
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:10,368	| IOT025 |	I know for example but I'm authorizing a Twitter app for example
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| IOT025 |	Or signing in with Twitter
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,952	| IOT025 |	A lot of the time I can see what it
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,976	| IOT025 |	Can and can't do
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,280	| IOT025 |	I don't actually get that right now
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,328	| IOT025 |	With everything at the device level
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:23,680	| IOT025 |	Consider two points that sort of disability into
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,984	| IOT025 |	Permissions you've assigned it is critical
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:29,312	| IOT025 |	Sell Twitter Facebook Google me I'll give you a page where you can
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,872	| IOT025 |	CD other apps that you
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:32,896	| IOT025 |	Connected
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:36,224	| IOT025 |	And you know what you dig deeper what permissions you've given them
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:39,808	| IOT025 |	And I give you the ability to revoke those permissions
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,856	| IOT025 |	And that's that's kind of
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,904	| IOT025 |	You get that for free with with a loss
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,184	| IOT025 |	If
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,464	| IOT025 |	The Google and Facebook
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:48,000	| IOT025 |	Choose to implement that model
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,816	| IOT025 |	Now what you described when you connect wink
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,096	| IOT025 |	Two-ness
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:52,864	| IOT025 |	Right
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,376	| IOT025 |	Believe
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,168	| IOT025 |	You're actually doing is
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,448	| IOT025 |	Is your connecting
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,216	| IOT025 |	The wink
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:57,728	| IOT025 |	Cloud
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,264	| IOT025 |	To the nest cloud
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:02,080	| IOT025 |	So you're using your using a wasp
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:02,592	| IOT025 |	Queen
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,152	| IOT025 |	Two servers right Andrew
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:08,992	| IOT025 |	Pub talks with Cloud through some proprietary
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,040	| IOT025 |	Identity mechanism
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:13,600	| IOT025 |	And the nest thermostat does the same up to its cloud
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:16,160	| IOT025 |	And then to Cloud your sugar glue together with or
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,952	| IOT025 |	Which is powerful
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:20,000	| IOT025 |	But you still created multiple identity
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,072	| IOT025 |	It's just sort of the permissions layer that they
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,376	| IOT025 |	Giving you two to control permission
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,192	| IOT025 |	You know I think that model
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:29,984	| IOT025 |	Using something like or
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,288	| IOT025 |	More generally
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,056	| IOT025 |	Delegated
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,080	| IOT025 |	Authorization
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,360	| IOT025 |	We can also try that
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,408	| IOT025 |	Right down to the things themselves
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,968	| IOT025 |	And and not necessarily rely on
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,248	| IOT025 |	The cloud for
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:42,016	| IOT025 |	Hooking everything up
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:45,856	| IOT025 |	Oh okay so that's a very subtle distinction that even I hadn't thought of
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,648	| IOT025 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,928	| IOT025 |	Just a matter of
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,208	| IOT025 |	Who gets
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:50,976	| IOT025 |	Token
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,768	| IOT025 |	That is going to be presented on
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:53,792	| IOT025 |	On all these interactions
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,584	| IOT025 |	And how you got it
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,912	| IOT025 |	So then in that case what happens is
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:02,752	| IOT025 |	Devices themselves each generate a token
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:06,848	| IOT025 |	Albany not generated something with generate it
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,384	| IOT025 |	For them but then they would
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,920	| IOT025 |	Issued ID
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,456	| IOT025 |	And somehow they would
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,760	| IOT025 |	Get that token stored away in their own
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,040	| IOT025 |	Secure Storage
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,832	| IOT025 |	Can I use that
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,368	| IOT025 |	Whenever they need to
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,904	| IOT025 |	Interact or Fennekin
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:21,440	| IOT025 |	Something else whether that's
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,232	| IOT025 |	In another device
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,000	| IOT025 |	In the home
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| IOT025 |	Maybe it's
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:27,072	| IOT025 |	The router maybe it's some
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,352	| IOT025 |	Third-party cloud service
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:32,448	| IOT025 |	So before we get into the token because that's going to get a little technical
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:35,776	| IOT025 |	Let's talk about what this looks like then
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,800	| IOT025 |	In the real world
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:42,688	| IOT025 |	The theoretical real world where we have these tokens and lots of things so
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:45,248	| IOT025 |	Help me understand what this might look like in my house
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:46,528	| IOT025 |	Where I have
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,552	| IOT025 |	You know sensors and
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:50,368	| IOT025 |	Today actually my sensors
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,392	| IOT025 |	Connect to
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,184	| IOT025 |	Cubs in
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:57,792	| IOT025 |	The onboarding process is usually through like as a zigbee radio so I'm pairing them
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:00,096	| IOT025 |	There's an authentication process
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:08,032	| IOT025 |	Yes and you don't necessarily when you bring up a new device into the home you got to get it onto the network weather
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,592	| IOT025 |	Wi-Fi so
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:13,920	| IOT025 |	That's one secret or one credential
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,224	| IOT025 |	The bootstrap
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,272	| IOT025 |	On to the network before that
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,808	| IOT025 |	Viceland
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,112	| IOT025 |	Do anything else whether talking to the
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,648	| IOT025 |	The cloud or just staying local
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:25,440	| IOT025 |	So I think
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,720	| IOT025 |	Clearly
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,280	| IOT025 |	NFC or rble
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,560	| IOT025 |	Different ways where we go
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:32,352	| IOT025 |	Bootstrap that credential
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:34,656	| IOT025 |	That the Wi-Fi credential or or similar
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,936	| IOT025 |	Aunt advice
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,032	| IOT025 |	But the next hurdle for that singing
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:41,824	| IOT025 |	When you say bootstrap that
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,104	| IOT025 |	Credential
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,384	| IOT025 |	Right is that me
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,712	| IOT025 |	Ultimately we got to give
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,480	| IOT025 |	To the new device
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,552	| IOT025 |	If you're trying to hook it onto your Wi-Fi
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,832	| IOT025 |	You got to give it
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:53,856	| IOT025 |	Either the password
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,648	| IOT025 |	For the Wi-Fi network
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:58,208	| IOT025 |	And there's various ways you can do that everybody
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,512	| IOT025 |	Kingsville hit dented their own whether it's
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,560	| IOT025 |	An ad hoc WiFi
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,352	| IOT025 |	Network that you connect
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,888	| IOT025 |	Via an app on the device
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,936	| IOT025 |	That's the means by which you
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:08,704	| IOT025 |	Provision
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,728	| IOT025 |	The real Network
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:10,240	| IOT025 |	Credential
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:13,824	| IOT025 |	The flashing lights
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:15,360	| IOT025 |	But some people have or
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:18,688	| IOT025 |	I know that I've got some security systems that I've done that have like
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:20,992	| IOT025 |	Some audio cable thing that
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:23,040	| IOT025 |	It's like highly secure in magical
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,088	| IOT025 |	Right okay I see what you're
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:28,672	| IOT025 |	Flashing lights are typically away of
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:33,280	| IOT025 |	Helping you validate that you were actually connecting to the thing you think you are
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,048	| IOT025 |	Because there's
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,584	| IOT025 |	There's an opportunity for someone
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,144	| IOT025 |	This way to insert themselves into that protest
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,424	| IOT025 |	Get on to the network
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:45,056	| IOT025 |	But you've got to get it onto the network before it can start talking to the other devices
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,848	| IOT025 |	Let's go to the first
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:47,872	| IOT025 |	Authentication challenge
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,432	| IOT025 |	But arguably a bigger one
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,200	| IOT025 |	Maybe there's
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:54,272	| IOT025 |	Chance for optimization in the future where
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,112	| IOT025 |	Typically you
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,648	| IOT025 |	You've got to tell that device
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,184	| IOT025 |	What
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:01,696	| IOT025 |	Count
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,256	| IOT025 |	When you already have it when you chew
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:05,024	| IOT025 |	Shut up
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,816	| IOT025 |	With the corresponding provider
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:09,120	| IOT025 |	Q light bulb
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:12,192	| IOT025 |	Set it up with a new account
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,008	| IOT025 |	Currently
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,312	| IOT025 |	The reality is
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,080	| IOT025 |	You know you're going to
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,104	| IOT025 |	Download the app
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,640	| IOT025 |	That is specific
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:23,456	| IOT025 |	Take two that lines light bulbs are that device
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:27,808	| IOT025 |	You're going to create an account in the app you're going to log into the app
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,088	| IOT025 |	And then.
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,904	| IOT025 |	Different mechanism
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:33,952	| IOT025 |	Connect you
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,256	| IOT025 |	That account you just created
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,536	| IOT025 |	To the device the light bulb
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:45,216	| IOT025 |	Ceremony or that experience for the user presumes that they're willing to create a new account
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:46,752	| IOT025 |	That you aren't supposed to
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:50,336	| IOT025 |	No using an existing account
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:51,616	| IOT025 |	Some other
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:52,896	| IOT025 |	Platform provider
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:53,408	| IOT025 |	Whenever it's
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:54,944	| IOT025 |	Apples
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,968	| IOT025 |	Coyote calls
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,272	| IOT025 |	Platform on Google store
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,856	| IOT025 |	Brightlight listeners I have
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:05,184	| IOT025 |	I'm probably going to stay at least 60 of those based on
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,208	| IOT025 |	The devices I have
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT025 |	Tried out
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,024	| IOT025 |	Closing those accounts
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,304	| IOT025 |	After
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| IOT025 |	Sending back
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:12,352	| IOT025 |	Device
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,448	| IOT025 |	Yeah it just just keeping track of those
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,984	| IOT025 |	Identities writing
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:21,056	| IOT025 |	Do I have an account what was the password they are needed
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:23,360	| IOT025 |	It's the same challenge we have on the web just
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,152	| IOT025 |	Steel. For everything in your house
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:29,760	| IOT025 |	Now you know you're an early adopter but that's the reality
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,296	| IOT025 |	For the users
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,320	| IOT025 |	Economist we
EDL	00:34:32,832	00:34:33,856	| IOT025 |	Something different
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:36,928	| IOT025 |	Okay and so your suggestion is creating this
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,464	| IOT025 |	This identity layer
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:42,048	| IOT025 |	And it is an interoperable layer
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,584	| IOT025 |	It's associated
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,608	| IOT025 |	With whatever
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:47,168	| IOT025 |	Whatever stack whatever technology stack that
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:47,936	| IOT025 |	We're going to build for the inter
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:50,752	| IOT025 |	What I argue is the
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,544	| IOT025 |	The importance of
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,336	| IOT025 |	Standardization
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,360	| IOT025 |	And so interop
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,152	| IOT025 |	At night
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,224	| IOT025 |	Talk about that
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,992	| IOT025 |	DeKalb right now
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:03,296	| IOT025 |	That work has started I think
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,856	| IOT025 |	I'm not alone in recognizing the
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:09,696	| IOT025 |	The importance of that so there's there's some encouraging
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,976	| IOT025 |	Initial steps on
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,512	| IOT025 |	Define in how
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,048	| IOT025 |	How to bond
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,072	| IOT025 |	These Concepts
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,608	| IOT025 |	Identities and
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,424	| IOT025 |	Relationships onto those new
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:19,936	| IOT025 |	Protocols
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:22,240	| IOT025 |	And what are some of those steps so far
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:26,336	| IOT025 |	So for instance there's a ace group Ace
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,664	| IOT025 |	Authentication for constrained environments
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,688	| IOT025 |	India ETF
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,736	| IOT025 |	Panera working group.
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,760	| IOT025 |	Looking at
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,552	| IOT025 |	Reality of
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,088	| IOT025 |	Constrained devices
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,624	| IOT025 |	What are the constraints is
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,416	| IOT025 |	Memory your size or battery
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:43,232	| IOT025 |	There's an effort in the
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,512	| IOT025 |	Open ID Foundation
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,280	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:48,096	| IOT025 |	Not an organization historically focused
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:48,864	| IOT025 |	Coyote
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,656	| IOT025 |	But there's early
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:53,472	| IOT025 |	Work there in defining
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,752	| IOT025 |	A model where
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:58,080	| IOT025 |	Cancel silicate the issuance
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,104	| IOT025 |	Betoken
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,128	| IOT025 |	To a device
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,944	| IOT025 |	An app on the phone
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:08,064	| IOT025 |	Let's talk about the constraints because we kind of went right in there and I never got back to
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,856	| IOT025 |	The constraints which are
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,136	| IOT025 |	Some of these
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:16,512	| IOT025 |	Devices so if I look at a sensor I'm I'm looking at a tiny little arm base
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:20,096	| IOT025 |	You know it might be like an arm zero microcontroller on these things
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:23,936	| IOT025 |	This is not something that is capable of
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:25,216	| IOT025 |	Running out of
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,496	| IOT025 |	128 bit
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,056	| IOT025 |	What is an encryption
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,360	| IOT025 |	Actually I'm saying that like I know
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:31,872	| IOT025 |	I don't know
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:35,456	| IOT025 |	The acronym
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:38,784	| IOT025 |	It is not a nice acronym I feel like it
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,552	| IOT025 |	That's a lot
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:44,160	| IOT025 |	That that's kind of a lot of number I'd I have a vague sense of hashing and What needs to go into that
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:46,208	| IOT025 |	It feels like a lot for that level of
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,744	| IOT025 |	Microcontroller
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:52,096	| IOT025 |	I made that statement I was actually presenting
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,632	| IOT025 |	On on stage in the summer night
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:56,704	| IOT025 |	Just made that blanket statement
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,240	| IOT025 |	These things will not be able to do
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,008	| IOT025 |	Modern crypto
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:03,104	| IOT025 |	And I was immediately corrected by somebody who knows
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:03,872	| IOT025 |	That would be nice
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,152	| IOT025 |	Macaulay Culkin
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:06,944	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,736	| IOT025 |	We're both wrong
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:12,064	| IOT025 |	Well point is valid
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:14,880	| IOT025 |	Right perhaps not specifically around Cliffdale butts
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:17,184	| IOT025 |	At least these things cannot do
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,976	| IOT025 |	Clara mobile phone can't work
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,256	| IOT025 |	Some of them
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:23,584	| IOT025 |	Write summer going to be connected to the house
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:26,912	| IOT025 |	Electricity and so we eating Taco battery
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:27,936	| IOT025 |	Battery power
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:32,544	| IOT025 |	Some definitely have constraints that we need to
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,824	| IOT025 |	Anticipate
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:39,712	| IOT025 |	Music about how they authenticate to other things and how they prove that they are
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:41,760	| IOT025 |	Still valid in an operating and a half
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,552	| IOT025 |	A particular user
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:47,392	| IOT025 |	And how often do they need to do that because if I look at like the latest zigbee hack
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,696	| IOT025 |	I'm it wasn't really a fact
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:50,720	| IOT025 |	If somebody who's like
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:53,280	| IOT025 |	Hey look most people when they do zigbee
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,328	| IOT025 |	You know other occasion right now they're just like
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:58,656	| IOT025 |	For the most part they don't use all of the encryption
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,192	| IOT025 |	Available to them they're just like
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:03,264	| IOT025 |	They use the same encryption code every time
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:04,544	| IOT025 |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:06,848	| IOT025 |	I'm not familiar with that hot but
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:09,152	| IOT025 |	But yeah there's a general pattern of
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:10,432	| IOT025 |	Relying on
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,968	| IOT025 |	Whatever
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:15,296	| IOT025 |	Shirts Ortiz were were burned into the device
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,832	| IOT025 |	At manufacturing time and
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:18,368	| IOT025 |	I just relying on that
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,648	| IOT025 |	Fault
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:20,416	| IOT025 |	So
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,464	| IOT025 |	If and when those things are compromised
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:23,744	| IOT025 |	You're just shot
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,512	| IOT025 |	Right cuz there's
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:25,280	| IOT025 |	There's no way.
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,304	| IOT025 |	Step back from that
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,352	| IOT025 |	The model that
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,376	| IOT025 |	Wheat
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,656	| IOT025 |	Argue for is
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:31,936	| IOT025 |	Ghost
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:36,032	| IOT025 |	Secrets that are broke into the chip when the thing is manufactured
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,568	| IOT025 |	Primary credentials
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:41,152	| IOT025 |	MasterCard goes we don't want to use those
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,712	| IOT025 |	Each and every time that device
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:44,224	| IOT025 |	Appendix
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,040	| IOT025 |	We want to instead
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,064	| IOT025 |	Issue
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,088	| IOT025 |	Secondary
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,624	| IOT025 |	Secret secondary credential
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,952	| IOT025 |	You know Austin
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:54,464	| IOT025 |	Primary
EDL	00:38:55,232	00:38:56,512	| IOT025 |	I know secondary
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,048	| IOT025 |	Secrets can be shorter lives
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:02,144	| IOT025 |	They can be issued only if the user consents
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:02,912	| IOT025 |	To the woods
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,752	| IOT025 |	They can be targeted at particular applications
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,288	| IOT025 |	Lots of
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:10,336	| IOT025 |	Security and privacy damages
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:11,872	| IOT025 |	That's simple operation of
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,432	| IOT025 |	Start with the shirt that was
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:16,736	| IOT025 |	Burnt End of the chapter trade it for something else
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:20,320	| IOT025 |	And finally is as the end user
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:24,416	| IOT025 |	When we start talking about adding an identity layer
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,208	| IOT025 |	And making that interoperable
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:30,048	| IOT025 |	What does that mean for me in terms of additional
EDL	00:39:30,560	00:39:32,608	| IOT025 |	Steps or work
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,120	| IOT025 |	Or
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:35,424	| IOT025 |	If it's shorter battery life on my
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,704	| IOT025 |	Devices Maybe
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:38,752	| IOT025 |	What does it mean to me what am I going to
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:41,312	| IOT025 |	I hope what you see is
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,104	| IOT025 |	1
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:43,872	| IOT025 |	Skewer
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:45,152	| IOT025 |	Prompts for password
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,432	| IOT025 |	Yeah
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:49,760	| IOT025 |	Yeah that's a good thing right we're seeing that on the web
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:50,784	| IOT025 |	Not reflect
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:51,552	| IOT025 |	Emergency
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:55,136	| IOT025 |	I suggest you're also going to see
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,184	| IOT025 |	More prompts for strong
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:40:00,000	| IOT025 |	Vacation by bringing something into the house
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:04,096	| IOT025 |	Credential or token that it's going to use to
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:04,608	| IOT025 |	Do its job
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:07,168	| IOT025 |	That's a sensitive operation
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,936	| IOT025 |	I want to protect that
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:11,264	| IOT025 |	I'd argue that it's relevant to
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:11,776	| IOT025 |	Impose
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,824	| IOT025 |	Rarely and infrequently
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:16,128	| IOT025 |	A greater authentication on bird
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:16,896	| IOT025 |	Burden on users
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:19,200	| IOT025 |	And we currently do
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,712	| IOT025 |	So Prince
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:23,296	| IOT025 |	Bringing something ended up the home and I'm setting it up
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:27,648	| IOT025 |	I should be expected to the fennec 8 through more than
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:28,160	| IOT025 |	Single
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,696	| IOT025 |	More than
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:30,208	| IOT025 |	Password
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:33,536	| IOT025 |	Also perhaps by swiping
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:34,560	| IOT025 |	Something on my phone
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:36,352	| IOT025 |	Communicate that's mean idiot
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:38,144	| IOT025 |	Touch id based login
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,752	| IOT025 |	So I'm going to have to use a fingerprint login
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:45,312	| IOT025 |	Whenever I bring a new device into my phone for the for the first time
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:50,432	| IOT025 |	Well I'm not saying it has to be fingerprint I'm saying it should be something more then
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,968	| IOT025 |	Just a password
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:53,504	| IOT025 |	That you used to login to that website
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,808	| IOT025 |	It's appropriate
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,576	| IOT025 |	I think
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:58,368	| IOT025 |	To require greater
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:58,880	| IOT025 |	Assurance
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:01,184	| IOT025 |	Of these sensitive operations
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:04,000	| IOT025 |	And provisioning a new device a sentence
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:07,072	| IOT025 |	Passwords
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:08,352	| IOT025 |	More
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,912	| IOT025 |	Strongest indication operation
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,680	| IOT025 |	Stun infrequently
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:12,704	| IOT025 |	And
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:14,752	| IOT025 |	Fewer account creation
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:16,032	| IOT025 |	Right
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,592	| IOT025 |	Not a given that every device
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,616	| IOT025 |	I bring into the home
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,408	| IOT025 |	Should have
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:23,456	| IOT025 |	Corresponding unique
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:24,992	| IOT025 |	Identity
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:26,784	| IOT025 |	There's a cloud
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:29,856	| IOT025 |	Why can I not use an existing identity
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,624	| IOT025 |	Like I can on the web
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,672	| IOT025 |	That would be exciting
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,696	| IOT025 |	I could use
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,744	| IOT025 |	Fewer apps will
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:37,536	| IOT025 |	Right now I can use fewer apps
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,816	| IOT025 |	And fewer account creation
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,096	| IOT025 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:41,376	| IOT025 |	That would be fun
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:42,144	| IOT025 |	Okay
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:44,704	| IOT025 |	Will Paul thank you so much for talking to me about the
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,728	| IOT025 |	Recite I feel
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:48,032	| IOT025 |	A little bit better how how far off do you think
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:52,384	| IOT025 |	Well the model
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:54,431	| IOT025 |	Has already proven itself on the web
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,711	| IOT025 |	People.com
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,479	| IOT025 |	Respect
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:57,503	| IOT025 |	This sort of
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:42:00,063	| IOT025 |	Identity interoperability they don't call it that of course
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,343	| IOT025 |	On the web
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:03,135	| IOT025 |	So that the protocols of the Earth
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,159	| IOT025 |	Patterns are there
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:07,743	| IOT025 |	That the standardization efforts are just beginning
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:11,583	| IOT025 |	I expect in one or two years we might see some
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:14,143	| IOT025 |	Products that actually Implement these models
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,191	| IOT025 |	Ultimately depends on
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,007	| IOT025 |	Pressures better
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:21,055	| IOT025 |	Consumers in this context
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,335	| IOT025 |	Play something
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:24,383	| IOT025 |	Device manufacturers in the platforms
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,943	| IOT025 |	Alright we'll device manufacturers
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:28,735	| IOT025 |	Consider yourself pressured
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,015	| IOT025 |	Because by golly
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:32,831	| IOT025 |	I am running out of passwords
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:38,207	| IOT025 |	Alright thank you so much for coming on the show today I really appreciate it
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:40,255	| IOT025 |	Was my pleasure Stacy thank you very much
