EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:12,544	| IOT18 |	And this is your house
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:13,568	| IOT18 |	Stacey Higginbotham
EDL	00:00:13,568	00:00:15,104	| IOT18 |	And your other host
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:16,128	| IOT18 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:16,128	00:00:19,200	| IOT18 |	And this week we have some awesome stuff for you beginning with
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:20,736	| IOT18 |	Anti-poaching effort
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:22,784	| IOT18 |	In South Africa
EDL	00:00:22,784	00:00:23,552	| IOT18 |	Not eggs
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:24,320	| IOT18 |	Not eggs
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:25,600	| IOT18 |	Rhinoceros
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:30,464	| IOT18 |	Living with our friend
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:32,000	| IOT18 |	The algorithm
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:33,024	| IOT18 |	And how
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:33,536	| IOT18 |	Is it worth it
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:35,840	| IOT18 |	We'll also talk about
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:38,912	| IOT18 |	Best Buy in The Geek Squad and our guest this week
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:41,216	| IOT18 |	Is David Newman who is the guy who helped
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:44,032	| IOT18 |	Target build its new retail concept for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,872	| IOT18 |	There's definitely a French theme running through this
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:48,384	| IOT18 |	This week's podcast
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:49,920	| IOT18 |	Spot It
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:50,688	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,200	| IOT18 |	Kevin
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:53,248	| IOT18 |	Let's get started with
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,272	| IOT18 |	Poached rhinos
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:01:01,184	| IOT18 |	Is this is interesting that you pointed this out to me I had not heard of this story but this is a way to use the Internet of Things
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:04,000	| IOT18 |	To basically connect rhinos to protect them from poachers
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:07,840	| IOT18 |	And you are a story about this so how are they doing this
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:11,168	| IOT18 |	This is an effort by an organization called
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:14,240	| IOT18 |	Protect and they are funded by The Humane Society
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,264	| IOT18 |	The international
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:15,776	| IOT18 |	Humane Society
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:17,824	| IOT18 |	It's actually kind of crazy
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:19,872	| IOT18 |	Take
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:20,640	| IOT18 |	Rhinoceros
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,176	| IOT18 |	Rhinos
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:22,944	| IOT18 |	Rhinos
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:23,968	| IOT18 |	Rhinos thank you
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:24,992	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:27,552	| IOT18 |	Surgically implant a video
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:30,368	| IOT18 |	In their secondary horn
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:30,880	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,720	| IOT18 |	Do a little rhinoplasty
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:39,840	| IOT18 |	They also
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,376	| IOT18 |	Add a heart rate monitor
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,144	| IOT18 |	The Rhinoceros
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,680	| IOT18 |	Rhino
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,448	| IOT18 |	Dry nose
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,216	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,008	| IOT18 |	They had a GPS
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,312	| IOT18 |	And what they do is they track the rhino
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:52,128	| IOT18 |	And when the heart rate monitor spikes
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:55,712	| IOT18 |	Check to see through the video camera
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,760	| IOT18 |	What has happened to cause that Spike
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,296	| IOT18 |	And if it is
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,344	| IOT18 |	Is an injury or some kind of problem
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,672	| IOT18 |	Share the GPS location
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,976	| IOT18 |	With the Rangers that protect the rhinos
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,768	| IOT18 |	And they send a helicopter
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,328	| IOT18 |	And helicopter come speeding in
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:14,656	| IOT18 |	Apparently hopefully catches a posher
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,424	| IOT18 |	In
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:18,240	| IOT18 |	Action and hopefully before it actually
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,264	| IOT18 |	Kills the rhinos
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,848	| IOT18 |	That's the key the timing is the key here
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,152	| IOT18 |	It is because what happens is
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:26,432	| IOT18 |	Your
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:29,504	| IOT18 |	If you're a ranger in Africa you're trying to protect
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,296	| IOT18 |	Thousands of miles or
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,088	| IOT18 |	Thousands of kilometers
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,600	| IOT18 |	As they would say
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,648	| IOT18 |	Of Savannah
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,464	| IOT18 |	You really can't do that very effectively
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:44,096	| IOT18 |	It's too difficult because it's too broad of an area there's a limited connectivity and so on so
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:47,680	| IOT18 |	It's kind of interesting to me that they're essentially instrumenting the rhinos
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,448	| IOT18 |	Scare
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,520	| IOT18 |	For you know Health monitoring reasons end of the video camera
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:54,592	| IOT18 |	I mean I don't want to sound morbid at all but you don't
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,872	| IOT18 |	Thinking Out Loud here
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,408	| IOT18 |	You'll be able to tell
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,944	| IOT18 |	By the video if perhaps something
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:03,552	| IOT18 |	Scared the Rhino and it's okay or something like that that made the hearts way
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,600	| IOT18 |	Obviously it's like they see the
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,880	| IOT18 |	Camera view
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:09,184	| IOT18 |	Sideways or something obvious to the Rhinos down
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:12,000	| IOT18 |	Yan in the show notes will include this but they also
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,024	| IOT18 |	You also get
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| IOT18 |	Rhinocam
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:15,328	| IOT18 |	Which is a
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,632	| IOT18 |	Rhino horns I view of the world
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:20,704	| IOT18 |	Which I think would be kind of a fun
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,008	| IOT18 |	Perspective as they fight or
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,032	| IOT18 |	Run around
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,568	| IOT18 |	Doing Rhino things
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:28,128	| IOT18 |	They're kind of solitary animals so I'm not sure if
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:29,920	| IOT18 |	Good footage
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,200	| IOT18 |	They have is
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,248	| IOT18 |	Hey here
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,296	| IOT18 |	Grassland scrub
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,064	| IOT18 |	Oh
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,576	| IOT18 |	Awesome
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:40,160	| IOT18 |	It's still kind of interesting and
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,952	| IOT18 |	Because the admission early there's
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,000	| IOT18 |	No connectivity challenges in these areas
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,304	| IOT18 |	Corrector using satellites
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,120	| IOT18 |	For the connection
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:52,448	| IOT18 |	They're actually a lot of technical challenges here outside of the
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,728	| IOT18 |	The challenges
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,288	| IOT18 |	Hunting down a rhino putting it to sleep in
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,080	| IOT18 |	Surgically implanting a camera in it
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:02,432	| IOT18 |	It snows I think this is a really interesting project
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,224	| IOT18 |	It is daunting
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:04,736	| IOT18 |	I still think
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:08,320	| IOT18 |	Hey it's worthwhile that they've gotten the proof-of-concept out
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,600	| IOT18 |	The Prototype
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:14,464	| IOT18 |	There's like one prototype running around there to have a couple more and the idea is
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:20,351	| IOT18 |	To actually expand this program to elephants and tigers they're starting to develop those proof of Concepts this year
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,655	| IOT18 |	And within a couple months
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,679	| IOT18 |	This will be
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,191	| IOT18 |	Kind of
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,775	| IOT18 |	The prototypes will be on the ground in South Africa
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,055	| IOT18 |	On the rhinos
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,823	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,639	| IOT18 |	Yeah it seems like a really cool project so
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,663	| IOT18 |	If you're interested I'll
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,199	| IOT18 |	Information
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,503	| IOT18 |	I'm watching the video feed
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,295	| IOT18 |	That you have in your story in
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:44,159	| IOT18 |	The camera quality outstanding except there's this giant horn in the way that lock
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:50,559	| IOT18 |	Yes yes you do just so you guys know if you want to go check this out you're not
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,839	| IOT18 |	How can I get the complete picture
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,631	| IOT18 |	You know if you saw the
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,143	| IOT18 |	Jornada
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,191	| IOT18 |	R2 that would
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,495	| IOT18 |	Kind of time defeats the purpose
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:03,615	| IOT18 |	That sounds like a good startup opportunity for somebody Cash Out million
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:06,175	| IOT18 |	Sorry
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,199	| IOT18 |	You are terrible
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,759	| IOT18 |	So moving for a rhino horn
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:14,111	| IOT18 |	Prince and the plains of South Africa
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,439	| IOT18 |	Sorry go ahead
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,743	| IOT18 |	Could you outrun a rhino these are questions that
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,511	| IOT18 |	Maybe we should
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,791	| IOT18 |	Ponder
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,071	| IOT18 |	As we watch that video
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,607	| IOT18 |	I'm going to have to see him run
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:27,167	| IOT18 |	Cuz he's going back and forth night looking at plants and eating so
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,727	| IOT18 |	Is this interesting
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:35,615	| IOT18 |	I watch a lot of Discovery Channel and National Geographic and so on and
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,199	| IOT18 |	I really get into this kind of thing so yeah I mean I'm mesmerised
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,711	| IOT18 |	Did you not
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,527	| IOT18 |	Alright so Kevin is going to be one of the first
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,551	| IOT18 |	Backers of the rhino
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:46,879	| IOT18 |	Sodexo
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,671	| IOT18 |	Moving on from
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,231	| IOT18 |	Fran okay I'm going to move into actually
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,743	| IOT18 |	Smart Home Care
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,583	| IOT18 |	Earlier this year I tested the netatmo
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:58,655	| IOT18 |	Is that the doorbell camera or
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,167	| IOT18 |	No this is
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,215	| IOT18 |	Is a Pringles can
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,335	| IOT18 |	I made it look like it look like a smaller print
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,871	| IOT18 |	And it looks more like a
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,687	| IOT18 |	It look more like a hairspray can remove scan
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| IOT18 |	It's a little skinnier
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,759	| IOT18 |	For those of you who use product
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| IOT18 |	In your hair
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:18,111	| IOT18 |	Does if you could do not it's just skinnier than a Pringles can and shorter
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:22,463	| IOT18 |	And it is beautiful it is champagne colored aluminum
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,999	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:30,143	| IOT18 |	It purports to have facial recognition and it learns via algorithm who the people in your family are
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:33,215	| IOT18 |	And it starts alerting you
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:36,287	| IOT18 |	And get your notifications instead of saying I detect
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,823	| IOT18 |	Movement it says things like
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:41,151	| IOT18 |	In my house it would be Stacy just into the house
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:45,247	| IOT18 |	Which is a little bit more useful and you don't even have to click through to the app
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,527	| IOT18 |	To be like oh who just enter
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT18 |	I told you
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,111	| IOT18 |	So I've been to
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,135	| IOT18 |	Testing that
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT18 |	And then
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:57,279	| IOT18 |	I've also tested things like the canary which is an all-in-one security device and then there's the classic
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:03,167	| IOT18 |	The Nest so I thought it'd be kind of fun Kevin for you and I to talk about like
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| IOT18 |	Life with an algorithm
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:08,543	| IOT18 |	Because a lot more Smart Home Products are touting this idea of
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,591	| IOT18 |	An algorithm is being
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,615	| IOT18 |	Epic selling
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:18,271	| IOT18 |	Like I think we're still trying to figure we Izzy and industries are trying to figure out how to make these things
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,831	| IOT18 |	Work in a smart way when we say smart home
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:26,719	| IOT18 |	To me that's not just these individual devices if the algorithms that tie Services Android devices
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,231	| IOT18 |	Together
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:34,143	| IOT18 |	And didn't take it off and doesn't work the way you think it might work the way you want it to and I suspect that's what you've been finding out
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,447	| IOT18 |	In testing all these things but I'm taking a wild stab here
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,495	| IOT18 |	It's a little like that so
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,543	| IOT18 |	The key point I think the
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,103	| IOT18 |	Anytime you see the word algorithm
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,895	| IOT18 |	With these products is
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,199	| IOT18 |	That you have to remember is you have to train them
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,991	| IOT18 |	And that's kind of what I'm getting at
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,015	| IOT18 |	Because a lot of these
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,527	| IOT18 |	Annie's products
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,343	| IOT18 |	Take the nest requires about a week-long train
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,159	| IOT18 |	And that's fine
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,951	| IOT18 |	And that week-long training. With
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:02,303	| IOT18 |	The Nest Is You by The Nest you install it in for a week you treat it like any other thermos
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| IOT18 |	You know when you're high
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,631	| IOT18 |	You go walk to the nest or you
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| IOT18 |	Use your phone
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,167	| IOT18 |	When you're like
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,679	| IOT18 |	Hey I'm hot
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,031	| IOT18 |	After about a week of that the nest
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:12,799	| IOT18 |	Dislike
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| IOT18 |	You know what
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,871	| IOT18 |	I think I got your schedule and then it starts
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| IOT18 |	Working on its own
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,711	| IOT18 |	If it's based on your behavior
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,759	| IOT18 |	Learn from your behaviors and starts
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:24,575	| IOT18 |	Reacting to or acting upon
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,647	| IOT18 |	Your behavior without you manually giving input
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,439	| IOT18 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,207	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,023	| IOT18 |	With the facial recognition because the canary has a
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,303	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,375	| IOT18 |	What is trying to do is its trying to identify things
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| IOT18 |	Things like
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:44,287	| IOT18 |	Oh hey that's a dog so when your dog comes in sets off the motion sensor I'm not going to call in a lot
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,567	| IOT18 |	Right
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| IOT18 |	Which
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| IOT18 |	That's awesome right
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:51,711	| IOT18 |	Oh that's great because in the old days which was not long ago
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,271	| IOT18 |	If you had motion detection sensors
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,087	| IOT18 |	We did we had an alarm system
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,367	| IOT18 |	And the cats
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,671	| IOT18 |	Would actually be able to set it off we weren't home
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:04,255	| IOT18 |	So then we had to buy special motion sensors that were programmed to ignore
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| IOT18 |	Sings
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,327	| IOT18 |	Moving around under roughly 40 lb
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,351	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:12,703	| IOT18 |	If that's not ideal if you can have actual recognition that's the way to go
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| IOT18 |	Right
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,007	| IOT18 |	Things like that so
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:18,335	| IOT18 |	In the welcome camera ideas it recognizes
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,663	| IOT18 |	Is people's faces who live in the house so it can give you better
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT18 |	Data
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,223	| IOT18 |	Slack better notifications
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,503	| IOT18 |	How can I deal with notify
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| IOT18 |	Vacation fatigue
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| IOT18 |	Great
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,063	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,855	| IOT18 |	The challenge with both of those system
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| IOT18 |	Was that
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,439	| IOT18 |	The training. Didn't actually
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,975	| IOT18 |	Stop
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,999	| IOT18 |	After a week
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| IOT18 |	It never ends
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,839	| IOT18 |	And so what would it what would happen is
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| IOT18 |	At first you know
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,399	| IOT18 |	So we'll start with a welcome
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,983	| IOT18 |	Everyone in my house had to go in front of the camera in
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,751	| IOT18 |	Antenna
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,031	| IOT18 |	Faking it was like
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,847	| IOT18 |	Here we are
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,871	| IOT18 |	Like 3 or 4 days
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,431	| IOT18 |	Every time it was show you
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:57,503	| IOT18 |	A list of faces basically in
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,063	| IOT18 |	It would be you would just be like this is dispersed
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:01,855	| IOT18 |	This is
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,391	| IOT18 |	Righteverywhere
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,671	| IOT18 |	Every face
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,207	| IOT18 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| IOT18 |	They made it nice
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,791	| IOT18 |	It after while. Really good
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:15,423	| IOT18 |	But it's still with throw up faces for you like every morning when I open the app it would be like
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,983	| IOT18 |	Here like 15 faces would like
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| IOT18 |	For you to identify
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,287	| IOT18 |	Or
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| IOT18 |	Sure
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,079	| IOT18 |	14 faces
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,639	| IOT18 |	Can you confirm that the following six are Stacy
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| IOT18 |	And you would hit them
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,039	| IOT18 |	What I was actually really impressed with was some of them
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,319	| IOT18 |	I couldn't even identify a state
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,135	| IOT18 |	These are pictures of
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,159	| IOT18 |	Purportedly of me
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,439	| IOT18 |	And I be like
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,279	| IOT18 |	And the pressure is on actually to get it right
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,559	| IOT18 |	Because
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| IOT18 |	If you get it
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,095	| IOT18 |	If you were like
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| IOT18 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,935	| IOT18 |	You're kind of like I miss him with an algorithm
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,519	| IOT18 |	And decreasing the probability that it
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,823	| IOT18 |	Be able to identify me
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,919	| IOT18 |	Right sure you don't want to be the one that weaken the algorithms intelligence
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,431	| IOT18 |	Just might be
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,735	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,015	| IOT18 |	I felt like
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,575	| IOT18 |	After a certain point in time I wanted it to stop at
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,671	| IOT18 |	Like after a month I was I was really done with
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,695	| IOT18 |	Interactive
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,559	| IOT18 |	Yeah it's it's a shame that it
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,351	| IOT18 |	Doesn't really ever end
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,679	| IOT18 |	Yeah I bet you don't maybe if they showed it to me like
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,215	| IOT18 |	Hey do you have time to go through
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:21,727	| IOT18 |	Some faces
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,287	| IOT18 |	And they made it like a fun game or something
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:30,687	| IOT18 |	You know there's value in going through every especially like I have a small child too
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,223	| IOT18 |	You know her face changes
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,735	| IOT18 |	Overtime
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,039	| IOT18 |	So there's value in that
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,343	| IOT18 |	And you know when new people come in
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,159	| IOT18 |	It's like hey I just saw a totally new person
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,695	| IOT18 |	We care about that person
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| IOT18 |	Every morning I would wake up
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:48,095	| IOT18 |	Here's 15 new faces of your husband
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,119	| IOT18 |	I know that's
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,423	| IOT18 |	Again they got to put
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:55,775	| IOT18 |	Some limits on that to decrease the number of times over the
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| IOT18 |	How often does that because
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,383	| IOT18 |	It just it just loses value
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,663	| IOT18 |	Kind of interesting because
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:07,039	| IOT18 |	Mei I have no problem with the facial-recognition approach I know a lot of people will and then that's fine that you know
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,087	| IOT18 |	Privacy issues etc etc I'm not going to go there
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,159	| IOT18 |	But there's one device that I've had for the past
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,951	| IOT18 |	I'll say three years
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,975	| IOT18 |	That is
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:19,071	| IOT18 |	Does an outstanding job at recognizing everybody in my family as well as some of the neighbors
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,631	| IOT18 |	I don't think you'll ever guess
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,655	| IOT18 |	I will not ever
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,191	| IOT18 |	Your talk
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,495	| IOT18 |	Well yes that are there is that
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,263	| IOT18 |	Bedtime
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,799	| IOT18 |	He's going to be around forever and for tonight
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,871	| IOT18 |	The Microsoft Xbox Kinect is fan
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,639	| IOT18 |	Tastic
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| IOT18 |	And identification
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:35,967	| IOT18 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:41,087	| IOT18 |	So I don't know if it's any use multiple sensors it's not just a camera that use infrared
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,391	| IOT18 |	But you some type of RGB camera
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,439	| IOT18 |	They have multiple sensors in that connect
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:48,511	| IOT18 |	And they do a fantastic job with it
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:49,791	| IOT18 |	I don't think
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,839	| IOT18 |	It's ever actually do because
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,119	| IOT18 |	When you set it up
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,399	| IOT18 |	You know it takes your picture and so on
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,471	| IOT18 |	You said your accounts and etc etc
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| IOT18 |	And then
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| IOT18 |	Anytime you walk
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:06,431	| IOT18 |	If you have it set up this way every time you walk in front of the Xbox it literally will just automatically sign you in if you have a configure to do so
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,247	| IOT18 |	I'm almost wish they would license it out because
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,319	| IOT18 |	Think these products would benefit greatly from that
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| IOT18 |	Who that would be
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,695	| IOT18 |	If your buddy at the echo somewhere behind you I won't say
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:18,975	| IOT18 |	Shi shoes
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,511	| IOT18 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,047	| IOT18 |	We call her in our house
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,351	| IOT18 |	Doubt that could be really compelling
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,887	| IOT18 |	Are there kind of creepy
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,703	| IOT18 |	So moving right along
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,751	| IOT18 |	Living with algorithms
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,263	| IOT18 |	And maybe something
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,055	| IOT18 |	Might be better about training
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,639	| IOT18 |	Since we're going to see a lot more of them and they should get better
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:40,735	| IOT18 |	Because that is the only way we're going to handle the information overflow that we're going to
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:41,503	| IOT18 |	Reconnect
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,295	| IOT18 |	Get the information day loser
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,087	| IOT18 |	Is
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:49,183	| IOT18 |	There is there is more help on the way other than better AI
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,463	| IOT18 |	Is
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| IOT18 |	Best Buy wants to help
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:57,375	| IOT18 |	Speaking at brainstorm Tech the CEO of Best Buy
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,911	| IOT18 |	To bear
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,703	| IOT18 |	Judicially
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,543	| IOT18 |	Got on stage and I can't believe I forgot to talk about this last week
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,407	| IOT18 |	He said that his retailer as a retailer Best Buy is
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,943	| IOT18 |	This is super poised to help
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,223	| IOT18 |	With the Internet of Things
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,527	| IOT18 |	Because not only will they sell connected devices
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| IOT18 |	They also
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,087	| IOT18 |	Well
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,671	| IOT18 |	How people install and troubleshoot
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,743	| IOT18 |	The stuff that you know Kevin you and I do like
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,303	| IOT18 |	Hours at a time on weekends
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| IOT18 |	What do you think about that
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| IOT18 |	Well
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:35,519	| IOT18 |	Say hello and I say this I don't want to categorize every single Geek Squad member as being fantastic or terrible
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,311	| IOT18 |	As long as
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:42,431	| IOT18 |	You barely can guarantee a certain minimum level of performance I think it's a great idea
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:47,551	| IOT18 |	Because most people either a don't have the time that you and I have to devote
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,319	| IOT18 |	To this kind of thing
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,087	| IOT18 |	How to troubleshoot everything
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,903	| IOT18 |	Time
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:56,255	| IOT18 |	And Emily just before the show we were kind of laughing out loud saying
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:15:00,351	| IOT18 |	Anytime there's any small problem with any of our systems are other devices
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| IOT18 |	What are apps
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,655	| IOT18 |	If he comes this
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,447	| IOT18 |	Debacle of things that
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| IOT18 |	Take hours to resolve
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:11,615	| IOT18 |	And people don't want to invest that kind of time that the whole point of all these connected devices
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,687	| IOT18 |	Is that you're pretty smart things in your house and around you
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:17,759	| IOT18 |	So you get some of your time back and you get some value
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| IOT18 |	So I'm
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,039	| IOT18 |	Fine with
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:23,903	| IOT18 |	Best Buy being the Apple Genius bar for my smart home provided
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,671	| IOT18 |	You know it's
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,975	| IOT18 |	It's not me spending two hours trouble shooting
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,535	| IOT18 |	I'd rather do than have them spend
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,095	| IOT18 |	2 hours or 3 hours and not be able to figure it out
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| IOT18 |	Right cuz
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,655	| IOT18 |	You & I we generally figure this stuff out
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,447	| IOT18 |	We do although I will say
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,727	| IOT18 |	When I think it's a gene
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,799	| IOT18 |	What I think of the Geeks
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,823	| IOT18 |	Squad
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| IOT18 |	Sorry
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:46,687	| IOT18 |	Sorry
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,503	| IOT18 |	Oh I did it again
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:52,319	| IOT18 |	What I have on the brain
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,367	| IOT18 |	Sorry God
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:58,463	| IOT18 |	Going to try it takes. T Squad Squad
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,767	| IOT18 |	Tutu issues
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,047	| IOT18 |	What is
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,583	| IOT18 |	Guys have fun
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| IOT18 |	Corn on your
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,887	| IOT18 |	Computer I really do
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:08,959	| IOT18 |	So you bring it in and they like rifle Terraria
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,727	| IOT18 |	Your folders on your heart
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,007	| IOT18 |	For like
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,287	| IOT18 |	Improvising stuff
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:16,895	| IOT18 |	There's been some horror stories about that yes
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,991	| IOT18 |	Poking around your house near
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,783	| IOT18 |	My house that I know of
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,111	| IOT18 |	I was going to say Stacy specifically not saying
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:30,975	| IOT18 |	They don't want to hurt you if you wanted to find a point in her house she did something happen to find anything and
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,279	| IOT18 |	The other thing is
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:36,351	| IOT18 |	You don't the hard thing about the Internet of Things
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:39,935	| IOT18 |	Is that your combining both it in like
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| IOT18 |	Physical
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,471	| IOT18 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:44,287	| IOT18 |	It's it's like people call it it and OT
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,335	| IOT18 |	God help me if I ever use
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,175	| IOT18 |	It is true you have to have
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| IOT18 |	Physical like
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| IOT18 |	There's Electric
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,015	| IOT18 |	Afraid so I got stymied by intellect
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:55,807	| IOT18 |	But this weekend
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,623	| IOT18 |	Not and then I got signed by a network
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,135	| IOT18 |	Arkansas
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,695	| IOT18 |	So you got to have those two things
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,743	| IOT18 |	And you know I was tok
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,767	| IOT18 |	Usually about
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:11,167	| IOT18 |	Like are you going to bring in like electricians because I would be really interesting service for BestBuy to offer if I could just call them up and get like
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,703	| IOT18 |	An installation Network
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,471	| IOT18 |	Work is well
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:18,335	| IOT18 |	And that doesn't seem to be in the plans because there's licensing things that differ by each state
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,871	| IOT18 |	That's the tougher things
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| IOT18 |	To sell
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,919	| IOT18 |	Although I think that would be amazing
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,711	| IOT18 |	Stop ride Amazon with it
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,015	| IOT18 |	Amazon Home Services is actual
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,807	| IOT18 |	I coming in real strong there
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:31,391	| IOT18 |	But so I feel like that would be like a much more compelling thing
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:35,487	| IOT18 |	That's those are two things that Best Buy really with its Geek Squad would have to address
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:35,999	| IOT18 |	Before I'm like
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,535	| IOT18 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,071	| IOT18 |	This is a really compelling offering
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,631	| IOT18 |	Come on over
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,399	| IOT18 |	Geek Squad
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,191	| IOT18 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:50,591	| IOT18 |	Computers phones those are all very personal devices but there's nothing more personal to probably anybody then
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:54,175	| IOT18 |	What's going on in their home their home itself and so on
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,943	| IOT18 |	Cancel
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:58,527	| IOT18 |	There is the trust issue that they have to work on and I think it's
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,831	| IOT18 |	We can take some time I I suspect
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:05,439	| IOT18 |	He saying what he should be saying you know in Defence of his company hey we have something nobody else offers
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,207	| IOT18 |	That's true
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,511	| IOT18 |	But a lot of people will not
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,047	| IOT18 |	Be swayed by that
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,327	| IOT18 |	I don't I don't think
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:15,423	| IOT18 |	Yeah I mean cuz like if you think about it Comcast AT&T
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:21,823	| IOT18 |	Verizon I mean those guys all have an installer Network and a smartphone Prada
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,847	| IOT18 |	Actually Verizon
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,615	| IOT18 |	I don't think has a small
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,943	| IOT18 |	AT&T and Comcast have
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:29,503	| IOT18 |	ATT has one
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:32,575	| IOT18 |	Alarm.com Vivint all of those guys
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,343	| IOT18 |	Do and they have
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,135	| IOT18 |	The same sort of expertise
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:42,559	| IOT18 |	Yeah I mean I get what he's driving at and I agree with you if they offer
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,583	| IOT18 |	You no more
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:47,167	| IOT18 |	Technical electrical type install services that would probably
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:47,935	| IOT18 |	Be element
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| IOT18 |	Make it more compelling
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| IOT18 |	But
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:53,567	| IOT18 |	The reality is these products are being designed so that
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,591	| IOT18 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:58,943	| IOT18 |	Somebody can just go to a Best Buy or whatever store they buy their gear out or get it from Amazon
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,991	| IOT18 |	And literally be up and running
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,527	| IOT18 |	On their own
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,551	| IOT18 |	It in a short
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| IOT18 |	Matter of time
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,111	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:09,439	| IOT18 |	You know it's it kind of defeats the purpose of these devices
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:13,791	| IOT18 |	It to some degree if it's going to require a Geek Squad or
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,839	| IOT18 |	AT&T tech or an electrician
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:20,959	| IOT18 |	The promise of the Smart Hub you know it's brings all the Simplicity and everything else but if you have to pull your hair out trying to get it installed
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,775	| IOT18 |	And you don't be on the phone with support for an hour or two
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,847	| IOT18 |	It's frustrating it's like
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:28,383	| IOT18 |	The promise has not been met here
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:30,687	| IOT18 |	Course without it we wouldn't have a show so
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,199	| IOT18 |	On that note
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,479	| IOT18 |	Good point
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,551	| IOT18 |	We should end the show but before we do
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:39,903	| IOT18 |	Kevin and I are taking a much-needed break because it will be
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,415	| IOT18 |	August
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,951	| IOT18 |	In August is a great month
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:42,975	| IOT18 |	To take a break
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,279	| IOT18 |	Cuz that would just be
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| IOT18 |	Puppy lazy
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,327	| IOT18 |	I'm not lazy
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,119	| IOT18 |	Asellina
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,631	| IOT18 |	No

EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:04,639	| IOT18 |	Yeah absolutely open house is the culmination of
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,967	| IOT18 |	Work we've been doing in the Internet of Things stays for
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,759	| IOT18 |	18 months
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,319	| IOT18 |	An ultimately with open house
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,879	| IOT18 |	We set out to create a very
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,672	| IOT18 |	Fun educational
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,464	| IOT18 |	Experiential retail space
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:21,024	| IOT18 |	Where consumers can come in and experience
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:25,632	| IOT18 |	The Internet of Things in the connected home in a very easy to understand way
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,192	| IOT18 |	Okay you got about fifty products
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,752	| IOT18 |	Dinner in the space end
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:36,384	| IOT18 |	I have yet to visit because I am not in San Francisco but let me tell you I have gotten text form about
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,920	| IOT18 |	A dozen people who've
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,224	| IOT18 |	So far showed up so you guys
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,504	| IOT18 |	It's only been like two weeks
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,528	| IOT18 |	When we're recording this
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:45,856	| IOT18 |	But this is been open but already a dozen people have sent me
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:51,232	| IOT18 |	Text an email saying hey I've been in this this amazing experience happened to me
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:51,744	| IOT18 |	You have
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:56,864	| IOT18 |	Clear furniture that is showing the stuff off to Lake
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:58,912	| IOT18 |	Crazy degrees you got Interactive
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,936	| IOT18 |	Tables you got
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:03,008	| IOT18 |	A lot of documentation that shows these things working together
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,312	| IOT18 |	So tell me a little bit about
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,336	| IOT18 |	If I go in there
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,128	| IOT18 |	What am I going to say
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:08,640	| IOT18 |	Cnexps
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,992	| IOT18 |	Sure will you mention the furniture
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:15,808	| IOT18 |	And the first thing you're going to see walking into open
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,832	| IOT18 |	Open house is
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,112	| IOT18 |	Very literally
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:21,440	| IOT18 |	In open house so we have a cross section
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:21,952	| IOT18 |	The house
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,792	| IOT18 |	Location appropriate house it's a
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,304	| IOT18 |	Victorian home
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,376	| IOT18 |	And we have all the various rooms
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,144	| IOT18 |	Tibet House
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,168	| IOT18 |	And it's made out of
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:35,264	| IOT18 |	Clear acrylic and the purpose of that actually came out of a number of
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,544	| IOT18 |	Design experiments that
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,824	| IOT18 |	Weed in San Francisco
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,896	| IOT18 |	I all around this idea of showcasing
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,664	| IOT18 |	Vinyasa
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,432	| IOT18 |	Products work
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,712	| IOT18 |	Getting together so
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,480	| IOT18 |	Our first
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:48,064	| IOT18 |	Our first-ever we call these iot playground
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,576	| IOT18 |	That's when we did that
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:53,696	| IOT18 |	And for any of your listeners who saw these around San Francisco we didn't brand them as targets
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:59,328	| IOT18 |	I'm the first one we set up a living room with actual furniture and connect
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,376	| IOT18 |	Good products and show various vignettes
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,912	| IOT18 |	So someone coming home and lights
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,680	| IOT18 |	Turning on
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:08,544	| IOT18 |	Music coming on different interactions all possible today with the various
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:10,080	| IOT18 |	Out there
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:13,152	| IOT18 |	It was interesting and I was as you can imagine
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,456	| IOT18 |	You walk into a space with locks
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,504	| IOT18 |	Living room furniture and some very
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,784	| IOT18 |	Smart connected products
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,552	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:21,344	| IOT18 |	It looks like you're in a living room
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,624	| IOT18 |	You notice the couch
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,392	| IOT18 |	Table you noticed
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:29,536	| IOT18 |	And so we realize that once we explain to people what we were doing they were interested in the technology
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,816	| IOT18 |	But it was too
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:31,840	| IOT18 |	Scared when
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,608	| IOT18 |	1 1st Ave
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,120	| IOT18 |	Encountered
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,960	| IOT18 |	So the next experiment we ran we actually took
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,472	| IOT18 |	A difference
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,288	| IOT18 |	Set of vignettes all around the babies
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,104	| IOT18 |	And went to a different location in San Fran
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:47,200	| IOT18 |	Cisco and for another 3 days we set up our next iot playground
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,224	| IOT18 |	Did the team win
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:49,248	| IOT18 |	And we
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,576	| IOT18 |	Set up baby furniture and this time we made me
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,856	| IOT18 |	We spray painted everything White
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,416	| IOT18 |	And in the baby's room we had
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,464	| IOT18 |	Activate monitor we had
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,256	| IOT18 |	Sonos speaker
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:03,584	| IOT18 |	And once again we found that while we work to obscure the fern
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,912	| IOT18 |	We still had big furniture
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:10,240	| IOT18 |	Even though it's all painted white it just look like a room full of white furniture
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,008	| IOT18 |	Iran
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:11,776	| IOT18 |	Small products
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:15,360	| IOT18 |	So all of this design experimentation let us
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:21,760	| IOT18 |	To the recognition that if we really wanted to show these products working together in sit you in these various room
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,784	| IOT18 |	Rooms of a home
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,832	| IOT18 |	That we really needed to
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:29,184	| IOT18 |	Make that furniture both literally and figuratively transparent
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,720	| IOT18 |	Like make the product
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,232	| IOT18 |	The Stars
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:34,304	| IOT18 |	And show the data interactions
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,864	| IOT18 |	And the very real daily life
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:38,656	| IOT18 |	Problems that we all want help solving
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,472	| IOT18 |	Unfolding before our eyes and
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,496	| IOT18 |	And how these products
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,264	| IOT18 |	You're helping so
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:47,616	| IOT18 |	To your question of what do you see when you walk in you first see this house and
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,920	| IOT18 |	And you go from the living room into
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:52,992	| IOT18 |	To the bedroom into a baby's room a kitchen
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:59,392	| IOT18 |	And a garage and a backyard area each that has the appropriate connected products or literally show
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:01,184	| IOT18 |	Showing entire home
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:03,488	| IOT18 |	Experience from the front door to the back door and
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,536	| IOT18 |	The backyard and everything in between
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:09,632	| IOT18 |	So both with the house and with the Deep dive tables
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,936	| IOT18 |	A big part of the
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:16,288	| IOT18 |	The design is all around the stories of how these products connect and work
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,056	| IOT18 |	Work together
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:18,848	| IOT18 |	And then lastly there is a tree
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:20,640	| IOT18 |	Traditional shelf that has
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| IOT18 |	It's along the backbone
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,176	| IOT18 |	The sidewalk
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,992	| IOT18 |	That has products out of their boxes UK
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,784	| IOT18 |	Pick him up you can
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,856	| IOT18 |	Interact with them via the device that is paired to eat
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,648	| IOT18 |	Each one and so that's more
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,184	| IOT18 |	Opportunity to engage with
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,208	| IOT18 |	The product as is
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:36,000	| IOT18 |	As an individual product
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:42,144	| IOT18 |	They're the least number of products on that shelf as compared to the Deep dive
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,192	| IOT18 |	Got it
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,472	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,776	| IOT18 |	Is consumers you can actually purchase products
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:48,800	| IOT18 |	Guess
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:52,128	| IOT18 |	Every product we show is for sale
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:53,920	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,944	| IOT18 |	You guys have now been open
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,760	| IOT18 |	As of this conversation about a couple weeks
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,040	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,088	| IOT18 |	What have you seen so far
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| IOT18 |	Because
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,160	| IOT18 |	This is an entirely new way
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:06,976	| IOT18 |	And I have to applaud you for selling this way because
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:13,120	| IOT18 |	It is by far the most comprehensive plan I think I've seen for selling the Internet of Things
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,680	| IOT18 |	I've had a lot of retailers on the show in
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:19,776	| IOT18 |	And visited just about every store that sells connected gadgets
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| IOT18 |	Kind of understand
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,104	| IOT18 |	How this is being sold
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| IOT18 |	Because it's
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,432	| IOT18 |	Is very complicated you're trying to show
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:31,808	| IOT18 |	Most people are just popping single-use devices on a shelf or a hub on a Shelf
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,112	| IOT18 |	So it's hard to understand
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| IOT18 |	What products work
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,648	| IOT18 |	With what other
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,208	| IOT18 |	So I really like what you're doing
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,256	| IOT18 |	There are no plans though now to
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:41,536	| IOT18 |	Anywhere between
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,072	| IOT18 |	Right
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:46,656	| IOT18 |	You're right now this is a one-of-a-kind space and it's
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:48,192	| IOT18 |	Purpose of experimentation
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,728	| IOT18 |	So we put it there
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,520	| IOT18 |	Because all of the question
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:52,032	| IOT18 |	Is that
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,336	| IOT18 |	One of your listeners might ask
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,360	| IOT18 |	Or a Sceptre
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,432	| IOT18 |	Think about the overall connected-home and iot
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,200	| IOT18 |	T-space my ass
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,272	| IOT18 |	We think there's validity of every one of those question
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,064	| IOT18 |	We're focused on trying to get to the
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:10,208	| IOT18 |	Rather this is a place where we think we bring all of the right parties together in a salon like way
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:15,584	| IOT18 |	And just have dialogue that we never felt we could effectively had around the conference
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,632	| IOT18 |	Around my table
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,936	| IOT18 |	We can state that we're serious week
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,984	| IOT18 |	Can state that we intend to do certain things
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,312	| IOT18 |	But when you're standing inside that space and you and you
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,104	| IOT18 |	You see the care and
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,896	| IOT18 |	Design that went into what
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,664	| IOT18 |	We felt
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:32,992	| IOT18 |	It just makes for a very different conversation with the makers
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,528	| IOT18 |	In the platform players
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:38,368	| IOT18 |	Consumers I think they see it and it's a different way of
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,928	| IOT18 |	I've just understanding and for many who come in the space
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,208	| IOT18 |	It's the first time
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:45,024	| IOT18 |	But they're saying that they may not have the friends who have
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:48,608	| IOT18 |	Put Nest up on their wall or have a Sonos speaker in their house
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,144	| IOT18 |	So it's a it's
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:52,704	| IOT18 |	It's an opportunity to really just have a gift
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:56,032	| IOT18 |	Start a conversation in and gather a different set of observations
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,336	| IOT18 |	We thought we could do without it
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,920	| IOT18 |	So what are you seeing what are what are those conversations link
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:02,944	| IOT18 |	Are people buying
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:07,040	| IOT18 |	Your people are buying me I think first and foremost
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:11,392	| IOT18 |	Consumer response and they're sponsoring the target gas that have come through has been really
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:17,280	| IOT18 |	People really get it people find it very very educational and we find that both from those who know this
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:20,096	| IOT18 |	Space is lost those who down at the very least those who know the space
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:24,704	| IOT18 |	I probably seeing a few products is only read about or maybe haven't even
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,216	| IOT18 |	Inseam before
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,544	| IOT18 |	A people definitely appreciate seeing how they work
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,080	| IOT18 |	Together and those little story
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,872	| IOT18 |	One of my favorite is just
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,408	| IOT18 |	The role of a connector
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:33,920	| IOT18 |	Speaker in a baby
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,992	| IOT18 |	When the baby wakes up
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,040	| IOT18 |	If you have that connected baby monitor
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,624	| IOT18 |	Then if you want Beethoven playing at plays
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,160	| IOT18 |	Baby wakes up in the middle of the night
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:49,536	| IOT18 |	You have this option to either notify you immediately or to play some white noise
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,816	| IOT18 |	4 Hour lullaby
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:54,144	| IOT18 |	A minute or two to see if baby goes back to sleep
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:56,192	| IOT18 |	And when people see that I think they the
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:57,216	| IOT18 |	Promise of the
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,240	| IOT18 |	These products comes
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,008	| IOT18 |	Life
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,288	| IOT18 |	So there's been a lot of excitement
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:05,920	| IOT18 |	Hearing some vendors and other companies in the iot
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,944	| IOT18 |	T space is pretty
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,968	| IOT18 |	Consistently
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,248	| IOT18 |	This is what we need
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:11,296	| IOT18 |	We needed the space like this where week
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,832	| IOT18 |	Cast and weak
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,880	| IOT18 |	Can observe and we can do that
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:20,000	| IOT18 |	On a consistent basis and do it in in close proximity to all these other great Prada
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:24,608	| IOT18 |	So it's the dedication of the space has really resonated with the vendors and
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:28,704	| IOT18 |	I think it would be also really interesting from a troubleshooting perspective
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,264	| IOT18 |	Like for example
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,288	| IOT18 |	My house is
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,312	| IOT18 |	Probably not as
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,360	| IOT18 |	Pretty my friend is none of my furniture is
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:35,872	| IOT18 |	Is clear
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| IOT18 |	I can't see my devices
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:44,832	| IOT18 |	Just setting up devices together and trying to get them to work together
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,856	| IOT18 |	Is educational
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:48,928	| IOT18 |	Not just for me but for some of the vendors where I'm like
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:53,024	| IOT18 |	You see this works together but when I put them together
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,048	| IOT18 |	Did they actually don't work
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:29:59,936	| IOT18 |	Updater app
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,216	| IOT18 |	So have you had any
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,776	| IOT18 |	Examples where I don't know maybe
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:08,128	| IOT18 |	Maybe things didn't quite work out as planned and you helped kind of broker
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,408	| IOT18 |	Apache or maybe
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:11,200	| IOT18 |	To manufacturers like hey wait a second
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:16,832	| IOT18 |	Just by virtue of being in the same room with these guys we suddenly seeing it would be a great idea that we
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,344	| IOT18 |	We if we
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,624	| IOT18 |	Built-in
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,648	| IOT18 |	Integration together
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:23,744	| IOT18 |	It's a great question in fact we probably
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| IOT18 |	Had the most
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:25,536	| IOT18 |	Experience
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,328	| IOT18 |	In This Very topic
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,864	| IOT18 |	As we were designing the
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,888	| IOT18 |	Space where
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,192	| IOT18 |	There were stories we wanted to tell but
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:36,288	| IOT18 |	Products didn't necessarily there made one of the products maybe didn't yet have an open
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:36,800	| IOT18 |	API
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:40,640	| IOT18 |	Or you had a more restrictive API where access needed
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| IOT18 |	Be granted to a
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,200	| IOT18 |	Platformer differ
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:43,712	| IOT18 |	Product
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:50,624	| IOT18 |	So it was really interesting exciting just to have those early conversations with these companies and some of them
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,136	| IOT18 |	Has opened
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,160	| IOT18 |	Things up
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,744	| IOT18 |	Haven't had an open up app that API access
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,512	| IOT18 |	Prior
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:59,584	| IOT18 |	Or they've agreed to open it up so long as we have
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:04,960	| IOT18 |	The space up so they may be saying hey world will keep this open and as long as Target is doing this and
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:07,008	| IOT18 |	And committed to it will continue to serve
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,032	| IOT18 |	Supportive
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,544	| IOT18 |	Aspen grade
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,616	| IOT18 |	We've yet to run into any problems
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| IOT18 |	Games with any of the
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| IOT18 |	The products that we have connect
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:16,480	| IOT18 |	And part of that is acceleration that went into
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:19,808	| IOT18 |	Because we did The Upfront work to make sure everything works
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,624	| IOT18 |	We also did the diligence to ensure that
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:25,696	| IOT18 |	Yeah we were going to know if apis ever changed or
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:26,976	| IOT18 |	Any of those
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,768	| IOT18 |	Particulars that can
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,560	| IOT18 |	Can keep things from working
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,328	| IOT18 |	Together
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:37,472	| IOT18 |	It's also get that why we don't have every we're not trying to have every product available in the space
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,776	| IOT18 |	Is part of what goes into a select
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,800	| IOT18 |	Sing a product for the space
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,592	| IOT18 |	Is making sure that
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:44,128	| IOT18 |	It has that openness
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,664	| IOT18 |	And that reliability
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:46,944	| IOT18 |	Before we put it in the
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,736	| IOT18 |	Nice
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:52,832	| IOT18 |	So I have to ask because there's a huge component here
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:56,672	| IOT18 |	I'm bringing startups and interesting ideas to Target
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,440	| IOT18 |	Which
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:57,952	| IOT18 |	Is awesome
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:01,792	| IOT18 |	So if I am an iot startup or smart home startup
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,096	| IOT18 |	Who do I contact if I call you
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,632	| IOT18 |	To get into the space because
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,680	| IOT18 |	This isn't just
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,448	| IOT18 |	Hi
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,520	| IOT18 |	I want to I want to put a device here you're also talking about
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:12,800	| IOT18 |	Letting
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,080	| IOT18 |	Companies come in and
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,640	| IOT18 |	You know create focus groups to talk to
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:23,808	| IOT18 |	And I'm not sure how great it would be to talk to the San Francisco focus groups I think talking maybe to the people in Boise might be better
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,320	| IOT18 |	But you know
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,880	| IOT18 |	Still getting in front of you so she would be good
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,928	| IOT18 |	So how how did
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:31,232	| IOT18 |	What kind of programs do you envision for startups
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,512	| IOT18 |	Then how can I get involved
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:35,072	| IOT18 |	Well first off in terms of talking to that
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:40,448	| IOT18 |	Consumer from Boise the nice thing about the location being directly across from the Moscone Center
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:44,288	| IOT18 |	Is that we do get a lot of traffic from the conventions
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,336	| IOT18 |	There there which is really interesting because
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,872	| IOT18 |	You're on any given day
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:49,920	| IOT18 |	Last week the semicon
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:50,944	| IOT18 |	Conference
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:53,248	| IOT18 |	Which is all about for the semiconductor industry
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:57,088	| IOT18 |	And so understandably a lot of interest in the space
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:33:00,160	| IOT18 |	Many of the makers of these chips that are in the products were coming
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:00,928	| IOT18 |	Through
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,720	| IOT18 |	And so everyone was from
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,744	| IOT18 |	Someplace different
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,024	| IOT18 |	And so that's that's an exciting
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:07,584	| IOT18 |	Part about the location and why we sleep
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:11,936	| IOT18 |	Which shows that this is the singular location for this one
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:12,960	| IOT18 |	Find face
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,984	| IOT18 |	In terms of
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:16,032	| IOT18 |	Companies wanting to
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:18,080	| IOT18 |	Come into the space the first thing is
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:20,384	| IOT18 |	We have to get familiar with what we're doing
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,920	| IOT18 |	Before we even start talking
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:27,808	| IOT18 |	The best thing to do is you only have a website that can give you a high level overview that's open house. Target.com
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:30,368	| IOT18 |	And then by all means if you're in the area
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:30,880	| IOT18 |	Come on Inn
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:31,904	| IOT18 |	Explore the space
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,720	| IOT18 |	And then in terms of actually putting a product
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:41,120	| IOT18 |	In others there's a couple ways we recommend on that website open house. Target.com we have our email
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:45,984	| IOT18 |	Address we also have instructions of how to contact us BR Twitter handle
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:51,360	| IOT18 |	And give us awareness of your product and that will that will set off a
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:52,896	| IOT18 |	A series of follow-up conversation
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,200	| IOT18 |	And what's really exciting is
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,272	| IOT18 |	You're giving that weed this is not our
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,552	| IOT18 |	This is not a date
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,600	| IOT18 |	Restore roll out of this experience
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:06,976	| IOT18 |	The conversations are not of that nature of how do you get a peg or how do you get a
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,768	| IOT18 |	A space on the Shelf but rather
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,048	| IOT18 |	How do you fit into this eco
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:13,376	| IOT18 |	What are those what are those everyday life
EDL	00:34:13,376	00:34:14,400	| IOT18 |	Scenarios
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,424	| IOT18 |	You're helping.
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,448	| IOT18 |	Solve and make better
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,752	| IOT18 |	And how would you fit in in this house
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:20,288	| IOT18 |	Put you in the house what room would you be
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:23,360	| IOT18 |	What other products if any would you be interacting
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:26,688	| IOT18 |	And same with the tables we can point out how
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:28,480	| IOT18 |	Product on the on the interact
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,272	| IOT18 |	Cable it doesn't connect to any
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,856	| IOT18 |	Is actually less interesting from that Interactive
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:36,928	| IOT18 |	Experience Ben are other products bad
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:37,696	| IOT18 |	Have a whole lot of
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:40,256	| IOT18 |	And frankly we found this.
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:45,376	| IOT18 |	Unexpected on their side so if they're used to wanting your getting questions about
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:50,496	| IOT18 |	Their supply chain efficiency or their packaging or what not
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,800	| IOT18 |	And we really want to know is you and what what
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:55,872	| IOT18 |	What's the story what story are we telling here because
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,664	| IOT18 |	This is all part of
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,688	| IOT18 |	A bigger
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:01,504	| IOT18 |	Endeavor on our behalf to understand
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:07,392	| IOT18 |	What role do we target play in this overall ecosystem how do we bring broader value to it
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,928	| IOT18 |	And how does the consumer Bennett
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:14,560	| IOT18 |	Cuz I want all those pieces come together that's when that's when an industry is really that's when it really starts
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,072	| IOT18 |	Takeoff
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:18,144	| IOT18 |	I like that I like that kind of mentality
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:22,240	| IOT18 |	Although Supply chains will eventually come in handy that's not your focus here
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,288	| IOT18 |	I think it's worth pointing
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,056	| IOT18 |	Out
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:25,568	| IOT18 |	Because
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:30,688	| IOT18 |	You're not the steppingstone necessarily to all 1800 Target
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,200	| IOT18 |	Acrostic
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:36,320	| IOT18 |	No but we certainly we are part of Target and we can help with
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:41,696	| IOT18 |	Are Merchants I was just just recently with our electronics and home
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:46,048	| IOT18 |	Merchandising leadership and brainstorming on all of the different things they want
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:46,816	| IOT18 |	What to do on the space
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:50,144	| IOT18 |	Whether it's a product launch where if it's
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,168	| IOT18 |	Thanks
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,448	| IOT18 |	Target do we Leverage
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,472	| IOT18 |	Space to launch it
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:57,056	| IOT18 |	It's certainly a lot around prospecting new and exciting products
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,336	| IOT18 |	And also around
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,616	| IOT18 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:02,432	| IOT18 |	It's the right product the way we operate very big box
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:05,248	| IOT18 |	And so the right product in the wrong space
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,296	| IOT18 |	Can be another challenge end
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:09,600	| IOT18 |	You take a product like tile everyone under
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,112	| IOT18 |	Stand for you
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:11,648	| IOT18 |	Yorkies
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:15,232	| IOT18 |	But where do you where do Yorkies come into play in your shopping app
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:21,376	| IOT18 |	Experience in our box is it as you're looking at a bike and you're thinking about a bike lock and you're losing your key
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,704	| IOT18 |	Your bike lock keys while you're on a bike ride is that a great place
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:26,496	| IOT18 |	Sonos
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:30,080	| IOT18 |	Has application in the baby's room and in the living room and
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:31,104	| IOT18 |	In electronics and
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:35,968	| IOT18 |	That's a you know that is a new challenge from multi-category retailer to
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:36,736	| IOT18 |	Kcon
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:41,856	| IOT18 |	So that some of those it those are the conversations we want to be having and that's where I can
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:43,904	| IOT18 |	Take the bridge between what we're doing it open
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:47,488	| IOT18 |	In house and what goes on Bradley at Target I think that's
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,768	| IOT18 |	That's one of those big connection
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,304	| IOT18 |	That's true
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:50,816	| IOT18 |	Although
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:53,376	| IOT18 |	I'm not sure the
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,656	| IOT18 |	The merchants are not the merchant
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,192	| IOT18 |	DIA
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,728	| IOT18 |	Manufacturers
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:58,752	| IOT18 |	The product companies field
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:01,056	| IOT18 |	No we want the stores
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:05,920	| IOT18 |	I should say because Kevin and I talked about this a couple of weeks ago when this lunch
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,200	| IOT18 |	And
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:13,344	| IOT18 |	You guys took issue with how he described it which I totally understand so Kevin and I said that this was in
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,648	| IOT18 |	The basement
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:17,696	| IOT18 |	Of the city Target across from a scone
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:24,608	| IOT18 |	And you were quick to point out that this is not actually a basement which sperm any probably conjures up get of darkened
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,888	| IOT18 |	Dingy places that
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,168	| IOT18 |	We're scared of
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,216	| IOT18 |	This is actually at the ground floor level
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,520	| IOT18 |	We I was just thinking it
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:36,128	| IOT18 |	Underneath the the main target which starts at the second floor
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,896	| IOT18 |	Ourself
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:38,176	| IOT18 |	This is street level
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:40,480	| IOT18 |	Florida City Target
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,760	| IOT18 |	Not the basement
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,808	| IOT18 |	So that that was one
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:44,576	| IOT18 |	One big
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:46,368	| IOT18 |	You know things that we should clarify for
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,416	| IOT18 |	People it's at 4th and Mission so
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,184	| IOT18 |	If you were there
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:51,488	| IOT18 |	And I'm hoping to be there at the
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,768	| IOT18 |	End of August so
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,840	| IOT18 |	You know I will let you guys know so I can pop in and
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| IOT18 |	Play around but
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:58,400	| IOT18 |	I think David
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:37:59,168	| IOT18 |	I
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:00,192	| IOT18 |	I have really enjoyed talking
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:02,240	| IOT18 |	Into you I cannot wait to go
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,008	| IOT18 |	Play
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:03,776	| IOT18 |	And see
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:04,800	| IOT18 |	I'm going to ask you
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:10,176	| IOT18 |	Has it have you changed anything do you have any connected Gadgets in your house or you know
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:13,760	| IOT18 |	Found a use case that you hadn't thought of in in putting this together
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:16,064	| IOT18 |	You use casewise those aha moments
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,368	| IOT18 |	We keep having them in
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:21,952	| IOT18 |	The happening at unusual moment
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,464	| IOT18 |	So
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:24,000	| IOT18 |	Things like
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:26,048	| IOT18 |	The role of Sonos in a babies
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,840	| IOT18 |	Things like
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,608	| IOT18 |	The important
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:32,704	| IOT18 |	Where in your house might you be most in
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:33,984	| IOT18 |	Interested in having the
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:35,264	| IOT18 |	Screen that shows
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,568	| IOT18 |	And the ring what's happening on your ring doorbell
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:40,128	| IOT18 |	Or what are you picking up on your Dropcam
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:44,992	| IOT18 |	I think when you see it in in the house you get to actually imagine
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:45,760	| IOT18 |	Products
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:46,272	| IOT18 |	Different location
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:50,880	| IOT18 |	We were doing as we were designing these early playgrounds we were talking
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:51,648	| IOT18 |	2
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,440	| IOT18 |	Consumers in their home
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:55,488	| IOT18 |	In their homes and
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:57,024	| IOT18 |	When you should one of them
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:59,584	| IOT18 |	Tile product which they haven't seen before
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,864	| IOT18 |	They were in process
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:04,448	| IOT18 |	Storing a bunch of boxes in their garage
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:06,752	| IOT18 |	And ask the question will can I put a tile in
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:07,264	| IOT18 |	Chinese box
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:10,080	| IOT18 |	And then link that tile to the right
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:10,848	| IOT18 |	Piece of my spreadsheet
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:15,968	| IOT18 |	To tell me so I can quickly find anything that I put away and so a year from now I'll remember end
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:20,576	| IOT18 |	That was another one of those aha moments it also gets into interesting question
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:22,624	| IOT18 |	Around that use case and the
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,648	| IOT18 |	Expected battery life
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:24,928	| IOT18 |	Thailand so
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:27,232	| IOT18 |	There are all sorts of these moments
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,768	| IOT18 |	It's undeniable that this
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:33,120	| IOT18 |	This is coming you'll be very hard-pressed to find a baby monitor in the next few years it is
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:33,632	| IOT18 |	Connected
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:37,216	| IOT18 |	Lost Art probably owning a piece of apparel that might have
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,496	| IOT18 |	Ships
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,776	| IOT18 |	Sensors in it
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:43,360	| IOT18 |	I'm wrong thermostats are probably going to Aldi connected
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:45,152	| IOT18 |	Shemar Moore store
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,432	| IOT18 |	These products will be
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:51,552	| IOT18 |	Connected and that means that we we need good answers to how do you showcase
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:54,368	| IOT18 |	Please because if you put them all together into a single connected
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,952	| IOT18 |	Kidspace what do you do when everything is finally connected and you have to start taking it
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| IOT18 |	Apart again
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:02,304	| IOT18 |	Tell for me I'm following the curves of what the market research
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:06,656	| IOT18 |	Search is telling us that the growth rate for these products in the in a home is
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,192	| IOT18 |	Upwards of 30
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:12,288	| IOT18 |	2% so I went from one couple years ago to 2 to 6
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,056	| IOT18 |	Send
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,848	| IOT18 |	When you're growing fast so I
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:16,896	| IOT18 |	I continue to enjoy experimenting and
