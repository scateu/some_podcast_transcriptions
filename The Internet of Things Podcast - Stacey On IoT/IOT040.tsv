EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:18,176	| IOT040 |	It is
EDL	00:00:18,176	00:00:19,456	| IOT040 |	CES time

EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:26,880	| IOT040 |	At home for the first time in ten years during CES week
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:29,696	| IOT040 |	He has earned his break but he did confess
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,976	| IOT040 |	To be that he misses the
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:33,280	| IOT040 |	Hustle the bustle the fun of hanging out
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:34,816	| IOT040 |	Baidu
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:41,216	| IOT040 |	Why do we always have such a good time at CES last year we hung out and it was a fun time on the plus side you probably have better weather cuz it's like
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:47,360	| IOT040 |	11 freaking degrees where I am in Pennsylvania right now
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:51,456	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,272	| IOT040 |	I'm good I'm good
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:01:00,672	| IOT040 |	I've technically because of the weird time constraints of podcast recording and editing process
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:03,488	| IOT040 |	You know we're going to do a little time travel to play a little
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:07,328	| IOT040 |	I have only seen
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,608	| IOT040 |	Like day one
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:09,888	| IOT040 |	Actually date
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:10,912	| IOT040 |	Day one and a half
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:12,960	| IOT040 |	But
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:14,496	| IOT040 |	I see the light I feel
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,264	| IOT040 |	I feel good
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:15,776	| IOT040 |	About what I said
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:18,336	| IOT040 |	So we're going to start off the show
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:22,432	| IOT040 |	With everybody's favorite platform the only true Internet of Things
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:25,248	| IOT040 |	Myvue which is
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,784	| IOT040 |	The Amazon Echo
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:29,344	| IOT040 |	She who shall not be named
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,624	| IOT040 |	Is playing a starring role
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:31,648	| IOT040 |	Addition show
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:32,928	| IOT040 |	Everyone
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| IOT040 |	Is integrating
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:35,488	| IOT040 |	With chicken
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,024	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:37,792	| IOT040 |	The echo
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:38,560	| IOT040 |	Kevin what-have-you
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:42,656	| IOT040 |	Well I seen a bunch a lot of people are
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:49,056	| IOT040 |	Cortical planning to do Integrations it's going to take them some time but one of the biggest that I'm intrigued about
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:50,080	| IOT040 |	Is actually Ford
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:53,408	| IOT040 |	Ford is working on Amazon Echo integration
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:59,040	| IOT040 |	Which you like well why would they do that with their sync platform in the car what does that have to do with
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,088	| IOT040 |	That cylinder that sitting in my
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:01,856	| IOT040 |	In my house
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,416	| IOT040 |	It's kind of interesting it's a two-way
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,720	| IOT040 |	Connection and here's how it kind of works
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:10,304	| IOT040 |	You will be able to control your
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:16,704	| IOT040 |	Home Smart Home devices that you would normally with your Echo from your car so let's say your
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:19,008	| IOT040 |	5 miles from home and you're like oh you know what
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:24,128	| IOT040 |	It's getting dark out I don't want to come into a dark home I'm just going to tell my echo through the car
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,920	| IOT040 |	Turn on my lights
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,224	| IOT040 |	Obviously have had at 7 to dance but
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:31,552	| IOT040 |	It's kind of one of the core things that people do with Amazon Echo right now
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:37,440	| IOT040 |	So that's kind of cool you can modify your temperature and so on directly from the car through voice navigation
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:41,024	| IOT040 |	The only way around 2 if you're sitting around at home
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:45,632	| IOT040 |	And you like I wonder if I need gas in my Ford vehicle you can ask the echo
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:52,288	| IOT040 |	What's the range on my car right now and it will tell you how many miles you have to go before you run out of gas
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:58,688	| IOT040 |	If you got remote car starting in your car as well you can remotely start the car with your Echo it's a
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:03,040	| IOT040 |	Cool two-way sync to me it's not one that was obvious immediately to me
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:06,368	| IOT040 |	That sounds really cool so I actually tested something like this
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:07,904	| IOT040 |	4
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,208	| IOT040 |	Okay I'm just going to say it for my Tesla
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:14,816	| IOT040 |	It was a software program
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:17,120	| IOT040 |	It was a software program called
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,216	| IOT040 |	And it is Kali for Tesla
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,800	| IOT040 |	And it works through the website on the car
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:27,360	| IOT040 |	And it was an integration with the wink
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,128	| IOT040 |	Hub
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,152	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| IOT040 |	Yeah okay there was
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,504	| IOT040 |	I thought it was actually pretty cool
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,528	| IOT040 |	Except
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,808	| IOT040 |	Because of the way the
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,832	| IOT040 |	Tesla update
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,648	| IOT040 |	It took forever to do anything with me
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,160	| IOT040 |	My smartphone
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,184	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,976	| IOT040 |	I'm actually kind of jealous
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,280	| IOT040 |	Because now I kind of want to have Tesla
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,816	| IOT040 |	Immigration
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,328	| IOT040 |	Quit Amazon
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,376	| IOT040 |	Do you hear that Eli please
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,192	| IOT040 |	Or I want these guys to make
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,472	| IOT040 |	Well if it's a Tesla issue
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:04:00,384	| IOT040 |	I want this to be a lot faster because I actually found it super convenient when it worked on time because I would live
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,920	| IOT040 |	Literally just drive away
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,200	| IOT040 |	In my garage door
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,480	| IOT040 |	From the Chamberlain
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| IOT040 |	We just closed
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:09,088	| IOT040 |	Because it was like Hey Stacy's cars driving off
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,672	| IOT040 |	I mean I know it's this is voice activated but I would totally talked
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,720	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,768	| IOT040 |	I love it and I love it that it's
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,047	| IOT040 |	804
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,583	| IOT040 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,863	| IOT040 |	Okay so you guys
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,887	| IOT040 |	If you have an echo
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:22,911	| IOT040 |	Totally
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:23,935	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,263	| IOT040 |	With a sinking car
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:33,663	| IOT040 |	Yep and I should mention that they have not provide a timeline for this Ford has not and only because you mentioned wink they said there are
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,967	| IOT040 |	Also working on a similar integration with wink
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:39,039	| IOT040 |	So even if you don't have an echo but you have a wink
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,575	| IOT040 |	You're going to be able to do some cool things
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,111	| IOT040 |	Oh my God if you have the wink
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,391	| IOT040 |	When they integrate this
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,671	| IOT040 |	Go out
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| IOT040 |	Get the garage
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,511	| IOT040 |	Because not using
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| IOT040 |	Using your voice
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,327	| IOT040 |	To control your garage door
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| IOT040 |	Or just using
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| IOT040 |	Cartoon
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,935	| IOT040 |	Control your garage door without like having to press buttons
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:58,751	| IOT040 |	I'll be honest
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:04:59,775	| IOT040 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| IOT040 |	So that's
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| IOT040 |	1
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| IOT040 |	Play Store
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,407	| IOT040 |	Again
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,455	| IOT040 |	Superstar
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:09,247	| IOT040 |	Total Superstar at CVS
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,319	| IOT040 |	There an alarm.com both announced
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,855	| IOT040 |	Alexa
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,671	| IOT040 |	DocuSign
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,487	| IOT040 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,767	| IOT040 |	Announce
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,535	| IOT040 |	Integrations
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| IOT040 |	With she who shall not be named
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,375	| IOT040 |	Alarm.com
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| IOT040 |	Did it through a skill
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,703	| IOT040 |	And so did
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,471	| IOT040 |	Didn't
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,519	| IOT040 |	It's worth pointing out you guys
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,055	| IOT040 |	We haven't talked about
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| IOT040 |	Like skills
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,383	| IOT040 |	Skills yet for the show and we should
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,407	| IOT040 |	Because
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,455	| IOT040 |	Right now Amazon through it
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,271	| IOT040 |	You know straight up connected home
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:46,111	| IOT040 |	Paris in the settings where you go to discover new devices only really supports
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,647	| IOT040 |	Lights for the smart
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,951	| IOT040 |	So you can say things like
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,743	| IOT040 |	Switch on this turn on that
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:57,119	| IOT040 |	So what a lot of companies are doing to give you more kind of freedom to do cool things like
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,423	| IOT040 |	So it's so tell my house to go to sleep
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,959	| IOT040 |	They're using skills
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,543	| IOT040 |	It what you do to enable the skill is just going settings and
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,591	| IOT040 |	You go to skills in you
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| IOT040 |	Enable
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| IOT040 |	Like all kinds of stuff
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:15,295	| IOT040 |	And they have all kinds like when I told you guys about playing bingo that's a skill they have like a 7-minute workout you can able
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,831	| IOT040 |	Which I've done and it's
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,903	| IOT040 |	Kind of chill because she is not a great coach she's just like
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,183	| IOT040 |	Do jumping jacks
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,719	| IOT040 |	Jay
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,023	| IOT040 |	It's okay
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:29,375	| IOT040 |	So you can enable like the alarm.com you have a
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,679	| IOT040 |	A sentence that you say to enable it
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,727	| IOT040 |	And then boom. Action
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,031	| IOT040 |	And so through these things
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:39,103	| IOT040 |	People are actually enabling all these really in-depth
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,895	| IOT040 |	Kind of smart home
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:47,807	| IOT040 |	Challenges you have to have the code words remember exactly the thing to say
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,087	| IOT040 |	Which can be hard
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| IOT040 |	Especially if you're going to bed
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| IOT040 |	Or your garage in your waking up in the
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,439	| IOT040 |	But the benefit is
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,487	| IOT040 |	Like with Vivint you can actually
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| IOT040 |	Close your locks
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,327	| IOT040 |	You can turn off your thermostat
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,351	| IOT040 |	You can
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| IOT040 |	All kinds of fun stuff
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:05,215	| IOT040 |	With the alarm.com you can
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,799	| IOT040 |	Pretty much only control your I think it's your lights and
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,639	| IOT040 |	A couple other things cuz they were actually concerned about the security part
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,943	| IOT040 |	About the you control your locks
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,455	| IOT040 |	With your boys
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,503	| IOT040 |	I also heard
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,039	| IOT040 |	This is the gossip at CES
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:22,879	| IOT040 |	Amazon later this year is going to be coming out with some
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,183	| IOT040 |	Deeper cooler Smart Home
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,487	| IOT040 |	Kind of platform stuff
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| IOT040 |	At the actual
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,047	| IOT040 |	Platform
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,095	| IOT040 |	Also not just letting you control your lights
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| IOT040 |	What those will be
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:34,911	| IOT040 |	Percent sure yet
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,751	| IOT040 |	So if I'm understanding what skills are
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT040 |	Date
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:43,871	| IOT040 |	Can you cut your native features that Amazon is baking into the echo
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:46,431	| IOT040 |	That can work with other cloud services and such
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:51,807	| IOT040 |	But the skills seem to be third-party if Amazon is not doing it natively you can still add things and
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:56,159	| IOT040 |	Perfect one is AccuWeather has is a skill you know if you enable you can say
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,695	| IOT040 |	Echo
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:01,279	| IOT040 |	Singer named Echo ask AccuWeather what time the Sun will rise and
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,351	| IOT040 |	Because of a table parse out there that phrase and
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,167	| IOT040 |	Use the AccuWeather skilled AccuWeather is created
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,959	| IOT040 |	And return the information so
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,239	| IOT040 |	You know it's interesting
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:13,055	| IOT040 |	That we're seeing so many Integrations here and I think it's
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,103	| IOT040 |	It speaks to what we were talking about before with us
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,151	| IOT040 |	It's just a wide open platform
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| IOT040 |	That's the beauty of the echo
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,247	| IOT040 |	It is
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:24,575	| IOT040 |	You have the option of remembering your complicated phraseology
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,879	| IOT040 |	And in some of it
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,903	| IOT040 |	It's not really
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,719	| IOT040 |	Pacific specific
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,999	| IOT040 |	And the cool thing is
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,791	| IOT040 |	You have the option of enabling the
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,631	| IOT040 |	If you don't want me there is a farting
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,423	| IOT040 |	Scale so if you don't want the fighting skill
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,959	| IOT040 |	You will
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,007	| IOT040 |	Forever free
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,823	| IOT040 |	The word fart around she Who Shall Not Be Named without
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,359	| IOT040 |	Ever having
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| IOT040 |	The dangerous
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,431	| IOT040 |	. wonderful farting sounds
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:54,527	| IOT040 |	I can't believe that's the top skill in my list right now
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,575	| IOT040 |	We did it
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,367	| IOT040 |	For a little bit
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,391	| IOT040 |	Didn't
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:06,559	| IOT040 |	It's actually not very good I've got to be honest we were not impressed with the first results
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:07,839	| IOT040 |	So you know
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,351	| IOT040 |	Just so you guys
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,983	| IOT040 |	I think they're advertising its it's
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,263	| IOT040 |	It starts with a number
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:15,775	| IOT040 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,615	| IOT040 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,943	| IOT040 |	So other things are getting Amazon Echo
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,223	| IOT040 |	Commands that we saw
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,807	| IOT040 |	I saw a radio this is actually it's called
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,319	| IOT040 |	Chubby
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,367	| IOT040 |	It's my company called in
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| IOT040 |	Noxious
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| IOT040 |	It is a
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| IOT040 |	Kitchen radio
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:38,559	| IOT040 |	And you could actually be one of the first devices using
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,095	| IOT040 |	The A's
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,375	| IOT040 |	Voice
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,143	| IOT040 |	Services
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,447	| IOT040 |	So it's built in
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| IOT040 |	To the device
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,567	| IOT040 |	That you can talk to it and it uses
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,359	| IOT040 |	The Voice Services platform
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,175	| IOT040 |	Music you can ask it to do anything
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:56,479	| IOT040 |	Anna talks to the Cloud Inn
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,247	| IOT040 |	That boys
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| IOT040 |	It's very cool
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,599	| IOT040 |	It's designed to sit
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| IOT040 |	On your kitchen
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| IOT040 |	Bridge Inn
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,439	| IOT040 |	Just be like
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| IOT040 |	The school radio
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,535	| IOT040 |	And I'm trying to remember when it goes on sale
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,583	| IOT040 |	Because that would be useful for you
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,119	| IOT040 |	It's triby by invoxia
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,679	| IOT040 |	This is what happens when you
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,215	| IOT040 |	Gradually are going senile
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:20,287	| IOT040 |	It's a connected speaker for the kitchen
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:24,639	| IOT040 |	Is $199 and it has little Message Board to
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,151	| IOT040 |	That you can write on
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,455	| IOT040 |	It comes in blue
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,479	| IOT040 |	Red and green
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:32,831	| IOT040 |	I wonder how many products this year will actually integrate the
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,111	| IOT040 |	Echo voice services
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,903	| IOT040 |	Because it's
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:41,535	| IOT040 |	Kind of like having Echoes all over the place it's at some point you noticed any gives you that whole consistent user experience
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,327	| IOT040 |	I can't wait for it to be in my back
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,375	| IOT040 |	Iwata vacuum cleaner that I can
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:47,935	| IOT040 |	Like vacuum
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,215	| IOT040 |	Really that's all I
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,031	| IOT040 |	I'm a simple woman
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:57,151	| IOT040 |	Okay so other the final integration that we talked about is
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,711	| IOT040 |	Wonderworld little unclear on what is intriguing
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,735	| IOT040 |	It is
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,319	| IOT040 |	Lumos still around this is
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,975	| IOT040 |	2009 it had it was one of Ashton Kutcher's First Tech Investments
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| IOT040 |	I know it's a winner
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,303	| IOT040 |	I just
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,351	| IOT040 |	Menarche
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,911	| IOT040 |	So what is up
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,679	| IOT040 |	Avoid
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:21,471	| IOT040 |	Don't copy came out is like
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,751	| IOT040 |	Back in the early days of weight
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| IOT040 |	Hey
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,871	| IOT040 |	Let's give it a hand for still being around
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,919	| IOT040 |	It's a phone and a little
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| IOT040 |	It's basically a hub
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,991	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,271	| IOT040 |	You can program
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:36,831	| IOT040 |	People's phone numbers in and you can tell it
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:41,695	| IOT040 |	And now you can use the Echo and say hey,
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,719	| IOT040 |	It's another skill
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| IOT040 |	Hey so-and-so
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,815	| IOT040 |	Ask
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,583	| IOT040 |	Better call Bob
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,351	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,119	| IOT040 |	Lo and behold
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,447	| IOT040 |	What year does it happen is the question
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,007	| IOT040 |	Yes we don't know if
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:57,055	| IOT040 |	What I know is
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,847	| IOT040 |	Echo cannot
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,871	| IOT040 |	Or could not
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,943	| IOT040 |	Camp right unless it is change it could not act
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,479	| IOT040 |	A speaker
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,831	| IOT040 |	Like a Bluetooth speaker for hands-free phone calling speaker right
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,903	| IOT040 |	It could act as a Bluetooth speaker for your music but it could not
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:14,207	| IOT040 |	Act is a hands-free speaker for you
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:18,303	| IOT040 |	I don't know if that's changed my has done something weird
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:18,815	| IOT040 |	Using
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:19,839	| IOT040 |	The scales
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,375	| IOT040 |	Or if it's just
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,959	| IOT040 |	Like basically then takes your phone in like
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| IOT040 |	Calls your mom
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:28,799	| IOT040 |	Yeah that's at the thing if it just does that if it just
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,895	| IOT040 |	You know it saves you from dialing and I'm like okay but
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:36,223	| IOT040 |	If it actually Taps into the microphone and the speaker of
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:40,831	| IOT040 |	The Amazon Echo hardware and let you complete the call hands-free right
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,855	| IOT040 |	Speaking to
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,367	| IOT040 |	The device
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,415	| IOT040 |	Venom I'm interested
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,207	| IOT040 |	Yeah cuz that changes the function of the device
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,535	| IOT040 |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| IOT040 |	Puma
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,095	| IOT040 |	Adecco
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,655	| IOT040 |	And wants to enable the skill and let us know
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:55,935	| IOT040 |	Interstellar
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| IOT040 |	You're going to email it
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:58,751	| IOT040 |	Info
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,407	| IOT040 |	Call Me Maybe
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,759	| IOT040 |	Okay so that was our first segment
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,575	| IOT040 |	On really cool things that have happened with the Amazon Echo at sea
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:13,855	| IOT040 |	So far
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| IOT040 |	Now let's talk about
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,231	| IOT040 |	Because
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,511	| IOT040 |	I love it
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:23,839	| IOT040 |	I know I've been shipped nerd and we have got a lot of radio news
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,351	| IOT040 |	Started with
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| IOT040 |	Halo Halo
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:33,567	| IOT040 |	Hello Halo CE I ain't like the news here from the Wi-Fi Alliance about this new 802. 11n a h or
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| IOT040 |	As I like to call it
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:38,175	| IOT040 |	Halo is the friendly name for attitude at 11 a.m.
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,527	| IOT040 |	You're not too keen on this and I want to hear why but let me just explain what it is
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,551	| IOT040 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:47,903	| IOT040 |	Says that by 2018 will be certifying products that use the standard
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:52,255	| IOT040 |	It's mainly meant for Internet of Things devices because it uses
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,791	| IOT040 |	Low power
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:56,863	| IOT040 |	And will not transmit data very fast but
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,143	| IOT040 |	That's okay with
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:01,727	| IOT040 |	Are the small bits of data that devices in the house actually word
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,775	| IOT040 |	In the reprise actually yeah
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:04,543	| IOT040 |	Transmit
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:08,127	| IOT040 |	Can you use the 900 megahertz unlicensed Spectrum band
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:12,479	| IOT040 |	And that gives it better range than current Wi-Fi Solutions
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,783	| IOT040 |	I think it sounds like a win
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:18,879	| IOT040 |	But before the show you're like I'm not sold on that and you didn't tell me why so why
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:19,903	| IOT040 |	All right
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| IOT040 |	Mostly because I have more question
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,487	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,279	| IOT040 |	Wi-Fi alliances
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,303	| IOT040 |	Talked about the 900
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:30,655	| IOT040 |	What you guys need to know about that is it is
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,679	| IOT040 |	Really awesome Spectra
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:37,055	| IOT040 |	It is currently used for a lot of things because it is so awesome so it
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| IOT040 |	Microwaves
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:38,847	| IOT040 |	Baby Mana
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| IOT040 |	Garage door open
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,663	| IOT040 |	It's a really crowded
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:42,943	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,503	| IOT040 |	Really crowded Spectrum lot of opportunity for interference
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,063	| IOT040 |	It also is great because it goes through
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,831	| IOT040 |	Walls
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:52,415	| IOT040 |	Which means you can stick stuff in your basement you're going to get an awesome signal
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,695	| IOT040 |	That's why they're really pumped about it
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,279	| IOT040 |	But in other countries
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:00,351	| IOT040 |	Like in parts of Asia and Europe actually
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:04,191	| IOT040 |	It's also part is like the is M BAND that is used for cellular
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,215	| IOT040 |	Guess so
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,775	| IOT040 |	Third kind of like wool
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:13,663	| IOT040 |	Is this unified for the rest of the world or is this us only so there's some questions about how that Spectrum
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,455	| IOT040 |	Going to be used for like
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:15,967	| IOT040 |	All of it
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:18,015	| IOT040 |	Where is currently the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,807	| IOT040 |	Bands that we have now
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,343	| IOT040 |	Arbroath wide
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| IOT040 |	Everywhere
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,695	| IOT040 |	The Wi-Fi Alliance doesn't have
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,207	| IOT040 |	Great answer
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,279	| IOT040 |	So that's question number one we're like
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:34,655	| IOT040 |	And because it's unlicensed spectrum they really can't control it so that's that's an issue
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,935	| IOT040 |	It is
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,215	| IOT040 |	How big of an issue
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,495	| IOT040 |	We will see
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| IOT040 |	We will see
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:39,775	| IOT040 |	2
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:44,383	| IOT040 |	Last year when I was talking to the chipmaker's about
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,687	| IOT040 |	They were really skeptical about the
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,503	| IOT040 |	Power draw and I asked the Wi-Fi a lion sound like
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,271	| IOT040 |	Hey
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,575	| IOT040 |	They're kind of positioning this to be kind of like
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,855	| IOT040 |	Competitor to Bluetooth
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:57,695	| IOT040 |	Not necessarily Bluetooth low energy but they were talking about using it wearables
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,207	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,023	| IOT040 |	That's a really big deal because
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,303	| IOT040 |	Syfy sucks
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,071	| IOT040 |	Power
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,607	| IOT040 |	I mean it's a great don't give me wrong
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,655	| IOT040 |	But you know there's always tradeoffs when you're
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,935	| IOT040 |	Engineering something
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,031	| IOT040 |	Because the alliance didn't
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,543	| IOT040 |	Give me
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,359	| IOT040 |	The power draw they just didn't have it
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:15,871	| IOT040 |	They're like nope
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:24,063	| IOT040 |	I really curious if in the years since I've last talked to these guys and that's that's what I'm about to find out
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,087	| IOT040 |	I'm talking to guys today
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,111	| IOT040 |	Is
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,647	| IOT040 |	Have they fix that problem
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,463	| IOT040 |	I mean a year is a long time when your engineer
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| IOT040 |	Lyrics oh
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,511	| IOT040 |	Maybe they have
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,815	| IOT040 |	When I last talked to people about age they were like
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,607	| IOT040 |	Stacy
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| IOT040 |	Is
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| IOT040 |	Better
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,423	| IOT040 |	But it is
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:39,935	| IOT040 |	Not
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:40,959	| IOT040 |	Bluetooth
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,239	| IOT040 |	Bro
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:42,751	| IOT040 |	Better
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,031	| IOT040 |	You know
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,823	| IOT040 |	Better is good
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,615	| IOT040 |	It's not something you could put in the world
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:50,687	| IOT040 |	Or a sensor that you know you really want to be battery powered
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,223	| IOT040 |	That's another question
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,783	| IOT040 |	So those are my big questions about
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:58,367	| IOT040 |	I'm not saying that that's going to kill this at all
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,903	| IOT040 |	Has changed
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,439	| IOT040 |	It feels
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:03,743	| IOT040 |	Barry marketing at this point
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:07,839	| IOT040 |	What's the Wi-Fi Alliance has a marketing organization and they have to go into the Internet of Things
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,191	| IOT040 |	If they're doing this and positioning this is like a technology that you
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,727	| IOT040 |	You can stick on things that are like
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,775	| IOT040 |	Your washing machine that's down in your basement
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,823	| IOT040 |	The Great
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:20,383	| IOT040 |	This is great I mean on washing machines plugged in
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,431	| IOT040 |	You definitely do want
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,223	| IOT040 |	You're connected washing machine in your basement
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,247	| IOT040 |	Table talk
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,551	| IOT040 |	Or reasons we'll talk about later in the shower
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| IOT040 |	But
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,879	| IOT040 |	If you're really going to try to
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,159	| IOT040 |	Compete with Bluetooth or
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,951	| IOT040 |	Superior thread
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| IOT040 |	No
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,535	| IOT040 |	So the devil's in the details
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,047	| IOT040 |	Always
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,095	| IOT040 |	And I don't even care about like
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,631	| IOT040 |	The date eraser talking about
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,167	| IOT040 |	Are up to 80 megabits
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,703	| IOT040 |	Which I think is great
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:49,567	| IOT040 |	And at the small end is like 100 56 kilobits per second
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,079	| IOT040 |	I think it is
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,687	| IOT040 |	So that's a big range so I'm also kind of like
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:59,807	| IOT040 |	Yeah well that's like I think it's up to four channels depends on how much data per channel in someone's butt
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,367	| IOT040 |	It does its 1 megahertz to 4 megahertz I believe
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| IOT040 |	Alright so
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,463	| IOT040 |	There we have it
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,487	| IOT040 |	Wi-Fi Halo
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:10,559	| IOT040 |	Very exciting
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,351	| IOT040 |	In case you're like
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,631	| IOT040 |	Hello
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,703	| IOT040 |	Excited
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:23,103	| IOT040 |	We also will be seeing Halo in devices in 2016 we probably won't see an official certification until 2
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,127	| IOT040 |	2018
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,175	| IOT040 |	That's how the Wi-Fi Alliance works
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,735	| IOT040 |	You know that's not a surprise to anybody
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,063	| IOT040 |	I know and it won't be surprising to see some
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:35,391	| IOT040 |	Halo ready products in 2017 I wouldn't be surprised at all
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,183	| IOT040 |	There we have it
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,463	| IOT040 |	Next up
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,023	| IOT040 |	Zigbee and thread
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,791	| IOT040 |	Get married
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,887	| IOT040 |	I bet this is Vegas they could totally do it
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,447	| IOT040 |	What happened is back in April
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,751	| IOT040 |	Sydney is another Mesh networking protocol
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:55,103	| IOT040 |	There in light bulbs out there
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,383	| IOT040 |	RCP certified
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:00,479	| IOT040 |	And a lot of your sensors are it's a low-power Mesh networking
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:02,527	| IOT040 |	Standard just so you guys know what it is
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:05,599	| IOT040 |	Add back in April
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| IOT040 |	We're going to work with the
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,159	| IOT040 |	Upcoming
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:08,927	| IOT040 |	Red
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,695	| IOT040 |	Wireless
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:12,511	| IOT040 |	Standard to kind of see if they could get together because
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,535	| IOT040 |	Underneath
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:19,167	| IOT040 |	At the radio level zigbee and threader actually using the same IEEE radio protocol
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| IOT040 |	It's 800
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,727	| IOT040 |	2
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,519	| IOT040 |	15.
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,287	| IOT040 |	4
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:28,895	| IOT040 |	That's for you IEEE nerds out there who are like but for everybody else
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,455	| IOT040 |	Just think they have the same
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| IOT040 |	Basic radio
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,111	| IOT040 |	Different different entirely
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,951	| IOT040 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,767	| IOT040 |	So they've got the same radio but they've got different software
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,791	| IOT040 |	On top of it gif
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,559	| IOT040 |	Protocols
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,863	| IOT040 |	What they said they would do though is
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:53,215	| IOT040 |	They would try to like see how they can make it easier for down the line
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,751	| IOT040 |	Things to work together
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,055	| IOT040 |	Because everybody was kind of like
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:02,175	| IOT040 |	Crap another radio protocol this is terrible we've already got zigbee Z-Wave Bluetooth
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,711	| IOT040 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| IOT040 |	Our homes are a mess
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,015	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,575	| IOT040 |	What they announced at CES
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| IOT040 |	Is
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,367	| IOT040 |	That
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,159	| IOT040 |	The upcoming
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,183	| IOT040 |	Zigbee
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| IOT040 |	Three.
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,719	| IOT040 |	Oh
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,487	| IOT040 |	Standard
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:15,999	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:19,327	| IOT040 |	Thread with basically have the same
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,119	| IOT040 |	Okay this is complicated
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,679	| IOT040 |	They would not be interoperable
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,447	| IOT040 |	But
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,983	| IOT040 |	The device manufacturers
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:30,079	| IOT040 |	Through a hub the devices with share the same
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,591	| IOT040 |	Play notes

EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,687	| IOT040 |	Show
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:40,063	| IOT040 |	If you were building a device that worked on thread and you were building a device that worked on zippy
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,599	| IOT040 |	It wouldn't actually be able to talk
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,367	| IOT040 |	Directly to each other
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:43,647	| IOT040 |	But
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:44,927	| IOT040 |	If you had a hub
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:49,279	| IOT040 |	A light bulb that said it was a lightbulb in CB and a lightbulb it said it was a lightbulb
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,839	| IOT040 |	Thread would say they were light bulb
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,631	| IOT040 |	The same way so they could actually talk
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:56,191	| IOT040 |	Exactly are
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,959	| IOT040 |	Itachi how to draw
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| IOT040 |	They'll start a certification program later this year I believe to
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,407	| IOT040 |	Thread + zigbee I believe it is
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,199	| IOT040 |	Yes that was really complicate
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:12,831	| IOT040 |	The two are pretty similar at at at at an underlying level to begin with so this makes them
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:15,391	| IOT040 |	A little more compatible even though they're not
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,672	| IOT040 |	The same things that make sense
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,744	| IOT040 |	But you're still as a consumer
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,304	| IOT040 |	And that's really what we care about
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,096	| IOT040 |	You're still going to have to look for them
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,888	| IOT040 |	To be compatible
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,912	| IOT040 |	All together
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:30,240	| IOT040 |	But if you buy a zigbee
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,264	| IOT040 |	Rio products
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:35,872	| IOT040 |	You will no longer have to worry about oh my God is it take me lightly certified
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,408	| IOT040 |	Or is it
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,200	| IOT040 |	You could just be like
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:41,504	| IOT040 |	I'll look this is Zippy 300 compatible
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,576	| IOT040 |	Yeah and this is it be 300 compatible
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,344	| IOT040 |	We're together
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,928	| IOT040 |	So going forward you should look just look for his MP3
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:49,952	| IOT040 |	Now
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,280	| IOT040 |	It's supposed to be backwards compatible
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,328	| IOT040 |	Gpha
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,608	| IOT040 |	Zigbee light Link
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,888	| IOT040 |	Sleepy all those things
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:00,704	| IOT040 |	But we all know how that's kind of a risky game to play
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,728	| IOT040 |	It is supposed to be
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,264	| IOT040 |	Nina
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,312	| IOT040 |	SEPTA's kind of good news bad news
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| IOT040 |	Okay so
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:07,872	| IOT040 |	How is that
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,408	| IOT040 |	Better
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,200	| IOT040 |	Okay
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,224	| IOT040 |	Okay good
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,784	| IOT040 |	Next radio news
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,552	| IOT040 |	And they were through it
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,344	| IOT040 |	Bluetooth decks
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,672	| IOT040 |	I was really kind of excited about this
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,184	| IOT040 |	Cuz I tried
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:28,608	| IOT040 |	It's easy to install there's a lot of cool Bluetooth stuff coming out in the lighting section A lot of light switches and light bulb
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,912	| IOT040 |	Set up Bluetooth compatible so you don't have to do any wiring
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:34,752	| IOT040 |	You just like screwing a bluetooth light bulb and then you like literally
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,288	| IOT040 |	Stick a switchblade to your
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,080	| IOT040 |	Controls it right
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:39,872	| IOT040 |	It's awesome
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:43,456	| IOT040 |	The downside is because the Bluetooth matches not like
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| IOT040 |	Super Gray
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,784	| IOT040 |	Phone sometimes
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,552	| IOT040 |	To be flaky
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:50,624	| IOT040 |	Discovery podcast
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,256	| IOT040 |	Introduced a Bluetooth Hub that controls 22 Bluetooth devices
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,816	| IOT040 |	I thought that was kind of a hundred feet
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,096	| IOT040 |	Which
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,376	| IOT040 |	I like
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:07,264	| IOT040 |	What they're saying Bluetooth range of up to a thousand feet in the open air or through as many as
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,032	| IOT040 |	3 walls
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:13,152	| IOT040 |	Cuz I and that's good I I know that sometimes I'm walking to my house I'm streaming music or doing something
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,224	| IOT040 |	I walked into two rooms away and that's it I'm gone
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:19,296	| IOT040 |	You know and then disconnected how to reconnect and so on so
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,344	| IOT040 |	This would solve that problem but
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,904	| IOT040 |	But other problems as well because they have
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,464	| IOT040 |	Other Bluetooth accessories
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,488	| IOT040 |	Bike smart home accessories
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,304	| IOT040 |	They do and this Hub is only
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:33,888	| IOT040 |	$100 and it supports Bluetooth low energy and classic Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:39,776	| IOT040 |	So I kind of look like if you're going to invest in a lot of Bluetooth accessories
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,824	| IOT040 |	This is like kind of $100 range
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:47,968	| IOT040 |	Yeah it supported more devices because I kind of feel like
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,736	| IOT040 |	You're going to
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:51,040	| IOT040 |	It especially if you're going to install a bunch of light switches
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,320	| IOT040 |	But
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:52,832	| IOT040 |	I still kind of think
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:58,208	| IOT040 |	It is an in 22 sounds like a lot in order for Bluetooth it is
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:02,304	| IOT040 |	But then again you know look at all the lights that we have in our houses these days you want to hide and
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,864	| IOT040 |	Switches and so on so I don't know if I would build hold
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,888	| IOT040 |	System out of this
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,936	| IOT040 |	You know you'll go through that 22 real fast
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:13,056	| IOT040 |	Yeah the facet my Hue Hub only supports 50 devices is actually kind of an issue
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,616	| IOT040 |	But the fact that he bolts kostek
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,016	| IOT040 |	I thought this was cool
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,040	| IOT040 |	That concludes our radios
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:26,368	| IOT040 |	And moving right along to
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,648	| IOT040 |	Services
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,696	| IOT040 |	Services integration
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,744	| IOT040 |	Honestly
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:35,584	| IOT040 |	If I'm calling a story for CES this year it is that the Internet of Things
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,632	| IOT040 |	Is moved from things
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,936	| IOT040 |	Two Services which is about
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,704	| IOT040 |	Time
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:44,032	| IOT040 |	That's what makes everything talk to each other
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:46,592	| IOT040 |	It's we're still not really there yet but
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,360	| IOT040 |	Let's hit
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:48,640	| IOT040 |	You want to talk about
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,040	| IOT040 |	Yeah, and they're not the only one but Whirlpool is highlighting some of their new smart appliances with guess what
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,600	| IOT040 |	Integrated Amazon Dash buttons
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:25:03,232	| IOT040 |	I'm almost surprised to see his eye when the Dash came out with the little $5 dongle
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,536	| IOT040 |	You press a button and orders whatever
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:08,864	| IOT040 |	Laundry detergent or whatever that button is for through Amazon
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:12,704	| IOT040 |	I was like yeah I know and it's cuz I'm kind of silly to me
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:17,568	| IOT040 |	Integrate into products it just kind of makes sense I'm starting to wonder will
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,872	| IOT040 |	How many products will actually have these kind of
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:20,896	| IOT040 |	Reorder buttons
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:24,224	| IOT040 |	This is the Amazon doordash fulfillment service
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,272	| IOT040 |	So it's not even
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,088	| IOT040 |	But miss
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,856	| IOT040 |	Kind of silica
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,904	| IOT040 |	It's really just an integrated like order from Amazon
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:35,744	| IOT040 |	Which is awesome
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:37,792	| IOT040 |	I love it
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| IOT040 |	Recite
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:43,424	| IOT040 |	Of course a bunch of companies integrating with Nest my favorite is Chamberlain
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,728	| IOT040 |	Doing some Nest Integrations
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:49,312	| IOT040 |	With the nest Dropcam stuff and lot of stuff there
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:53,408	| IOT040 |	I also thought Lowe's doing a monitored security
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:56,992	| IOT040 |	Service through is Iris home hub was worth mentioning because
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,784	| IOT040 |	Again services
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:02,112	| IOT040 |	And they're still planning to do another service through
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,696	| IOT040 |	Helping to plug mic hook you up with plumbers and that sort of thing
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:07,488	| IOT040 |	I also believe Samsung
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:10,816	| IOT040 |	SmartThings is also going to continue a line that plan
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:16,704	| IOT040 |	Service announcement
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,984	| IOT040 |	Ginni rometty is giving
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,520	| IOT040 |	Jeremy the CEO of IBM
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,056	| IOT040 |	Is giving a keynote
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,128	| IOT040 |	@ces Witcher like with Enterprise
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,640	| IOT040 |	Crazy
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,176	| IOT040 |	Watson
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,968	| IOT040 |	IBM's cognitive
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,296	| IOT040 |	Picture of a dozen just play Jeopardy
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:31,808	| IOT040 |	Doesn't trust
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| IOT040 |	Crazy and
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| IOT040 |	Lake
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,976	| IOT040 |	Hooking up with all these consumer-tech players
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,512	| IOT040 |	Such as Medtronic
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:43,584	| IOT040 |	To help anticipate diabetes
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,352	| IOT040 |	Track
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,120	| IOT040 |	And predict
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:48,448	| IOT040 |	Wearable medical sensors there is a partnership with whirlpool
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:52,032	| IOT040 |	To help like anticipate needs in the Smart Home
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,568	| IOT040 |	Partnership with SoftBank
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,896	| IOT040 |	Robotics which is the creator of pepper
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:27:03,296	| IOT040 |	And a partnership with Under Armour so Kevin you want to talk a little bit more about the Under Armour and maybe pepper will Pepper
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:09,696	| IOT040 |	Real quick for those don't know what it's a little robot from aldeberan that's been around for a while they also make the now and I don't
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,488	| IOT040 |	I'm saying that represent a o
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:15,584	| IOT040 |	Like a $20,000 Little Robot that's really cool walks around and so on
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:16,864	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:22,496	| IOT040 |	IBM is going to tie into pepper what they're going to do is provide a little more smarts to the robot
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:27,360	| IOT040 |	Which I don't see that you can buy just yet I'm not sure if you can or not AIDS
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,944	| IOT040 |	Based in Japan through SoftBank so it may be a
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:37,344	| IOT040 |	Japanese thing only but I want a pepper also IBM is working with Under Armour and that sounds kind of strange like me
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,624	| IOT040 |	What does the people make like
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:42,208	| IOT040 |	All the clothes at the athletes wear that I can go buy at the store
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:49,376	| IOT040 |	And I have these products Under Armour Justin LCS they launched their UA healthbox
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:52,448	| IOT040 |	I have a health box and it is a $400
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:55,264	| IOT040 |	Kit that has a brand new
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,312	| IOT040 |	Under Armour scale with
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,104	| IOT040 |	Wi-Fi built in
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,920	| IOT040 |	Measures your body fat as well as your weight
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:06,528	| IOT040 |	Morgan update people need to step on it it knows who you are based on your weight and body fat
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,064	| IOT040 |	It sent that they dumped into the cloud
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,112	| IOT040 |	I thought it worked
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:16,256	| IOT040 |	No no no it's not that big it's a regular very well-designed glass scaler nice
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:21,120	| IOT040 |	There's also in the box and Under Armour band which I've been wearing for a couple weeks
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,656	| IOT040 |	Measures your

EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:27,264	| IOT040 |	You are activity or Fitness
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:30,592	| IOT040 |	And has a heart rate monitor Optical heart rate monitor not talk about that'll it more
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:33,152	| IOT040 |	They also include a
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,432	| IOT040 |	UA
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:38,272	| IOT040 |	Chest strap heart rate chest strap for those who would rather wear a chest strap
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:39,296	| IOT040 |	That's all in the Box
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:43,136	| IOT040 |	Not in the Box optional $450 I also have these
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:47,488	| IOT040 |	Are the Under Armour Gemini 2 speedform sneakers
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,048	| IOT040 |	With it looks like regular running
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,864	| IOT040 |	Shoes but inside is a battery and sensors
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:56,448	| IOT040 |	You wouldn't know it which I love it because it's invisible you don't turn them on or them
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:28:57,216	| IOT040 |	Just work
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:00,544	| IOT040 |	They measure your steps your stride your Cadence soup
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,824	| IOT040 |	Pace and so on
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:05,920	| IOT040 |	It all feeds into the Under Armour record app for iOS or Android
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:11,808	| IOT040 |	Addicts well-designed shows the four quadrants of activity Fitness Nutrition and sleep
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,600	| IOT040 |	I'm getting tons of data
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,624	| IOT040 |	But back to IBM
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:17,696	| IOT040 |	I'm getting insights from Watson
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:22,048	| IOT040 |	Which is using all of the big data that IBM has on health
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:27,680	| IOT040 |	And it's telling me how my maybe my fitness compared to people in my age group
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:31,264	| IOT040 |	Men in my age group for example actually goes at specific
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:34,080	| IOT040 |	Talks about health bits it just provides insight
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:38,688	| IOT040 |	It's not doing too much just yet but then again they just launched this but
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:41,248	| IOT040 |	I did notice the past couple days before the announcement
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:45,344	| IOT040 |	I was getting Watson insights in my Under Armour record app
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,624	| IOT040 |	Based on my data
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:48,672	| IOT040 |	And how compared to the big data that Watson has
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,464	| IOT040 |	Awesome
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,744	| IOT040 |	On Thursday
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,792	| IOT040 |	Morning when this goes
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,632	| IOT040 |	Let you know
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:01,984	| IOT040 |	Ask Watson for the Powerball numbers the Powerball numbers tell me Owasso
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:07,104	| IOT040 |	It will be at Watson plan breakfast which means it will be
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:13,248	| IOT040 |	You know as you guys know what's and not only anticipates Kevin's every need
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,528	| IOT040 |	ASCII exercise
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:17,600	| IOT040 |	Watson also plans delicious recipes
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:20,160	| IOT040 |	It's recipes before so
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:24,000	| IOT040 |	All right so that is kind of the services thing there is
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:26,048	| IOT040 |	The stuff also happening at the connect
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:28,352	| IOT040 |	Car front will probably talk about that next show
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,888	| IOT040 |	The partnership with whirlpool
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:31,936	| IOT040 |	Watson will actually be gathering data
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,984	| IOT040 |	From whirlpools new
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:36,544	| IOT040 |	Connected washers fridges
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:40,896	| IOT040 |	Other things which is why your wife I should be better in your basement in case you
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,688	| IOT040 |	You keep your Whirlpool washer and dryer
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:43,968	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,760	| IOT040 |	It's a little scary actually
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,320	| IOT040 |	I'm not going to lie to you
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,344	| IOT040 |	Vital thing
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,648	| IOT040 |	If we don't actually have a guest for the show so don't worry
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:53,184	| IOT040 |	You're going to spend the whole time
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,488	| IOT040 |	Is cameras
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:58,048	| IOT040 |	Because there were a lot of really good cameras and you know how
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,840	| IOT040 |	Actually we know how you live cam
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,352	| IOT040 |	Because
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:03,680	| IOT040 |	I'm not too sold on them except when they're outside
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,960	| IOT040 |	In this case in my fridge
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,496	| IOT040 |	This is me
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,008	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| IOT040 |	Starters
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:14,688	| IOT040 |	It was actually here last year at CVS and they had a smarter coffee pot and hot water kettle that we talked about
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,968	| IOT040 |	Dissing your cake
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,832	| IOT040 |	Fisher they were showing off a connected fridge cam
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:24,160	| IOT040 |	It was $199
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:30,304	| IOT040 |	And I don't know if you guys recall this but I'm super psyched about the idea of a connected fridgecam because
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,400	| IOT040 |	Catalog in what's in your fridge
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:35,424	| IOT040 |	Boracay news
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:38,496	| IOT040 |	Grocery shopping purposes
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,080	| IOT040 |	That might happen but it's going to take awhile
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| IOT040 |	And I need to know if I have no
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:44,640	| IOT040 |	So
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:47,968	| IOT040 |	This camera basically
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| IOT040 |	It's a picture
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:50,528	| IOT040 |	And it sent it to you
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,040	| IOT040 |	On your phone
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,576	| IOT040 |	And that's it
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,600	| IOT040 |	And then you can be like
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:54,624	| IOT040 |	Hey
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:58,208	| IOT040 |	They also have a line of connected math
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:01,280	| IOT040 |	For your pantry basically it's mats with the weight sensor in it
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:02,560	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,840	| IOT040 |	You tell it was on that mat
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,936	| IOT040 |	It's like hey whatever this thing is
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:12,288	| IOT040 |	I'm loving that that concept
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:13,312	| IOT040 |	I'm loving the fridge cam
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,592	| IOT040 |	What is a little
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:20,224	| IOT040 |	Yeah I mean I'd rather just keep a grocery list and said pay $200
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:21,760	| IOT040 |	But I love the concept of
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:23,808	| IOT040 |	I'm out and about at the
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,344	| IOT040 |	Story of the grocery store
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:27,392	| IOT040 |	Cheese how much milk do we really have I forget
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:30,720	| IOT040 |	Pop open the app you look at your camera in your fridge now you know
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,768	| IOT040 |	Yeah I have to cut the tops
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,792	| IOT040 |	Set of my egg carton
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:36,608	| IOT040 |	I did get rid of my
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,376	| IOT040 |	Quickie eggs
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:38,656	| IOT040 |	And I'm
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,192	| IOT040 |	Now I wouldn't know
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,728	| IOT040 |	So I like that
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:45,824	| IOT040 |	I like this kind of like having you had a great idea cuz we
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:50,432	| IOT040 |	Is tiny little cameras I've written about them actually in my previous life at giga
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:51,968	| IOT040 |	They're called blink
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:54,272	| IOT040 |	They did a Kickstarter last August
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:57,088	| IOT040 |	Not this most recent August but August 2014
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:59,136	| IOT040 |	These are it's actually a
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,160	| IOT040 |	Companies
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:00,928	| IOT040 |	Started
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:05,280	| IOT040 |	They had a video processing chip that was really good
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,840	| IOT040 |	Really low power
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:13,984	| IOT040 |	And they realize that they couldn't make it as a video Processing Company like the margins were just too thin they could sell these chips
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:16,800	| IOT040 |	You know are actually $2
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:17,824	| IOT040 |	Tencent youku
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,104	| IOT040 |	Margins
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,128	| IOT040 |	Will Barton
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,152	| IOT040 |	To DVD Maker
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,688	| IOT040 |	DVD player makers
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,200	| IOT040 |	Blu-ray player
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:26,016	| IOT040 |	Instalike what is the Terrible
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,040	| IOT040 |	Nobody wants this
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:27,808	| IOT040 |	What could make
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,600	| IOT040 |	Connect to camera
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:32,928	| IOT040 |	So they decided to make a connect to camera they got out of the chip business and
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,720	| IOT040 |	When did the consumer product business and they like
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,000	| IOT040 |	Sonys cameras
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:42,656	| IOT040 |	Are $79 for one tiny little it's probably a 2 and 1/2 by 2 and 1/2 in maybe 3 by 3 in
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,960	| IOT040 |	And a wireless
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:45,984	| IOT040 |	And cordless
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:50,336	| IOT040 |	Yeah they run out of battery should last quite a while
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:53,920	| IOT040 |	You can if you buy these and both are even less than the $79 each because
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:57,760	| IOT040 |	And get to 41393 for 189 and 5
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:58,784	| IOT040 |	289
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:02,880	| IOT040 |	I like this because of the portability
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:07,488	| IOT040 |	It still uses Wi-Fi so it's not like using some funky radio protocol
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:09,024	| IOT040 |	You actually
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:13,376	| IOT040 |	Plug-in into an outlet with a little help it comes with it so it's not hanging off router
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,704	| IOT040 |	You can't use them outside or not waterproof but that's okay
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:21,056	| IOT040 |	But you could use one in your fridge
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:24,128	| IOT040 |	They turn up their not recording all the time when they see motion
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,176	| IOT040 |	The record that's the power conservation
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,200	| IOT040 |	Method obviously
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:29,504	| IOT040 |	So when you open your fridge door they're going to start recording
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:31,040	| IOT040 |	And you close it
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:34,112	| IOT040 |	The recording of what's in your fridge right
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:38,720	| IOT040 |	What about your friends being a giant Faraday cage I talked to the inhibitor
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:41,536	| IOT040 |	Behind what we thought that too
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:48,192	| IOT040 |	But there's a lot of like rubber gaskets and stuff that actually allow the Wi-Fi signal to get out so I was like okay great
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:51,776	| IOT040 |	What about you know the colder the fridge sucking the battery
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:53,312	| IOT040 |	You know what he's like
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:55,616	| IOT040 |	We also were concerned about that but you know
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:35:01,504	| IOT040 |	Tell battery life actually it's actually really good for the batteries up until you get to about 0 degrees Celsius
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:03,552	| IOT040 |	Then
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,320	| IOT040 |	The battery life
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,392	| IOT040 |	Maybe you could use
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,184	| IOT040 |	479 bus
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:12,256	| IOT040 |	If I don't use it in my fridge and I'm tempted because
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,816	| IOT040 |	These look simple to use during expensive
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,120	| IOT040 |	You can move them around easily
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:18,144	| IOT040 |	I like it
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:20,192	| IOT040 |	They're getting through their Kickstarter orders
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,520	| IOT040 |	And then they said by mid-January they'll be shipping
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| IOT040 |	Comstock
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,568	| IOT040 |	So you don't even have to wait
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:29,152	| IOT040 |	So there you got blink for home. Com is where you can order them from
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,688	| IOT040 |	Two more cameras
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:32,224	| IOT040 |	That are worth mentioning
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,528	| IOT040 |	The ring doorbell launched
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,296	| IOT040 |	Stick up camera

EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,864	| IOT040 |	You were looking actually for
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,144	| IOT040 |	A smaller outdoor
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,168	| IOT040 |	Camera this is bracket
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:53,728	| IOT040 |	Yeah bracket mounted might work for 9
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:56,032	| IOT040 |	What's neat about this is
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:57,824	| IOT040 |	It works with the ring doorbell
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,872	| IOT040 |	But two is a two-way audio
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:04,224	| IOT040 |	I'm so you can talk to someone if you see them running around on your property
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:04,992	| IOT040 |	Used to be like
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:07,040	| IOT040 |	Hey that my mom
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,064	| IOT040 |	Quite literally
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,344	| IOT040 |	Which
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:13,184	| IOT040 |	And then the other camera is the netatmo presence
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,464	| IOT040 |	Outdoor camera
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:16,256	| IOT040 |	And I like this
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:17,536	| IOT040 |	A couple reason
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,352	| IOT040 |	1 this is a wired camera
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:23,936	| IOT040 |	So the ring doorbell camera is actually not its Wireless
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,728	| IOT040 |	Battery power
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:28,544	| IOT040 |	But the netatmo is wired but what happens is you
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,824	| IOT040 |	You wire it into
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:32,640	| IOT040 |	An existing outdoor security light
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:35,200	| IOT040 |	Or an existing outdoor light
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:40,320	| IOT040 |	And it's got an egg LED light that turns on that actually gives the camera enough light to
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:40,832	| IOT040 |	Come by
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,624	| IOT040 |	And
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,136	| IOT040 |	Skinny
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,464	| IOT040 |	It's not going to be out till Q3 I don't have pricing for it
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:49,792	| IOT040 |	I've been wanting a camera to stick up on my rooftop
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:51,328	| IOT040 |	And this
