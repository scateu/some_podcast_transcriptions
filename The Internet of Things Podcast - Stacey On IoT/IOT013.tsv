EDL	00:00:03,840	00:00:10,240	| IOT013 |	Hey everybody this is the internet
EDL	00:00:10,240	00:00:11,264	| IOT013 |	The things podcast
EDL	00:00:12,544	00:00:13,824	| IOT013 |	Higginbotham and my co-host
EDL	00:00:14,336	00:00:15,360	| IOT013 |	Kevin tofel
EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:18,944	| IOT013 |	Yay this week we have a lot of awesome stuff for you
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:21,248	| IOT013 |	Actually I shouldn't say that because
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:23,040	| IOT013 |	Restart on a pretty Grim topic
EDL	00:00:23,808	00:00:25,088	| IOT013 |	Which is the question of
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:25,856	| IOT013 |	If
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:26,368	| IOT013 |	If
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:27,648	| IOT013 |	Be smart home
EDL	00:00:27,648	00:00:28,672	| IOT013 |	Is crumbling
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:31,232	| IOT013 |	Are people still really into the Smart Home
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:33,536	| IOT013 |	We had a couple of news item
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:34,048	| IOT013 |	Recently
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:37,376	| IOT013 |	We had Leo which is a company that makes a smart light
EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:39,168	| IOT013 |	Tired I don't even know how to do
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:41,472	| IOT013 |	Describe Leo actually it's it makes a smart night light
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:45,312	| IOT013 |	Also listens for your smoke detector to go off
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:50,432	| IOT013 |	And then it will text you if it goes off so it's kind of like a way to retrofit your smoke
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:50,944	| IOT013 |	Actors
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,224	| IOT013 |	It is also a night light
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:53,760	| IOT013 |	Does that make sense
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:55,296	| IOT013 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:56,576	| IOT013 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,856	| IOT013 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:00:58,880	| IOT013 |	It's like the Labradoodle
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:00,416	| IOT013 |	Gadgets
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:05,536	| IOT013 |	You just come by and some kind of random cool stuff and you get this
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:08,608	| IOT013 |	It's a nice Gadget I've actually tested it out
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:09,888	| IOT013 |	It's about a hundred bucks and
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:12,704	| IOT013 |	Yeah it's a it's a fun thing
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:15,008	| IOT013 |	Last week the company laid off
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:17,568	| IOT013 |	About 30% of its staff it was 16 people
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,104	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:21,152	| IOT013 |	I talk to the CEO and
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:24,480	| IOT013 |	Basically the issue is that the
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:27,552	| IOT013 |	The smart home is kind of getting there a little slower than anticipated
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:30,624	| IOT013 |	And they wanted to conserve their cash and they have
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,672	| IOT013 |	They raised 37 million info
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,232	| IOT013 |	Their pretty good
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:36,768	| IOT013 |	So we have that
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,048	| IOT013 |	We also had
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:40,096	| IOT013 |	We talked about it in previous shows
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:43,424	| IOT013 |	The quirky was getting out of the making all products
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,216	| IOT013 |	Business and was selling
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,752	| IOT013 |	It's wink
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,800	| IOT013 |	Home automation Hub software in
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,080	| IOT013 |	Platform
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,360	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,664	| IOT013 |	I kind of like of the opinion that
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,200	| IOT013 |	The wink was not a crate
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:58,528	| IOT013 |	Platform the software is actually really good but the hardware just in
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,296	| IOT013 |	Was it just didn't work
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:00,576	| IOT013 |	And so
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:06,464	| IOT013 |	Taking those things plus a couple other instances for example there's a Smart Lock called Gucci
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,024	| IOT013 |	I don't know if you remember this cabinet lunchbox
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,048	| IOT013 |	2013
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,328	| IOT013 |	I do remember it
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,864	| IOT013 |	So it actually hasn't shipped
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,704	| IOT013 |	It was supposed to say It was supposed to ship in December of 2013
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,776	| IOT013 |	People are basically if you go look at the Twitter account
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,312	| IOT013 |	It's kind of sad there's this one
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:24,128	| IOT013 |	It's like one for a person who's having to handle at least
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,408	| IOT013 |	Say hey
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,224	| IOT013 |	I would not want to be that person
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,736	| IOT013 |	Yeah
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,296	| IOT013 |	That's Tuff
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,344	| IOT013 |	There's also plump which was a
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:37,440	| IOT013 |	Wifi-connected light switch the founders were actually cedia
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,976	| IOT013 |	The Trade Organization for kind of
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,048	| IOT013 |	Yeah I am home and install
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,864	| IOT013 |	They launched in 2013 in
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,680	| IOT013 |	They still haven't produced eras light switch yet
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:48,960	| IOT013 |	Still available
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,008	| IOT013 |	Pre-order they say they're going to ship it in
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:55,872	| IOT013 |	So there's like a lot of stuff happening here that kind of made me
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,896	| IOT013 |	Look and realize that
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,432	| IOT013 |	Maybe it's time for a reckoning
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:05,088	| IOT013 |	Will you notice I think there's two things going on here one is a lot of companies and started to jumped in
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:09,440	| IOT013 |	And promised the world and I commend them for that cuz I I
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,720	| IOT013 |	Like a lot of these
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| IOT013 |	Potential products
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,792	| IOT013 |	A lot of them haven't delivered yet
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,120	| IOT013 |	It's funny because I've said in the past
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:23,520	| IOT013 |	Smart Home Market is kind of moving so slow but in some respect between pretty quickly when you have all these companies jumping in with potential products
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| IOT013 |	The last couple of years
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:25,824	| IOT013 |	The thing is
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,872	| IOT013 |	Promising the product is one thing
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,176	| IOT013 |	Implementing and delivering is another
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:34,016	| IOT013 |	And the market itself that with so many bigger companies getting in
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,600	| IOT013 |	Seems to be crowding out something small guys to the point where like
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:41,952	| IOT013 |	Who this product we promised sounded great when we launched it but now we're competing against
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,232	| IOT013 |	Ab&c here
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:50,144	| IOT013 |	This isn't going to fly we need to either retool rethink or or something here and so I think they get into the state of paralysis
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,728	| IOT013 |	And it looks to me like it's really just a lot of companies that
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| IOT013 |	Didn't deliver timely enough
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:59,360	| IOT013 |	And we also have a lot of consolidation going on in this industry right now so
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,896	| IOT013 |	I think it's those two things going on
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,688	| IOT013 |	I think building good Hardware is hard
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,736	| IOT013 |	We talked about that plenty
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,528	| IOT013 |	I also think there is
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| IOT013 |	A lot
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,320	| IOT013 |	Of
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,624	| IOT013 |	Poorly reviewed gear out there
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:15,744	| IOT013 |	And that makes people nervous and there was an artist inside study that
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,768	| IOT013 |	Came out last week
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:17,791	| IOT013 |	About
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,351	| IOT013 |	Demand for Smart Home Products is
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,167	| IOT013 |	Dropped 15% in the last
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,447	| IOT013 |	Year
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:27,263	| IOT013 |	So from May 2014 to now and then
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:30,079	| IOT013 |	It also showed some data in this is August
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:30,591	| IOT013 |	Isn't
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:33,663	| IOT013 |	Counting actual sales their measuring things like
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:38,527	| IOT013 |	Reduce inventions on social media
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,063	| IOT013 |	But they actually
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:44,415	| IOT013 |	Got a pretty good track record of predicting what's going to do well so
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,207	| IOT013 |	That's why I'm actually mentioning it
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,719	| IOT013 |	And then
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,999	| IOT013 |	This week
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,023	| IOT013 |	Icontrol
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,071	| IOT013 |	Put out some data about the Smart Home
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,887	| IOT013 |	It is also worth kind of
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,703	| IOT013 |	Looking at in terms of like demand and who's buying a
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,007	| IOT013 |	Basically
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:04:59,775	| IOT013 |	It looks like
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:04,127	| IOT013 |	Younger people are much more likely to buy it in the age range of 25
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:04,639	| IOT013 |	234
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:09,759	| IOT013 |	Are likely over 50 about 50% of them are likely to purchase
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,319	| IOT013 |	A smart home service are connected appliances
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| IOT013 |	Within the next 12 months
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,879	| IOT013 |	Versus
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| IOT013 |	Consumers
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| IOT013 |	What you say
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,975	| IOT013 |	About 31%
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:21,535	| IOT013 |	Would purchase a smart home service
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,583	| IOT013 |	And only 25%
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,863	| IOT013 |	Purchase a connected
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| IOT013 |	Appliance
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,471	| IOT013 |	And across-the-board the percentages are
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,239	| IOT013 |	In the
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:33,823	| IOT013 |	Mid-thirties for everyone purchasing smart locks
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,919	| IOT013 |	Connected home cameras connected lighting and connected door locks or what they're measuring
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,967	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:43,295	| IOT013 |	It looks like if you get into this 25 to 34 age range
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,319	| IOT013 |	Which theater URI
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:48,159	| IOT013 |	Sorry to spell thank you appreciate that
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:55,583	| IOT013 |	So it looks like younger people are a little bit more willing to spend but even then only half of them
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:06:00,703	| IOT013 |	It looks like when they're willing to spend is is worth mentioning to because
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:06,079	| IOT013 |	It looks like people don't just like walked out to Best Buy and pick one of these kind of connected devices up
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,591	| IOT013 |	Looks like May
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| IOT013 |	They're waiting for
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,919	| IOT013 |	Events like the birth of a child or
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,455	| IOT013 |	Moving to a new home
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,479	| IOT013 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:19,135	| IOT013 |	Yeah it's it's also interesting to me in the eye control report on and we've hit these two topics before but it just want to highlight it since it's
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:22,207	| IOT013 |	Two major obstacles found in the study for
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,719	| IOT013 |	Consumers
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:27,839	| IOT013 |	Privacy data concern 71% of consumers share the fear their personal information make it stolen
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,119	| IOT013 |	No surprise there
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,399	| IOT013 |	And this is
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,447	| IOT013 |	Big thing with me I can say no forever
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:37,567	| IOT013 |	Can your devices talk to each other 60% of the consumers wish their devices to a better job
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:41,919	| IOT013 |	A talking to one another to me it's it's a platform thing it's not just individual
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:45,759	| IOT013 |	Fragmented devices and hope that you got radios that talk and work with each other but not
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,063	| IOT013 |	And I think that bodes well for the
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:54,719	| IOT013 |	Cornhole platform makers we've talked about him getting the pass and how it's been slow but there's an example of a platform that will
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:58,303	| IOT013 |	Probably resolve that issue of Kenya devices talk to each other
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:58,815	| IOT013 |	Exactly
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| IOT013 |	I will say another thing
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:05,983	| IOT013 |	Another concern of theirs is that smart home technology will have too many bugs
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,031	| IOT013 |	57%
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:08,543	| IOT013 |	People

EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,023	| IOT013 |	The entertainment
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,327	| IOT013 |	Internet Security in the eye control
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,863	| IOT013 |	Survey is the
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:09,727	| IOT013 |	90% of people buy a smart home for security so they're they're emphasizing that as they would
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,007	| IOT013 |	Icontrol
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| IOT013 |	Provides
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,567	| IOT013 |	The backend smart home software for
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,615	| IOT013 |	Comcast for
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| IOT013 |	ATT
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,175	| IOT013 |	For a lot of
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,967	| IOT013 |	What is so security is one of
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,759	| IOT013 |	Selling point
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,039	| IOT013 |	Entertainment is the other
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,087	| IOT013 |	And people are ready
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:29,439	| IOT013 |	To connect their entertainment rooms first followed by the kitchen
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,231	| IOT013 |	And let's see
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,535	| IOT013 |	I'm trying to think what was
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,047	| IOT013 |	What was the other thing
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,607	| IOT013 |	And then the bedroom for a second there I thought it was the bathroom
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,655	| IOT013 |	Smart bathroom
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,167	| IOT013 |	It's not there
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| IOT013 |	Percent of people are in
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,311	| IOT013 |	Connecting their bath
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,591	| IOT013 |	Yes
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,663	| IOT013 |	I really don't need my toilet to tweet every time I use it
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| IOT013 |	Oh Noah needs that
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,295	| IOT013 |	I would say actually I have speakers in my bathroom a lot of
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,319	| IOT013 |	Smart sales
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,855	| IOT013 |	Good lighting
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,927	| IOT013 |	Those are all very very nice to have but
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,439	| IOT013 |	Certainly.
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,719	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| IOT013 |	That is kind of
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,559	| IOT013 |	Where people are in the Smart Home
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,327	| IOT013 |	Tom and
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,607	| IOT013 |	I think
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,143	| IOT013 |	If you can serve your cash
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,935	| IOT013 |	You're putting out a good product
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,215	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,799	| IOT013 |	You know you're in it for the long haul I think that's probably the way to go
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,079	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:23,199	| IOT013 |	God help us please let's get some smart platform just like let's get things talking to each other in a real
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,991	| IOT013 |	Easy-to-use way
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,063	| IOT013 |	So there's our learnings from that
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:33,439	| IOT013 |	We should talk because last last week we recorded before nest made there
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:37,279	| IOT013 |	Huge announcement
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:37,791	| IOT013 |	Siri announce
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,095	| IOT013 |	But we'll go with Kevin and
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,607	| IOT013 |	Your sarcasm
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,911	| IOT013 |	Kevin
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,983	| IOT013 |	Shall we shall we briefly cover what Nest covered
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:52,127	| IOT013 |	Version 1.01 of nest
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| IOT013 |	It's getting a software upgrade
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,711	| IOT013 |	There's a brand new Nest protect
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,735	| IOT013 |	Smoke detector
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,807	| IOT013 |	There is a
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,343	| IOT013 |	Brand new
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,391	| IOT013 |	It's now the nest
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:03,903	| IOT013 |	Scam
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| IOT013 |	Nest
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,463	| IOT013 |	Cam with a
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:06,975	| IOT013 |	Capital c
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,279	| IOT013 |	Instead of the Dropcam
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,559	| IOT013 |	Which
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,631	| IOT013 |	This condo at this looks The Nest cam looks a lot like the Dropcam
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,143	| IOT013 |	Ampro
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,727	| IOT013 |	Two hundred bucks
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,007	| IOT013 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:22,079	| IOT013 |	The Nest protect is still at a hundred bucks
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,151	| IOT013 |	You know the nest thermostat is 250
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:30,271	| IOT013 |	I will eagerly await my software update I'm really glad that they did not introduce a new nest
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,319	| IOT013 |	Turn Nest Thermostat because I'd hate to
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| IOT013 |	After ripped mine out of the wall
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:35,903	| IOT013 |	Yay 4th Avenue

EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,095	| IOT013 |	We had
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:48,959	| IOT013 |	Like some sort of home audio entertainment product we had rumors of voice control
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,983	| IOT013 |	We had some great room
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,055	| IOT013 |	Rumors aside I mean really
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,335	| IOT013 |	This nest
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:58,943	| IOT013 |	When was when did Google buy nest for 3.2 billion January
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,063	| IOT013 |	Okay so you're in a half ago

EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,231	| IOT013 |	I got a check when
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,999	| IOT013 |	Nest
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,535	| IOT013 |	Best spotter Google bypass
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:18,655	| IOT013 |	No not much has happened and the features they have in these things are not
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,703	| IOT013 |	Rocket science they're not like
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,215	| IOT013 |	Daunting
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,287	| IOT013 |	Especially in the camera side they're not
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,567	| IOT013 |	We should get ahead of the cops
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,335	| IOT013 |	Petition
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,127	| IOT013 |	It was January twenty

EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,527	| IOT013 |	Kind of
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,951	| IOT013 |	The biggest the biggest thing and we'll probably talk about it on another show cuz I'm
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,231	| IOT013 |	Planning this
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,511	| IOT013 |	Crazy idea
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| IOT013 |	The
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,607	| IOT013 |	Announce that American family which is an insurance company
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,655	| IOT013 |	And Liberty Mutual
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,703	| IOT013 |	Are going to subsidize the nest
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,215	| IOT013 |	To protect
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:56,287	| IOT013 |	And give it out to homeowners as a way to like
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,871	| IOT013 |	Help prevent fire damage in homes in hopefully
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,383	| IOT013 |	Lower
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,455	| IOT013 |	The incidence of payouts for fire damage
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,783	| IOT013 |	And if you do that you get a free Nest protect
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:12,927	| IOT013 |	From your insurance company and you also if you send them monthly data reports you'll get 5% off
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,207	| IOT013 |	Nice
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,743	| IOT013 |	So cats in
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:20,607	| IOT013 |	For American family which is the only one that offers this program now and it's only offered in Minnesota right
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| IOT013 |	Right now
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:25,727	| IOT013 |	You can actually staff discounts so your security alarm discount that you might get
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:31,103	| IOT013 |	Say to get 5% off each month format and then you can get 5% off for the nest
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,127	| IOT013 |	Defender like woohoo
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,687	| IOT013 |	That's good deal good deal
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,711	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:36,991	| IOT013 |	However
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| IOT013 |	It's still not that exciting
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,575	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,367	| IOT013 |	On the really exciting energy
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,159	| IOT013 |	The front we have this awesome
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,927	| IOT013 |	New Gadget
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,279	| IOT013 |	And I talked to these guys a couple of months ago they're based in Austin
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,863	| IOT013 |	I've been super excited wanted to tell you guys about it it's a product called curb
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,727	| IOT013 |	You install it in your circuit breaker box
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,495	| IOT013 |	Is it a circuit breaker
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,359	| IOT013 |	So you like the box with Breakers
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,151	| IOT013 |	Open
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,967	| IOT013 |	And if you don't actually install it an electrician install
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:09,759	| IOT013 |	What you can
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,551	| IOT013 |	Do with this is amazing
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,831	| IOT013 |	You get to see
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,135	| IOT013 |	On a device level
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,695	| IOT013 |	How much energy something is
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:20,511	| IOT013 |	Is consuming in your house in real time like
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,047	| IOT013 |	I sat through the demo in
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:29,983	| IOT013 |	He remotely turned out he had it installed in his home the CEO had it installed in his home and he remotely turned on a space heater
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,543	| IOT013 |	And you could see the graph in the kilowatt hours
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,335	| IOT013 |	Soon to go up
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:34,847	| IOT013 |	Like
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| IOT013 |	I can't remember.
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:37,919	| IOT013 |	It turned red in light
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,223	| IOT013 |	The numbers got a lot bigger in
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:44,319	| IOT013 |	He's like sea based on this you know the space heater just turning it on for like a
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,855	| IOT013 |	8 hours a day would cost me
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,671	| IOT013 |	$5 a
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,183	| IOT013 |	$5
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| IOT013 |	It was
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,279	| IOT013 |	Amazing DD
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,327	| IOT013 |	App is very
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,119	| IOT013 |	Compelling it's it's very easy to read
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,911	| IOT013 |	It's currently hard for me to talk about
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,191	| IOT013 |	.
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:07,103	| IOT013 |	So I'm going to say in a personal level I am super enthusiastic about this
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:11,199	| IOT013 |	Because I have tried to do this in the past with the
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,759	| IOT013 |	Kilowatt meter so I don't know if you
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,295	| IOT013 |	No those are actually kind of like
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,575	| IOT013 |	Smart
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:20,927	| IOT013 |	Smart Meters that can determine how much juice is flowing through a particular Outlet
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,719	| IOT013 |	The curb does it at the
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,999	| IOT013 |	The circuit level so
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,279	| IOT013 |	Guess
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,583	| IOT013 |	Pair multiple things on a circuit you're actually
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,911	| IOT013 |	If you can break it down to those individual things
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,935	| IOT013 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:35,263	| IOT013 |	You can break it down I mean it depends on how your house is
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,799	| IOT013 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:41,407	| IOT013 |	And that makes total sense but so so the kilowatt that I used to use a couple years ago
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,175	| IOT013 |	You know that was
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,199	| IOT013 |	Literally just
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,991	| IOT013 |	Measure 1 Outlet the
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,271	| IOT013 |	Outflow of energy
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| IOT013 |	1 Outlet
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,063	| IOT013 |	This can do at 3
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| IOT013 |	Full House
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| IOT013 |	Which I love
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,951	| IOT013 |	Part of the reason I love that is because I have 41 solar panels on my roof
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:59,583	| IOT013 |	I can tell you to the second how much energy each panel is producing
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,863	| IOT013 |	Because
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:03,679	| IOT013 |	Every one of the panels as a microinverter and its shares
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:10,079	| IOT013 |	Data over power line to a little web server have running and so when I get historical information real-time data yada yada
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,895	| IOT013 |	Thing is I don't know how much energy I'm
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,663	| IOT013 |	Assuming
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| IOT013 |	Steve
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,223	| IOT013 |	For my monthly Electric
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,991	| IOT013 |	Bill
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| IOT013 |	Since I am
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| IOT013 |	I'm still tied to the grid
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,855	| IOT013 |	And I can't reconcile it really on a device level
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,879	| IOT013 |	So this is
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,415	| IOT013 |	I think I'll standing
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,207	| IOT013 |	For someone who really wants to
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,511	| IOT013 |	Get a feel for the energy consumption in the house
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,047	| IOT013 |	I agree in
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,119	| IOT013 |	Another reason I think you would be such an interesting candidate for this
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,167	| IOT013 |	Solar is the top reason
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| IOT013 |	But the other is you got
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,471	| IOT013 |	A fold or lease
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| IOT013 |	Hypervolt
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:42,079	| IOT013 |	So you can actually calculate even
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:45,663	| IOT013 |	Better your Energy savings because when you plug your car in
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,735	| IOT013 |	You can see exactly how much
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,039	| IOT013 |	How much it cost to charge your car so
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:55,135	| IOT013 |	The CEO sent me some data from someone in Austin who has
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,647	| IOT013 |	Two Teslas
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| IOT013 |	Lucky man
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,463	| IOT013 |	He's got a roadster and an s
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,791	| IOT013 |	The one week.
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,583	| IOT013 |	You know that he tracked it
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,375	| IOT013 |	His car is cost him
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,935	| IOT013 |	$27 a little over $27
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,703	| IOT013 |	To charge
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,727	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,775	| IOT013 |	That's that's a week's worth of
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| IOT013 |	Charging
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,055	| IOT013 |	Are those things
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| IOT013 |	That's pretty impressive in
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,943	| IOT013 |	That's how she's amazing data cuz you can start seeing like
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,759	| IOT013 |	Is it time to replace my fridge because
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,343	| IOT013 |	She's assisting cost me a hundred bucks a month to you
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:28,927	| IOT013 |	Yeah the the electric-car bit
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,743	| IOT013 |	It's actually not that impressive tomato I'll tell you why
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:35,583	| IOT013 |	Because unlike a lightbulb
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,863	| IOT013 |	Or some other device
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,423	| IOT013 |	There's a fixed amount of energy a car can
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:45,823	| IOT013 |	Can take can consume and I know the capacity of the battery in my Volkswagen Atlas
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:48,127	| IOT013 |	Bass Elite 13 kilowatt hour battery
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,895	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,687	| IOT013 |	I can just multiply my
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,455	| IOT013 |	Hourly
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,479	| IOT013 |	Usage rate
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:56,831	| IOT013 |	To figure out how long that is it's about a buck and a half for me I know it is on a daily basis
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,367	| IOT013 |	It a little bit
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,135	| IOT013 |	You know
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,439	| IOT013 |	Beneficial to me for the variable type things
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,047	| IOT013 |	Okay I would love this before I put in do you know my
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:10,399	| IOT013 |	My Ness and that's where it's at my Nest my ecobee my LED lights because
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,191	| IOT013 |	Actually have a sense of
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:18,335	| IOT013 |	Am I saving money or am I just you know installing $250 thermostats just for fun
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,615	| IOT013 |	Yep
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:23,967	| IOT013 |	We probably both it's a little bit of both because I keep my house at an ungodly Hi-Tech
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,735	| IOT013 |	Temperature
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,247	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:30,367	| IOT013 |	Speaking of savings we should get to the downside of
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,927	| IOT013 |	Which is this thing is very
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,975	| IOT013 |	It is
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,279	| IOT013 |	It is the devices on Indiegogo
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,327	| IOT013 |	Right now you can pre-order it
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,095	| IOT013 |	Indiegogo
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,119	| IOT013 |	And it will ship in September
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,399	| IOT013 |	4
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:47,519	| IOT013 |	One one unit is $350 and that measure 16
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,031	| IOT013 |	Different
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT013 |	Circuits
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,079	| IOT013 |	18
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,103	| IOT013 |	Centers $0.18
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:55,199	| IOT013 |	16 zones of appliances what it says
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,271	| IOT013 |	649
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,343	| IOT013 |	Which in my house I actually
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,367	| IOT013 |	Three of these
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,671	| IOT013 |	And then there's also the charge
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,719	| IOT013 |	For the electrician to install it
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,487	| IOT013 |	Which
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,511	| IOT013 |	They're trying to
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:11,327	| IOT013 |	Current that the guys at Kerber trying to make it so
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:15,167	| IOT013 |	Still have a network of installers that will pay a set fee
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,703	| IOT013 |	Right now
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:20,031	| IOT013 |	They haven't got that in place so he estimates about a hundred
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,591	| IOT013 |	$250 for one
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:26,943	| IOT013 |	Eventually he'd like to be $100 for one and a hundred fifty for the two pack
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| IOT013 |	We'll see
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,295	| IOT013 |	I am getting one in my house
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,831	| IOT013 |	So I'm going to be
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,903	| IOT013 |	I feel like maybe I should have them send it to you Kevin because
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,231	| IOT013 |	With a solar you're like way more compelling
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,023	| IOT013 |	That's up to you
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:46,911	| IOT013 |	I bet I'll let you decide how it looks like there app is available for IOS and Android so that's a good sign
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,703	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,727	| IOT013 |	Yeah looks pretty good
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:53,055	| IOT013 |	Yeah so that's our excited that's our exciting thing on curb
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,871	| IOT013 |	Indiegogo is doing super well
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,967	| IOT013 |	I think I've been there they're so close to getting there
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,503	| IOT013 |	There they're raising 25000
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,527	| IOT013 |	Ed
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,831	| IOT013 |	23000
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:11,487	| IOT013 |	I'll tell you guys a secret there shipping in September because I already producing these
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:11,999	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:14,303	| IOT013 |	It's it's a little less produce safe
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,583	| IOT013 |	Yeah it's a little less
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:20,447	| IOT013 |	Yeah and in the end plan is probably to go install this in
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:22,239	| IOT013 |	Like talk to
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,055	| IOT013 |	Solar power cup like when you're getting your solar installed
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:31,455	| IOT013 |	It's a perfect match for that absolutely
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,759	| IOT013 |	They're doing because they've got a smart home initiative
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,783	| IOT013 |	You know just
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,831	| IOT013 |	Pop in the sky in here cuz you can amortize it with
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:38,111	| IOT013 |	House
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,623	| IOT013 |	French
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:46,303	| IOT013 |	As expensive as it is I think I could get started with the early adopter package at 309 and that's
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,887	| IOT013 |	A tenth of the price of a Tesla battery that I actually reserved
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| IOT013 |	So to me it's
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:54,751	| IOT013 |	Probably worth the 309 if I get an early I might I might
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,543	| IOT013 |	I guess talk to my wife
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:57,823	| IOT013 |	Oh
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:01,663	| IOT013 |	You know what this was the 309 wasn't actually available
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,967	| IOT013 |	They must have opened up some more
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,271	| IOT013 |	Early doctor either so there's a few left
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,551	| IOT013 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,647	| IOT013 |	It's okay
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:15,231	| IOT013 |	Yeah and in the large home there's a two pack for 5:49
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:21,119	| IOT013 |	It just to clarify the reason you would need the 2Pac is because
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| IOT013 |	You have two circuit breakers
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,679	| IOT013 |	Actually have three circuit
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,751	| IOT013 |	My house is very
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:27,519	| IOT013 |	Overachiever
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,591	| IOT013 |	What my house was wired for the future
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,383	| IOT013 |	Yes so
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,919	| IOT013 |	So when we built it
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:35,455	| IOT013 |	2 years ago that's that was our
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:35,967	| IOT013 |	Thought process
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,039	| IOT013 |	So you know what yes we are overachievers
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,063	| IOT013 |	But
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,903	| IOT013 |	That's I also going to get really granular data when I am
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,207	| IOT013 |	Does pops away with
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,487	| IOT013 |	So I can I can tell you how much
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,255	| IOT013 |	My washing machine
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,303	| IOT013 |	I can't wait y'all
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:50,815	| IOT013 |	Okay
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| IOT013 |	Moving right along
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,631	| IOT013 |	2
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,143	| IOT013 |	Arnex picked
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,423	| IOT013 |	Snooze
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:55,935	| IOT013 |	Which is
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,983	| IOT013 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,543	| IOT013 |	Oh I thought you're going to do your echo echo
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,335	| IOT013 |	Echo echo
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,663	| IOT013 |	I would but I'm a little peeved
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:09,759	| IOT013 |	That means it's good news let's just say what the news is Amazon Echo is available to everyone
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,831	| IOT013 |	For 179 99 you don't need an invite
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,391	| IOT013 |	And I believe July 14th is when they're in stock
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,928	| IOT013 |	Ship July 4th
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:22,304	| IOT013 |	Yeah so as we all know I passed on the echo.for $99 and you
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,608	| IOT013 |	Got one for $99 as a Prime member
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:29,728	| IOT013 |	I later said on this very show I think I'm going to reserve one again and I did for 149
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,264	| IOT013 |	Well
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:36,384	| IOT013 |	I never got the 149 invite and now I've got to pay 17999
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:39,456	| IOT013 |	Sometimes it pays to be a believer
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:43,808	| IOT013 |	Yeah we we should say that this is going to be today's 5 minutes
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:46,368	| IOT013 |	Yes Papa
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,184	| IOT013 |	Because
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,720	| IOT013 |	Because I think
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,256	| IOT013 |	Now that anyone can buy it at
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| IOT013 |	Reply
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,096	| IOT013 |	If you were unlucky like Avenue
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,144	| IOT013 |	You would have gotten it but now you can go buy it
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,680	| IOT013 |	180 bucks
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:00,704	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:03,008	| IOT013 |	Okay for those of you guys who
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:06,336	| IOT013 |	Have not heard us talk again and again about the echo this is a
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,384	| IOT013 |	This is basically Siri combined with a
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:10,176	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,224	| IOT013 |	You talk to it
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,504	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:16,832	| IOT013 |	Is connected to the Bing search engine is connected to a lot of other things
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,904	| IOT013 |	And you tell it what you wanted to do or you ask it a question
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,184	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:21,952	| IOT013 |	10
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,720	| IOT013 |	A response
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,768	| IOT013 |	Set also plays music at axes like a
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,560	| IOT013 |	Bluetooth speaker with your phone
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,584	| IOT013 |	What else does it do
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:32,960	| IOT013 |	Well they've added a bunch of things like a lot of content I got to Pandora
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:36,032	| IOT013 |	And I could always read you the news from NPR
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,056	| IOT013 |	I wouldn't have the timer
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,616	| IOT013 |	Timer so and
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:43,456	| IOT013 |	So so in the last so when it launched it was basically
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:49,856	| IOT013 |	Connected to being so you can talk to it ask us some questions it would tell you casket jokes it have the timer
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,648	| IOT013 |	And then it also had
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,952	| IOT013 |	Amazon music search
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:57,024	| IOT013 |	Write a Prime music Amazon Prime
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:23:00,352	| IOT013 |	So it could play you could be like Alexa play Taylor Swift
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,888	| IOT013 |	And it would play Taylor Swift
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,448	| IOT013 |	If you happen to have that album in your pregnant
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,240	| IOT013 |	In
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,776	| IOT013 |	You know what for 99 bucks
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,544	| IOT013 |	Set the time
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:10,080	| IOT013 |	I thought it was a joy
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:13,408	| IOT013 |	A joy to use it was wonderful to talk to is the most effective
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:16,992	| IOT013 |	Kind of natural language translation service I really encounter
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:19,040	| IOT013 |	It was really it's really very good
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,856	| IOT013 |	But it was such a limited
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:22,624	| IOT013 |	I did nothing
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,416	| IOT013 |	He wanted to tell it to do things
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:30,816	| IOT013 |	But they did change that in February this off I think it came out in November and February they said we've got a
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:36,704	| IOT013 |	Early SDK for developers and I started to add some things and they later added
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,520	| IOT013 |	Smartphone type things such as Philips hue light support
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| IOT013 |	WeMo support
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| IOT013 |	Couple of things
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,640	| IOT013 |	It's this and that
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,432	| IOT013 |	Fort for select services
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:51,040	| IOT013 |	So long with all the home automation stuff it's also added things like the ability to
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,600	| IOT013 |	Read your audible books and
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:58,208	| IOT013 |	You know you could always do things like add stuff to your grocery list and now you're just
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,512	| IOT013 |	You're basically saying it over all expansion
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:02,816	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,096	| IOT013 |	The question is
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,680	| IOT013 |	Who should spend $180 getting a
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,240	| IOT013 |	$449 to Yuan
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:16,896	| IOT013 |	But that's another story are not doing that deal okay I retract the question
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,944	| IOT013 |	Not if I have a question
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:23,040	| IOT013 |	I still would like to see it have things more Integrations with Spotify
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,832	| IOT013 |	I want to give it
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:26,112	| IOT013 |	More commands in my home
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:29,952	| IOT013 |	I can already talk to my house like my thermostats using
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:33,792	| IOT013 |	I'd like the nest thermostat I can use Google but
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:38,144	| IOT013 |	My husband and I both use the Ability we tell Alexa to turn off her lights
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,424	| IOT013 |	Every night
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:44,288	| IOT013 |	You also have with the device a remote control that you can use
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,080	| IOT013 |	To speak into
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,360	| IOT013 |	For when you're far away
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:49,152	| IOT013 |	Or at the room is too loud
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,688	| IOT013 |	And we use that a lot too
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,016	| IOT013 |	I personally might buy another Echo
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,040	| IOT013 |	Go actually for upstairs
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| IOT013 |	That's how much I like
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,880	| IOT013 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:03,232	| IOT013 |	There's a lot to like here in a minute because they've expanded what it can do I was not
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,280	| IOT013 |	I didn't want to spend $99 at the
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,328	| IOT013 |	The time because it was very limited in my opinion
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,912	| IOT013 |	The funny thing is I just talked to my family about this
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:17,312	| IOT013 |	And I said you know if I get this you guys going to use it and even after watching the video which has been updated to show
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,336	| IOT013 |	All the different things you can do now
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,152	| IOT013 |	They're like probably not so
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:25,760	| IOT013 |	Surprisingly I would be the only one who would theoretically use it according to them
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:29,344	| IOT013 |	So I don't know if I'm going to do it especially having to pay $30 more
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:36,000	| IOT013 |	I don't know I have a lot of other things I can talk to and do things with such as my phone one of my watches and so on
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:38,816	| IOT013 |	I like how it's all integrated into one device
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:39,840	| IOT013 |	But
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,680	| IOT013 |	It does duplicate a lot of things I can already do
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,240	| IOT013 |	But it does them so well
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,080	| IOT013 |	My family didn't think they would use it
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:53,152	| IOT013 |	But I think we probably
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,688	| IOT013 |	And I don't have soap
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:57,504	| IOT013 |	It is a no-brainer if you have a huge music collection
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,016	| IOT013 |	Turn on Amazon
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,832	| IOT013 |	On Amazon which we do not
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,880	| IOT013 |	We do not either so but I will say to
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,648	| IOT013 |	Two people who do
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,440	| IOT013 |	This device
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:05,952	| IOT013 |	Will be amazing
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:08,256	| IOT013 |	Because you basically just tell it what you want
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,560	| IOT013 |	And it plays it in the sound quality is pretty
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:14,400	| IOT013 |	It's its equivalent with like a jam box or something
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,704	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:19,520	| IOT013 |	But that aside my husband didn't think he'd use it
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,800	| IOT013 |	But again he uses it every night
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:23,616	| IOT013 |	We actually use it at the dinner table to settle like
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,640	| IOT013 |	Debates
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,944	| IOT013 |	Who is president in
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,504	| IOT013 |	Oh you should ask it who was president in
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,528	| IOT013 |	1841
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,320	| IOT013 |	Because that is
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,624	| IOT013 |	Secret Pop Quiz question and you will be surprised
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,696	| IOT013 |	Put that there
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:41,024	| IOT013 |	I'm thinking but I don't know
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,816	| IOT013 |	That's all I know
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,120	| IOT013 |	I think you should spend the money
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,144	| IOT013 |	If
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,448	| IOT013 |	If you have actually Hue Lights you should see
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:54,336	| IOT013 |	We've actually set it up so when you tell it to play music are Hue Lights in the living room flash on and off
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:57,152	| IOT013 |	I didn't see the color circle
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,432	| IOT013 |	Which is fine
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,224	| IOT013 |	So my advice
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,760	| IOT013 |	If you have music
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,040	| IOT013 |	On Amazon
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,320	| IOT013 |	Prime
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,880	| IOT013 |	Amazon yeah Amazon Prime music service
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,392	| IOT013 |	If you have
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:10,464	| IOT013 |	Connected lights that are Hue or WeMo enabled
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,512	| IOT013 |	And if you
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:17,120	| IOT013 |	What are elected like you're very excited about voice-activated technology
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,912	| IOT013 |	This is an easy
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:19,424	| IOT013 |	Easy Spanish
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:22,240	| IOT013 |	And it's actually relatively low cost
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:25,056	| IOT013 |	When you think about what it does do for you so that's fair
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,080	| IOT013 |	What's gravity group
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:28,384	| IOT013 |	And I use the kitchen timer part of it all the time
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:33,760	| IOT013 |	Everything I have plenty of other timers but it's very nice just to be like hey Alexa set a timer for 15 minutes
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,320	| IOT013 |	Or hey Alexa what time is it
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,136	| IOT013 |	Everybody's if you have one right now it's going off
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,208	| IOT013 |	Sorry y'all okay
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,000	| IOT013 |	So I think that that
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,304	| IOT013 |	Covers Us for this week that's a lot of news
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,352	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,632	| IOT013 |	So please

EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:53,216	| IOT013 |	Because our guest today is the CEO of lumoid
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,264	| IOT013 |	Which is a company that allows you
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,544	| IOT013 |	To rent
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,056	| IOT013 |	Cameras
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,104	| IOT013 |	Drones and wearables
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:06,016	| IOT013 |	I'm going to talk about some surprising data that lumoid has to offer people about werewolves and where they met

EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:22,208	| IOT013 |	This is actually really good way to do it I know several journalists who've done this before they've covered stories in that sort of
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:23,232	| IOT013 |	So
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:26,304	| IOT013 |	We're mostly concerned about your wearable stuff
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,072	| IOT013 |	Because
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,352	| IOT013 |	In addition to like
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,888	| IOT013 |	Having the stuff in the business line
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,424	| IOT013 |	You are also a dataset
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:35,008	| IOT013 |	And your prior company trueandco
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,056	| IOT013 |	Which I have also used
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:40,896	| IOT013 |	Was a kind of an online retailer meets offline retailing for
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,920	| IOT013 |	Surprise
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:44,736	| IOT013 |	And you actually sent people bras out to try
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,016	| IOT013 |	And
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,320	| IOT013 |	Gather data on what bras
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,856	| IOT013 |	Actually gather fit data for them
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,392	| IOT013 |	Then you sent the prize out for
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,184	| IOT013 |	And then
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,464	| IOT013 |	You guys
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:55,744	| IOT013 |	Kind of track
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:58,816	| IOT013 |	What people actually kept from the ones that you sent to them
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,864	| IOT013 |	And then felt even bigger and better profiles
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,936	| IOT013 |	So how does that attention towards data kind of
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:06,496	| IOT013 |	How does that influence what you're doing it live
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:10,592	| IOT013 |	When I was doing so I went off the coupon first air
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,896	| IOT013 |	My job was to go
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:15,968	| IOT013 |	M14 pinyin online
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:17,760	| IOT013 |	One of the things that the exact blood
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:21,088	| IOT013 |	The entire world was going from
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,416	| IOT013 |	Physical retail stores and online say the same
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,720	| IOT013 |	But people still wanted
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,536	| IOT013 |	Chest and touching feeling
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:32,352	| IOT013 |	Actually try out items before they committed to buying them
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:38,240	| IOT013 |	The try before you buy was a no-brainer that worked out really well
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:41,824	| IOT013 |	Anthony spark needed even more interesting and useful on both sides
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:45,152	| IOT013 |	And so far as the story by
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:52,064	| IOT013 |	Is something that we tested before and it's worked really well and in the age of consumer electronics
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:56,416	| IOT013 |	Now you're seeing Manufacturing moralistic
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:32:01,280	| IOT013 |	And Scott is getting into manufactured and used in Kickstarter campaign
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:04,864	| IOT013 |	Just lots and lots of manufacturing Innovation happening
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,424	| IOT013 |	And the net result here is that
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,728	| IOT013 |	Are many many options to try
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,544	| IOT013 |	But there is no way for you to test drive in
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:13,824	| IOT013 |	In the comfort of your home
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:18,432	| IOT013 |	Unless you was deciding to pay full price
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,712	| IOT013 |	Awesome so
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:21,248	| IOT013 |	What I'm seeing like
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:23,552	| IOT013 |	Right now you've got like a runner's kid on the site
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:30,464	| IOT013 |	And let see in that as the Fitbit charge HR the Garmin vivosmart the Jawbone UP24 in the street
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,488	| IOT013 |	Fusion
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:35,328	| IOT013 |	That's poor and I get this for like a week and it cost me
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:37,376	| IOT013 |	It looks like $25 is what this cost
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:41,728	| IOT013 |	Do weed work if you get to either pick a kid
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,824	| IOT013 |	You want to measure
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:50,176	| IOT013 |	We also have these fun little kids like things like that
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:53,760	| IOT013 |	If you'll fit into one of these please set aside
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:57,856	| IOT013 |	Buckets of what kind of credible person you are
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:01,440	| IOT013 |	You can get the kids or you can pick and choose up to five items
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:04,512	| IOT013 |	And it's all on the cartwrights and you can add the
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,280	| IOT013 |	Winter Park
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,560	| IOT013 |	Try them out for two weeks
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:11,680	| IOT013 |	Whenever you decide at the end of two weeks when you decide which one
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,960	| IOT013 |	Is the best for you
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,496	| IOT013 |	Everyday commands
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:15,776	| IOT013 |	Workout with me
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,312	| IOT013 |	You're really bad at context
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:24,224	| IOT013 |	And at the end of the lease once you decided which one
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:25,248	| IOT013 |	The best for you
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:28,064	| IOT013 |	Will send you a brand-new one of your choice
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:28,832	| IOT013 |	And that
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,368	| IOT013 |	Price of judicially pig
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:31,648	| IOT013 |	$25
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,976	| IOT013 |	And then it goes up as you get more expensive devices
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,280	| IOT013 |	That goes towards the purchase of the item
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:41,376	| IOT013 |	You also have a really interesting gender split on the wearable side
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:47,264	| IOT013 |	I think four for most of your product so for the drones you have drones and photography are your other two section
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:51,104	| IOT013 |	And those it looks like they're about 74% male
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:54,688	| IOT013 |	Yeah and that's what's the interesting part
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:57,248	| IOT013 |	The most exciting part
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:59,808	| IOT013 |	Monday-saturday photo video gear
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:00,832	| IOT013 |	And then you find it
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:01,600	| IOT013 |	Drones
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:07,488	| IOT013 |	Retracted gender split and for the longest time
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:09,280	| IOT013 |	26 virgin female
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:11,072	| IOT013 |	Launch printable
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:14,912	| IOT013 |	And Parabola is volume 59%
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:17,984	| IOT013 |	Answer me that was incredibly surprising because
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:23,360	| IOT013 |	The perception that you see in mainstream media that gravel dissolve used by men
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:26,688	| IOT013 |	It's cheetah to understand the sizes are good chords
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:28,992	| IOT013 |	Pragmatism
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,552	| IOT013 |	By the people who are actually using this
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:36,928	| IOT013 |	Happened to be more female than men
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,488	| IOT013 |	And you'll have a coordinated dance
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:42,816	| IOT013 |	+ 4
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:48,192	| IOT013 |	Most marathons 60% to 55%
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:49,216	| IOT013 |	And 42
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:54,080	| IOT013 |	McCormick's very well with back pain
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:59,456	| IOT013 |	Yeah I wonder if that's because women are more likely to want to try or if we're just more active
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:01,248	| IOT013 |	For we just care about having
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,272	| IOT013 |	Stats I don't know
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:13,024	| IOT013 |	2 months ago and you've been tracking it initially we just thought it was an anomaly
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:16,352	| IOT013 |	And maybe decorated falling out the crib
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:19,168	| IOT013 |	I've been excited reaching out to the customers and
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:23,008	| IOT013 |	The more we cleaned up the green Adam RV rental
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,800	| IOT013 |	Define
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:28,896	| IOT013 |	It's actually true and you know
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:33,760	| IOT013 |	Kind of different from the rest of consumer electronics has how the perception is
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:36,064	| IOT013 |	It's much more females are there
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:41,184	| IOT013 |	And we should be able to just conference play one of the speakers at the same thing they were like
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,720	| IOT013 |	Our customers are
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:43,744	| IOT013 |	Mostly female
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,584	| IOT013 |	Largest airplane
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,888	| IOT013 |	And I think this is something that we go
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:53,728	| IOT013 |	We started telling manufacturer Partners to
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:57,568	| IOT013 |	You need to take notice there's a lot
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:59,616	| IOT013 |	Maui now
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:02,944	| IOT013 |	Not sure if that's how you're confusing it but that's ardida
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:06,528	| IOT013 |	And it might be helpful for you to keep that in mind for your next version of the
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,320	| IOT013 |	Oh that just means more people
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,624	| IOT013 |	That's
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:14,464	| IOT013 |	Unfortunately that's that's what what I've experienced so far in the gadget world
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,744	| IOT013 |	Let's put some pink on it
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,536	| IOT013 |	You also have the
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,816	| IOT013 |	The Apple watch
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:19,584	| IOT013 |	Twitch
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:20,352	| IOT013 |	Is
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,376	| IOT013 |	Ghetto super hot
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,912	| IOT013 |	And it says I think I can

EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:01,472	| IOT013 |	But it sounds like on the wearable side it's really like
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,240	| IOT013 |	Hopefully I passed
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:02,752	| IOT013 |	2 conversion
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:06,080	| IOT013 |	I don't see a lot of people thinking of man I really need a

EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:08,128	| IOT013 |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:11,200	| IOT013 |	It's more of a try-before-you-buy as opposed to like
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,016	| IOT013 |	A drone to do a project or something
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:18,368	| IOT013 |	What are the percent of people are percent of purchases people who convert

EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:31,680	| IOT013 |	And it sounds like the most popular wearables are the Garmin Vivo
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:35,520	| IOT013 |	Vivosmart the Jawbone UP24 in the whiting's pulse O2
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:42,688	| IOT013 |	That's the most popular to try but it looks like the ones that are most popular buyer a little bit different to jawbone up 24 in
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,480	| IOT013 |	Garmin vivosmart are both on that list
EDL	00:38:45,504	00:38:48,576	| IOT013 |	The most popular one to buy is actually the Fitbit charge HR

EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:06,527	| IOT013 |	And use the wearable with a way to stop dementia life.
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:09,343	| IOT013 |	I think a lot of people
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,367	| IOT013 |	Once I get
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:12,415	| IOT013 |	This particular wearable

EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:30,335	| IOT013 |	You can't expect everything to change just because you have you noticed watch on you
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:33,407	| IOT013 |	And I feel a lot of people trying to do that continually
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:36,991	| IOT013 |	And I almost want to tell them what what did you expect
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:37,503	| IOT013 |	Annies
