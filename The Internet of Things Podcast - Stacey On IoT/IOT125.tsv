EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:47,616	| IOT125 |	Cooley
EDL	00:00:48,128	00:00:51,712	| IOT125 |	Is VP of iot at silicon labs
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:53,248	| IOT125 |	And he's going to talk about
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:56,064	| IOT125 |	The hard problems that we need to solve
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,856	| IOT125 |	For The Internet of Things tours
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:02,208	| IOT125 |	We're also going to have a message from our sponsor haikou solution
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:04,256	| IOT125 |	And now let's go to another message
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:11,936	| IOT125 |	This week's sponsor is Eero earobics a Wi-Fi router that uses
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:17,056	| IOT125 |	Mesh WiFi entire house in to make it really easy to set up
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:22,432	| IOT125 |	Wi-Fi in areas that may be hard to reach so we're talking about the new
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:28,832	| IOT125 |	2nd generation mesh wi-fi system the Euro introduced earlier this year
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:35,232	| IOT125 |	Eero the taxes that have main router and then one to two beacons these are mesh access points
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:41,632	| IOT125 |	That plug right into the wall they have a night light they're super cool and all of this can be
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:48,032	| IOT125 |	Be yours for 399 for that one arrow in the two beacons you can also if you have existing
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:54,432	| IOT125 |	Heroes you can actually buy additional begins if you just want to extend your system
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,456	| IOT125 |	Night Beach
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:59,296	| IOT125 |	In the far up north area
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:05,696	| IOT125 |	The Canada if this sounds good to you Cody Eero e e r o
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:10,048	| IOT125 |	. calm and you can get free shipping if you include the code
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,328	| IOT125 |	Stacy
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,144	| IOT125 |	A before we get back to our show
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:19,776	| IOT125 |	Actually wanted to tell you the story because I have one of my Eero beacons upstairs on my roof deck
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,800	| IOT125 |	The power like
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,360	| IOT125 |	My Sonos system up there and some lights
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,920	| IOT125 |	And I got an email the other day from
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,480	| IOT125 |	Hero they were just like by the way we noticed that your
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:31,296	| IOT125 |	Roof Eero Beacon is having some erratic
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,576	| IOT125 |	Performance issues
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,344	| IOT125 |	And
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,648	| IOT125 |	We just wanted to get some information about it so we can
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,416	| IOT125 |	Find out what's going on
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,696	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| IOT125 |	Isotope
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,744	| IOT125 |	Back to thing
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,048	| IOT125 |	Hey it's outside on my roof
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:45,376	| IOT125 |	Inside a metal cabinet so that probably explains why it's not working
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:45,888	| IOT125 |	They were like
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,680	| IOT125 |	Yes
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:52,800	| IOT125 |	Could you listen don't place your router's a faraday cage
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| IOT125 |	Exactly
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| IOT125 |	Also
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:57,920	| IOT125 |	Apparently these are only good at temperatures below 95
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:58,944	| IOT125 |	Switch is not
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,736	| IOT125 |	Summertime so
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,504	| IOT125 |	I move that
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,552	| IOT125 |	And
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,648	| IOT125 |	You know I just want you to know that if you buy these things you apparently get proactive service calls
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| IOT125 |	Some things are not working
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,696	| IOT125 |	Yay
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,232	| IOT125 |	All right
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,512	| IOT125 |	Now back to the show
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,584	| IOT125 |	Let's start off talking about
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,608	| IOT125 |	Bricks
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,960	| IOT125 |	Actually we're going to talk about locks that turn into bricks
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,984	| IOT125 |	Yay
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,776	| IOT125 |	What state
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:25,312	| IOT125 |	They make lox
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,128	| IOT125 |	And they make locks actually that are used in Airbnb
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,480	| IOT125 |	Their profession that there should be professional-grade I guess is what I'm
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,272	| IOT125 |	Button
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,576	| IOT125 |	They sent out an update last Monday in
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| IOT125 |	We did see this
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,904	| IOT125 |	Did brixham is there
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,720	| IOT125 |	Fox and so they got the software update
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:46,560	| IOT125 |	And then suddenly they were like I can't connect back to the home service
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,072	| IOT125 |	Or any other
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,864	| IOT125 |	So what that means is
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:52,448	| IOT125 |	Then they couldn't fix the problem without either
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,240	| IOT125 |	Padding the person uninstall the lock-in
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,288	| IOT125 |	Send it back to them or physically sending a person to
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,896	| IOT125 |	Real remote access to do anything to the lock was just
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:01,664	| IOT125 |	Gone and
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,992	| IOT125 |	Basically customers of these lost could either
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,016	| IOT125 |	Channellock back
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,368	| IOT125 |	And it would take between 14 and 18 days for replacements
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:14,208	| IOT125 |	I guess maybe they could send somebody out to fix it
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,232	| IOT125 |	Luckily
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:17,536	| IOT125 |	It was only I say only an elder
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,327	| IOT125 |	It's all relative course
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,351	| IOT125 |	500
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,375	| IOT125 |	Customers were
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,655	| IOT125 |	I'm totally affected
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,727	| IOT125 |	And 200 of them were those were Airbnb host
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,775	| IOT125 |	These are all first generation
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,567	| IOT125 |	6000i models
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:30,591	| IOT125 |	Of the wok
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,383	| IOT125 |	So it's not like
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,175	| IOT125 |	Thousands or millions of blocks but
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:34,687	| IOT125 |	Still
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:39,039	| IOT125 |	Make a few reasons for Airbnb and it kind of puts out of business in a sentence right
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,319	| IOT125 |	Yeah because
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| IOT125 |	You still have
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,671	| IOT125 |	But
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:51,839	| IOT125 |	But that make nearby that's a challenge yes that's how they are you have a rental home
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:56,959	| IOT125 |	Far far away and you just are being bit and now you got to work on the logistics of getting somebody the key
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:59,263	| IOT125 |	Getting the key back from them and so on
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:02,847	| IOT125 |	So this is actually not a new phenomenon back
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:07,455	| IOT125 |	Probably 2 years ago I think it was wink smart home hub
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,991	| IOT125 |	They actually had an update
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,783	| IOT125 |	The break their devices
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,599	| IOT125 |	Certification there DNS service
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,159	| IOT125 |	Vacation broke during a software update so
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,439	| IOT125 |	I couldn't call back to home
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,231	| IOT125 |	And what it meant
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:25,375	| IOT125 |	And this was a huge deal for them and I think probably contributed to kind of some of the problems and Corky's eventual bankruptcy
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| IOT125 |	Was that
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,447	| IOT125 |	They had their
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,727	| IOT125 |	Customers send back there
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,007	| IOT125 |	Cubs
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| IOT125 |	Or
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,823	| IOT125 |	You can actually go in on your own
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,639	| IOT125 |	In a log into your router and change the
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,151	| IOT125 |	DNS settings
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,967	| IOT125 |	For some people that was just too much
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| IOT125 |	Touch in Sol
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,247	| IOT125 |	Those people
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,551	| IOT125 |	Week actually sent them
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,063	| IOT125 |	A box
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:49,183	| IOT125 |	You shipped it to them and then you got a new one back with all the
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,695	| IOT125 |	Your programming
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:59,935	| IOT125 |	So two things come to mind with a story to me
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:04,543	| IOT125 |	The one is that lockstate says they can manually update the lockup have physical access to it
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,567	| IOT125 |	Clearly
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,359	| IOT125 |	There's some communication Sports
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,663	| IOT125 |	On the device on the lock itself that is not
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| IOT125 |	Rely upon
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:14,015	| IOT125 |	Wireless connectivity so I wonder
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| IOT125 |	If
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:20,159	| IOT125 |	In the future some of these locks should be designed with actual customer access to that
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,951	| IOT125 |	Because that would save a lot of time if you could
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:25,279	| IOT125 |	Update your own firmware number one but you can't do it
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,815	| IOT125 |	Without access to that poor
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,351	| IOT125 |	Well so here's the downside though
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,167	| IOT125 |	Where that Port is
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,959	| IOT125 |	It may not be something you
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:33,727	| IOT125 |	He want on a lock
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,007	| IOT125 |	Because some thief
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| IOT125 |	Is there only
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:39,103	| IOT125 |	USB with their own firmware on it
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,127	| IOT125 |	Indication for
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,431	| IOT125 |	Hahaha
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,455	| IOT125 |	I got you the crew
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:46,527	| IOT125 |	That's totally another Point ioi reason because
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,087	| IOT125 |	According to the weather reports I read lockstate
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,927	| IOT125 |	It says they can manually update the lock up their physical access to it meaning to me
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,743	| IOT125 |	Citrus swapping it out they're updating the firmware so that
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,791	| IOT125 |	Actually exist as how I'm reading
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,815	| IOT125 |	I could be wrong
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| IOT125 |	No no that make sense
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,191	| IOT125 |	And the other thing is
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| IOT125 |	You may disagree
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,775	| IOT125 |	But one of the reasons I've never
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,823	| IOT125 |	Look at the
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:12,383	| IOT125 |	Type of Smart Lock that fit over existing
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,151	| IOT125 |	Lock
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:14,175	| IOT125 |	Is
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:18,527	| IOT125 |	I want to make sure that I've got key access and other ways to get into something
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:24,159	| IOT125 |	Right I've always stayed with the traditional looking type locks which could happen
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| IOT125 |	Type of problem as well but
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,743	| IOT125 |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:32,863	| IOT125 |	There are cases like if your renting then this kind of lock
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,911	| IOT125 |	Baby
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,959	| IOT125 |	More acceptable to a landlord
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,799	| IOT125 |	But yes I'm I'm with you a hundred
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,311	| IOT125 |	2%
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:44,639	| IOT125 |	What kind of deadbolt turning lock that would be like in August or some
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,711	| IOT125 |	Ratatouille those have key access or no
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,015	| IOT125 |	I'm trying to remember I'm done
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,063	| IOT125 |	I had an August installed
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,367	| IOT125 |	It was like 2 years ago and now I'm like did it have a
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,415	| IOT125 |	I can't tell you
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,951	| IOT125 |	I don't know. Okay
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:00,511	| IOT125 |	It's okay I'm actually looking right now on there
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,535	| IOT125 |	On the product site
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,839	| IOT125 |	I'm just curious it looks like
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,863	| IOT125 |	There is a
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| IOT125 |	Key type lock
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:10,751	| IOT125 |	So you do have access is probably not the same key as you would have for your door
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,847	| IOT125 |	It might be actually LOL
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,383	| IOT125 |	Actually
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,455	| IOT125 |	Yeah yeah so you're not covering the the locked
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,479	| IOT125 |	The key tumbler part
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,503	| IOT125 |	So you could do
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,551	| IOT125 |	Secrets
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,879	| IOT125 |	I rescind my point yes
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,903	| IOT125 |	Aventura
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,143	| IOT125 |	That's alright that's okay William
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,471	| IOT125 |	Sorry
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,263	| IOT125 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,591	| IOT125 |	Which makes all kinds of thing
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,383	| IOT125 |	Starbucks
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:54,015	| IOT125 |	Yes back in 2011 or 2012 or the software developers from Google Afton
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,087	| IOT125 |	Move to Shenzhen and traded
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,391	| IOT125 |	You say uncle right anchor but you're probably right
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,927	| IOT125 |	And then another
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,719	| IOT125 |	Key Personnel Google
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,487	| IOT125 |	Join him
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,511	| IOT125 |	And yeah they make
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,327	| IOT125 |	Y'all kind of terrestrial spring
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,959	| IOT125 |	Start with smart batteries now they make cables and adapters all things but
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,727	| IOT125 |	Now they make
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,519	| IOT125 |	Something else which is intriguing
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,823	| IOT125 |	You think it's the eufy genie
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,127	| IOT125 |	I think it is the eufy
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,639	| IOT125 |	Genie
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| IOT125 |	Such a strange
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| IOT125 |	Yuki Cheney $35
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| IOT125 |	Madame GAO powers
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,087	| IOT125 |	Smart speed
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,671	| IOT125 |	This was a big deal people wrote about it a lot
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,511	| IOT125 |	Clare County review on CNBC and they were like
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,631	| IOT125 |	15 bus more just buy the echo instead because it has slightly
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,655	| IOT125 |	More capabilities
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,191	| IOT125 |	And so
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,239	| IOT125 |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:52,127	| IOT125 |	Well I mean on paper that you feed looks and sounds good is slightly bigger than an echo.
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:57,503	| IOT125 |	As you said it's $15 less expensive they say that the audio driver inside
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:02,879	| IOT125 |	Deliver stronger base in 20% more volume. Which I don't know because I have not seen this yet
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,439	| IOT125 |	One of the things that jumped out at me though is
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,975	| IOT125 |	It only has
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,535	| IOT125 |	A two microphone array
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,071	| IOT125 |	And I think the.
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,399	| IOT125 |	I want to say it's use the same 7 Michael raise the echo
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:20,287	| IOT125 |	Okay do you need sound from CNBC said that the sound was not that
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| IOT125 |	Gotcha
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,783	| IOT125 |	That far field
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:35,903	| IOT125 |	Michael Ray is actually just mentions cuz interesting I didn't realize this is powered by synaptics
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,439	| IOT125 |	Who recently
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| IOT125 |	Bought
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| IOT125 |	Connexient
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,583	| IOT125 |	And it's actually connections product that does the the audio or the the microphone
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:47,679	| IOT125 |	Okay so you can tow and that thing that
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| IOT125 |	They were sad about his cuz
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,007	| IOT125 |	It is not actually an echo
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:55,103	| IOT125 |	You could do some things that you can do with an echo but not others like calling other Echo
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,199	| IOT125 |	Amazon specific Services then
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:04,575	| IOT125 |	So so this has the voice Services behind the echo but not
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,135	| IOT125 |	Every single other Amazon service
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,975	| IOT125 |	I don't know I have yet to
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| IOT125 |	Use other than calling you that
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| IOT125 |	One time
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,815	| IOT125 |	I have yet to use
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:20,191	| IOT125 |	Any of my echo calling features including people call people on my Echo Show
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:25,055	| IOT125 |	Which is kind of a bummer I really want my mom to get one
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:25,567	| IOT125 |	Because of privacy
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| IOT125 |	I can't talk to him
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:36,319	| IOT125 |	And I agree with you on that and I can also verify cousin looking at Amazon's pitching out the echo Dot drugs have 7 for free
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,367	| IOT125 |	Real microphones so there's a potential difference
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,951	| IOT125 |	Okay
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,255	| IOT125 |	That's that now
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,535	| IOT125 |	From the really cheap end
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,327	| IOT125 |	To directions to Tracy
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,631	| IOT125 |	What is talk about snoo
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,911	| IOT125 |	Because
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:54,239	| IOT125 |	There's a review out for the snoo and if you're like Stacy bless you
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| IOT125 |	No
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,079	| IOT125 |	This is a party at you yes
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,359	| IOT125 |	What's new
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,175	| IOT125 |	It is a smart sleeping bassinet
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,455	| IOT125 |	Fur babies
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:08,063	| IOT125 |	You guys we remember this because it actually came out last year I actually saw it
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,575	| IOT125 |	In
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,415	| IOT125 |	CES it actually I think I saw it again in the beta store here in
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:12,927	| IOT125 |	In Austin
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,231	| IOT125 |	So but I don't have a baby
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:18,047	| IOT125 |	So I couldn't text review it and say
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,887	| IOT125 |	So baby tell me how did you sleep last night
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,191	| IOT125 |	Right
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:26,495	| IOT125 |	No one was willing to let me borrow a newborn
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,287	| IOT125 |	Go figure
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,847	| IOT125 |	Put in some crazy crib that comes with
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,871	| IOT125 |	You know basically a straight track
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,479	| IOT125 |	Well alright you turn the baby into a little caterpillar
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,015	| IOT125 |	There's a little
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:42,111	| IOT125 |	Yeah it's a sleepsuit so that the baby is he right kind of like in a straight jacket
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| IOT125 |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,439	| IOT125 |	What's better
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| IOT125 |	But
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:48,255	| IOT125 |	So this is a $1,200 crib
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,559	| IOT125 |	It's designed by Yves Behar
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:51,839	| IOT125 |	Doctor
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:55,423	| IOT125 |	It's the guy who wrote the happiest baby on the Block
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,495	| IOT125 |	Magikarp
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| IOT125 |	Yes
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,567	| IOT125 |	And this is attachment parenting book it's
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| IOT125 |	I read it when I was a boy
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:07,199	| IOT125 |	I paid my child sleep in the closet so I clearly
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,991	| IOT125 |	Maybe I shouldn't
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,015	| IOT125 |	People should not let me go
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:11,807	| IOT125 |	Options
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,319	| IOT125 |	But she's very high
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| IOT125 |	Dispatch
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:19,743	| IOT125 |	Which it is only a bassinet apparently works for this one baby that tray
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:24,863	| IOT125 |	I don't the parent who did the review did not say if their baby was a
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| IOT125 |	A good sleeper
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,399	| IOT125 |	Anyway
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| IOT125 |	But she did say
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:30,751	| IOT125 |	Baby got 8 hours of sleep
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,031	| IOT125 |	At
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,567	| IOT125 |	8 weeks old
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,079	| IOT125 |	Which is
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,383	| IOT125 |	Uninterrupted sleep now
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:36,895	| IOT125 |	Yeah I would
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,175	| IOT125 |	I'll be honest
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| IOT125 |	Yeah and then that's
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:44,319	| IOT125 |	We talked about pay for it we we are dimensions $1,200
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:46,111	| IOT125 |	Thing is it has a very limited
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,159	| IOT125 |	Shelf life because
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:51,231	| IOT125 |	After about three months in this particular parents case
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,511	| IOT125 |	The baby was too big for it
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,839	| IOT125 |	So you're paying basically $400 a month
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,375	| IOT125 |	For the most challenging
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,911	| IOT125 |	30 months have any babies
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,471	| IOT125 |	Wife and parents life
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| IOT125 |	Definitely those first few months you're dying
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,663	| IOT125 |	You would do anything
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,175	| IOT125 |	I put your baby in
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:17,087	| IOT125 |	So if there's a safety factor involved because the the little swaddling
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,879	| IOT125 |	Burrito that you put the baby in
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,439	| IOT125 |	I'll keep them on their back but can't roll over
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,999	| IOT125 |	Great and you don't want your baby to roll over B
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,535	| IOT125 |	Danger of SIDS
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| IOT125 |	All your doctors are going to be like
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,119	| IOT125 |	Can you put your baby on your back
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,631	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,959	| IOT125 |	Do we actually say what how it works
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:36,287	| IOT125 |	No I was just about to say what it does
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,823	| IOT125 |	That's the best part
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,615	| IOT125 |	Velcro your baby into the swaddle
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,199	| IOT125 |	You stick your baby into this water
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,991	| IOT125 |	And then the crib
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,039	| IOT125 |	It rocks back and
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:50,879	| IOT125 |	Fourth not rocking like a rocker but it goes from side to side
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,415	| IOT125 |	And then
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,231	| IOT125 |	Does it have sound does it detect when your baby's crying
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:15:00,351	| IOT125 |	Basically it has sensors it has sound and there's a white noise
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| IOT125 |	Option
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,703	| IOT125 |	But you can have and it rocks the baby when it senses that they're not sleeping
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:08,543	| IOT125 |	It's kind of got some smarts involve plus there's an app that you can actually
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| IOT125 |	Engaged
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:12,383	| IOT125 |	White Noise turn on turn off or turn the rocking motion on or off
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,943	| IOT125 |	So I actually kind of want this
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,295	| IOT125 |	I think it would be amazing for adults to have a
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,855	| IOT125 |	Sleep Number
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:24,159	| IOT125 |	I have a Sleep Number and it doesn't do that
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,439	| IOT125 |	I know
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:28,767	| IOT125 |	See when you when you kind of like like oh they're having trouble sleeping
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,327	| IOT125 |	I'm a 45 by the way
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,863	| IOT125 |	Free sleep number for something
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,375	| IOT125 |	I'm not asleep
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,447	| IOT125 |	No number for you
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| IOT125 |	Next
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,727	| IOT125 |	Next
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,311	| IOT125 |	Alright we had a couple people asked us to talk about this
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,615	| IOT125 |	So we're going to talk about this
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,919	| IOT125 |	NPR did a story on
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:49,759	| IOT125 |	It's a sensor developed by MIT it's called the super sensor
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:54,623	| IOT125 |	And basically this is a tiny sensor you stick it someplace and it uses
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:58,463	| IOT125 |	Audio signals to determine what's happening in a
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,255	| IOT125 |	Suenos
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:06,655	| IOT125 |	It's got algorithms it's a oh that's series of noises sounds like a shower or at that series of noises sounds like someone shedding
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,167	| IOT125 |	The microwave door
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,983	| IOT125 |	It's really clear what's happening in the
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| IOT125 |	Home based on sale
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,543	| IOT125 |	Very small
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:13,567	| IOT125 |	It is it's like
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,663	| IOT125 |	It's a tube Square you just plug it into your wall
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,735	| IOT125 |	This is really cool we've actually talked about this many months ago
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,295	| IOT125 |	But NPR did a story that
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,063	| IOT125 |	Was basically like
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:26,879	| IOT125 |	Are you guys sure you want to put all the smart stuff in your
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,159	| IOT125 |	Home because
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| IOT125 |	It sure a lot of
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:34,047	| IOT125 |	NPR is not wrong and we talked about this before like I have
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:36,351	| IOT125 |	Devices in my home that measure sound
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,399	| IOT125 |	Or humidity and I can tell things like
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,423	| IOT125 |	Oh hey
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:42,239	| IOT125 |	My family is in the kitchen eating dinner even though I'm not
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:42,751	| IOT125 |	At home
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,567	| IOT125 |	Or I can tell when someone's taking a shower
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,103	| IOT125 |	A sun-like humidity reading Spike
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,407	| IOT125 |	In certain rooms of my house
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:52,479	| IOT125 |	And people don't often think about the privacy and
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:56,575	| IOT125 |	Locations of this and that's one of the things we do on our show is we try to explain
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,111	| IOT125 |	Hey by the way
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,743	| IOT125 |	Used to drive what you're doing
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,279	| IOT125 |	And even who you're doing it with
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:06,815	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,119	| IOT125 |	Let me ask you this because I agree
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:12,191	| IOT125 |	Call Heartland the whole privacy aspect we have talked about it many times
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,471	| IOT125 |	In your home
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,775	| IOT125 |	I assume that your family has
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,847	| IOT125 |	Agreed to give up their privacy to you which
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,895	| IOT125 |	She's not a big deal you're a happy family
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:25,759	| IOT125 |	Are you talking about privacy that goes outside beyond the home and other companies
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,783	| IOT125 |	And the reason why
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,063	| IOT125 |	It's kind of a two prong
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| IOT125 |	There is
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,879	| IOT125 |	And worried about companies getting the data
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,951	| IOT125 |	And or I guess I should say my case
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,743	| IOT125 |	Family is not too keen on me knowing
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,023	| IOT125 |	Where they are mother doing
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,559	| IOT125 |	So they were different
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,375	| IOT125 |	Yes so I think that you're right there
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| IOT125 |	Definitely tula
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:48,031	| IOT125 |	We don't have gas family decided we don't want cameras inside our house
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:51,871	| IOT125 |	Face inside the house unless we're gone and then we position like Arlo's we got
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,687	| IOT125 |	Does fun Arlo cameras will position those differ
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,455	| IOT125 |	Places
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:59,039	| IOT125 |	And you know when my parents are here at there's an echo dot in the guest room
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:00,063	| IOT125 |	They turn that off
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,831	| IOT125 |	I don't want that
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:07,231	| IOT125 |	Yeah when we have a sitter or someone like when we had when we went out of town
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:10,303	| IOT125 |	We actually told the person who is in our house I was like
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:12,607	| IOT125 |	Hey by the way there's cameras located here here
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,935	| IOT125 |	Because I trust her and I
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:19,007	| IOT125 |	I think she's going to do anything bad but I didn't want her to be caught
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,031	| IOT125 |	Picking her nose on the cameras up
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,311	| IOT125 |	I thought
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,383	| IOT125 |	So there's that level and I think there's a set of
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:28,223	| IOT125 |	And then there's the
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,015	| IOT125 |	Surveillance
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:32,831	| IOT125 |	Kind of Internet surveillance in
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,623	| IOT125 |	1 companies are not great with
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,951	| IOT125 |	What's using data we actually just saw the FTC this week find Uber
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:41,535	| IOT125 |	For having their employees finding out who is
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,303	| IOT125 |	Driving
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,071	| IOT125 |	Where is showing
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,119	| IOT125 |	That kind of thing
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:49,471	| IOT125 |	Is really unsettling to me like I am very aware that when I'm testing doorbell
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,519	| IOT125 |	When I go out at my front door
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,615	| IOT125 |	Grungy clothes in my hair's all a mess
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,407	| IOT125 |	Oh my God you know if I
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,479	| IOT125 |	Pissed off his company and they were immature they could like totally
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:08,415	| IOT125 |	What
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,719	| IOT125 |	Play something
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| IOT125 |	Sure
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:16,095	| IOT125 |	Yeah and then that's a thought that we talked about that topic many times
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,887	| IOT125 |	It's interesting
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,447	| IOT125 |	For me and my family when we got our Nest cam
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:23,775	| IOT125 |	The only way they would let me actually install it my family that is
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,055	| IOT125 |	Was
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,103	| IOT125 |	To make sure use all of the features
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:29,919	| IOT125 |	That use their phones for locations for them when they are
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,223	| IOT125 |	In the house it does not come on
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,551	| IOT125 |	And also to schedule it so that it goes
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:38,623	| IOT125 |	Automatically on the bed and it was
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,903	| IOT125 |	Off automatically
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:43,743	| IOT125 |	Before they go to bed and go downstairs and you know get themselves ready for the day
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:46,303	| IOT125 |	So they they set up Wii workout rules
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,095	| IOT125 |	To actually implement this
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:52,191	| IOT125 |	So it was compromised
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,239	| IOT125 |	You can't just start setting the stuff up
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:58,079	| IOT125 |	And I think the other thing that the story brings out that
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,103	| IOT125 |	People may not be aware of
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,383	| IOT125 |	Is
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,199	| IOT125 |	Not just bad or immature actors that accompanied
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:03,711	| IOT125 |	Doing something stupid
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,551	| IOT125 |	But there's also a lot of questions about
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,599	| IOT125 |	You know if you can tell
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:12,415	| IOT125 |	That there are three people who live in my home
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:18,815	| IOT125 |	And you can tell when we take showers and you can tell that we apparently use the microwave a whole lot
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,351	| IOT125 |	That data may be valuable
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:20,863	| IOT125 |	Malta Subway
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:28,031	| IOT125 |	Absolutely you know and if you can tell from the sound my appliances make maybe you can figure out what kind of appliances I have
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,615	| IOT125 |	Then you can start selling that data to others
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,895	| IOT125 |	That gets a little creepy
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,199	| IOT125 |	I think it should creep people out
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,479	| IOT125 |	Because
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,503	| IOT125 |	It's surprising to them
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,551	| IOT125 |	I think it's surprising to a lot of
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,063	| IOT125 |	People
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,855	| IOT125 |	We think of cameras
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,903	| IOT125 |	Is like
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,183	| IOT125 |	But we don't think about that
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:45,695	| IOT125 |	In relation to a lot
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:47,999	| IOT125 |	Which is funny because
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,863	| IOT125 |	We have thought about in the past but she said gone away just a smartphone itself which is been around
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,423	| IOT125 |	Modern version for amino 10 years now
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:57,727	| IOT125 |	It's got a camera it's got a microphone
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,775	| IOT125 |	I've got GPS
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| IOT125 |	The cellular
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:04,383	| IOT125 |	Carriers know where you are apps can know where you are
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,711	| IOT125 |	A whole Treasure Trove of that that's up there
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:10,015	| IOT125 |	And yet we've kind of mostly gotten over that
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,831	| IOT125 |	I think so and maybe that's why
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:14,111	| IOT125 |	Manufacturers of reliable
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,184	| IOT125 |	French
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,256	| IOT125 |	I don't know how to solve this
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| IOT125 |	I dunno
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,560	| IOT125 |	You should definitely
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| IOT125 |	And now
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:27,936	| IOT125 |	We're going to talk about the Internet of Things expanding outside of this
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,728	| IOT125 |	Into the city streets
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:32,288	| IOT125 |	Does an MIT project called carioca
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,336	| IOT125 |	I made it uses
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:34,848	| IOT125 |	Toll tag
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,896	| IOT125 |	On cars
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,920	| IOT125 |	2
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:42,016	| IOT125 |	Basically determine where they are in the city and ideas you could use this for
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,040	| IOT125 |	Figuring out
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:47,392	| IOT125 |	Where cars are parked and understand a little bit more about traffic patterns
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,416	| IOT125 |	And
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,696	| IOT125 |	You know figure out
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:50,976	| IOT125 |	Parking options
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,072	| IOT125 |	The challenge here is
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:59,424	| IOT125 |	Again privacy do you really want to know he don't do you want
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,728	| IOT125 |	Anyone else to know that you parked in front of
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,288	| IOT125 |	When you're at the grocery store right
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,312	| IOT125 |	Is any of the ads
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,664	| IOT125 |	I mean if it's if it's to help me find parking
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:13,504	| IOT125 |	Innocence I'm okay with that as long as I could Billy determine that
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:18,368	| IOT125 |	Technology honor off these are like an EZ Pass RFID type tags you don't turn them on or off
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| IOT125 |	But
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,184	| IOT125 |	You know it's
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:22,208	| IOT125 |	An application that would
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:25,536	| IOT125 |	Work in conjunction with this but I can say okay I'd like to find a place to
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:28,096	| IOT125 |	The park you may use my location to help me
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,608	| IOT125 |	Cinema
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,680	| IOT125 |	I mean this is just an MIT research project
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:32,704	| IOT125 |	EXO
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,264	| IOT125 |	It's worth looking at because you know things like parking
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:38,848	| IOT125 |	Are not just inconvenient for you
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,128	| IOT125 |	How to circulating lights look
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,408	| IOT125 |	Looking for parking spaces
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:44,480	| IOT125 |	It causes congestion in the city
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:45,248	| IOT125 |	Pollution so
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:46,784	| IOT125 |	Who knows
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,392	| IOT125 |	This is a pilot project this is not something you need to worry about today
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,672	| IOT125 |	But maybe tomorrow
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,952	| IOT125 |	For those of you who are privacy mind
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,488	| IOT125 |	Let's go to the
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,560	| IOT125 |	To the small news bits that are kind of fun for
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,352	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,376	| IOT125 |	My small newspaper
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:04,960	| IOT125 |	Is actually like a cool little story that someone sent me about
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,240	| IOT125 |	Scheduling a Roomba
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:07,776	| IOT125 |	To clean
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,544	| IOT125 |	Your
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,312	| IOT125 |	Office
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,080	| IOT125 |	FaceTime
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:10,592	| IOT125 |	Outlook
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:11,872	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:15,200	| IOT125 |	Which is an IP licensing company
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:17,760	| IOT125 |	Did the license for MP3s
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:20,320	| IOT125 |	So they're developing an intelligent cleaning Concepts
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,136	| IOT125 |	And
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,720	| IOT125 |	Schedule something in Outlook and then your room
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:30,560	| IOT125 |	Go
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:33,376	| IOT125 |	And you can put the put the bookings in
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,168	| IOT125 |	Prioritize things
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,728	| IOT125 |	And then the robots going to basically update
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,520	| IOT125 |	Band
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,056	| IOT125 |	Go
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:42,848	| IOT125 |	Wander around
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,200	| IOT125 |	So if I had had that in my office
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,272	| IOT125 |	Environment I think I would try to find a way to hack it so that it
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,088	| IOT125 |	I could schedule the Roomba leg drop
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:58,720	| IOT125 |	Cherry was Oliver somebody's Florida prank
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:01,024	| IOT125 |	There you go. Yes if you dislike your boss
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,816	| IOT125 |	You could probably use this
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,400	| IOT125 |	Yay
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:07,936	| IOT125 |	I will say
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,216	| IOT125 |	They use the
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,496	| IOT125 |	Roomba 6
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,520	| IOT125 |	50 Robot vacuum
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:15,872	| IOT125 |	Camo that they're doing and not the
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,664	| IOT125 |	It's a 900 model
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,432	| IOT125 |	Don't worry about that
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT125 |	Recently was in the news
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:24,064	| IOT125 |	Because the CEO was like hey maybe we could sell its mapping data
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,136	| IOT125 |	Yasso different Roomba
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:31,744	| IOT125 |	Not the one whose data is getting sold cuz you probably don't want your
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:34,048	| IOT125 |	Maybe you do maybe you don't want your
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:34,816	| IOT125 |	Office
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,864	| IOT125 |	Layout
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,656	| IOT125 |	I cannot
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,192	| IOT125 |	Thinking.
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,776	| IOT125 |	Superfine
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:50,944	| IOT125 |	I have a small bit of news I just found out yesterday there is a new June oven
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,224	| IOT125 |	Model that is
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,760	| IOT125 |	Hungry soon was just announced
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:57,344	| IOT125 |	For those who are not familiar the June oven is a smart
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,112	| IOT125 |	Oven
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,136	| IOT125 |	That
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,928	| IOT125 |	Has WiFi has
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:03,232	| IOT125 |	Cameras ceramic heating elements
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,280	| IOT125 |	As a touch screen display
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:07,072	| IOT125 |	And basically identifies
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:11,424	| IOT125 |	Is food you just put it in and it has recipes for so many types of foods
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,960	| IOT125 |	I just cook sporty it's fantastic
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,264	| IOT125 |	Pretty sure that you
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,288	| IOT125 |	Still have one yes
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,568	| IOT125 |	I do I still love it
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,896	| IOT125 |	We both purchased our genes
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:26,272	| IOT125 |	I think it was $1,500 is not cheap obviously but unfortunately the new June oven model
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:30,368	| IOT125 |	Is even not cheaper because it's 1995 so another $500
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,392	| IOT125 |	But the difference is
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,928	| IOT125 |	Sedative being built
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:35,232	| IOT125 |	In as a standalone unit
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,280	| IOT125 |	And I think it's all aluminum
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,048	| IOT125 |	Right now
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,840	| IOT125 |	There's a built-in version with
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,376	| IOT125 |	Stainless steel
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,168	| IOT125 |	Food grade stainless steel and
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:46,496	| IOT125 |	You got has venting built-in as well so you can now
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,520	| IOT125 |	Dodgers
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:49,312	| IOT125 |	Put it right into a wall in your kid
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:52,128	| IOT125 |	Kitchen soap for people who want to insert an oven in there
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:54,688	| IOT125 |	The June oven is now insertable if you buy this model
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:58,528	| IOT125 |	It's all the same size and everything else there's no additional features
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,344	| IOT125 |	So it's still relatively small
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:03,136	| IOT125 |	I think I cooked up to a 5 and 1/2
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,160	| IOT125 |	Chicken
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,208	| IOT125 |	So in that was crammed in there
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| IOT125 |	So this is basically a built-in version of the June
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:12,096	| IOT125 |	It's $500 more and
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:15,168	| IOT125 |	If you're building a house this would make an excellent secondary other
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,704	| IOT125 |	And it's not
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:22,848	| IOT125 |	Crazy like my two ovens in my house are Bosch ovens and they are my built ins and they were eating 15
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,432	| IOT125 |	Another.
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:30,016	| IOT125 |	I'm kind of like I wish I were building a house
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:34,368	| IOT125 |	I honestly can't remember the last time user full size oven
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:34,880	| IOT125 |	I really can't
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:39,488	| IOT125 |	I use mine in addition to I use one of mine because sometimes I'm doing two
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,000	| IOT125 |	Two things at once
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:42,304	| IOT125 |	So that's just me that's why I had
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:46,144	| IOT125 |	Okay other bit
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,680	| IOT125 |	Final small bits of news
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:54,080	| IOT125 |	Pulse which is used to be a company called cell Savers has raised 25 million dollars to switch its business model to be
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,848	| IOT125 |	Become
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:58,944	| IOT125 |	Not just someone who comes out and repairs your cell phone or your tablet when you break it but
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:04,064	| IOT125 |	To deal with smart home devices when they are broken so they will actually set up voice Act
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:08,416	| IOT125 |	Activated smart home stuff they will help repair things if they're broken or
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| IOT125 |	You're experiencing trouble
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,208	| IOT125 |	And
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:14,304	| IOT125 |	This is part of an ongoing Trend in the Amazon team is
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:18,144	| IOT125 |	Experimenting with their own version of The Geek Squad The Geek Squad has its own version of
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:18,656	| IOT125 |	Geek Squad
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,216	| IOT125 |	Installations and
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,752	| IOT125 |	I imagine we're going to see a lot more
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:25,568	| IOT125 |	Yeah these folks
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,872	| IOT125 |	They repaired more than 100,000 devices
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:30,944	| IOT125 |	So far I'm actually in the last year
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,736	| IOT125 |	They're all smart phones and tablet
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,296	| IOT125 |	Topically so broken screens and whatever else might happen
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:38,112	| IOT125 |	It doesn't make sense to expand their
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,672	| IOT125 |	Yeah because
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:47,840	| IOT125 |	I mean if you think about it everybody has one maybe two smartphones maybe other tablets better than once a couple people whatever
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:51,680	| IOT125 |	But the house might have like how many devices do you have Stacy that could
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,984	| IOT125 |	He could breathable
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:56,288	| IOT125 |	Shrek
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:59,872	| IOT125 |	Right so bye-bye expanding into this Market
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,920	| IOT125 |	Their area of
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,712	| IOT125 |	The types of devices that can do an
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:07,808	| IOT125 |	Who knows how my devices are going to repair next year I'll be very curious to see if people
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,832	| IOT125 |	Use this new service
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,392	| IOT125 |	I'll be very curious maybe I should get
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:19,072	| IOT125 |	That's most of the news we also have a gadget for our Gadget Hall of Shame
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,888	| IOT125 |	We brought you the smoke
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,424	| IOT125 |	Few weeks back
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:25,216	| IOT125 |	And now we're bringing you
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:25,984	| IOT125 |	The sound
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,568	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,360	| IOT125 |	The sound caddy is
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:35,968	| IOT125 |	I know what it sounds like if a Bluetooth speaker that's in the shape of a golf club has a
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:37,760	| IOT125 |	A shaft in golf
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:42,624	| IOT125 |	Looking head on it so it looks like you could even put with it but I wouldn't do that that's not what it's for
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:43,904	| IOT125 |	But it plays
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:48,512	| IOT125 |	Music from your phone over Bluetooth and can also recharge device
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,816	| IOT125 |	Sisters take us a bit of a battery last on a battery in there
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,656	| IOT125 |	But so you can connect it maybe smartphone
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,472	| IOT125 |	And you can even turn it upside down and
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:00,288	| IOT125 |	Shopping is at the ground while you're at the dry ranch or something like that
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,848	| IOT125 |	$129 for this
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:06,176	| IOT125 |	As of sometime not very good golfer
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:10,784	| IOT125 |	I would go absolutely berserk if somebody brought this thing to
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:13,344	| IOT125 |	The driving range next to me or Alto Golf Course
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:18,976	| IOT125 |	Just blaring music is not what conference talk about it is not acceptable so yes
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:23,840	| IOT125 |	I mean you can't even clap at golf tournaments you got to do the quotient.
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:25,888	| IOT125 |	Deer camera with a shutter though
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,912	| IOT125 |	Tell you did it out of here
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:27,936	| IOT125 |	No noise
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:29,472	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,776	| IOT125 |	This feels like a gimmick
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:34,080	| IOT125 |	Doesn't have a lot of
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:36,896	| IOT125 |	Purpose unless you're going to use it to charge
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,176	| IOT125 |	But that's what those
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,712	| IOT125 |	Anker / Anker charging
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,808	| IOT125 |	Right listen I've been on golf outings where we
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,088	| IOT125 |	Get a Little Rock SC
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:47,136	| IOT125 |	Noisy and whatnot
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:49,184	| IOT125 |	Okay maybe that would be fun
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:50,976	| IOT125 |	This would be fun for that
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:54,560	| IOT125 |	But that's not what most golfers about so I say to Mickey
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,096	| IOT125 |	So the sound caddy
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,632	| IOT125 |	Panera in the release disgusting
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,424	| IOT125 |	In the product golf is hard enough
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:04,032	| IOT125 |	But the sound caddy is helping to lighten things up while attracting Millennials and curious participant
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,104	| IOT125 |	To try so this is Millennials entry into golf
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:10,944	| IOT125 |	All right
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,504	| IOT125 |	So that concludes this week show
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:17,600	| IOT125 |	And stay tuned for a message from our sponsor haikou solution

EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| IOT125 |	Usually overwhelm anymore
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:36,960	| IOT125 |	What's the date today
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:37,728	| IOT125 |	And then
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,032	| IOT125 |	Help them to make better business
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,336	| IOT125 |	Excellent so you build algorithms
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:45,152	| IOT125 |	But there are a lot of platforms
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,920	| IOT125 |	Who's that provide
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,480	| IOT125 |	What makes Haiku different
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,760	| IOT125 |	Good questions to ask
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:53,344	| IOT125 |	Indeed provide great pieces of functionality

EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:59,488	| IOT125 |	Bear in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to real-world cases
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,536	| IOT125 |	Send a text tomorrow
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,864	| IOT125 |	You quick but often meteor crater
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:07,424	| IOT125 |	Did you find this
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:07,936	| IOT125 |	Is customized

EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,008	| IOT125 |	Mathematical
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:15,104	| IOT125 |	Based on what the client requires we can often make a recommendation as to
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,408	| IOT125 |	What data needs to be collected
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,456	| IOT125 |	And provided as an equal to this model
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:21,504	| IOT125 |	Subject matter expertise
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,016	| IOT125 |	Essential
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,320	| IOT125 |	And to work closely with our clients

EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,160	| IOT125 |	Who developed the perfect
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:32,256	| IOT125 |	End this way bro scientific perspective becomes important
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,048	| IOT125 |	So could you give me an
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:40,192	| IOT125 |	Want religious comes to mind is where the girl was too focused price ranges of collect
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:44,288	| IOT125 |	And working together with our client would you like some water
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,824	| IOT125 |	Play Someday.
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,848	| IOT125 |	Sociology

EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:52,224	| IOT125 |	We applied a similar process in the financial in the
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:57,344	| IOT125 |	Our task was to recognize specific types of motion
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:59,648	| IOT125 |	Quotes on waiting
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,696	| IOT125 |	Play some ocean parameters

EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:43,936	| IOT125 |	That's www.har.com
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:56,992	| IOT125 |	Hey everyone welcome back to the Internet of Things podcast this is your host Stacey Higginbotham and today's guest is
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:59,808	| IOT125 |	Daniel Cooley who is senior vice president
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,856	| IOT125 |	Of iot at silicon labs
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,880	| IOT125 |	Hi Daniel
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:07,744	| IOT125 |	I'm doing great thanks for having me Stacy and I am super excited to have you
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,280	| IOT125 |	We're going to talk about
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:12,608	| IOT125 |	The tough problems the heart problems that were not thinking about you
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:13,632	| IOT125 |	With the Internet of Things
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:17,472	| IOT125 |	You mentioned to me that there are four main things that you want to talk about
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,240	| IOT125 |	So let's hit him
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:20,288	| IOT125 |	First just broadly so we know what's got
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,848	| IOT125 |	Sure so this is a
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,896	| IOT125 |	But working on it the Silicon level to enable and if
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:27,456	| IOT125 |	Future so these are the things that take a long time to play out
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:28,736	| IOT125 |	What is Edge computing
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:30,784	| IOT125 |	Iot data models
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,576	| IOT125 |	Human machine interfaces
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:35,904	| IOT125 |	And shifting business models around iot that impact of silicon
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:40,512	| IOT125 |	Awesome and we touched an Aldis so I'm looking forward to getting your perspective
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:43,328	| IOT125 |	Kick it off with Edge computing
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:46,912	| IOT125 |	Because I kind of feel like cloud is so yesterday
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:47,936	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:50,496	| IOT125 |	What do you mean when you're talking about
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:52,288	| IOT125 |	Edge Computing what are headed how do you define
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:53,568	| IOT125 |	First
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,592	| IOT125 |	That's a great question
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:58,432	| IOT125 |	So I I don't mean kind of the fog iot fog
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,712	| IOT125 |	That people may read about
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:04,576	| IOT125 |	Which is most recent around gateway's gateways in the home gateways in retail commercial Factory application
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:09,184	| IOT125 |	I mean doing computations at the actual end devices
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:09,952	| IOT125 |	In the iot
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:14,816	| IOT125 |	Doing math and making decisions on a door window sensor on a power tool
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,376	| IOT125 |	On a piece of equipment that sitting out there
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,168	| IOT125 |	Because today those devices
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,216	| IOT125 |	Necessitate provide
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,496	| IOT125 |	Actually don't make too many
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:26,592	| IOT125 |	Decisions
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,384	| IOT125 |	More massive power at the edge
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,408	| IOT125 |	Because there alot of trade-offs
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:33,504	| IOT125 |	This really comes down to things like memory
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:37,600	| IOT125 |	Rock compute for decision-making DSP for math I need a battery
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,672	| IOT125 |	Because a lot of these these cases have
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:43,488	| IOT125 |	Battery-powered devices to any efforts they can you know
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:49,888	| IOT125 |	Do they make better batteries is always good right now we're seeing as we've seen a big shift in the last few years from 8-bit to three
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,656	| IOT125 |	32-bit architecture
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:57,568	| IOT125 |	Stuff that was traditionally run on 851 Coors or or simpler architecture ship to 32 bit
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,104	| IOT125 |	Nothing great or the Eagles
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:02,944	| IOT125 |	But going forward is going to be a lot more need before
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| IOT125 |	DSP
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,760	| IOT125 |	Computations in the math domain
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:10,368	| IOT125 |	As well to make better decisions around Sensor Fusion and was starting to Branch into topics like
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,648	| IOT125 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,416	| IOT125 |	At the edge
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:17,792	| IOT125 |	So that you can I know it's kind of out there but it is real and it's going to happen when I talk
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,864	| IOT125 |	Machine learning algorithms that get trained at the edge but
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,144	| IOT125 |	Ticket implemented out there
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:24,192	| IOT125 |	All right you just brought up like
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,240	| IOT125 |	Think so let's
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:28,032	| IOT125 |	I meant to say break it down a lot in the show
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,824	| IOT125 |	Let's talk about DSP
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,872	| IOT125 |	Because when I think of DSP
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:34,944	| IOT125 |	Math I think cellular base station
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,968	| IOT125 |	Voice process
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:39,296	| IOT125 |	So kind of threw that out there are we talkin about
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,320	| IOT125 |	Building Lee
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:44,160	| IOT125 |	Really power fishing DSP that are going to sit at the very edge is part of like a
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,440	| IOT125 |	An SOC or something
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,000	| IOT125 |	Pretty much it
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:49,792	| IOT125 |	Actually it's not that complicated
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,816	| IOT125 |	For the last few years
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:54,144	| IOT125 |	People making a lot of efforts on making better decisions
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:54,912	| IOT125 |	But that's not
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:57,472	| IOT125 |	Now people need a lot more math
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,776	| IOT125 |	How to make those decisions in this could be a fifties
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| IOT125 |	Play fft
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,616	| IOT125 |	Fast Fourier transforms this could be
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,664	| IOT125 |	Yes
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:08,992	| IOT125 |	This could be voice recognition like think about
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:10,272	| IOT125 |	Something like Alexa
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:14,880	| IOT125 |	Sitting down in your sock to talk to a door lock how do you do that it's battery powered it's not plugged in
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:18,464	| IOT125 |	This could be in the form of image recognition this could be
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:24,096	| IOT125 |	Glass break detectors on running as with with a microphone as a sensor not necessarily for boys but for others
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,144	| IOT125 |	Presence detection
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:30,752	| IOT125 |	Is a lot of reasons people want to do more math at the most energy constrain in the most cost
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:32,032	| IOT125 |	Constrained devices
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:34,080	| IOT125 |	And putting a big DSP chip
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:37,920	| IOT125 |	Sitting in that system just doesn't work economically or powerful it's not very powerful
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:42,016	| IOT125 |	That's today so in the future we're going to make tsp smaller
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,832	| IOT125 |	Or are we going to do something completely different
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,904	| IOT125 |	We're just going to architect soc's for the iot
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,440	| IOT125 |	I'll say that most of the
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,464	| IOT125 |	DSP that you
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,232	| IOT125 |	You could have brought up in
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:52,512	| IOT125 |	You think about her knees
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:54,048	| IOT125 |	Big Iron
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,352	| IOT125 |	Applications or or centered around
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:02,240	| IOT125 |	Strict audio but in the future we're going to make the right products for the iot just like we've done with the wireless
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:04,544	| IOT125 |	Systems and processors willing to do the same for math
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:07,360	| IOT125 |	Okay and now let's go into machine learning
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:10,688	| IOT125 |	Because this is something that the coolest product
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:11,456	| IOT125 |	It came out recent
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,504	| IOT125 |	Read to me was the Intel movidius
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,272	| IOT125 |	Dongle stick
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:18,624	| IOT125 |	It's like a stick you plug into the edge and it's using the movidius computer vision
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:20,928	| IOT125 |	Chips in architecture to
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,976	| IOT125 |	For robotics for other cool and stuff so I'm like
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,280	| IOT125 |	This is not what you're talking about
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:30,144	| IOT125 |	Middle part of it so those kind of sticks that are running our
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:33,216	| IOT125 |	Le running Linux systems with gigabytes of
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,264	| IOT125 |	In a Flash and RAM and
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:37,568	| IOT125 |	I mean this is what it in my world this is
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,848	| IOT125 |	Is pretty processor
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:39,616	| IOT125 |	Intensive
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:42,176	| IOT125 |	But the applications are going into don't necessarily need that
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,456	| IOT125 |	That's where they're starting to
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:47,040	| IOT125 |	The same kind of applications can be implemented in a much
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:51,392	| IOT125 |	Smaller architecture a much simpler software architecture and a much lower energy flicker
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:57,792	| IOT125 |	Once you kind of decide what you need it doesn't have to be this generic linux-based system it can be something that kind of extends
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:00,352	| IOT125 |	Bring the cost down so can be adopted more widely
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:06,240	| IOT125 |	So that's kind of what I'm talking about here is in these iot use cases as they come up and they really come into their full form
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,288	| IOT125 |	You start to see more silicon
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:12,640	| IOT125 |	Tailored towards those use cases unless I caught generic architectures
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:15,968	| IOT125 |	Is it going to be generic in the sense of
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:17,760	| IOT125 |	In the cloud Microsoft and
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:19,552	| IOT125 |	EBay Google are looking at
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:22,880	| IOT125 |	Specifically architected chips for a certain workload
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:24,160	| IOT125 |	Big fat
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:28,768	| IOT125 |	When we bring that down to the iot are we going to be doing those same sort of
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,304	| IOT125 |	Custom architectures
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,352	| IOT125 |	In some cases yeah it's not nice
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:33,632	| IOT125 |	Necessarily that is
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:38,240	| IOT125 |	Divine for a specific application like a cell phone or a TV or something like that
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,544	| IOT125 |	But you look far enough commonality
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:42,080	| IOT125 |	When the volume justifies it
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:45,408	| IOT125 |	You go out into the system around then you can think about application
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,176	| IOT125 |	Mclighting
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,992	| IOT125 |	Being one here where there's a lot of lighting Products
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,528	| IOT125 |	Ticket shipping is about 4 billion
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:54,624	| IOT125 |	Products physical units that get shipped every year in lining
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,672	| IOT125 |	And it's not commonality across that segment
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:58,464	| IOT125 |	You can think about doing
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:02,304	| IOT125 |	Specific applications around lighting Building Products specifically for that
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:05,376	| IOT125 |	And you know they started by just doing lighting control and then they
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,656	| IOT125 |	You know Branch into other
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,704	| IOT125 |	Functions within the lighting system
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,472	| IOT125 |	Such as
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,008	| IOT125 |	Dippin Dots
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:16,128	| IOT125 |	Sensing relaying information these light bulbs are plugged in their power
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:18,176	| IOT125 |	Do a lot of relaying are they
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:21,248	| IOT125 |	P****** sand in these networks so there's a lot of
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,272	| IOT125 |	Functions of these are
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:25,088	| IOT125 |	See maybe in terms of sensing but there's a lot of fun
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:26,880	| IOT125 |	I don't see in terms of routing
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:29,440	| IOT125 |	So they're their partner an integral part of a network
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:31,232	| IOT125 |	In a lot of somewhere
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:35,840	| IOT125 |	Ford leaving architectures that are coming into the market and some of them are in the home but most of them
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:37,888	| IOT125 |	Kind of these kind of applications are outside of the home
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:41,216	| IOT125 |	All right in another area where I feel
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:47,616	| IOT125 |	Like we might have some custom chips and maybe some algorithms is around voice not just using tsp is
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,384	| IOT125 |	But also in
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:48,896	| IOT125 |	Machine learning
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:52,736	| IOT125 |	Now you're exactly right voice is starting to come up
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,272	| IOT125 |	Very very big
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:56,064	| IOT125 |	Element of the environment
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:58,624	| IOT125 |	Something environment who's there what do they need
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:01,184	| IOT125 |	What they saying identifying you as a person
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:05,792	| IOT125 |	There's a lot of that I know in this kind of starts branching into the human machine interface
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,096	| IOT125 |	She took my Segway
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,912	| IOT125 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,680	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,448	| IOT125 |	How you interface with
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:14,240	| IOT125 |	Electronics is changing and
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:18,336	| IOT125 |	These Electronics want to know who you are on in Taylor they
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:22,176	| IOT125 |	The used towards you itself so they can do this with vision they can do this
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,968	| IOT125 |	I can do this in a number of ways
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,504	| IOT125 |	Your phone already doesn't with fingerprint
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:28,064	| IOT125 |	It's right your finger up your phone knows who you are based on
EDL	00:41:29,088	00:41:30,112	| IOT125 |	That was a big step forward
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,392	| IOT125 |	Machine interface actually
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:34,464	| IOT125 |	You may not think about it that way but that's the way the engineering side
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,768	| IOT125 |	Engineer thinking about this so
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,560	| IOT125 |	In the more that these Electronics
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:39,840	| IOT125 |	Taylor there
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,912	| IOT125 |	Application in their operation to the person
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,960	| IOT125 |	Using it it matters
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:47,008	| IOT125 |	I think about the lord always
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:47,776	| IOT125 |	Is like
EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:48,544	| IOT125 |	I want a
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:50,080	| IOT125 |	Put my hand on a door lock
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:52,895	| IOT125 |	It knows who I am by the time I start turning it
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,687	| IOT125 |	Is either going to unlock or not
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:55,711	| IOT125 |	Think about it that way
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:42:00,319	| IOT125 |	You're more generous that I am I think it should unlock or it should send it. Electricity
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:03,391	| IOT125 |	Orgeat
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:06,207	| IOT125 |	Exactly and so just the way you interface Electronics
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,487	| IOT125 |	Products
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,303	| IOT125 |	In general is changing but you need a lot of electronics
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,071	| IOT125 |	To do that
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,607	| IOT125 |	Decapitation
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,911	| IOT125 |	Is a lot of privacy security needs around that
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:19,007	| IOT125 |	A lot of data that has to be shared a different levels in the car called iot food chain
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:20,799	| IOT125 |	And soul is driving laws
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:26,943	| IOT125 |	Security needs but it's ultimately about tailoring the product experience to the user interfaces I feel like everyone's
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:30,015	| IOT125 |	High voice I love your perspective about
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:31,295	| IOT125 |	Prince but then
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:33,087	| IOT125 |	It feels like we've gone from voice
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:39,231	| IOT125 |	To like all of this like you will communicate directly via telepathy if you think of like Elon Musk and some of the Facebook ever
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:46,399	| IOT125 |	And I feel like we've Miss like a huge chunk of the middle going straight for a veto I'm going to tell you to do something that I didn't think it and it will happen
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:51,007	| IOT125 |	Being perhaps more practical cuz you have to sell actual products to
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,031	| IOT125 |	Just like real
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,055	| IOT125 |	Customers
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:57,151	| IOT125 |	What do you think the interfaces are going to be or how are you thinking about
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:57,663	| IOT125 |	The future here
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:59,199	| IOT125 |	Twister tracks
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:00,479	| IOT125 |	Because I love that
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:05,087	| IOT125 |	That angle here my head is making a big shift away from physical button
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:06,111	| IOT125 |	Athens to capacitive button
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,647	| IOT125 |	For example
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:09,695	| IOT125 |	This is super practical
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:12,767	| IOT125 |	Because the performance is better and less things break
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:19,167	| IOT125 |	If there's not a mechanical switch anymore so it's easier to manufacture it's either produce less Q's but it doesn't really stop there I think
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:21,983	| IOT125 |	The product companies that were working with right now
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:25,055	| IOT125 |	Want to remove as much you as possible
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:31,711	| IOT125 |	It is kind of a strange way to think about it but they want to remove as in decision-making and I think you can see that in his face
EDL	00:43:32,479	00:43:34,271	| IOT125 |	Use casein in remote controls that are
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,039	| IOT125 |	Being shipped with
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,343	| IOT125 |	Televisions are over-the-top box
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:41,439	| IOT125 |	You know just recently actually I had table service
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,487	| IOT125 |	Installed in in in a property that I own
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:44,511	| IOT125 |	And I haven't had cable
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,279	| IOT125 |	4 years
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,583	| IOT125 |	And they gave me this giant remotes like 50 buttons
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:50,655	| IOT125 |	What would I do with this I'm used to my
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,471	| IOT125 |	Single remote from Amazon and so everybody's driving
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:57,055	| IOT125 |	Simplify simplify simplify and as much as possible and
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:44:02,687	| IOT125 |	I remove as much interface if they can really Taylor The Experience around what they want and not know
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:06,271	| IOT125 |	Necessarily try to provide every single hook on hook and knob out there
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:10,367	| IOT125 |	Okay so tedious feel almost like a bad example because you got a screen which makes you
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,647	| IOT125 |	You able to do more with
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:13,695	| IOT125 |	Four buttons rate it gives you a lot of like
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:16,767	| IOT125 |	Assistant mousing over but pushing over whatever
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,559	| IOT125 |	When you're talking about interfaces
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:19,839	| IOT125 |	Devices that don't have
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,607	| IOT125 |	Screens
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,399	| IOT125 |	Voices obviously win
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,935	| IOT125 |	What else is there
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:25,471	| IOT125 |	I'm to get seems like haptic feedback
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:26,751	| IOT125 |	Car
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:27,263	| IOT125 |	I don't know
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:29,823	| IOT125 |	Does haptic feedback there's lights
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:32,639	| IOT125 |	So anything visual is always bigger eyes are fantastic
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:34,431	| IOT125 |	Sense8 sensory objects
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:39,807	| IOT125 |	This voice that comes into play like your Alexa is it in and all the products that are coming out around boys
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:40,575	| IOT125 |	Control
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:44,671	| IOT125 |	That's a huge question and one that's going to be big because it's the one of the most natural things
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:45,439	| IOT125 |	You don't actually
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:46,207	| IOT125 |	If you have to learn how to read
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,487	| IOT125 |	Right
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:48,767	| IOT125 |	You don't have to learn how to
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:49,535	| IOT125 |	Speak it just
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:51,327	| IOT125 |	Gym Kids
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:52,607	| IOT125 |	You seeing this as an adult
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:58,495	| IOT125 |	But I think that's one of the big things going for is anything that you can talk to you probably will be able to talk to
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:00,031	| IOT125 |	I just came back from
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:02,847	| IOT125 |	You know I'm partner meetings and it was a big push around
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:07,455	| IOT125 |	Fencing again it's more about figuring out who you are and
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,503	| IOT125 |	Maybe how you're responding to
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:12,831	| IOT125 |	Environment or two what's going on then examples of company that
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:14,623	| IOT125 |	Was trying to
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,903	| IOT125 |	Or actually has
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:17,439	| IOT125 |	It'll mean a lot of Technology on EKG
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:19,999	| IOT125 |	To not only identify you
EDL	00:45:19,999	00:45:21,535	| IOT125 |	As a person uniquely
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,815	| IOT125 |	But if you're stressed
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:23,839	| IOT125 |	If you're dehydrated
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:24,607	| IOT125 |	If your
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:28,447	| IOT125 |	Hungry all of the other trying to figure out it interesting ways to actually do this
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:29,215	| IOT125 |	And so
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:30,751	| IOT125 |	If you want to think about that
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:36,127	| IOT125 |	Enter the human machine interface you can it bathe they were selling this as being able to identify
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,407	| IOT125 |	People on a factory floor
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:39,455	| IOT125 |	And I like that scary that's 19
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:40,479	| IOT125 |	84 territory for me
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:43,295	| IOT125 |	Okay so you brought up business model
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:45,087	| IOT125 |	Let's talk about that beat
EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:45,855	| IOT125 |	Because I spend
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:52,767	| IOT125 |	Just a crazy amount of time thinking about how we're going to make this a hardware
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:54,815	| IOT125 |	More money from
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,607	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:59,935	| IOT125 |	What is the future look like to you what are you what future are you building
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:01,983	| IOT125 |	The question of businessman
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:05,823	| IOT125 |	I guess the idea for me is that
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,615	| IOT125 |	All products should be able to be
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,127	| IOT125 |	Be connected to the in
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:10,431	| IOT125 |	Scary
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:12,479	| IOT125 |	I certainly is for me
EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:13,759	| IOT125 |	Intellij idea
EDL	00:46:13,759	00:46:14,527	| IOT125 |	Is powerful though
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:15,551	| IOT125 |	And
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,343	| IOT125 |	The way that people built products
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,647	| IOT125 |	The way they roll them out over time
EDL	00:46:19,647	00:46:22,719	| IOT125 |	And the way that what you expect out of them all fundamentally
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,487	| IOT125 |	Change
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:24,767	| IOT125 |	So if you can get with Kinect
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,303	| IOT125 |	The internet or some service
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,327	| IOT125 |	Think about it that way
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:28,607	| IOT125 |	Is
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,375	| IOT125 |	Pretty dramatic
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:31,935	| IOT125 |	But I think it hasn't really been done before
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:34,239	| IOT125 |	Other than for cellular technology
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,263	| IOT125 |	+ 4
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,287	| IOT125 |	Set top boxes
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:37,567	| IOT125 |	In a few of these other application
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:38,847	| IOT125 |	Transport for the consumer site
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:40,127	| IOT125 |	But it's
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:42,943	| IOT125 |	Edit you sweet on proprietary wise brother application
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,455	| IOT125 |	Smart metering
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:44,991	| IOT125 |	That is a great example
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:49,087	| IOT125 |	The internet but they are connected to some service
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:51,391	| IOT125 |	You're certainly being transacted on how much energy you use
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,415	| IOT125 |	We use at all times
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:54,463	| IOT125 |	So this idea is that
EDL	00:46:54,463	00:46:56,255	| IOT125 |	This is kind of my fear of
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:47:00,351	| IOT125 |	Oh my God everything is going to become a subscription so I will subscribe to
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:03,423	| IOT125 |	Turn on my door locks are my car or
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:06,751	| IOT125 |	You name it I'm going to subscribe to these connect two things
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,799	| IOT125 |	Which is kind of cool in some ways
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:10,591	| IOT125 |	What do you need to make that a reality
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:11,871	| IOT125 |	On your end
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:15,199	| IOT125 |	What do we need to make a reality in technology standpoint is
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:16,479	| IOT125 |	It's actually not that
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:20,063	| IOT125 |	You need consistent data connectivity to that device
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,087	| IOT125 |	And you need to do it securely
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:22,879	| IOT125 |	Most of the other stuff starting place
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:27,231	| IOT125 |	Actually so people can buy chips that are pretty cheap to go build a door lock
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,023	| IOT125 |	It's not the hardest thing
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:33,631	| IOT125 |	But getting data in and out securely and reliably is a big problem that people are trying to solve right now
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:36,959	| IOT125 |	But I think that's not the hardest for the hardest part here as in technology
EDL	00:47:37,471	00:47:39,775	| IOT125 |	It's about convincing people to shift over
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:43,103	| IOT125 |	There's a certain generation gap is a certain fear adapters a certain
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:47,455	| IOT125 |	Y'all got going a lot of places where people just won't rent a device as a service
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:49,759	| IOT125 |	Eustasis so compelling I'll just do it
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:54,623	| IOT125 |	And there's not a whole lot of those right now so I think there's Marcus going to take a little while to adopt it
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| IOT125 |	Consumer side
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,439	| IOT125 |	Onyx flip
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:59,999	| IOT125 |	Of that the industrial commercial space
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,279	| IOT125 |	This is normal
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:08,703	| IOT125 |	You know you have service contracts left and right in an in a retail environment in a in a in a business environment in a factory
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:13,055	| IOT125 |	You already have services for security near have services for a hundred other things
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:15,359	| IOT125 |	This is being adopted a lot faster
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:18,943	| IOT125 |	Actually in the in the commercial and Industrial side that's the focus
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:22,015	| IOT125 |	That kind of a building for our products and those
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,551	| IOT125 |	Same specs
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:25,599	| IOT125 |	Meet the consumer need
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,367	| IOT125 |	At the same time
EDL	00:48:26,879	00:48:28,671	| IOT125 |	So it's mostly securities
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:31,231	| IOT125 |	Industrial side
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:36,351	| IOT125 |	Yeah there's a lot there secure boot authentication certification Key storage generation
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:41,215	| IOT125 |	Acceleration all these kind of things
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:44,031	| IOT125 |	Go to the kind things were building into our chips and in
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:44,799	| IOT125 |	The whole industry
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,079	| IOT125 |	Actually is racing towards
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,615	| IOT125 |	To do this right now this is not just me
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:48,639	| IOT125 |	So as a
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:51,199	| IOT125 |	Average person running around out there going
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:53,247	| IOT125 |	Why do we need all this
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:55,295	| IOT125 |	What's the worst case scenario if you
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:56,831	| IOT125 |	You don't have this and you have soups
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:57,343	| IOT125 |	Scription baserva
EDL	00:48:58,111	00:49:01,695	| IOT125 |	I think it just won't scale it won't take off in the volumes whenever materialized
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:04,255	| IOT125 |	The flywheel Easthampton
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:05,279	| IOT125 |	Think about it that way
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,303	| IOT125 |	I think that
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:08,351	| IOT125 |	It only takes a few hacks really takes a few
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:10,911	| IOT125 |	You know family members telling you no way don't go do that thing
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:12,447	| IOT125 |	And then you wouldn't do it
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:15,263	| IOT125 |	That's not out of the realm of happening I think that
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:20,127	| IOT125 |	Working hard to make sure that doesn't happen but that iote's happening in fits and starts along the way
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:22,687	| IOT125 |	I think in the end that the real use cases are
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:24,735	| IOT125 |	Pretty compelling out there and
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:27,039	| IOT125 |	DIYs too big to ignore so it's just
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:29,087	| IOT125 |	It's not a matter of of S but when
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:34,719	| IOT125 |	It's just going to be how how long does it take to get to security angle worked out and it's not just about songs
EDL	00:49:34,719	00:49:37,023	| IOT125 |	Security and that's an enabler for everything else
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:38,815	| IOT125 |	Really it's not about
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:41,887	| IOT125 |	Making the most secure devices like without a secure device nothing else
EDL	00:49:41,887	00:49:42,911	| IOT125 |	Is really going to scale
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:48,287	| IOT125 |	Okay well let's go to the biggest I don't know if this is the biggest elephant but it does feel like a
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:48,799	| IOT125 |	Huge elephant
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,847	| IOT125 |	Which is data models
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:56,735	| IOT125 |	She talked to me about what you mean by data bottles cuz people throw around that phrase a lot meeting a bunch of different thing
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:59,039	| IOT125 |	Serenity by data models is
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:00,063	| IOT125 |	Is the code running on device
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:01,343	| IOT125 |	That device
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:02,623	| IOT125 |	And if you don't have
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:04,415	| IOT125 |	Consistent data models to just stop going to work
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:09,023	| IOT125 |	You know I could take lighting for example and you install 20 or 10 light bulbs and
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:12,607	| IOT125 |	Can you start replacing them over the years 3 4 5 years down the line
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:14,143	| IOT125 |	They all need to work together
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:14,911	| IOT125 |	All the time
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:16,703	| IOT125 |	On off dim color
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:18,495	| IOT125 |	Control if you need that there is it has to be
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:19,263	| IOT125 |	Process
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:20,287	| IOT125 |	The same way
EDL	00:50:20,287	00:50:21,823	| IOT125 |	So that that apis
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:23,359	| IOT125 |	If you think about it that way or the
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:25,151	| IOT125 |	The definition of that light bulb
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:25,919	| IOT125 |	In soccer have to be
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:28,223	| IOT125 |	And if you're relying on
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:30,271	| IOT125 |	Fifty or a hundred proprietary
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:32,575	| IOT125 |	Implementations of what that looks like it just won't scale
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:33,855	| IOT125 |	It's not going to go back up
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:36,671	| IOT125 |	So that will be a standardization
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:37,951	| IOT125 |	There's a half a dozen of these
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:38,975	| IOT125 |	Things that are in play right now
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:41,535	| IOT125 |	And she's going to be there any two or three in the end
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:44,095	| IOT125 |	So this is a big philosophical
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:45,119	| IOT125 |	Question
EDL	00:50:45,119	00:50:48,703	| IOT125 |	I remember in the early days of the week
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:49,471	| IOT125 |	For the wind
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:56,895	| IOT125 |	The open web is dead everything's an app in
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:51:02,783	| IOT125 |	Even things like amp services like that it killed it so it feels like every business has looked at that and said
EDL	00:51:02,783	00:51:05,343	| IOT125 |	Hey you know what we can handle proprietary
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:07,391	| IOT125 |	We can try to push people
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:08,671	| IOT125 |	To buy all
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:11,743	| IOT125 |	Philips hue light bulbs are all Cree light bulbs
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:15,839	| IOT125 |	I know there are standards trying to make this work but it feels like
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:22,239	| IOT125 |	The industry is not interested in listening to what is probably good for consumers or businesses
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:25,823	| IOT125 |	They might be beating themselves against this light app to find
EDL	00:51:25,823	00:51:26,591	| IOT125 |	For years to come
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:28,383	| IOT125 |	I think that
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:30,175	| IOT125 |	Part of the reason of doing that right now is
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:30,943	| IOT125 |	Because
EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:33,759	| IOT125 |	They're looking for ways to differentiate and that's how they differentiate today
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:35,295	| IOT125 |	And I just don't
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:37,343	| IOT125 |	Think that's how they're going to differentiate
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:39,135	| IOT125 |	I don't have a
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:44,767	| IOT125 |	A more concrete answer than that but I do know all these companies are looking for different ways to differentiate
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:46,047	| IOT125 |	Because they see
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:48,351	| IOT125 |	The Legacy stop being commoditized
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:48,863	| IOT125 |	Pretty rapidly
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:50,143	| IOT125 |	So
EDL	00:51:50,655	00:51:51,935	| IOT125 |	Having a connected device
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:52,703	| IOT125 |	Enable fat
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:57,055	| IOT125 |	You know I think that defining what a light bulb looks like an software isn't Phillips
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:57,823	| IOT125 |	Just trying to do
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:51:59,359	| IOT125 |	I think they're trying to do
EDL	00:51:59,359	00:52:00,895	| IOT125 |	And I'm using that as an example
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:02,175	| IOT125 |	You brought up the hill
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:04,479	| IOT125 |	In which is in one that everybody knows and
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:06,015	| IOT125 |	You know they're looking for other ways
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:09,343	| IOT125 |	Differentiate whether it's working with different ecosystems are out there for the
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:10,111	| IOT125 |	Control elements
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:13,951	| IOT125 |	How you turn light bulb on and off and software isn't so important
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,999	| IOT125 |	To them it's not where they differentiate their products
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:20,351	| IOT125 |	Those are the kind of companies and whether it's lighting or or anything else in the home
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:23,679	| IOT125 |	They're going to look for different ways to differentiate in the future that they don't have to do
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:24,703	| IOT125 |	Today we made
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:27,007	| IOT125 |	Really want their proprietary way of doing it
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:32,639	| IOT125 |	To be standardized that's still yet to play out but I think that they're going to look for other ways to differentiate the future
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:34,431	| IOT125 |	And do you guys have
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:40,831	| IOT125 |	I guess a dog in that hunt in the standardization effort in the data model effort are you trying to push the industry one way or the other
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:43,135	| IOT125 |	Different models are you just like please guys settlement
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:44,671	| IOT125 |	Yes
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:46,207	| IOT125 |	We are actually
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:51,071	| IOT125 |	So there's kind of three entry points into the iot from a technology perspective
EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:53,887	| IOT125 |	There's the datacentre the Gateway and the edge device
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:55,167	| IOT125 |	And
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:57,727	| IOT125 |	Depending on where you start you'll try to drive
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:03,103	| IOT125 |	Decisions that actually impact all the others without realizing it or maybe you're doing it on purpose
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:06,687	| IOT125 |	It's a data models that are birth out of organizations that starting
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:07,455	| IOT125 |	The cloud
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:09,503	| IOT125 |	Practical to implement for
EDL	00:53:09,503	00:53:11,039	| IOT125 |	Certain cost energy
EDL	00:53:11,039	00:53:14,111	| IOT125 |	Complexity budget at the edge starting the gateways
EDL	00:53:14,623	00:53:19,487	| IOT125 |	Usually Implement security requirements on National devices that just don't work you can't implement
EDL	00:53:19,487	00:53:21,023	| IOT125 |	Certain kind of security at a
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:24,863	| IOT125 |	There's a lot of I keep saying that the cost word because that's what the price
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:28,447	| IOT125 |	Optical element throwing the stuff out so we push Verde tomatoes that are light
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:30,495	| IOT125 |	It has appropriate amounts
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:31,775	| IOT125 |	Security and Trust
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:35,871	| IOT125 |	Put on the IRT and so let you know I don't just want to go into all the ones that still come out to
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:37,919	| IOT125 |	Pushing through the standards bodies right now
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:38,943	| IOT125 |	But we're
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:39,711	| IOT125 |	In general
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:40,735	| IOT125 |	Shooting for lightweight
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:44,575	| IOT125 |	Models that Define only what they need to define a nothing more
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:48,415	| IOT125 |	And then have security elements built in at the chip level
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:49,951	| IOT125 |	And yeah
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:50,463	| IOT125 |	Okay
EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:53,023	| IOT125 |	Security requirements
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:54,559	| IOT125 |	Encryption
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:56,607	| IOT125 |	4 key storage generation 4
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:58,655	| IOT125 |	Boots certifying firmware images
EDL	00:54:01,727	00:54:02,495	| IOT125 |	Already
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:06,847	| IOT125 |	Mostly. And then it becomes how do you put all this together to Define what a product looks like
EDL	00:54:06,847	00:54:07,615	| IOT125 |	Software
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:14,015	| IOT125 |	Oh my gosh why can't wait to talk to you in like three maybe four years to see if we've actually done this
EDL	00:54:14,015	00:54:15,295	| IOT125 |	Because my hopes are not high
EDL	00:54:16,575	00:54:18,879	| IOT125 |	We'll see I think that you're going to see
EDL	00:54:18,879	00:54:19,903	| IOT125 |	No not one
EDL	00:54:19,903	00:54:20,415	| IOT125 |	I think there will be more
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:23,999	| IOT125 |	All right will Daniel thank you so much for
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:26,303	| IOT125 |	Thank you for having me
EDL	00:54:27,327	00:54:33,727	| IOT125 |	That's it for this week show thank you so much for listening and if you want more.
EDL	00:54:33,727	00:54:37,311	| IOT125 |	Tnews you can sign up for my newsletter Stacy knows things at
EDL	00:54:37,311	00:54:43,455	| IOT125 |	Stacey on iot cam will see you next week
