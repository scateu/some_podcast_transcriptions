Renee

52
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
It's my pleasure to have you in the studio today

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Thank you Ivan pleasure to be here

54
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,832
Let's start with how you got interested in science and

55
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,440
What was was there a teacher that transformed you that turns you on to side

56
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744
Did you come from a scientific household

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
What was

58
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
This hurts me to think of a time when I didn't have science in mind even from a very young age so growing up in in Florida we always had

59
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Access to a little critters on the beach or in little creeks in our backyard that we would play with and my sister of who

60
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
Her name is Lisa she's 11 years older than me and she

61
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Had a career

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
That was really on a trajectory to be a scientist until later in life she switched to be a lawyer but in there

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,928
Early days I got to go to lab with her and kind of see what that world look

64
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
Call me really interested in so from a very early age

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,656
In high school I was a lab assistant to one of the teachers were I helped him and bomb

66
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Some of the animals that we would dissect in classes I think I was very lucky through Elementary School and High School

67
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
School and then going into college and Beyond I always had Opera

68
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
Opportunities to be really Hands-On with the scientist to

69
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Understand

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
What types of science I really liked him and what I didn't like and

71
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
I remember in

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
High School

73
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,208
One of our teachers would take us to a local

74
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
It was I think was a limestone mine and in Florida where they would

75
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
Pump out dirt and rocks from really deep into the Earth and there's many fossils Mastodon teeth and things

76
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,544
Like I said that you could find that really had an impression on me because that's where

77
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
I first started to learn about Evolution and

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
And then all through school I I did take the opportunity

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
Student work in the laboratory as an undergraduate

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,576
Adored attacking that's why I came back to do a PCV

81
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Because I already had

82
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
That you're a half under

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
Justin for listening to it never seen a mastodon

84
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Actually have I mean they're like the size of

85
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Eraser

86
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Amazing things to see

87
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Obviously I was catalytic

88
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,448
And when I look at you or your

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Degrees

90
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Both of them

91
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
Are an Applied Biology which is to say your bachelors

92
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Rihanna Dior

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Your PhD

94
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,736
On the way but both and Applied Biology which tells me that from a very early age you were looking at

95
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Biology as

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Technology

97
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
So how did that early inside

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
I come to you

99
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
His estimated to think about it I hadn't thought about it that way but it but I did always see biology

100
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Piazza is a tool

101
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
And I told understanding the world around us and later than in the University it's a tool to understand disease

102
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:31,615
And then the integrated actually even with it person moving into the medical-device world at Georgia Tech I was

103
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
In one of the early classes

104
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
That

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
Was working with vial engineers

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,807
They're just watching a a bioengineering program at Georgia Tech

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
So it was really interesting for me to interact with

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,183
Did the engineers who would actually builds a device

109
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Based.on sings like

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
Cellular mechanics and fluid

111
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
Jackson and that was pretty mind-boggling

112
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
You take that

113
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
It actually turn it

114
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Intuit device

115
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
10 proof

116
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
So for some years you worked as a contractor are you with booze

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Hamilton

118
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
That's a company that's a lot of work

119
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
I would government agencies in

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Ludendorff

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,503
Is that actually how you got to know DARPA

122
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
No actually I got to know DARPA

123
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,415
When I was working in the Biotech Industry appear in Rockville Maryland

124
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:23,071
And the CEO of a small company I worked at call Dad life this is where we were developing Diagnostics

125
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
Corner dinner tip diseases based on protein misfolding and indicators

126
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Of disease and

127
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,079
The CEO of that company Alan Rudolph used to be a DARPA program manager and I had not heard about DARPA

128
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,687
I'm before meeting Alan so sometimes over lunch or just casually he would talk about this magical

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Call DARPA wear

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,599
It really seemed that you can have a a wild idea and as long as you had a great Technica

131
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
I plan to make it happen

132
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
There could be a password to try to implement that in the more I learned about DARPA

133
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
The more I really

134
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Got interested in

135
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,399
And when I was looking for the next step in my career

136
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Alan knowing me well

137
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
I just asked you to what what do you think

138
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
Could be something that would be good for me I like the taste

139
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,431
Survey of the startup environment but job security it would be a little bit better

140
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,551
Longer-term job security would be adventurous and so he suggested

141
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
Data that I look into a different types of Contracting

142
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
He's around

143
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
The DC area

144
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
2 support agencies like DARPA

145
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
Buslers multiple archetype

146
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,119
I see is an end luckily I just found a great

147
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Position

148
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Booz Allen in

149
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
And stay with them for quite a few years

150
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,287
As a Sida not only at DARPA but other other

151
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
Places like ir-pi the intelligences

152
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Advanced research projects activity

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,759
And the bill Melinda Gates Foundation is while I help them with some of the early Grand challenges

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
Right and you use a little government speak in there zika

155
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Scientific

156
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Engineering

157
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Technical

158
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Advisor

159
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
That's actually word we hear a lot around here there are more citas here than there are program at

160
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
You are now a pro

161
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
So you've actually warned both

162
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,335
And I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about

163
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,943
Those two categories of employees here the Sita and the program

164
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
As you just mentioned there there are

165
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,671
Two categories of employees here there's that the government employee which is the program manager and in other supporting staff and

166
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Anicetus

167
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
And the way I like to describe that model 2

168
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
Two folks in biology especially their familiar with having a pi in the lab and then people that work with them to assist

169
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
Principal investigator

170
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,591
In a laboratory and they have a supporting staff of

171
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
They could be grad students they could be

172
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,711
Staff scientist II to help them Implement division

173
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
That pi and really

174
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,391
DARPA to me at the program manager and Cedar Villas is very much along those lines a program manager is responsible

175
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,743
Buffer for the vision of the program and and the direction forward in the strategy

176
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Inesita team

177
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
There's various roles as they can provide technical content

178
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
That's complementary to the program manager they may have to

179
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Strategic guidance

180
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,031
Are they may have deep darpet experience because oftentimes Atascocita

181
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,127
Maybe here for it for many years longer than than a program manager

182
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Of course we're here for

183
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Term appointment

184
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
What's nicer get into your dark life

185
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
A little bit

186
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
In 2016 who became a program manager

187
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
At that time you inherited

188
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
One program called

189
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Living

190
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Foundry

191
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Please which is about

192
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Engineering

193
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,119
The Exquisite control that living cells have over to atoms and molecules but in an inescapable

194
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Technological lens

195
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Materials

196
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Industrial chemicals Pharmaceuticals in

197
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Agricultural products

198
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
And then you did Elsa program

199
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Cold safe jeans would you rather

200
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Get through the very difficult wedding

201
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
And approval process Europe

202
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
And this is all about it

203
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:57,087
Developing a tool kit to rain in limit and even reverse some of the

204
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Emerging extremely power

205
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Powerful

206
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Tools in

207
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Genetics and genomics and molecular

208
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Herbology

209
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
I want you to talk about those but

210
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Before we do

211
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
I just want to hear a little bit about how you

212
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Think about

213
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Biology

214
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,239
Because as we look at some of these tools and we'll talk about

215
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Last night

216
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
To me they're sort of miraculous

217
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Little nanoscale

218
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Machine that it makes me

219
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Uniserv look

220
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Get life in a

221
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
With a kind of reverence and awe

222
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
I don't mean to lead you that's not nice of me

223
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
Talk to me about how you view

224
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Biology on these sort of Malay

225
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Skeleton

226
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
And even higher

227
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,071
The way I think about biology is really from it of an applied

228
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Approaching and that

229
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Has a lot to do with I think

230
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
I'm having been

231
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Brought up scientifically

232
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Georgia Tech

233
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Always

234
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,335
Emerson Donnelly biology but surrounded with engineering

235
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
When I look into biological

236
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
This time I think about how that system could be manipulated in a programmable way of looking at some of the tools that synthetic bile

237
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Allergy bring saucer or genome editing like

238
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Crisper cast 9 witches

239
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
Christopher is one of the biggest acronym so used today stands for a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic

240
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:14,655
What does protein does it's it's really interesting it at the origins are it was a bacterial immune

241
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Effectively wear

242
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,591
Feed virus would insert his DNA into a bacteria that. Bacteria would would cut up that DNA

243
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Using crispr

244
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Caste system

245
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,503
And take little pieces of that phage DNA and put it into its own genome as a memory

246
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Of that

247
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
Infection so that if that

248
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Again to infect that cell

249
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,463
I would say oh hey I have this information that I've seen this before I can now

250
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,351
Sew-Vac in 2012 what researcher is Jennifer doudna and others

251
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Recognize where

252
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
He could actually program

253
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
What

254
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Cast nine

255
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
Recognizes it doesn't have to be a phase but you can provide it within

256
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
Information to say okay

257
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Go after the specific

258
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
Piece of DNA and that was very

259
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
Powerful I like what I like to think of from the darker perspective as a Sputnik moment and biology so we had a lot

260
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Innovation in DNA

261
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
Sequencing and synthesis you could look over the decades that we

262
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
We kept improving that technology is very powerful now

263
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
But all of a sudden we had a toilet

264
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
How to be able to edit

265
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
That DNA

266
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
And that's that's really has changed a lot in the field now there's

267
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
There's very few organisms at

268
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
I can't be edited

269
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,079
I love the Sputnik moment partly because when you look at some phages

270
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
When one is named T4 they look like little spacecraft

271
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,855
That's right yeah there's even microsatellites in DNA sometimes

272
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,743
But for me that's what created an urgency for this new tool in biology that that I say

273
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
I think makes it national

274
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
So let's let's talk about the two program

275
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
We'll start with the one that you inherited

276
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
Living Founders tell me little bit

277
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
About the history of that and it's

278
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,591
Sure so that original program manager who launched that effort Alicia Jackson

279
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,455
She had this Vision to start to create a tool bed where we could

280
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Distill biology to an engineering

281
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Where you could

282
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Take something like the design

283
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Build

284
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,743
Test learn cycle of engineering and apply that to a biological system like a microbe

285
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
And E coli or a yeast or other types

286
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Bacteria to make products in Mali

287
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Would be of value

288
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
And

289
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Really

290
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,311
Things that her inspiration came from looking at biology as

291
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
This incredible system that

292
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
I can make a real diversity of molecules that

293
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Extends well beyond what we can make

294
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
Through traditional manufacturer

295
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
So when you have access to that diversity of biology

296
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Can you start to manipulate that to make new

297
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
Molecules things that have never been made

298
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Buy biology

299
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
The most

300
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Ambition School

301
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
The program

302
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Silver foundational Investments really

303
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,959
Created the tools under each one of those

304
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
Categories of design tools that you

305
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
You can quickly in an automated way

306
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Design a biosynthetic

307
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
Pathway to stitch jeans together to put into a microbe

308
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
Build services that the DNA synthesis and

309
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,551
Insertion of DNA into a living system

310
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Testing this

311
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,927
The mass spectrometry and other measurement tools to look

312
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
If a product has been made and importantly

313
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
Learning so this is

314
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,399
Some of the designs you make or not going to work and programming that into your learning cycle to not use that design

315
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
How to make a better design

316
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Important

317
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,567
So when I took over the program The Living foundries 1000 molecules

318
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
Program was just taking

319
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
King of the first phase of the program was to build those individual components and tools and now the second phase is to really integrate them

320
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
As a platform

321
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
To create this boundary type capability that

322
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,999
U.s. military or a customer a business customer could go to a Foundry and say I would like

323
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
You to make this molecule

324
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
The pathway and the organ

325
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
So

326
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,495
The ultimate demonstration of that capability that Foundry capability is to make

327
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
And we're 551 molecules

328
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,919
And so our teams which are Amherst Simonton and MIT

329
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
T-bird Institute they've saved

330
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Collectively made five

331
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
Can you just give listeners a sense of the

332
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
The kinds of Molly the kinds of molecules so they're very diverse they can be anything from adhesive to Coatings to

333
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,583
Paige might want to put on the outside of an aircraft all the way to a small molecule

334
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Kohl's that that could be used

335
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,959
For the medicines countermeasures cancel

336
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
You name it the whole gamut of

337
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
Set of small molecules are

338
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Being developed

339
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Under that program

340
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
Now we're about two years into 4 year program

341
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,319
The final two years is going to prioritize a small subset of those molecules that have been produced

342
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
They're very compelling that we'd like to scale-up so so far we've made

343
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Pretty much detectable amounts meaning

344
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
You're very small amounts of each one of those molecules and we'd like to move to the kilogram level so that these are not

345
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,423
Taxable amount that we can really Implement in enlarger

346
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Absol exciting area me when you just

347
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
We think about biology

348
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
I think of things

349
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,455
Sequoia Forest you know in Amazon forest diversity of

350
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
Of creatures in an all of the tissues that

351
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,063
They're made of all the materials they are made of

352
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
Hormones and neurotransmitters

353
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
There's all of these these powerful

354
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Names of substances

355
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
Come out of biology

356
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
And now here bringing a different mindset

357
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
That seem kind of

358
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Contacts

359
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Of synthesis

360
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
Really kind of exciting

361
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
I think it's a great point that you mentioned that that biological diversity across the globe because what many of the teams are doing art

362
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Are looking at

363
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,895
Extreme environments across the globe looking at microbes looking at plants

364
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,015
Even looking at some some human enzymes and you can stitch those together a plant enzyme human enzyme

365
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,159
Extremophiles microbe enzyme all together in a in a Workhorse organism in the laboratory tutu

366
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
That's so it is

367
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,255
This program is very much dependent on biological

368
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
University and looking at the enzymes that that can be detected

369
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
In the wild

370
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
Doing their normal jobs that they do in the wild that we

371
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
Laboratory so you're also leveraging

372
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
The way Evolution has pushed biology to be Innovative in its biological context sort of seeing where you might find used

373
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Things are but then

374
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Further with human

375
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Absolutely

376
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
So then let's go to

377
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Safe

378
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,879
This is this was your first baby here right so

379
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Talk to us about

380
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
About that

381
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
The origin of it in your mind and

382
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
What the status of that

383
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Program is now

384
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
16 is a program that that's the part of my came to DARPA

385
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
To run in fur

386
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,519
The listeners that they don't know the way that program is stood up at DARPA is it it's

387
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
If it's very grass

388
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,663
After each type of process where it comes from the program manager and an initial idea or concept

389
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
That we can bring to our leadership

390
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Been to the director of DARPA that gets

391
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
You into a pro

392
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
So I came to darker with the idea

393
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
2

394
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,231
Really try to harness the beneficent use of genome editing

395
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Technologies like Chris

396
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
Best nine but to prevent

397
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Their potential for Miss

398
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
So at this point these

399
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Stools have

400
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Really been democratized

401
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
It's arguable that probably every molecular biology lab in the world has access to these tools and it's using these tools

402
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
So the Genie's out of the bottle it's out there

403
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
And there's a lot of power in these tools for for editing genomes and we can do a lot of relate

404
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:33,695
Tremendous good with these tools but their potential for misuse both nefarious and accidental

405
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Is a real

406
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
That vulnerability that

407
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
I came to

408
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,839
The agency to try to address simile

409
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,471
The ability to control editing activity if you want to use it in a given system to limit it only for you so much

410
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
System

411
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
The counter

412
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
At the

413
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
Start of the safety program there was no countermeasure available meaning no inhibitor of a genome editor that can shut down if it's activity

414
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
Is it should accidentally be misused or or in a more malicious

415
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,391
And then finally if it changes made how come you restore a DM back to its base

416
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Find state to remediate then

417
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
Yeah it's it's a remarkable set of tools

418
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
One of them

419
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
I heard you talk

420
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Reminds me of

421
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Telomere

422
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,799
Ticks off how many times a cell has replicated and there's only so many times that a cell can do that

423
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,127
Before it dies off it sounds to me like you're something like that

424
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
That you

425
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
You are your performers and by that I mean the research

426
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
Have contracts under the safe genes program

427
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
They might be working on some similar mechanism

428
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
Limit

429
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Hey

430
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Genetically

431
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Edited cell

432
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
And it's

433
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
How long you can be out there

434
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:45,375
That would definitely be under the category of a controller that that we're developing our we do have some generation

435
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Encounters

436
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
The one thing that I haven't mentioned is the

437
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
If there's derivative tools that are made from GM editors

438
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
Called Dean drives and this is one of the most power

439
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Uses of these

440
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Is because

441
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
What Dean drives do is they ultimately biased the outcome

442
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Inheritance

443
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Where

444
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
When Mom and Dad gets

445
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Together you normally have a 50

446
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,439
50 chance of of a gene in an offspring coming from Mom or Dad

447
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
But through a gene drive when you

448
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Couple a gene or trait

449
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
With a genome editor

450
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
That can force its inheritance to near 100

451
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Until when you can buy us the outcome

452
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Two levels that are about

453
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Reach up to 100%

454
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
You want to be able to have a way to

455
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
To control that if you don't want

456
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Straight to go

457
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
So one way you can do that is to

458
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
But if you want to keep

459
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,367
Something like a gene Drive local you may say okay after

460
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
After five generations and reproductive

461
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Despite Cycles this

462
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Can shut down

463
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
And so these are some of the Techno

464
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
Write so clearly you you are

465
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
Stick in an area of

466
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Powerful by Allah

467
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,983
Some of those who

468
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,567
Forbidden from the beginning of I'm thinking here of Jennifer doudna

469
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
Who has been in on this from the beginning it's so she's written a book that I read recently and when you read

470
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
That she is both utopian

471
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
In

472
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Thinking about

473
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
The power of

474
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
Tools like crispr cast 9 in

475
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
Touring all kinds of diseases and doing all kinds of

476
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Good things but she also

477
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
What is inside some

478
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Points in the book sort of dystopia

479
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,263
You are in the middle of this is when you go go out to conferences the promise and the Peril of these Technologies are always part of that discussion

480
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,359
How are you thinking about that as someone who is in a position now to

481
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
Direct to some degree

482
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
How this research

483
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Ghost

484
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
So somebody is once described me as

485
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,135
Surprisingly upbeat for someone working on Gene editing and National Security

486
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
But I'm really excited about that the promise

487
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:51,071
Of these tools not only for addressing an inherited genetic disorders but

488
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
The potential for use of the

489
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
These tools to eliminate infectious disease in a way that's Superior to our current countermeasures that we use

490
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
I look forward to the opportunity

491
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
I think there's a lot

492
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
To be sad for for biodiversity as well

493
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
In terms of

494
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
A tool like a gene Drive is going to have to

495
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
The face

496
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,903
Natural biodiversity of perfect Dean drive would only work in the system where

497
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
An organism's genome is identical

498
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
All the way across

499
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Send in any

500
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
Some so I think

501
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Reality

502
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Some of the

503
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Piece of these tools is

504
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
Is actually going to be.

505
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,800
Challenging to achieve in as long as we're addressing those risks that while we developed the beneficent used

506
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Horse forward

507
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
When you think about the work

508
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
That you are doing

509
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Now in the

510
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Biological

511
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
In darpa's Institution

512
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
What do you say about darpa's

513
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
Place in the overall kind of innovation

514
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Ecosystem

515
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Because you work in a number of parts of that

516
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Ecosystems

517
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
So I think you might have been

518
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:58,656
Having been at DARPA now in some capacity for about eight years I I can

519
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,728
Absolutely say DARPA is it is Leading Edge and

520
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,848
It's a place where you learn about new technologies new ideas we we have

521
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
From industry from Academia Reach Out

522
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Time with Swiss

523
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
Concept so I I do feel that

524
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,880
DARPA is a special place where we have Early Access to these Technologies are at least information about

525
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
About these Technologies and

526
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Really responsibility to

527
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,768
Look at that diamond and understand you know how could these

528
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Is 4 good

529
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,680
Use for bad and then really be ready for a to address both of those in and out

530
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Appropriate way

531
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
And when you think

532
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
About tools like

533
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Forecast 9

534
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
You spoke about

535
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
This tool

536
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Within the context

537
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
The program's you working on

538
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
But when you think of

539
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Maybe

540
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Best application

541
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
The answer to that question

542
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
Probably

543
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,000
Varies depending on on who your speech

544
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
So I'll

545
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,120
Had the opportunity to be in meetings with patient

546
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
For a number of inherited genetic

547
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
The ability to create a therapeutic

548
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,872
For an adult individual who has

549
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
Suffered long-term

550
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
From a disease I think is it in

551
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
Incredibly exciting if we can do something to

552
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Can prove that ended

553
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
There

554
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,856
They're desperate for those Technologies

555
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Is and

556
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
I think yours and an opportunity for

557
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
A lot of good

558
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,280
So that's that's one of the things I'm most

559
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Excited about

560
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
And many diseases that otherwise have no.

561
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
Options at all the religious

562
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
Treating symptoms

563
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
I was trying to make peace

564
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
And the other

565
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:44,640
Is of course this is when a lot of people points to 44 Dean drive but is the ability to eliminate

566
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Factors that

567
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
That carry disease

568
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,528
Says things like malaria or Dengue or Chikungunya as we

569
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,344
Have more and more emergent diseases that that

570
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Are spread through

571
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
Actors this is beyond incredible

572
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Tool to implement to

573
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
To prevent their

574
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
Right and again now we're talkin about such powerful technology so what

575
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
CNN debate here

576
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
Has been in do we get rid of these

577
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
Mosquitoes

578
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
The vector is it actual

579
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
We carry these things

580
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,128
Which sounds on the surface to be at sounds like a solution but on the other hand

581
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,528
And I think you've talked about this yourself we are talking about very complex ecological environment and so even though we think about

582
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
That mosquitoes is essentially bad things

583
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
We don't know if we got rid of them

584
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
What would that do ecological

585
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
Right yeah and that's that's something that we have to take a very

586
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Serious clothes

587
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
Lookout because we could be opening up a new ecolodge

588
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
It's right if we

589
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
1 species of mosquito

590
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:42,752
And there are many P species of mosquito out there right so they say you can be inviting a new mask

591
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Needs to end

592
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Potentially bring in a different

593
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
Really this is a

594
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
Teachings of the short-term funding for four years there's no open released but we want to start to develop test beds for these systems

595
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,392
Understand how they behave over Generations but it but I think this

596
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
Question

597
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
Of how this might work in the environment

598
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Ecosystem

599
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
It won't be answered

600
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
So we can roll

601
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,192
What is it's interesting I often think about the history of Technology

602
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
As part of the solution becomes

603
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
The problem

604
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
I'm taking care of things like CFC chlorofluorocarbons which were a great solution to a refrigeration problem

605
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
Early last century

606
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
People are dying from The Reef

607
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
That were being used

608
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Mcfcu

609
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Come in

610
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
You're not flammable.

611
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
Toxic then and they become

612
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Wunderkind

613
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
That purpose

614
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
But then is there made in massive amounts

615
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
The same stability and makes them great goes up to the Stratosphere in stores

616
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
Why the ozone 7

617
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
Become up the great one of the great Ki Mobility

618
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
The 20th century

619
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
When you think about biological

620
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
What is in this context

621
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,616
Next episode the solution canticum the problem

622
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
What are the problems that keep you up at

623
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,552
Before you go back to the dean Drive examples it is that retina what are the long-term

624
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Applications and so

625
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
This would be a genetically modified organism

626
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Environment

627
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
And

628
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,536
We have to be sure that we

629
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Carefully consider how one might.

630
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,144
Please use these toilets not going to be a silver bullet for every

631
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
We probably shouldn't have

632
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,008
50 different types of mosquitoes species engineering

633
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Gene drives

634
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
It's going to turn into a space junk

635
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,152
Tight situation where we don't know how these individual

636
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Orgasms

637
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,248
Interacting with each other what is the long-term effect on the environment

638
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
This is

639
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,880
I don't agree I don't think that's a long-term solution in Fort for me

640
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,488
Part of the safety program end and just at the message that I like to go out there is

641
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Is 2

642
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
Do you have that long-term

643
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Thinking in place

644
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Where

645
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,448
And even in the initial designs of the experiments you know what might this look like

646
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Like in 10 years

647
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032
20 years 30 years will be on the end of a Fisher

648
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
DARPA program

649
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,872
So we can build in some of those safety

650
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Switches

651
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Early on at the Inception

652
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Technology

653
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,528
It's heartening to me to know that you were the program manager

654
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,368
Are thinking about both those pros and cons the promise and the Peril of these

655
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Powerful Tech

656
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Technologies

657
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
It's going to be exciting to see

658
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,280
Where you take from your existing programs in and maybe some other ones

659
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
Janiyah in the near future

660
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Renee is there a

661
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Question that you

662
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,240
Wish I had asked her you wish some of your other interviewers from other

663
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,080
Interviews in the past had asked you that I haven't

664
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
So

665
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
You can ask it any vinance

666
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
One of the questions I I

667
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,600
People do ask me if I want to put a plug here for that item,

668
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,696
Answer this is an international genetically engineered machines competition

669
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
This is

670
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
A place

671
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
Where a lot of

672
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:51,424
Researchers and individuals amateurs interested in synthetic biology get there

673
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,544
This is a pretty low threshold way to get into

674
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
Competition setting to say

675
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
What's something cool you can do with

676
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
With engineering biology

677
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
In the organizers of this competition

678
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Have

679
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Always first and foremost

680
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Biosafety and biosecurity

681
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
As part of the

682
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,256
Deprogrammed each of the teams has young students is undergraduate sometimes even Heights

683
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Didn't have to

684
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
Address

685
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,424
Safety and Security in all of their designs and it wouldn't that be a great thing for every

686
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
Lab to be able to do

687
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,056
One of the things I've noticed since being a program manager is that

688
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
People are often blind to the potential

689
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
Use of Their Own

690
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,248
It takes somebody from the outside to be able to look in

691
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
And

692
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,160
See where where those potential vulnerabilities are not only for just the system won't work in might break

693
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,464
To wow this could actually become

694
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,584
A problem you mentioned biotechnology becoming the problem I think if we had the ability to

695
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
Really look

696
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:59,008
Objectively at each other's work and try to identify those vulnerabilities and then mitigate the risk said that that are

697
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
Are presented that would be much more excited about

698
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Forward for bios

699
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Technology

700
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:08,480
Okay well I think we're about out of time so I just want to thank you for being here

701
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
It was amazing

702
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,808
Interesting discussion for me thanks

703
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,136
Sharing these stories about how you came to science

704
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
What's motive

705
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
The program manager

706
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Thanks I'm instead of pleasure

707
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,096
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us

708
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
I hope you join us again for the next

709
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Voices
