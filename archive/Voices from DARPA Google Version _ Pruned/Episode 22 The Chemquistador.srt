00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,928
DARPA the defense Advanced research projects agency

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Has been

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
A driver of

00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
What is possible

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your daughter

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,336
Today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,152
Dr. Anne Fisher a program manager since

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
2017

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Any agencies

23
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
That's where she and her fellow program manager

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,344
PM's as they were known in house

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,416
Forage deeply into the fundamentals of chemistry

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
Free physics

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464
Optic materials

28
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
And other disciplines in search of new scientific and Engineering foundations for technologies that can matter for national

30
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
And it's making her Market.

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
But it's one of the few Chemists in the agent

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
After receiving her PhD in chemistry from Michigan State University

33
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
With a catalyst project that relied on Electra

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
Oakley conductor

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Diamond

36
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,736
She did a couple of research students at the naval research lab

37
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,040
Which is the Navy's broad-based corporate

38
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,136
She also got her feet wet in the Science and Technology policy world

39
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
As a fellow

40
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
At the American Association for the advancement of

41
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
Publisher of Science magazine

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
Then in 2009 she began with continues to be her partner

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Starship with DARPA

44
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
First as a contract scientist

45
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
And since early last year

46
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
As a dark

47
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Programmatic

48
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Enterprise

49
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,176
Inspired by her own successful journey to become a woman scientist in a male-dominated

50
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Profession

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
She created a Girl Scout chemistry Pinterest

52
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
With the goal of getting more girls interested

53
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
In the molecular wonders of the world

54
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
Dr Anne Fisher welcome to the studio

55
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
It's great to be here thank you

56
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,840
Before we talk about your sizable portfolio of DARPA programs

57
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
With names like

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,192
Make it the molecular informatics and this one

59
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,752
Spectral Combs from ultraviolet

60
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Terahertz

61
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,384
You've got to tell me how your interest in chemistry a rose

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Because you will know most people men

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Where women

64
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
Bolt with panic

65
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
The instant you say something like the periodic

66
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Table chemical

67
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Helmets

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah so so that actually goes back

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
2

70
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Elementary School

71
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Sitting down at the kitchen table in my house

72
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Growing up

73
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
And my parents bought

74
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Chemistry

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Things I don't think you could probably buy today

76
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
It wouldn't be in the store today I had literally had a rack

77
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,360
On it with all sorts of different chemicals a very dangerous chemicals that are probably don't even want to know what they were

78
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
And it had experiments

79
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,016
From an early age my my mom specifically my parents both

80
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Sort of

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
Just encouraged

82
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
This sort of

83
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,928
Exploratory experimental nature and I just watched on.

84
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:15,328
Then through High School sort of Oliver science that can really choose an end it was really solidified

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
In my undergraduate

86
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Education at the College of Wooster

87
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Wooster Ohio

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Just

89
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,776
Do you know there was something about chemistry and the way it was taught

90
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
And that department that really

91
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Just kind of

92
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Catalyzed

93
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Essentially the resting of

94
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
The Graduate

95
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Career in post

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,576
Tell me just a little bit about that dissertation project where you used to electrically conductive diamond

97
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Right

98
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,488
So the the group I was in at Michigan state was really focused on

99
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,328
Developing electrically conducting Diamond electrodes for variety of application

100
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,656
And I was in the dissection of the lab that was working on Power and energy

101
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,032
So we're actually trying to develop new and ultra-stable materials

102
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
4 fuel cells

103
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,920
That really was both a project related to my love of chemistry but with a very practical app

104
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Application

105
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
And that was in need of the early 2000 where

106
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
There was a lot of work on fuel cell development in a lot of work

107
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Conservatory

108
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Alternative Energy continues today

109
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
That was really the Genesis of their technology

110
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
Mexico relies on fuels even something like hydrogen but maybe hydrocarbons

111
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
End

112
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Mine produces from that

113
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,703
At the electricity that's right that's right and I'm one of the one of the problems at the time was

114
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,055
The stability of the electrodes and tells an electrons are what converts word of the

115
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
The fuel if you all of the hydrogen atom and example

116
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Case 2 electron

117
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Electricity

118
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
And we were trying to enhance acid

119
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
To believe this materials

120
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,599
Okay then be before you move on to your stencil Naval research laboratory and you just want to

121
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,903
Confirm that you did not walk with any of those

122
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
Diamond electrode you left him

123
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,047
I left them unfortunately no they're not as beautiful as you might imagine

124
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
There are there decent films of

125
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,471
Really sort of Greg utilitarian absolutely

126
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
So tell me about Naval Research lab

127
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,359
The reason I wanted a little bit about that is is because I actually work

128
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Four in a row for a while

129
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
What tire to write a

130
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:13,599
Institutional history for their 75th Anniversary so I got to know the place pretty well it didn't read me to see that you at work there

131
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
Yes I work there

132
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,535
I came right out of graduate school to postdoc at a naval research lab working with them Deborah wallison and Jeff Long

133
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
And

134
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:28,703
They worked on Power and energy related applications not with diamond but but with other electrode type

135
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,359
And so I was essentially taking my interest in and sort of power and energy and alternative energy sources

136
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,431
I'm to a group that had a long history of

137
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
So I spent about two years they're working

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Actually I got to know.

139
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
The funny thing also I work at Triple E S

140
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,047
As well the American Association for the advancement of science

141
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
Where you from learned a thing or two about

142
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
Science and Technology

143
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Policies that interesting

144
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
Shifting away from from the lab and into this other

145
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,639
Component of the whole science Enterprise yeah so I actually learn about the aaa's fellowship when I was in graduate school

146
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:15,551
And it's you know it's a one-year potentially a two-year program if you if you renew for a second year

147
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Where

148
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,183
Scientist and Engineers come to DC and either either serve on Capitol Hill and work work

149
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,767
Four members of Congress or Congressional committee or working executive

150
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,863
I meant I spent my time as a triple as fellow working at the national

151
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Science Foundation and that was my first

152
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,543
Kind of Entry if you will into policy by the purse strings essentially

153
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,639
How do we serve change the scientific Endeavors by funding

154
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Specific areas

155
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Technology

156
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Queso

157
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
I'm also realizing there is something weird about

158
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
I guess both of rcb's because I'm swerving you now into your darpet experience and you know I've got DARPA

159
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
On my resume

160
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,303
As well I think this is for this is it I'm not going to mention it again but there are

161
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,887
Parallel

162
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
So

163
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,799
What is the Western experience you've started as a seed a contract worker

164
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,383
And then you became a program manager in the defense

165
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
Science is opposite talked about the early seed of phase

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
And then how that

167
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Segwayed into

168
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Your program manager

169
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Yes it is

170
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
That's a really interesting

171
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Thread because

172
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Shapes

173
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,095
What my interests are today all the all the way back to the first day that I worked

174
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
So actually

175
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,519
Heard about DARPA from a friend who worked for a company that had

176
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Cita contract here

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,455
And while he didn't work at our but he said hey there's this opportunity is it something you'd be interested in this was right after

178
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
Aaa's Fellowship was winding up

179
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
And I

180
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
I know that sounds pretty interesting and

181
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
The opportunity was was

182
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Working with a mathematician

183
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
The defenses off

184
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
It's been man

185
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
And

186
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
Ben was

187
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,655
Is sort of a genius mathematician who wanted to surround himself by

188
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
People who

189
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
New other things

190
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Chemistry biology

191
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Physics those are

192
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
The things in it so he was really looking for someone to come in

193
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
I'm to provide a lens to chemistry

194
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
That's her if he could then

195
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Think about how to apply math

196
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
In that space

197
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
And

198
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,391
It was probably one of the scariest first days of my life but I just had to do it anyway

199
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
It was an amazing offer

200
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Opportunity

201
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
And really the sort of

202
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
The math and the programs that that

203
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
He had going

204
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
Still again as I as I mentioned her to impact my thought process

205
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
What's the time in super guns I have today

206
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
I'm have

207
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
AI components machine learning based components

208
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
Complexity those are just things were

209
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Who sings that song

210
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Address for a fundamental level

211
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Many years ago when I started

212
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,575
And I sort of weave through you know is as

213
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,415
Is DARPA goes none of us are here for for all that long

214
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
And so I'm worked for

215
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
Material scientist in a chemistry to getting back a little bit closer

216
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
My roots

217
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,887
But still being able to bring in those things I learned from Bandon from his

218
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
Performers in the programs that he

219
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,615
Right in just for listening to who might not know what how does for the basic structure here works is a program manager

220
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,479
Who is in charge of a portfolio of programs we're going to talk about that in your case

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,575
Soon but then each program manager has has one or several

222
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Sito's who

223
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,231
Assistance so what what might be a typical role for a seat on a typical program

224
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
Remind me what would say when it comes to

225
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
At working with

226
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Those

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Research groups

228
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
To become part of the overall

229
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Program Everett

230
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
Yes it really it really depends on on the program itself in the program manager but generally speaking

231
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,943
You serve as you can cover the subject matter expert where you have your the person in the room with that

232
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Expertise in chemistry

233
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,575
And when questions arise about for example how to apply mathematics

234
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
Tucanes relay question

235
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
You can think about well

236
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,023
You know if I think about a material I think about some structural considerations of that material

237
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,607
Those have Dimensions associated with them how that is that

238
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
Could that be addressed by mathematics

239
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Michael design

240
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Formatear live

241
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,799
So it's it's it's providing that subject matter expertise but then also

242
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
How do you bring that perspective of that field

243
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Into

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
The program at hand

245
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Because it's always about her.

246
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Program is exploring

247
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
And how various

248
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,671
A disciplines in an and approaches can impact that

249
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
So subject matter expertise

250
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Providing

251
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,167
Assertive reviews of of literature and things like that and then some some help with sort of program strategy

252
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Shiso

253
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,775
DARPA programs are all about how you manage

254
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Them

255
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
To function most efficiently and towards a

256
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
Specific goal into that requires a team of people I think

257
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Really kind of

258
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
Think through all the different ways

259
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
With which that

260
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,439
It's a year-and-a-half when you became a p.m. a program manager

261
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Most

262
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,815
PM's end up managing just a few programs

263
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
In their several positions but you are as we

264
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
I think you've got seven perhaps even more than that

265
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
Awesome inherited from

266
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Previous

267
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Another

268
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
Program managers in

269
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
Awesome that you've pitched and were able to get

270
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Approved through the hiring

271
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Vetting process

272
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,039
We can't talk about all these in in-depth do I would really love to

273
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
Let's just talk about a few and let's start with the make it program which I actually can tell you it was started by

274
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
Former program manager here Tyler

275
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
McQuaid who

276
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,911
I have a special fund this work because he was my first guest here on the voices from DARPA podcast

277
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
So you taking the Baton

278
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
221 D make it

279
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Program so tell us a little bit about

280
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
What's the goal is and what the status is now

281
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
The primary goal of the make it program is to

282
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Fully automate the synthesis

283
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Of small molecule

284
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
And what I mean by that is is we have a small molecule like Ibuprofen that might be some sort of pain medication or is

285
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Small molecule

286
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,047
Energetic or a small molecule agrochemical there

287
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,399
Chemicals are the building block materials for for what we have on it on a daily basis

288
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
We need to

289
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
To figure out how to make them

290
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,359
So by and large right now that's a that's a by hand process an expert chemist we go into a lab and and mix things up in

291
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
Beakers and test tubes in round bottom flask

292
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
I really Define

293
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
A route to a molecules that route is like a rat

294
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
That you might have it

295
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
The kitchen to bake a cake with a certain Tech

296
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Textron a certain fly

297
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
And you don't know in advance

298
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
What that route is

299
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
So you go in and you test out there is steps

300
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
To get to

301
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
A particular Malik

302
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
So molecule might take a five-step synthetic route which means I need to

303
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Go from set of starting materials

304
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
And do

305
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Five different

306
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Experiments

307
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Five different

308
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
Transformations if you will

309
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
How to get to the actual product

310
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
It takes much longer than you might imagine in your head

311
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,295
To design a route to molecule that that no one's done before it might take me

312
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
32426

313
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
To do

314
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
So what we're trying to do with make it is actually

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Provide

316
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
Computational tools

317
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
That can help us

318
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Define that route

319
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Through machine learning

320
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
And then

321
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Build

322
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
A device

323
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
The Implement that route

324
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Completely hands-free

325
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
And we are just need to stop you here with that machine learning as a

326
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Applied to chemical synthesis

327
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,223
Which is very interesting sounding to me I mean if it sounds like you have to

328
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Gather a tremendous amount of some sort of

329
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
Data from the chemical literature to feed to your machine

330
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
So that it can pull out of that

331
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
Likely series of steps

332
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,887
That would work that I get that right that's absolutely right and there are there is existing

333
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
Data from the last hundred years of

334
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Of chemistry and what's in the literature

335
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,079
But we actually are having to generate a lot of fun as well because his

336
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
As you might know

337
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,455
The data that you need to train machine learning algorithms is both what

338
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Works

339
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Or the positive result

340
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
And you also need what doesn't work and it turns out that scientists typically don't

341
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Publish what doesn't

342
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
We might have it captured in our lab notebook

343
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,279
But we don't publish that information and it's not available in database

344
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,351
And that's what you need so that your machine learning doesn't take you down a dead-end

345
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,959
So that's right it needs to know what doesn't work and we've actually had to both

346
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,311
So it's generate that computationally so we generate sort of negative results if you will

347
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
We've also built a rapid screening platform

348
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
That we can rapidly test

349
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Various reactions and we're collecting

350
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
All of the data

351
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
4

352
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
The molecules that are made

353
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
And then those molecules that aren't

354
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,695
Homemade sodas reactions that don't work we want all of that information to then feed into

355
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Machine learning

356
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Then help us understand

357
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
What's the best path

358
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
A recipe to

359
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
Quesadillas machine learning but also in this if I'm not mistaken

360
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
It's machine

361
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
Make it right so so

362
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,335
This whole thing is really automated your machine learning a saying

363
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
Going to try these 10 different synthetic routes and then

364
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
A bunch of gadgets are going ahead and doing it right right so we're trying to accelerate both that the brain is a chemist in terms of

365
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,391
Of having to sort through and sit through what route to use and what route

366
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
The test and also then the implementation of that

367
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
On a device

368
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
So that will be a fully automated

369
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Process

370
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,191
And not only automated from the perspective of making one molecule but we want one device

371
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
The commit

372
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Mini mall

373
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Nuts

374
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
A pretty complex undertaking

375
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
So as I Envision the whole system

376
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
It's it's sort of making me think a little bit of sort of like a a molecular version of the

377
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Star Trek

378
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
Replicator or something like that but where

379
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
Maybe I would I would bring this make it

380
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Gadgetry

381
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
Somewhere to a battlefield where

382
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
I might need this or that

383
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,607
Can you take us through an actual scenario let's say you're sick

384
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
Successful with makeup

385
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
You have these make it

386
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Do Technologies these gadgets

387
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,287
Boxes that you can ship somewhere who might want that and what were they used for

388
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,663
I think about this in instead of two main ways one is one is from the perspective of

389
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,271
If there are times where you might need to generate some

390
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
Some medicine for example remotely in the field

391
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
This device would allow you to do that it would allow a non-expert to come up to the device

392
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,279
And so you know I want medicine X and the device would then be able to

393
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,911
Define the route to that medicine what is the most efficient route most cost-effective route the most environmentally friendly route

394
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Be able to make that medicine

395
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,103
I also think about it from the perspective of a reproducibility and enabling synthesis

396
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
4

397
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,967
Four fields for research tool for fields that don't

398
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Have synthetic X

399
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
So for example in the field of molecular biology

400
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
Perhaps they could have him make a device in their lab

401
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
And generate

402
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,487
Small amounts of chemicals that they might need in their research

403
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
Without having to purchase sort of large

404
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,423
Large products or in a products that aren't necessarily available commercially they be able to then use this

405
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
To enable their research

406
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Interesting okay well

407
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
Good luck with that with make it may you take it

408
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
To the finish line

409
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
I want to move to another program

410
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Which

411
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
I find this absolutely fascinating molecular

412
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Informatics

413
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,415
You know me we've also gotten familiar with the idea of thinking of DNA

414
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
Deoxyribonucleic acid as an information can

415
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Containing molecules

416
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Contains genetic and

417
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Say it's sort of

418
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Has the

419
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
The genetic or the molecular in

420
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
Information blueprint of a of a person

421
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,799
But you're you're taking this idea of molecular information to

422
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
Entirely different

423
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
I'd rather audacious places so can you talk about

424
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Molecular

425
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Yeah sure so

426
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
Looking for my taxes at kind of a

427
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
Crazy instantiation of of really what would you do

428
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,487
If you could actually store data

429
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
The physical form of a molecule

430
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
So nature does that as you mentioned in DNA

431
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,935
That's that's how that's how we store information for genetic codes

432
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
And then there is work going on to store actual Digital Data zeros and ones of our our digital world

433
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
In

434
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
DNA so DNA has these four building blocks

435
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
And you can essentially

436
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Code

437
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,319
The zeros and ones of our Digital Data into these four building blocks

438
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,695
But when we started to think about this in in terms of of

439
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,767
How we could both accelerate

440
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,167
Ultra dense data storage so that's the benefit that molecules provide is is it from a density person

441
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Effective

442
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,287
You can store much more data in a very small physical form

443
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
But also then as compared to say

444
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:01,759
The transistor base magnetic memory things like that take memory yeah

445
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
But then if

446
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:09,439
If you do that they're there their serve to threats or what is that nature uses for building block

447
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Box for molecule

448
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
Ulta store

449
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Our

450
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Complex

451
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Instruct

452
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Options for life

453
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
But there are millions of Malik

454
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
Nny limit ourselves to those for

455
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,359
So we started think about this from the perspective of if we could actually sort of address

456
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
An access

457
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
The Richer palliative chemistry to store data

458
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:37,087
What could that been enable from either a density perspective or a computational

459
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,927
And that's where we started to see this this mix between

460
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Storing data

461
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
An archiving it

462
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Which is which

463
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
Time is really good with DNA right now you you write the data onto a DNA strand and you put it in the refrigerator and our climate

464
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Earlier

465
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
But

466
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,079
Could you actually use that information in the molecular

467
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Perform so could you compute

468
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
On

469
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
That molecule

470
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
For some function so computations are like

471
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,855
You know you might want to do an addition or multiplication or you might want to do

472
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
I'm a search of a large dataset

473
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,743
So a large image that do some sort of machine learning on that day

474
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,351
And what molecules offer is

475
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
Not only

476
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
The ability to store

477
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
Data in a very very dense way

478
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
But also

479
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Very highly parallel

480
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
And what I mean by that is

481
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,199
Chemical reactions happen

482
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Relatively

483
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
Quickly and

484
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
They happen

485
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Essentially simultaneously

486
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
So if you have a beaker full of molecules

487
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,975
You'll have multiple reaction pads all happening at the same time

488
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,327
As opposed to the sort of Serial processing or one right after the other process

489
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Something that we might think about

490
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,191
Are there particular kinds of

491
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Problems where

492
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
This molecular computation

493
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
Would be better than then

494
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
What kind of convention

495
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
That's exactly what we're exploring

496
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,711
You know we have hypotheses about where that might be true

497
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
We have some approaches that are looking at things like

498
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Similarity search

499
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
Trey very large set of images

500
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
So

501
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
Can I find all of the images that have a red shirt

502
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Can I do that much money

503
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Faster

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
In a convention

505
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
The computer might be

506
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Able to do it

507
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,632
We're looking at problems in involving signal processing

508
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:31,520
And optimization so so how can you optimize a response how can you get sword of the best

509
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Function from that room

510
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
And

511
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
What we're really looking at is is

512
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Can molecules able

513
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Us to do things like

514
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Faster

515
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
And or can they enable us

516
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
To do sort of a computation

517
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
That

518
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,672
A conventional computer that sits on your desktop would not be able to

519
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
I just want to drilling on one part of this

520
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,560
To see if you can help me understand say how

521
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
Hey the result of a chemical reaction

522
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
I'm saying this

523
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Molecular

524
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Computation

525
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Camille corresponds to a

526
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Redshirt in an image where

527
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
How does that

528
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Molecule

529
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
Map

530
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
To the

531
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
So that depends on how you encode the

532
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,808
I'll give you a an example that's kind of easy to Grass will go back to DNA for

533
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
Two DNA again has these these four base pairs

534
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
And we put them together in a string

535
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
And that string

536
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
We can then

537
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
With that string in the code that we use for that string weather it

538
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,448
Actg or gcta whatever we design

539
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Code

540
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
For a red shirt

541
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
We could actually

542
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Then

543
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
Synthesizes DNA strand

544
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,944
An image that has a red shirt in it will have that red shirt

545
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Code

546
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,040
So in some if I have a string of 100

547
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
Of these A T C and G

548
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,672
The code for that red shirt will be embedded within that

549
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,000
And we'd actually search for that very quickly from within a molecular

550
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Way

551
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,376
And and with DNA we might do that with some complementary strand so

552
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:06,496
If folks understand that that DNA has is assertive a double-stranded process

553
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
We're working in

554
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
Encoding on the encoding and data storage side

555
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Single strand

556
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,200
So we can use that that sort of base pairing

557
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
I'm phenomenon that that nature uses and DNA

558
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
To then how do we reach in

559
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
To that

560
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:26,208
Liquid stew of of data and then only pluck out

561
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Those strands that have

562
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
That code

563
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
For a red shirt

564
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,912
That sounds absolutely amazing one thing that I think would be interesting to maybe

565
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
Try to give

566
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
Listen to sense of is just

567
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
How dense

568
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
The storage can be I mean you know sometimes you hear

569
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
People talking about

570
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
Storing the entire contents of the Library of Congress

571
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
And something the size of a sugar

572
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Cube like the Library of Congress

573
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Become a and information unit

574
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
So when you talk about

575
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,952
DNA as storage, how much

576
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Say I mean this might be difficult

577
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
But in in DNA that could

578
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Packages sugar cube

579
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
How much would that be

580
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
So

581
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Wouldn't one of the best kind of

582
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,080
Images I can provide as if you took all of the data that have been generated in the history of

583
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Time

584
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Up until like

585
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
2015 or 26

586
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
If you swear that in DNA

587
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
You could pack all of that into something besides NSU

588
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Absolute Style

589
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,232
Tiptoe to put an exclamation point on that what we're trying to do a molecular for Maddox is

590
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Is

591
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,632
Provide sort of practical DNA storage solutions that we can compute on as I mentioned but then

592
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
Access that broader

593
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,496
Pallet of molecules which might provide

594
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
Even higher.

595
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Right on that case

596
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,944
Biological evolution leads to DNA with these four building blocks acting

597
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
But that doesn't mean we have to stop there

598
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
Our purposes is

599
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Or something else

600
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Alligator storage

601
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
You might have

602
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Additional building block

603
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
Boxer wants a different different functions

604
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:04,000
That's right that's right in it allows us a lot more flexibility in our in our designs

605
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
We think a lot at DARPA about

606
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,840
Not only developing and a blanket

607
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,936
Abilities but thinking about the ultimate source of scalability and implementation of those

608
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,824
DSO really is looking at things that we might actually realize in 10 20 30 years

609
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
But we always have that in mind

610
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Different science

611
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
That's right

612
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,808
Let's just touch on two of your other programs just briefly

613
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,648
One of them ACDC that stands for agnostic

614
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
Compact

615
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Demilitarization

616
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
Of chemical agents in that just sounds like a great idea

617
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
Yeah it's it

618
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
It's a wonderful and Nessa

619
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Necessary

620
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Unfortunately

621
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,776
So is a CDC program is is designed to make

622
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
Transportable

623
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
Devices that can destroy chemical warfare

624
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
So really we're headed with this is actually

625
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Building a device that is

626
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:03,648
Almost a conventional diesel engines if you imagine a diesel engine and what we're going to be doing with this diesel engine is using

627
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
The chemical warfare agents

628
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
As a fuel

629
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
So just like his you would burn diesel fuel

630
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
In an engine

631
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
We're burning chemical warfare agent

632
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
And destroying it in the process

633
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
So we can produce energy from this engine

634
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
But we are also then destroying chemical

635
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
I'm an ultimately what we're building is

636
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
The Prototype

637
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
It's a pickup truck

638
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,200
With an engine in the front that in this pickup truck can drive to a site

639
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Run

640
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,552
Off of the chemical warfare agent destroy chemical warfare agent

641
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
And then we can drive

642
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
Swords to plowshares

643
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Thanks

644
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:44,096
Okay may you actually succeed in a nephew you've tested this a few times right now

645
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,656
Developing rebuilding the full system develop

646
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:53,312
Okay the last of your many programs that we will talk about right now is

647
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,640
Scout just because I mentioned it earlier in the intro that stands for

648
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
Spectral Combs

649
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Ultraviolet

650
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
2 terahertz

651
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,600
And we're not talking about here. Comes that we use to make our hair look nice right this is something else

652
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
That's right

653
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,696
Scout is is focused on

654
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,256
Developing compact sources for spectroscopy

655
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
Spectroscopy is essentially a chemical measured

656
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Of of

657
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Varispeed

658
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,656
She's so if we want to know

659
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,752
What species are present in the air that were breathing we might use spectroscopy to five

660
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
And

661
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
Tell was really designed to take

662
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
A capability that have been developed that

663
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Single wavelength

664
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,016
And expanded all the way from ultraviolet to Terre Haute

665
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
Hertz as you mentioned in the reason that you want to do that is because

666
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Molecules behave differently

667
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
When they're

668
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Energize if you will with light

669
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
In the UV regime than they do in the terror

670
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
I'm in different systems respond to phone

671
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:50,144
Aliso movies is very good for interrogating biological

672
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,264
Where is terahertz might be really good for really complex mixtures like breath an hour

673
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
So people are very interested in using terahertz

674
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
Before for those compass

675
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Interstellar

676
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:07,296
Had to have two threads one is to develop the materials to miniaturize

677
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,880
Very sort of high-fidelity sources

678
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
For spectroscopy

679
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,488
Across the UV de Terror

680
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
That's right

681
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
To use for the sort of spectroscopic apus

682
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Application

683
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,704
And the other was to actually demonstrate let's say that we can build these things in the laboratory

684
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
What can we actually do with them then in the field

685
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
And

686
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
What we've shown is that

687
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,896
That Scout offers the ability to do

688
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Things much much

689
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
Faster than conventional

690
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Systems

691
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
So I can take a spectrum

692
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,136
In a matter of milliseconds where it might have taken me minutes

693
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
To do before

694
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,792
And that's very important when you when you have something that that is a matter of whether or not you want to know that there's been

695
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
Chemical attack for example you want to know as fast

696
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
Possible and you want to know exactly what that

697
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
Agent was

698
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
I'm just kind of

699
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Tool can tell you

700
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
And also we've been able to show that we can do

701
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,408
The spectroscopy over a large distance

702
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
So, am I

703
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Link the distance

704
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,576
Which is really important to monitor larger areas

705
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,416
And this might have implications in the oil and gas industry for gas leak

706
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Example

707
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,792
Also for air quality monitoring across the city there are a number of different Factor

708
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
You could think about

709
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
I'm in these are all I safe

710
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,680
So so we don't have to worry about safety challenges

711
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,520
And we're really looking to find out how we might apply

712
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
This

713
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Spectroscopic method

714
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
In a in a DVD and then outside DVD

715
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
Why didn't you just mention along the way

716
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:44,576
Even breath analysis that that begins to sound like a biomedical application cuz I know there has been research

717
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Indicating that

718
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,952
There can be in a really subtle signs in the in the sort of the chemistry of Ativan

719
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
Exhalation right back in the be indicative of

720
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:59,936
Play some kind of disease and really what you're getting in something like breath analysis or any other biological or complex

721
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,776
System generally as you getting a lot of chemical a lot of signals

722
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
That might change

723
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,408
Frequently or overtime in the concentrations might be very very low

724
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
To developing a technique that can can do both

725
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,808
I'm deal with that the complexity of of the number of different

726
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:21,440
Analytes if you have the number different things in that sample and also do it very quickly and distinguish them from each other is really

727
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
Okay then just finally on that for that word

728
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Home

729
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,912
I take it it's because if you were to look at the distribution of wavelengths

730
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
Insertive represent each one of those is a line

731
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
Then

732
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,336
There's many lines in a way look like the tines of a comb

733
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,944
That's right that's exactly right suit so you get a light source that provides

734
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
Many wavelengths

735
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
All at once

736
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
But they have a very

737
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
Find spectral resolution

738
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
Which is really important

739
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
Again for the surf

740
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Complex apart

741
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Dealing with

742
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:59,072
Okay so we we've kind of touched on four of your programs and I but we will will have to leave the other one

743
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
4

744
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
Another time Although our

745
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,216
Westerners can always go to the DARPA website and find out more about those

746
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
So you been a program manager for about a year-and-a-half

747
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,336
And that that means that you

748
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
You're probably only have

749
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152
Have a couple more years to go that's typical

750
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
I'm just wondering if you imagine

751
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Back

752
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,064
2 your time here at DARPA but from a vantage

753
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Of 10 years from now

754
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
And you've examined what has

755
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
Come of your work

756
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Computer program

757
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Save

758
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
Scouter make

759
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,328
What do you hope you will be able to say at that time

760
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Well

761
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
I really you no looking back

762
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,032
We spend a lot of time here and I'm spending a lot of time thinking about

763
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,920
Where might these things go and that's a lot of what what DARPA does is build relationships with other organizations

764
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
Transition the technologies that would that we develop and so

765
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,088
I already see seeds toot-toot to what that answer might be

766
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,928
There's some projects I have where it's going to be continued scientific Kentucky

767
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
Call development a lot of knowledge generated

768
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
And it might be

769
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,864
You're 20 to 30 years before anybody sees anything and it might not look anything like it does

770
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,168
Today I think for four program like

771
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
Like make it we might actually see these two

772
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
Systems and we might actually see some

773
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
Some generation of the systems that we're building now

774
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
As a first generation

775
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
As commercial device

776
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
We might see some seeds

777
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
Industry

778
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
Enter the chemical production industry

779
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,344
Using some of the

780
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
The computational

781
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
That we're developing

782
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
I think

783
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Programs like make it in ACDC

784
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
I can see a very practical through field adapt

785
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Application

786
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
And more Partners like molecular informatics I think it's

787
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
We're just

788
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
At the Forefront of the

789
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Fining

790
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
What are the questions we should be asking

791
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,312
To really begin to understand the opportunity for molecules

792
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
In

793
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
And something like

794
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,944
Write an as I game this at myself if I try to be you for a minute

795
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,784
If I knew say 10 years from now.

796
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
AC DC technology that I work

797
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
Help to decontaminate tons and tons and tons

798
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Very dangerous

799
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Chemical warfare agents

800
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:11,168
Well I mean I would feel like I have something in my life I have to say even even even being it.

801
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,752
On a daily basis is humbling experience but then

802
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
You know seeing something

803
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
That that you're working on and they are performers are working really hard to

804
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
To develop

805
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
Become

806
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Used

807
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
In either the deity or a broader

808
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Contacts

809
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
Will be incredible

810
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,672
All right and then that's what we're getting toward the end here but I did just want to touch back on

811
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,256
An interest of yours that you express way back when you were

812
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Graduate student

813
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
When you were

814
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,912
You're a woman entering the world of science and and

815
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
You know in what

816
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
Tradition has been in a male-dominated

817
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Kind of world

818
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
But going further not just getting through that yourself but also

819
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,432
So trying to inspire young women and girls to do the same so the Girl Scout

820
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,832
Interest patch in chemistry a little bit about that particular experience and then if you've actually continued

821
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
That kind of Interest

822
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,232
Even in your late on your career really started

823
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
In in college

824
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
College and graduate so I was actually part

825
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
And held leadership roles in an organization

826
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
My undergraduate and graduate

827
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
Tutions

828
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
That we're really geared towards

829
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
Assertive women science

830
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
And

831
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
We did Outreach

832
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,784
Sit tight tight two young girls and and worked at science fairs and things like that but we also then work Community for each other

833
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
Weather and the faculty at RNC

834
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
It's not it wasn't something Limited

835
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
2 to a student

836
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
I might sort of crosses

837
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Alter professional level

838
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
And

839
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
I learned a lot

840
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,864
Through a lot of those conversations about explicit bias

841
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,168
Implicit bias and all sorts of

842
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
Of quitting reasons

843
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
You know

844
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
That

845
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,312
That there is an underrepresentation of

846
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
Of both women and other

847
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Under represent

848
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,760
But for me it was about finding the answer for the reason it was about empowering

849
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Those around me

850
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,600
And and that happened it at that level at

851
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,184
It still happens today but I think I do it a little bit more

852
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,048
Organically now as opposed to being involved in an organization's it's much more about mentoring

853
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,400
And trying to fill a hole of that other women might have in terms of

854
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Having a circle of

855
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,032
The people around them men and women to help Mentor them

856
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
And grow their careers

857
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
And that's one thing that that I do try to focus on

858
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,224
And also then again make sure that I have that in my

859
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
Life is wild because it's important for everyone

860
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
Play to make sure that they build this relation

861
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
For folks

862
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
Books to help

863
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
And learning

864
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Okay so what

865
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
We were actually at a time

866
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,072
But I just wanted to ask you if there's anything about science

867
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,376
DARPA your career as a chemist

868
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
So it was anything else you just didn't come up that would be adventurous

869
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,264
Well you didn't ask me it how fun this way

870
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,432
Well tell me how fun is it this this being being the podcast but also

871
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
Life in general it at DARPA

872
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
And I say that because

873
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
Get to interact with

874
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,648
Amazing top-notch scientist

875
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Json

876
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
A daily base

877
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
Multiple times a day

878
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,584
That's a really exciting and it's a really fun it's amazing opportunity

879
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
And those are the folks that are doing that the

880
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
The hard work to implement

881
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
All of the ideas that we might

882
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Generate

883
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,032
I'm really put them to practice

884
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:32,896
Snn again from another perspective of coming to work every day and being humbled by that

885
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,480
And being so excited and energized by what they have

886
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
To bring in terms of their ideas and

887
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,392
But I just want to thank you for spending time with me in the studio

888
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
And they're getting up to speed on your programs

889
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Thanks this is fun

890
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us

891
