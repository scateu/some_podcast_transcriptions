Your hands

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
Technology is a driver of our time

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,296
Since its founding in 19

5
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
58 in the midst of the Cold War

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,648
DARPA the defense Advanced research projects

7
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
The agency has been a driver of Technology

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
Welcome to voices from DARPA

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
A window

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
Want to DARPA score of program manager

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Their job

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
To redefine what is possible

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,008
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your door post

14
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,080
And today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio

In Darkness defense

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
Science

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,992
Throughout her career

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,808
Reba has been working on mathematical innovation

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,624
In applying them in areas ranging from

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
Spacecraft control

23
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
Vibration control in structures

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
And even to the vexing problem

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
Quantifying uncertainty

26
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,608
In a mathematical model

27
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
The scientist

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
Fuse to study complex phenomena

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Weather and biological processes

30
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
In the engineers use

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,592
Used to design simulate manufacture

32
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
And operator

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,688
Many of the complex Technologies important

34
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
In Military and civilian setting

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
Thanks people for spending some time with me today

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
Thank you Ivan

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,768
I would love to start out for you and learning a little bit about you about your background your education

38
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Some of the

39
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
Important things that of

40
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,632
Happened throughout your career

41
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
That ultimately LED you here to Darby

42
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Tell us a little bit

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
Well let me tell you a little bit about my

44
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Background

45
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
And tell you that the chili my relationship mathematics has been a developing one and I have to say that

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Over the years

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
It has really

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
T-Pain

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
I was born and raised in Iran which has a long tradition of excellent and rigorous mathematical and

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
Technical education

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
I

52
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
Receive my

53
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Bachelor degrees

54
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
14 applied math

55
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,704
Physics from UC Berkeley from then I went to

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,824
A beautiful Campus of University of Wisconsin-Madison

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,176
And then I went to Brown to get my PhD in applied math

58
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
After getting my PhD

59
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
I came back to

60
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Meme of Postgraduate School to California to Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey and spent several years as Professor ended

61
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Department of

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Like math

63
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
And while I was there I was contacted by a colleague of mine was working and very sick

64
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,288
Similar research areas she suggested whether I would consider getting a job as a program manager

65
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
For computational mathematics said efforts

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Of the scientist

67
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,200
Research

68
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:04,576
It's Arlington basic on the same block as a Starbucks

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
I wasn't even sure what that entails

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
But having my colleague and friend in a position and watching her but she was able to

71
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,912
To to achieve but actually an inspiration and that's when I said yes

72
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
And how then was did you make the direct connection here with

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
DARPA I suppose

74
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
To being a pmlc

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
The interesting thing was that about

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
Maybe couple years into my job but some program managers from TWRP approached me and they said that with the

77
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,856
Interested in going are coming to DARPA and

78
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
And I have to say

79
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,048
If I thought getting a position to a full-service scary and cut about a character I thought the

80
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
Kites DARPA would be

81
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
The scariest thing to do

82
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:56,288
I become familiar with the research that being supported by DARPA and our permission

83
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
And I was having a hard time trying to see her supporting basic Research In Math

84
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
Mathematics could be

85
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,600
Of any relevance to what darpro was doing and making that connection

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
You certainly have done that with your

87
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Programs which we will

88
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
Talk about in a little while you really haven't discovered that there really is a connection between you and end the

89
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Grams

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
Before we actually talked about those I want to pull back a little bit

91
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
10

92
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
Find apps how you

93
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,335
And Mathematics became lifelong partners and I asked you this because

94
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,663
I think this is true for me and I'm sure many listener is that

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
The mathematics is just one of those fuels are

96
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
So many of us

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Is difficult

98
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,111
We we we kind of push it away. The earliest time that we can

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:47,999
And yet you've really had this partnership Tressa how did you develop this what I imagine is a

100
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
The kind of love for

101
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
For the discipline

102
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
So my interest in mathematics

103
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
Was not actually from the point of view of being interested in abstraction

104
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,383
Or just because this is this was the way my

105
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Mine worked

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,807
I was always interested in problem-solving but I was also interested in gaining

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Better understanding

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Pictures of the physical world

109
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,207
So I didn't want to become an engineer

110
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Even though

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
At the time it seemed like all the smart kids to with strong mathematical abilities would like to go to

112
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
Engineering or they would go to medical school but then I decided no I

113
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,383
I want to try to become more of a scientist so I was thinking of physics

114
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
The only thing is that I started as a physics undergrad but it only took me taking semester-long

115
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
Concourse in their experimental to realize I don't have a lot of talent that I realized you didn't

116
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,047
Necessarily come with a lot of pleasure enjoyed spending my time doing experiments

117
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,143
So then I decided that I tell you what really gives me

118
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,263
A lot of pleasure in and studying hard as was actually the more mathematical

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Aspect of the

120
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
The physics courses

121
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,199
And I found out that oh I can I did a very quickly become a double major

122
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
In-flight mathematic

123
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,159
So that's how I started interest me about applied math is that

124
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,231
In that way of engaging mathematics

125
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,351
You are looking at these symbols and working with the symbol that many of us associate with Matt

126
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
And you are finding out how they relate

127
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,495
Wheel World in pretty dramatic ways

128
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,359
One way of making this concrete in this conversation might be for you to tell us about how

129
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
You applied

130
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
A kind of mathematics

131
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,551
Kind of an innovation for which you now have some mathematical entities named after you

132
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
And and how that

133
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159
Led to operational

134
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Changes

135
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
With respect to the international

136
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Space Station

137
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Can you just tell us that story

138
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
About

139
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
W that math

140
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Two space station

141
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
So

142
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
The research that

143
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Doing

144
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
During my PhD in afterwards.

145
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
To do with control and optimization of

146
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Natural systems that are modeled by

147
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
What's an example of an atom

148
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Sound

149
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
Animal control of

150
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
A structure

151
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,815
Or any combination of interaction of these

152
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Different physical

153
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,447
So in the case of for example of spacecraft control

154
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Is that beer looking at the situation we're looking at complex nonlinear Dynamics

155
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,663
Where in this case

156
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
So that means little changes can lead to big

157
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
Results possibly even even though the sound engineer system right this is not necessarily like climate that you would say

158
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
Quit being a Sally don't have any control over

159
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Innate randomness

160
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
Patient but he were talking about engineering system

161
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
That we would like

162
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
To perform certain maneuvers

163
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
In an optimal fashion

164
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
So you're expecting your system in this case

165
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
The skyscraper

166
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,895
Needs to perform certain Maneuvers at that lets you minimize a certain

167
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Objectives

168
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
So in this case

169
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
You trying to do it

170
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,063
Sometimes it minimum time sometimes you're trying to do it with minimum

171
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
Energy or

172
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,743
Minimum

173
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Something to go for it

174
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Is propellant on a

175
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Spacecraft can cost

176
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
$10,000

177
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
A pound

178
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
So if you can minimize that

179
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,311
And give the Nvidia another needs to cost by the house across stuff like in the case of

180
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
The National Space

181
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Station

182
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
The cost of refueling

183
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Could be

184
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,855
I mean not that situation so you really have to use everything in the most cost-efficient

185
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
An optical Manor

186
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,743
So in this case for me actually I have to say that

187
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,327
The whole success story here I owe it to my

188
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
Basically my colleagues were able to

189
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
They said forget the theory and

190
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
The algorithms that we developed

191
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
And basically

192
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Work really hard

193
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
2

194
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
How to implement

195
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,503
Right and if we were to just to say simply what the result was

196
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
My reading is correct is that you were able to come up with a way of using certain systems like gyroscopes

197
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
On the space station

198
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
To achieve fairly dramatic

199
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,607
Changes like 90 degree turns 180 degree rotations without

200
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
The used

201
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
A propellant released minimizing to a great degree

202
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
The need for

203
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Propellant

204
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
And it's this would not have happened

205
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
I did not come up

206
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
With

207
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Inefficient

208
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
An accurate way of

209
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Implementing days

210
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,647
Right input the actual control that went to those gyroscopes

211
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
Emerge from the mathematical framework that you were able to

212
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
To develop into this

213
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
Should have brought that line all the way from the smoke.

214
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
Abstract way of thinking math all the way to this

215
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
Million-dollar multi-million dollar savings

216
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
Of how you operate the International Space Station

217
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,103
That to me is sort of one of the Miracles of of math and its connection to the real world

218
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,175
What's what's Segway than two

219
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
And the two programs that

220
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
You are working on here

221
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,903
So one of them goes by the acronym equips

222
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
That stands for

223
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,047
Enabling quantification of uncertainty in physical systems

224
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
The other one that goes by the acronym model that stands for models Dynamics and

225
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Learning

226
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
So let's start with equips

227
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,591
And again that stands for enabling quantification of uncertainty

228
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
In physical systems

229
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Sounds

230
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Fascinating the idea of

231
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Quantifying uncertainty

232
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,111
Tell us about the program what the goals are and what

233
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
The status is

234
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
At the moment

235
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
The goals of the

236
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Program I have to say no

237
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Southern Loft

238
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
The fashion which is not always my

239
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
Almost state of Rio Fest

240
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
Yes but I do have to say that I had very lofty goals for the

241
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Program

242
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
And

243
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
The way

244
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,735
In my mind I was thinking of the program

245
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
I still do

246
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Is

247
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
To dress like bleach

248
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Change the wave

249
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
B

250
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
Go through our modeling and simulation

251
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
What you were saying physical world engineering system

252
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
We do have a long history

253
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Basically

254
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Mama Soul of scientific

255
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
History def of modeling physical

256
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
Systems and physical phenomena

257
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
And using mathematics

258
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
But what I'm saying about changing the practice of modeling is

259
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
In some ways

260
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
Taking into account

261
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
How good how how bad we are

262
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
As modeler

263
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
It's almost like being inside certain level of honesty

264
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
2R model

265
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Innocence dad

266
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,287
We have to consider the fact that it doesn't matter how good

267
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
We think our models are

268
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
At the end are just going to be an approximation

269
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
It just going to be a surrogate

270
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
For the physical real

271
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:43,135
The fact that in the process sometimes we are not quite clear

272
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
About the

273
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
Let's say the discrepancy between our what the output of our models are and what the physical world is

274
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
It's going to create a lot of

275
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Issues

276
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
When we trying to analyze a cyst

277
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,567
As far as physical modeling goes probably one of the most successful

278
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
Stories is basically

279
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
The navier-stokes equation

280
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
So you might apply the never Stokes

281
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Equation for example

282
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
If you wanted to

283
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Try to describe

284
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
How

285
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
The cream you pour into your coffee

286
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Goes into that

287
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
Fluid in you see the Beautiful

288
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Horse world

289
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
Or it might be the way

290
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Masses of air in the atmos

291
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
Sphere are flowing

292
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
Adventure intermingling itself

293
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
That's the clothes at the range that were talking about with the taxi

294
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,383
In a basically Huff love everywhere you know

295
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Airplane games

296
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,271
It's basically the fundamental of aerospace engineer

297
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,671
At the celebrated equation but the problem with it is that you didn't you talk to

298
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,231
So people who are looking at

299
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
Physical physical flows fluid flow

300
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,143
And they do still scratch their head and it still can say that

301
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,727
We are talking a certain situation let's and Hypersonic

302
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
But it's not at all clear

303
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
That this is

304
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Equation

305
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
How to get talking about

306
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
You were still talking about fluids but it's at the scale and

307
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Serta physical condition that

308
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
It's not at all clear

309
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
The right equation

310
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Steven try to

311
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Assimilate

312
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
Yes we do have airplanes that fly we do have an aerospace industry has been one of our most

313
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Successful

314
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Water Industries

315
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,727
Let the 20 Century and it will be even more in at 20th and the teacher Center

316
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
But

317
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,871
It makes you a little worried that the sum of the work and the mathematical work that is being done

318
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Is based on

319
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,271
Certain assumptions that and the physical models that may actually not hold

320
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Correct me if I'm wrong but

321
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
As you were speaking I'm realizing

322
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Well

323
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
We have

324
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
These

325
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Technology wish list

326
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,839
We want Hypersonic vehicles in Hypersonic technology things that are

327
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
What's the operating faster than the speed of sound

328
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
What you're saying is

329
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,751
We've got mathematical equations and traditions and method

330
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Fly roughly in the kind of

331
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Phenomenal

332
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
That are applicable in

333
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Designing

334
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,687
Hypersonic vehicle but we actually don't know

335
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,527
We don't know cuz if it's an accurate representation of of that

336
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Hypersonic

337
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
Arena

338
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
This need for

339
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,535
Quantifying or uncertainty or lack of knowledge and also the kind of error and discrepancy.

340
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,911
Between a mathematical models and a physical reality and our Engineers system comes from engineers

341
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
Because one of the things is that

342
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
You're looking right now in situations

343
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Bad

344
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
The only way they can

345
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Consist of

346
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Certify

347
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Let's say their design or whatever did Bill

348
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Is

349
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
By using something right and in this case

350
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
Probably try to do it using

351
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
Well in certain situation you can test

352
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,583
And maybe you can if you do test summon the kind of testing maybe could do it

353
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,143
In certain maybe certain components

354
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Before testing on the system

355
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Praise up listen up Coldplay

356
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,359
Will necessarily have to be done on the entire when he's after you've already built it

357
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
That's a little too late in order to come up with

358
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
Ways of changing a design or changing the way it's

359
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
Being built right so you would like to be involved in that whole process

360
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,695
As a mathematician and as an engineer

361
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
A little earlier into that

362
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
So the only way to do that

363
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Testing is not going to help

364
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Personable insurance

365
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Situation is

366
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Is maybe too expensive

367
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Too late

368
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
And

369
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Something

370
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Possible

371
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
Is using simulation

372
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,407
Whole thing about simulation is based on having a mathematical model

373
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,319
And having the simulation tools like a basic it is numerical methods and all that and a computational tool

374
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
And

375
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Platform store

376
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
Computers that you can actually Judy

377
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Assimilation

378
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,815
So this is where you see that math comes in right there

379
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
And this is the only way

380
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
That we can test out

381
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
These

382
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,287
These new designs on your that are not already there not built

383
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,847
But you have basically the elements of

384
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
The design so you can at least test it out

385
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
Using simulation

386
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Before

387
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Before you go

388
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
I think I heard you once

389
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
Talk about this is almost like a mathematics

390
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Honesty

391
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:38,559
Yes it is and I love the phrase now that you're talking about

392
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
This

393
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
World of

394
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Simulation

395
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Which is

396
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
Based on mathematics and then perhaps

397
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
Mathematical models

398
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
Operating in the form of computer mod

399
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
But in there in that kind of abstracted

400
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Place

401
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
An extracted operation

402
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
You're trying to develop a framework with equips

403
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
That

404
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
It is kind of the reality check in the map

405
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
Exactly how well is this

406
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
Representing ultimately the real world

407
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
Technology that we want

408
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
To emerge out of this

409
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Mathematic

410
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Sex and modeling

411
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
Is that

412
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Mice characterization

413
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,799
And what is so fascinating about this is that the feels goes very quickly from some

414
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
May in in the beginning may think

415
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Some philosophical

416
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
Ruminations about what is reality what is representational reality what is a relationship

417
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Should of mathematics 2

418
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Physical world very quickly

419
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
2

420
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Some beautiful Theory

421
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
So interesting

422
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
Result that I expect from eclipse

423
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Is to see whether it's

424
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,519
Possible to come up with some common Frameworks and common tools that could deal with some of the

425
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
The major challenges

426
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,639
Within looking at very different application prompt

427
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,223
This is this is going to be an interesting

428
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,575
A process to to observe and see what results come out of it

429
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
Because the performers at this point are looking as system as

430
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
A different as possible from each other from Aerospace structures to integrated circuits to chemical

431
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
So we'll see whether something

432
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Commonwealth

433
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Come out of

434
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,751
What's the maybe that's a nice cue to talk a little bit about

435
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Model

436
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Are the models Dynamics in learning

437
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
So there's actually a very nice link between

438
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
The program equips and model

439
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,319
One issue that I need to emphasize about

440
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Quips

441
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,951
Because right now I've only talked about about basic as you mention it took

442
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Trying to

443
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Capture

444
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
4

445
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,631
Make honesty as part of her modeling

446
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Process

447
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
But I haven't really told you about the challenges

448
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
That beat we have enough

449
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Processing

450
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
One of the biggest challenges is that

451
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,199
The complex world that bear looking out of compass system we are looking at

452
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
The high dimension

453
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
When you say hi dimensionality

454
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,367
What do you mean by that sounds like there's many parts that we have to think about

455
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Right

456
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,487
Exactly so so there's a lot of times when you think of dimension

457
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,559
And you might have heard that you're thinking about the dark

458
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Three physical dimensions

459
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,703
And then we have a dimension of time so we we think our physical world is basically

460
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Laika for dementia

461
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,335
But the way we're using dimension

462
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:35,711
Basically here is what we think exactly is the degree of Freedom or basically

463
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
The number of variables that

464
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
We need in order to

465
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
2

466
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Build a model

467
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
What represents

468
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,439
At model a robot with 10 joints

469
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Is that

470
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
I could think of that very simply that

471
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
10 dimensional problem that is

472
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Exactly

473
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
1000

474
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
You could be very exact

475
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,079
And the interesting part is that you look at a robot and you have your look at it okay but I want to write down basically

476
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
What I'm thinking about the

477
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
The number of

478
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
Variables are modes or whatever that I can

479
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
Express the physical variable that I'm interest

480
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,575
But at the same time

481
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Sometimes when I wanted to

482
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,184
Any kind of approximation

483
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Right

484
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
Of each of these

485
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
10 variables

486
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Start end dimension

487
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,216
Each Dimension I'm actually need additional

488
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
Dimensions

489
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
In order to do my app

490
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Approximately

491
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:38,944
So this is like at every step of our modeling here and and an approximation we are introducing

492
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,832
More Dimension cx-10 demand what we say is a 10 dimensional system

493
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
Ends up being for example for each Dimension I may need another 10 yesterday

494
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Way of seeing how

495
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
10 Dimensions multiply

496
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
In that robot cases that

497
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
Each joint

498
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,240
Self has has these three spatial dimensions and the temporal so each one has four

499
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,872
So suddenly were already at 42 have to do with the physical

500
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
Relate to the physical

501
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,784
Representation but someone says something's Dimension comes from our

502
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,880
Approximation and the modeling and the mathematical work that we need to do

503
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
It's at 7

504
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
Really good question

505
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,768
I said what what may be talked about

506
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
High dimensionality

507
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
And this is what happens with the

508
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
A system that we are looking at

509
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,240
Dad's representation of this physical

510
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Systems

511
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Require

512
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,152
Lots of Dimensions lots of variables lots of

513
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Heideman

514
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
And the and the higher the dimensionality the

515
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:49,856
The harder to compute to put into a computer actually run a simulation

516
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
Legos back to how much Computing can we do

517
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,000
And people say we'll know right now we do have

518
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
Extremely good extremely fast

519
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Computing platforms

520
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
And that is true

521
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
And that's why at this point we can do

522
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
Computing physical system that

523
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
20 years ago was no pasa

524
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,896
But the more you do

525
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,480
The higher the demand on viewer analysis tools

526
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
Know about model

527
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,208
So model is a sort of an acronym for models Dynamics and learning

528
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,840
And I would say that the goal of the program is

529
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,936
Extracting mathematical models from Dynamic dataset

530
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,544
The goals of a program when you say dynamic

531
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,152
Dataset something a lot of data Dynamics makes me think of motion or time

532
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
Did I get that right or would you want to ask what I mean by Dynamic data set is a data set that you get from

533
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,880
Dynamical system with your system was Behavior changes

534
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Spectre

535
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:02,048
So you are a dynamic system I mean it's just life is

536
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
The greatest example of a dynamical system

537
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
One of the reasons that I wanted to

538
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
Have this program

539
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,056
Was also again seen that existing tools

540
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
That we have or modeling

541
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
Cannot handle

542
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
Us on the complex dynamical system

543
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
That we need to analyze

544
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,416
You're looking again very similar but we're looking for a sample system such as weather

545
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
In a fluid

546
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,632
Biological systems even Engineers system like communication networks or

547
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Eunos

548
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,984
Human social networks these are all examples of

549
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
Dynamical systems

550
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
But we don't have very good analytical

551
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
Medical models to

552
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
2 Express

553
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,272
The complex behavior of this system

554
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
If you just look at a dataset from

555
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
Something like turbulent flow

556
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
It's fascinating because you CDs

557
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,072
These vortices these holes these Eddie's

558
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
Is beautiful patterns come and go

559
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
Exactly that's the

560
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,568
What's so beautiful about these

561
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Old is different fennel confit

562
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,712
6 phenomena that can be expressed and then you see at these some commonality in

563
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,088
And in this case what we trying to learn is that what are the common patterns that can be learned

564
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
And basically

565
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,464
Express dynamics of these systems

566
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
In terms of evolution of

567
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
Yeah I search

568
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,424
We don't have the mathematical tools yet to deal with the data

569
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,824
Some people say why you no look at us we not only beer at the age of Big Data be also the age of

570
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,944
Machine learning and oldest different ways that we can handle data of any size

571
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,528
But what I'm saying is that

572
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Assisting techniques

573
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,088
Cannot handle

574
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
The fact

575
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
That data is

576
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Dynamic

577
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,792
I know actually now going back and say look

578
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,632
Go back to the beginning of dynamical System Theory

579
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
I'm trying to develop

580
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
Different way of modeling

581
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
Extracting these models from dynamic

582
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,616
Give me one example of a

583
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,456
A phenomenon a system a technology that cannot really be modeled well now

584
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
That if your model program is to

585
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Successful

586
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Wildomar

587
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,512
Alaska performance in model program to start with something that we think we have some grasp of

588
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,912
And use it basic as a test case I'm going back again to the classical problem of basic guitar panel flow

589
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
My Hope Is that

590
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
They can

591
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,288
Plida methodologies

592
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,848
Mathematical methods that day

593
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Developed

594
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,968
Two systems that are much less understood

595
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,552
And their system for example of data did you get for example

596
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
Wolfram neuroscience

597
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
So you're talking about things like

598
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
How brain signals propagator

599
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
How

600
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
Patterns of new Rolex

601
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Tivity associate

602
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
The sensory stimuli

603
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Or the way we move

604
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Absolutely

605
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
It could be

606
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
Data that you can get even from

607
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Social networks and so

608
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Social systems

609
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,336
And basically two systems for which was really

610
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
All right

611
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
You're lacking

612
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Proper

613
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Mac Medical

614
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
Modeling

615
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
Before Time runs out here I I just want to ask

616
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
One question about

617
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,392
Being an applied mathematician at a place

618
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Like DARPA

619
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,024
One of the phrases hero a lot here is the Innovation ecosystem

620
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
And what that means is

621
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,424
It really was referring to what kind of all the players and all the stakeholders that it takes in order to go

622
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
I'm sort of an idea about it

623
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
G2a

624
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Technology that you

625
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
But you haven't had that

626
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,824
What's the operational to the field

627
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
So as an applied

628
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,944
Mathematician what what do you think you can do here that you might not be able to do

629
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,296
I saved our price probably the best place to be

630
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
If you are

631
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,208
Applied mathematician in fact I just say format fewer mathematician and blank to solve a problem

632
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Because

633
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
One of the

634
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
Greatest thing about door prizes dad

635
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
There's this wealth of

636
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168
Information about the

637
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,008
Problems that are important and

638
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
I have to say they're very very cool

639
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
The coolness Factor

640
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,504
4 problems to solve for a mathematician

641
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
Here is enormous

642
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,952
Because you feel that not only your solving a problem that has importance there's certainly broader

643
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,072
Impact as far as universal solvent important problems and National Security

644
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
Videos of feel like the problems are so rich

645
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
That is some ways

646
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
There is some

647
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
There's so much to contribute

648
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
The richness of the problem

649
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
Are just

650
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
Maybe the

651
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
Biggest driver

652
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
A motivating factor

653
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Anybody

654
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,832
Certainty for mathematician and I and I just want to add

655
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
That is that

656
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,464
And I've been saying that to my my

657
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,864
Friends to my colleagues anybody who would listen that why mathematics is actually very important to 2

658
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
DARPA

659
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
And encourage them to come

660
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
Feature program manager is that

661
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
When

662
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
You are encountered by

663
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
Important problems

664
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
And you see that your ideas

665
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,784
The role you have as a mathematician that not only try to look at these

666
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,672
Particular Problems by Detroit to abstract out and coming with different representation that would yield

667
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
A better solution for these problems

668
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
So you basically see

669
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,376
That you ideas are at work I mean what better satisfaction

670
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
Well free busy

671
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
It's been a delight for me to talk

672
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
To you about

673
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
Your Love of mathematics

674
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Coming out to your right now

675
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,920
And to get some sense of how mathematics does

676
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,760
Have that role in in the overall Innovation ecosystem in a particular

677
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
So I just want to thank you for spending this time with us

678
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Thank you Ivan

679
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
And pleasure

680
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,488
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with Reba and I

681
