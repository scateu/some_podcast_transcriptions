00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,272
Our times

3
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,088
Since its founding in 1958 in the middle

00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,976
Has been a driver

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
Welcome to voices from DARPA

Their job

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
To redefine what

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
What is possible

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,752
My name is Ivan Amato and

17

25
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,624
What program managers take some of the deepest dive

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
In the fundamental science

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
In search of New Foundations

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
Four novel technology

29
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Relevant

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,608
Deep dive into fundamental science goes all the way to elect

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
Unusual ways

32
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
They can organized

33
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
Behave in certain materials and how it might be used

34
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
Engineer those

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Electronic organization

36
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
Into new microelectronic

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
And micro magnetic.

38
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
Free applications in memory

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712

Energy conversion

41
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
And sensors

42
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
Prior to arriving at our Bollywood

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,624
The professor of physics at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Burke Virginia

45
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
Before that she was a member

46
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
The physics package

47
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
At the University of

48
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Toledo in

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Ohio

50
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
And yet earlier in her career she was a research scientist

51
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
The Argentine National

52
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Commission

53
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Cmea

54
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
In Buenos Aires

55
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
After finishing her early college training at the University of Buenos Aires

56
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Earned her doctorate in

57
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
In physics from Wayne State University in

58
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
In Detroit Michigan

59
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
And she completed a postdoctoral fellowship

60
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
Ship at the University of Michigan

61
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Thanks for joining me

62
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
I'm happy to be here thank you

63
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
So let's start out by talking about

64
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,232
How you became interested in science in general

65
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
And then particularly

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
In physics and the

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Antics of life

68
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,680
When I guess that you know mean I started being interested

69
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,008
Because my father was right to me articles that he was

70
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
Interested in in a magazine that he was getting delivered at home

71
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
The time you want to start as he was getting

72
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
John's RV

73
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
Which was a French magazine about latest

74
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
Discovery Center of Alamance

75
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
And he was reading this to me when I was like

76
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,904
7 radius also I'm universal very early start so

77
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:41,792
That was the beginning and then we'll clearly I mean in science has always been appealing to me

78
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,936
And I we were getting additional magazines that harm you know that I was very obviously reading on

79
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
I remember reading once about shredding the equation in even though I was like 10 or 11 at the time and I didn't know what he meant

80
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
I knew how to write it down in the deepest parts of the Quan

81
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
Car mechanics in uncertainty makes me think that your parents were

82
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
Scientist or engineer my father was a doctor in engineering

83
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
So

84
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
But yeah

85
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,816
Clearly I mean I was reading in this magazine as I said you didn't understand what equation man

86
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
I was staying

87
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
But I still was able to write it unit 2

88
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,776
If it wish I was able to draw this equation on paper

89
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,408
And it is a Edwin but it's from that era so I mean I was very fascinated by this and clearly well you know

90
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Time went by

91
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,576
It was good in my head that I was going to go for a career in science I didn't know exactly what I say

92
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,232
Shirley Burch Olean Amina became very very interested in the electronic properties of materials

93
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
In my

94
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Interest when

95
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
From their own words

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
To where I am right now

97
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Rights of the first part of your

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Career you

99
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
You ended up going

100
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Academic director

101
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
William & Mary

102
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
Talk to me a little bit about that experience as a professor

103
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
When I'm going to want to hear your

104
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
How did you get to darkest

105
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
So start with a u

106
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
So I mean

107
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
I have been fascinated by the fact that you know mean is not about what we are doing is like you know we're suspicious why

108
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Have to realize that

109
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,791
Our power resides on the fact that we transferred our knowledge

110
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,655
Is not our individual knowledge is Inola from every generation before us

111
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,751
Any disabled Beauty in my mind to pass this along to the Next Generation

112
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
You're part of a continuity

113
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Right

114
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,199
Correct correct so I mean I was interested in in Indiana Professor for that same reason because I wanted to

115
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,063
To be able to you know identifying students that ain't like that capacity

116
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,207
The drive to go for scientific research and try to mend a tendon and in health indeed the best they could be

117
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,559
So that they can do no Advance knowledge in that particular area Evermore

118
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
So that's why I went far

119
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Academia

120
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,239
Of course you know when you're in Academia one of the things you need to do in order to be able to

121
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Duke aerial distance

122
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Trying to train guys do that you have to get funding

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,735
And so clearly I mean I had to Explorer the funding agencies among them is

124
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Starpine I got some fun

125
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
From there by Leon

126
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:16,415
And eventually you want to kind of learn okay what does it take the other side

127
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
Right to understand

128
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,815
How do you know select the best people to do the best work

129
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
How is this process

130
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,679
Being proceeded from the Viewpoint of the founding

131
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Asian

132
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,775
So it was particularly intrigued by DARPA because

133
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,383
I said I was dropping by funded by DARPA in the beginning and so

134
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
This model of trying to find

135
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,855
Basic science that has a goal and ultimate goal was really very appealing to me?

136
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Particular

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
As someone in academe

138
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
You might have gone to National Anthem

139
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
If you might have gotten that

140
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Science found a

141
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
What about

142
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Is there a Disney day

143
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
Question I mean on the one hand you know as

144
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
As an American

145
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Not by

146
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Birth by choice

147
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
You know I have a deep love for this

148
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Country station for this

149
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,991
Country Inn in a sense of Duty regarding you not trying to have this country to continue B

150
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
What it is right now

151
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,671
And the best way in my opinion is to try to see okay what are the needs of the people that are at the Forefront of the car

152
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,511
Defending the country that would be the defendant the Armed Forces in general right

153
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:30,655
Is it what is it is going to make that difference in terms of yuno advances in technology advances in research

154
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
That can top this

155
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
This mission

156
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,567
And clearly they are pies at the Forefront of all of this funding agencies in that particular direction

157
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
So I was very very

158
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,199
Intrigued and curious and interested in being part of

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
Did you reach out LA to DARPA with there's somebody here that new about you what we

160
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
Was the that those sort of

161
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
Final steps

162
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Got you

163
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
Onto the roster programmatic

164
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,679
I had a collaboration with store dwarf who was at a time when I was at William & Mary he was at the University of

165
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
Virginia and he was leaving and Institute in nanotechnology

166
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,127
And an In-N-Out took it upon myself to actually introduce my research to him Detroit

167
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
Static collaborative effort with him

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
And in India

169
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Did happen and we actually got a couple of Russia

170
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,879
Just going inside eventually but of course I knew that he kabina DARPA program manager in the past

171
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,951
So mention to him that that I was in

172
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
Christian like you know seen the other side of the

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Force

174
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
Is so she actually told me what wait on you give me your CV and I will pass it along and then particularly hits

175
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,007
Told me that he was going to show it to Tiffany dumplings

176
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
Which was a tad under the director of ESL

177
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
Meaning offense or defense

178
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,783
I technically correct correct that she got my city and she contacted me.

179
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
To see if I was interested in pursuing a career

180
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,671
So you mentioned Stu wolf and that gives me a little bit of Anna

181
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Excuse tattoo

182
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Maybe diving 2

183
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Your intro

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Press because I in a stool

185
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
He's a big name in the area

186
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,983
Tronix advances to electronics immaterial Sophie talk to me even a little more

187
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
The physicist that you are about this Arena of phenomena that so

188
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
He'll grab you

189
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:21,247
So basically in my make my career in physics here in this country have been focused

190
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,831
If I take orally on spin dependent phenomena

191
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Matthias and magnetic phenomena

192
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
Depended on the spins of particles like electrons

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
In particular

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
Yes that is correct electron

195
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Spencer

196
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,215
Cancel that will during his tenure as a program manager here.

197
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
Stuart actually was defended of

198
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,103
Can chronic in the sentence that he realized there were some discoveries I going to have

199
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
And a diamond

200
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Talking like late 90s

201
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
In particular the giant magnet

202
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Persistence

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Affect which was

204
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
A particularly driving

205
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Before

206
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,879
For the explosion in a hard drive density

207
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
And storage in general that we have eggs

208
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Expensive Alaska

209
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
20 years

210
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
Stop you from I realize we we kind of just passed by the

211
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Business ideas

212
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
Spin dependent the spin of electron

213
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
But there's a difference between

214
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Spin of electron which is a little less familiar

215
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
Charge of electron negative

216
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Chinese people do know about

217
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
Talk to me about the different aspects of

218
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
The electron and where

219
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Dependence is

220
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
I thought you were coming to the door

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,855
Write so the electron spin is a very difficult quantity to Define because it isn't

222
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Daquan

223
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,207
A counterpart In classical world I mean it's a quantum mechanical effect

224
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,607
Instead of trying to Define what spin is one is better suited by defining what is it

225
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
NetSpend.

226
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Athenian General

227
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
You find it the electron

228
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Speed

229
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
That is your

230
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,055
If you think of it as like a little arrow pointing in any given Direct

231
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,895
And what happens is that electron spins like to either parallel to each other on

232
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,319
And in the case of magnetic materials what happens is that the electron spins in different atoms in particular areas of the

233
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Brent Adams

234
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,463
They all like each other there didn't you know very much attracted to one another pointing in the same direction

235
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,815
And in what that gives us an opportunity to give some meaning to this

236
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
Best answer for example you can say okay if I have a group of

237
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
Beans that are all aligned in a given Direction

238
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
I can associate that with say number one

239
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,871
Any they appointed in the opposite direction then I can as a say this would say number 0

240
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,479
And then you have the binary language and you can combine the binary language in more complex

241
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,807
Languages that lead to what we use in Computing

242
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Famous ones and zeros of our digital age

243
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,767
Correct correct so allows you to do this in the advantages of speed

244
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:45,631
In an RR that well you can actually have these composition

245
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,519
Off of Spanish to be made really small which means that you can actually affect a lot of these bits

246
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
Soft ones and zeros

247
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,687
In space as you can enhance the area of density that you can stored of ones and zeros

248
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,503
They happened to be just by the nature of the materials

249
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,087
Protective against radiation damage rain

250
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
And in one of the Holy Grail

251
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Cecil is being

252
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,511
Did you try to find out what is the limit how small can you make

253
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
This little Amanda

254
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Spins

255
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
The store

256
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
Ones and zeros in a stable manner

257
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,751
So focusing on spin

258
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Of the electron rather

259
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Charge of the electron that

260
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,223
Actually have a smaller area of a safe a piece of semiconductor with or Wally's electrons are living

261
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
Small piece of metal that semiconductor will

262
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Host a 1 or 0

263
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Is not just a question of

264
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
Besides butt is so soft energetic

265
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
So mean you know me one of

266
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
The things that matters to you is you know

267
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
How to see how

268
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,679
How much power are you going to be needing in order to have these this configuration of zeros and ones so

269
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
In general you know this is what

270
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
What we found there was several effects

271
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Associated with this activity of the elect

272
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
That enabled

273
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
Technologies

274
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
That will enhance the density without increasing the demands of hardware and making this very stage

275
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Family and also and aggregation

276
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
So that makes

277
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,535
Didn't Tire you know collection of properties that are very very attractive

278
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Not just for storage density seoul car drives but also for name

279
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,007
And that's basically one of their goals. That's been chronic program had the program that's

280
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Stewart actress

281
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
Right and let me bring you back now

282
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
How to another big

283
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Multisyllabic

284
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Phrase that you use earlier with

285
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Giant magnetoresistance

286
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
Reason I'm bringing that up

287
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
What is because

288
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
That phenomenon and the

289
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Technology that

290
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
It led to

291
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,207
Became part of our everyday lives in our hard drives right in the read heads

292
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Of of the hard drives

293
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Tell us a little bit about that technology Evolution and where is it now it happened was that what he was found it was what

294
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
I'd like to the Nobel Prize in 99

295
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,031
98 was dead when you have layer at the systems in which you have

296
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,871
Do magnetic layer separated by what layer that is not magnetic

297
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Anywho

298
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Current through this particular contraption

299
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,087
The resistance of this contraption will be different when the Spencer parallel with respect when they are anti

300
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
So that gives you a mechanism to read

301
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,255
What is going on in Tennessee if it is parallel or antiparallel because you have now

302
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
Resistance to enabled.

303
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
That determination

304
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
And that's how you sense what is in their country

305
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Right

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
So what you're reading the spins whether they're paralyzed or better because they have an effective assistant

307
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Cracked so that is a big Power

308
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
So that was discovered in 1998

309
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
And then later was discovered was that even replaced at the intermediate layer the magnetic

310
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,391
Metallica The Time by an insulating layer

311
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,023
Then you have an effect that is even larger which means that you have MRI enhanced sensitivity what you're doing

312
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
That was a spin dependent magnetic

313
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Aspen Dental Independence

314
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,959
And that led to the explosion in memory in mram

315
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
That we have

316
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
Okay magnetic when

317
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Eighth grade

318
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Yes I almost

319
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Forget that uniform

320
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Cefazolin to fill this

321
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,247
Just like everyday language rather not for everybody understanding science

322
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Is understanding

323
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Acronym that's almost half

324
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,695
The battle has been in the government

325
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
So let's then segue into

326
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
Life is a program manager in an actually do you only

327
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
I've been doing this

328
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
For less than a year so you have a kind of prefer

329
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Perspective

330
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Of an early program

331
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
I think I will be quite interesting

332
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
You already have two programs

333
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Under your way

334
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
Ho switch stands

335
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
Weir program in ultrafast

336
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
Laser science and engineering

337
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Is a program that yuan

338
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
The other one

339
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
The topological X

340
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Cetaceans in electronics

341
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
RTE

342
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
That's a program that you pitched

343
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
Agency leadership and got the green light so congratulations

344
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Map

345
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Let's start by talking about

346
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Pulse-width seems to be

347
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
About your sort of take

348
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
Ability to generate a

349
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Electromagnetic

350
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Radiation

351
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
In ways

352
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Open impassa

353
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
4

354
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
So tell me what your take is on pulse in Wichita

355
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Sherpas

356
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,063
I just I just stated is a program that I inherited the basic tenets of the program is that it was

357
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Do use

358
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
At against undiscovered SF

359
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Be encouraged

360
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
By that community

361
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
Which is related to the

362
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Frequency

363
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Seacomm

364
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
The frequency, something that takes

365
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
Alpena kitchen light

366
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Super 8

367
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Specific frequencies in a broad range

368
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Frequencies

369
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
Can use that for a variety of Apple

370
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,079
Vacation home comes from Rocky cuz if you think of each frequency as a

371
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
Italian

372
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
You got something on somebody looks like the

373
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
The comb you use our address so you can select several

374
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,879
Citi Trends of this frequency domain and Southern Caribbean work that I was

375
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
But secretly into

376
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Twisted indicas

377
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
Dicing with the programs that I am that I develop

378
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,839
People having able to use this technology for example

379
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
To get

380
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
Kind of x-ray

381
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
Behavior let the kind of behavior that you get to the secret

382
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Facility

383
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Big Lots

384
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Facility on a table top

385
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
So that has been fascinating

386
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Having able to

387
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,295
To achieve these by using frequency, I'm saying the Other Extreme of it was also

388
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
That people have been able to probe things

389
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
In the time domain

390
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Widad II

391
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,279
Now that is a really short duration

392
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Right I mean in Arrow II

393
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
10 to the minus 18 sec

394
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
You think of a nanosecond

395
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
9 sec

396
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Billions

397
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Been a second

398
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
1 billions of

399
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Of 1 billion

400
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
One second

401
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Is really really bad

402
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Show that the thing about this

403
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Is Dad

404
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,599
It is going to enable us to actually

405
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Look at the time

406
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Did not Dynamics

407
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
Because those are the only

408
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
The main entities

409
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Isn't that going to be

410
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Moving

411
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
And that

412
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
James said that is where you're going to be using this

413
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,495
So in some ways it's almost like you're trying to create

414
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
A movie

415
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Camera

416
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
That is Matt

417
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,895
Onto the way electrons live in the speedway

418
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
Which is so much faster

419
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,295
I got another lead a human but I'll even the things are

420
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
You're being doing so far because

421
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
Cuz I mean you look at the various ranges in

422
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Which week of the coven looking

423
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Yes we move it song

424
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
It is

425
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Molecules

426
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
To have a way of movie

427
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Wynndata Translate

428
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
They brought that

429
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,703
And then we have seen those because those movements are not at the

430
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
CarMax Laurel

431
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
So we have been able

432
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Want to see some of those

433
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,127
I mean you're getting the capabilities that will enable us

434
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
CSI

435
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
You know I mean the real

436
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
So much smaller

437
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
And move so much

438
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Last episode this is Senor Cabello

439
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,903
That would be achieved by this program and it is due to their apartment this does not exist

440
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,743
So let's stand this one for a second before you move over to

441
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
30 program

442
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:14,143
So did this sounds like very fundamental sign of course that's why it's within DSL the defense Sciences off

443
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
Office among the six technical offices

444
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
But on the other hand we are also in DARPA

445
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
And so tell me a little bit about not only sort of

446
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Weirdest my push

447
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
The envelope in

448
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Fundamental science

449
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,455
Tell them that might actually be of relevance to National

450
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:33,087
Was some of the things that for example these technologies will enable that have been talking to her performances

451
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Pistol for example

452
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Provide Metrology

453
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
For example

454
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
For the math

455
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,351
And they are batteries that are being done at the Nano level formica

456
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,167
Circuits that are used in the Vietnam

457
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,007
Makeup of a number of Driving Systems for Mississauga

458
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
You need

459
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,127
Microprocessors in in in micro Electronics in the number of

460
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
Instruments in

461
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
10 + things that are used

462
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
Dubai the Armed Forces

463
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
So when you reduce the football

464
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Their number two things that came with that

465
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Adamine addition to lower weight

466
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Smaller

467
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:12,767
You make a Chivas so fast faster which also enables you know faster reader

468
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
The transfer of information

469
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
But you also may enable lower power consumption which

470
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Also enables day

471
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
I capability of having this instant

472
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
This

473
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
Gizmos

474
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
Cheap store with less

475
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Boccherini

476
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Show battery source

477
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Have their own

478
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Wage and footprint on the soldiers back

479
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
So I mean all of this

480
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
Is going into the same direction

481
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
And to try to make you know

482
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,647
The possibilities for safe for the soldiers

483
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Doobie

484
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
More efficient than what you have right now

485
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
But less

486
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,815
Bulky and less power-hungry

487
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,119
Sedimentology that this technique will

488
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Enable ghost

489
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
In an indirect action but it goes into that but

490
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,567
White Sand by Metrology we mean serve new ways of measuring

491
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
Very very small

492
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
Crime in as you were speaking it also makes me think that this does put

493
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
Perhaps play into

494
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Future

495
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,647
Of progress in microelectronic Sanders always has been this concern for many many

496
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Some points

497
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
We're not going to be able to use the

498
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
The techniques we use now to make the next smallest transistor

499
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Coming out of pulse that will

500
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,983
Open doors for yet another era of

501
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,823
Of miniaturization or not miniaturization increasing capability

502
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
Current of the translational

503
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
More

504
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
We the same right Mars

505
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
Smart sensitivity for Less power even if

506
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
Advantage

507
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
Which way did you already broad parameter space

508
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,023
Alright so a lot of opportunity there in both fundamental science

509
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Applying at

510
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
To the highest of tech

511
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
So let's not move over to

512
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
Your baby

513
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Are your topological EX

514
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Expectations in electronics

515
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Program

516
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,943
And I know this gets a little bit hairy because we're using words like topological where were you going to take our imaginations down to

517
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
The electronic level

518
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
Talk to me is an undergraduate

519
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Physics in your you're

520
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Introducing some of these ideas

521
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,024
I try in a mean one of the things that I mentioned earlier was that one of the Holy Grails that we have had for the applique

522
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
Station of Spain's

523
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,424
In say storage or memory is how small can you make this collection of

524
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Spins

525
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,080
So they can keep their information is all aligned meaning one or auraline meaning of zero

526
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,432
Without being disturbed by perturbations because in the end it's always an energetic

527
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
Consideration of your

528
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,576
Temperature fluctuations are more energetic than the energy that is contained in this

529
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Group of LA

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Calculator

531
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
Then they're not going to win and then you lose information is like I like to say my student you think your laptop to Miami and there goes all day

532
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
Information that you started that wouldn't be fun

533
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
So you need something better than that

534
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
And so

535
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
I haven't put him in the literature and turns out you know that I we have in you to our

536
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,616
Our disposal for for provi new paradigm

537
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Annies with apology

538
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,248
Which is again something that has to do with a bit

539
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
Day of orientation or configuration

540
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,392
Pieology comes out of really though.

541
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
Realm of

542
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Geometry

543
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Like in any way

544
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
Yes it has to do with something that has to do with a special

545
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Configuration

546
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
So in this particular case should we go to the heart of the matter I mean I told you that spins like to be parted on Type R

547
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,080
But he done said that is an eternity past

548
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Fidelity designs

549
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Covered entities that are ways in which

550
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Engineer

551
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
For them to be content

552
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
That is making some angle between

553
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,856
Now you lock them into discounting and you try to put them on a surface

554
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:55,488
You realize and now they have to arrange inside themselves in such a fashion that they can accommodate accounting

555
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,072
And when you try to do this exercise you could take like two little bit

556
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,912
One upon several of them on a surface

557
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
They have to be arranged in kind of a vortex

558
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
Little Things

559
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,848
Aspire Ollin tornado correct

560
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,664
Something like that so that you can put them there right on the surface

561
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
And that is what we call

562
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Right

563
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
Ayr this interesting

564
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
Well because now because they have counted

565
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
If you want to switch them off

566
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Pointing in One Direction

567
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Centerpoint India

568
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,464
You have to do this within Tire stent a lot

569
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
And just just for clarity when you say the word

570
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Canting with you letter

571
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
BB spinzar

572
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
Tempted

573
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
Means it or not

574
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,192
Parallel or antiparallel but they're actually at a certain kind of angle almost like a

575
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Correct

576
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Correct correct

577
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Is now because you're locked into this

578
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Buy some milk

579
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
You just cannot

580
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Switch one with us

581
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
Switching data so you have to switch the entire thing

582
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
Because you have to switch the entire thing

583
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
That cost you more energy than it will be

584
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Doing Jazzy individual

585
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,952
Rights to the major internal structure more stable

586
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,304
. of of thermal energy a little heat snack is not enough to flip it correct

587
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,888
So they become stable correct that is what the topology offers

588
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Eye protection

589
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,312
So that if you can like engineer this in a suitable ways such that we can create the region of Spain

590
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,640
Candace configuration smaller than what we have right now

591
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
For collecting the ones and zeros

592
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
Then you are in the next generation of memory device

593
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
This is a Google based

594
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Step on this.

595
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,416
And I would push it that mean and there are some

596
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:34,304
Matrix itellas where can we go what will we are cheating by doing that and he's not just

597
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
Size as I said earlier they supposed to question about energetic

598
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
How much energy do we need to do this

599
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,336
Can you move them around can you actually do things with them so you can open up several paradigms to use this and today's

600
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,128
For memory loss record

601
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Sandra Bullock

602
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Stations beyond what we can do

603
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
I guess right now

604
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,064
Okay and does this still fall within the the tradition of spintronics and

605
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
Insta will Forsythia is this

606
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,952
It in some other Arena

607
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:07,328
In in spirit right but it's it has the saddest thing which is a topological

608
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Action Auto Parts

609
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Topological

610
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
That's a new thing

611
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
And that is what what this can take

612
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
Let's talk about where your program is inside

613
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
General

614
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
Life cycle of a program here at DARPA so

615
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
You came in here you came up with this

616
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Wonderful idea

617
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
You went through the harrowing experience of bringing it to what's called Tech Council

618
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
Eyewear leadership in your

619
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
Program manager

620
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
Others are there

621
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Wedding it

622
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,488
So you made it past all of all of those obstacles

623
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Now what

624
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
Right now we have fast

625
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:45,728
Selection show a broken announcement was placed publicly so that people could apply

626
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
And you know send me the proposals that

627
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,616
Proposals were evaluated by teams effects

628
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Birds

629
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,456
And then the stations were made in terms of

630
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
For the most

631
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,344
Qualified by Source selection is that those who

632
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,464
Can make it past obstacles become a source as it were we told them performers

633
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Correct so right now that is De state

634
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,424
And so what we have going on right now will be you know the Contracting part of it so is that when the money is

635
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Actually being delivered to the

636
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Performers and so

637
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,104
We think that we will have the kickoff meeting sometime early in 2018

638
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,456
And shortly after we leave a review time right I mean they have to perform because that's

639
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
The difference between DARPA and other agencies

640
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
She's as well is that there are very strong Matrix at

641
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
5

642
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
You know that the continue with it

643
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,256
This reminds me a little bit of some of the early days

644
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
Here at DARPA where

645
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
Well there was a funding

646
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Laboratory

647
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
Reason and these became kind of

648
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
The seeds

649
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
What later became known as Material Science and Engineering

650
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
DARPA had a roll there and

651
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
At least nurturing

652
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,944
What had was on its way to becoming a

653
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Harley new

654
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Field Material Science is this

655
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
This

656
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,344
Ascend to that kind of possibility we're

657
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
Because you're not

658
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Ideas for organizing groups

659
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Potential performers

660
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
You think this is going to be important for

661
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Restarting a new field

662
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,376
It is particularly important to concentrate the Air Force

663
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
Experts say that maybe working on various other areas are man Ali related to one another but to console

664
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
Braden focus them on this

665
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Specific problem with this

666
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
Specific metrics

667
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
And that may lead to advances in this particular terrain of which we are not even breathing because we don't know what they are going to discover

668
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
I mean we are thinking that one application will be

669
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
These new generation memory that we all are needing and wanted

670
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
What happened

671
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:48,608
But it so happens in this is being experienced that you know prior people including still has mentioned this to me

672
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
That often times what happens is it

673
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
Christopher former discover things that you didn't answer

674
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Dissipate

675
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
In the girls room can go in at 8

676
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,592
Direction weekend and start a new program you just don't know

677
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,456
So that's basically what my hope is that because this is basic

678
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
There is always the possibility

679
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Kathy Cruz

680
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
Groups of people

681
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,368
To discover something completely non and

682
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
That will know our minds away

683
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Well

684
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Well made that happen

685
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
That sounds really

686
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:22,400
Exciting possibility in some ways I wonder if at a place like darkover

687
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Are there such a diversity

688
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Skill set

689
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
Whether there is even more of an opportunity

690
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
To recognize when release

691
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Surprising things

692
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Maybe I-85 / 2

693
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Formas no question here

694
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,040
Now that you're here you kind of are dropped in from academe

695
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
Your ear in the defense Sciences office

696
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
Have you met

697
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Other

698
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
Programmatic

699
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
Pictures of run into other programs

700
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
Mom said that in a sense

701
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,072
Blow your mind and that are you are now beginning to think of

702
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
How they relate to your own

703
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
I'm definitely looking

704
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
Is particularly for the empty or the

705
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
The Microsystems

706
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,872
That is correct because these are the guys that will be perhaps

707
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,272
The ones I may take on whatever developments come from there so because they are the ones that are going to try to make

708
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Actual device

709
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,832
Just out of this if they turn out.

710
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
To living up to

711
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
The problem is that we

712
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
So yes

713
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
Interesting Synergy there where you might

714
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
You might be on there

715
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
Really fundamental side of things

716
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
MTI Microsystems technology office

717
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,192
Even though still fundamental in an engineering side could take it

718
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
The next step toward what ultimately would be

719
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
The finish line and of course

720
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,080
This is the way DARPA works that would probably be

721
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,128
Out in industry or some

722
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,200
A part of the military service

723
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:44,576
But the result is an expected because in the sensor technology you don't know this may take you to some biology

724
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:49,184
Related sensors are we're not even thinking on right now I mean it has happened a lot

725
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,768
In in particularly in recent times at the lot of the discoveries.

726
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
Copying. Like for example taking the

727
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:00,448
In the area of nanotechnology I mean people were working with nanoparticles for the number to physical applications in the

728
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,288
And then the biology STAAR test thinking how about using them as markers

729
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,664
Four biological process

730
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,784
Viruses are things that are much smaller than cells more around you can smell

731
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,904
Opportunity

732
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
And we would have

733
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
You know we will see the performers get there

734
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,096
And then you know if there is such an opportunity will it really extraordinary

735
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
And make the

736
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
People from BtoB

737
