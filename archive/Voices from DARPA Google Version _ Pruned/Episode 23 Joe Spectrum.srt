Thank you

72
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,352
Before we talk about some of the programs we run

73
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
With names like

74
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144

Cher

84
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
I would like to

85
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Know something

86
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
About where you're into

87
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
How did you get into

88
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Twisted Insane

89
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Science

90
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
Engineering and the elect

91
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
True magnetic Spectrum which as I look

92
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Folio seems to be

93
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
Lancaster may be hereditary

94
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Grandfathers were electrical in

95
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Auctioneers

96
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
As my father

97
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
Were involved in various things my

98
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
Grandfather my mother's side was involved in

99
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Electrical engineering for

100
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Public projects ladavian

101
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Yo

102
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,112
To work for three-letter agencies back when you couldn't say the names of those agencies

103
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,464
And

104
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,352
And and then on my father's side is involved in early broadcast

105
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Sing back in the nineteen

106
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
20s

107
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
What is Radio is

108
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
Is really new and becoming a

109
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
Exactly and so many others been the sloth long-standing interest in radio

110
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
Engineering spectrum and then Yellow fast forward to another hose

111
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
Is a kid today

112
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Exposed

113
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,184
Science fiction Star Trek and things like that in the 1960s I remember asking my father

114
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,536
Yeah could we make a something like the communicator in the garage and you know

115
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
No well no that's like

116
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,448
Too far out there you can't get the components a little balls of the tour that small and then

117
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,312
Fast forward to the 1990s and suddenly have a flip phone that looks like a

118
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Star Trek Communicator

119
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,944
Yeah I think I've had this long-standing interest in those types of Wireless

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Lowes Topix

121
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,832
And it's been wonderful to watch through my career highlights

122
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
Technologies really evolved the point

123
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
You can do some of the

124
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
It seems like

125
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
That were science fiction

126
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Even

127
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Kids you were really a

128
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Knowing about Ray

129
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Hearing it used

130
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
But knowing

131
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
Something about it

132
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Everyone at 1

133
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
So what I would love for you to do

134
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Talk a little bit

135
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Spectrum I've always found it

136
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
To be a kind of miraculous thing

137
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Spider-Man

138
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
It's invisible

139
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,575
We have no sense of it directly bodily

140
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
And yet we can

141
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
User cell

142
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Turn the radio on

143
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
All of the stuff

144
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Is going on now

145
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
So when you think of you

146
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Is in your mind

147
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
I think of it really as a as a

148
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,727
The shared resource like the air if you might want for that

149
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
That way they have the ability to

150
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
Communicate through this medium

151
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
Obviously there's a lot of technology behind the

152
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,807
How you didn't build RF devices and Enzo for radiofrequency devices

153
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:17,695
Really in the end it's a it's a shared resource that we can use

154
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,327
For various things like Communications radio for sensing radars

155
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
On those tight types

156
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,447
Two things and it's something that I think as

157
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,055
The technology Sioux Falls we can be more sophisticated about how we use that that share

158
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Resource

159
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
All of Me

160
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
The RF Spectrum

161
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
I will

162
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
Say it is pretty ethereal but it is one of those things that you have you you kind of have to

163
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,647
To visualize how the sharing is going on in this multidimensional space

164
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
In order to make you so that more more

165
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Smartly

166
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Watch the kingsman good excuse to

167
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
To to start in on

168
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Some of your program

169
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Including one

170
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Program because in some ways

171
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
The technology you seek

172
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
There

173
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Is trying to make

174
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
The invisible

175
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Visible train

176
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
How to make

177
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
What's going on in the elect

178
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Acro magnetics

179
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Visible so can you talk to me a little bit about

180
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
This program which

181
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Is that the tail end right in transitioning

182
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
The Marine Corps

183
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
That's so

184
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
This isn't a nice example where you can sort of talk about the original

185
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Idea of it

186
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
It's status now when

187
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Advanced RF

188
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
Nothing is really known by the

189
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,751
Name radio app that's it slid the shorthand we use for that program until the radium at program

190
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Is really trying to provide that basic Spectrum situational awareness what's happening in the Spectrum

191
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,247
As you say it's lit its invisible unless we make it visible through

192
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Computer visualization

193
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Olson so

194
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
I'm it's a mix of

195
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,183
Sensing what's a out there so turning existing

196
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Radios things like that into RF sensor so you can see what's actually see what's going

197
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Only one in the Spectrum you can sample

198
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
What's going on in the Spectrum

199
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,495
You bring that back over tactical networks in our case

200
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
Is that the Marine Corps

201
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,615
But you bring those back to essentially

202
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
PC think of a laugh

203
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
And you run some algorithms on it and generate a visualization of what's happening in the in the

204
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
The Spectrum at any given area

205
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
In any given area and so if you may have

206
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
Military units operating in a particular area they

207
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,559
Generally many of those Marines Are Soldiers

208
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Have radios

209
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,679
You use those radios as your sensors you bring back

210
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
Yeah all the measurements you can from that area

211
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,591
To that location where you can run the algorithms and generate

212
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,455
What looks like a heat map of colored visualization of what's Happening

213
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,271
In that geographic area in the Spectrum

214
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,415
The map shows you how much energy is there by the color of the of the map kind of the way that you do

215
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Signals are different

216
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
Tell how strong the signals are if you think of like the weather radar that you see you know on the evening news

217
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,959
On that type of visualization is the way you used to look at the Spectrum

218
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
And you can see here what essentially what's

219
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
Radiating hot

220
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
In your area

221
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,407
And that may be of interest you may be curious about what that is

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,039
I'm so we can't we have a display that shows Seattle kind of here's what's happening over all the Spectrum

223
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
And then we have a display that shows you okay at this particular frequency at this particular part of the spectrum

224
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Say the frequencies where the Wi-Fi networks are

225
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
You can see where the hotspot

226
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,655
You can see how they are radiating away from there

227
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
There they say

228
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Situational

229
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Ernest Rady

230
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
I can look around in

231
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
And see if there

232
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Maybe their adversaries like

233
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
At military assets

234
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
We have an adversary's might have

235
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
This is has always been sort of more of a

236
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Invisible sort of

237
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
A set of phenomena

238
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
As a war fighter if I know this

239
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Now

240
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Muhammad Ali

241
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
Says I was a war fighter it's it's very valuable because you can start to identify maybe signals that you did not expect to be

242
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
They are so a particular example that we have from some Marine Corps exercises was a lance

243
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:19,103
Scorpio was simply really that they playing with the radio map display

244
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
And I saw something that was unusual and it turned out to be the sniper team that was out there hiding and not visit

245
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,647
Otherwise other than there are at Spectrum emissions us are using there their radios

246
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,255
So they're things like that that that allow you to identify what's happening

247
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
I'm in the Spectrum and then you can decide if that's militarily important or or not you may decide

248
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
Well that's an odd signal maybe I should send somebody over to take a look

249
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Things like things like that

250
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Are possible course of action that you're

251
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,639
You're presented once you can finally see what's happening in the

252
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Nerf

253
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
Sucker right in the radio map is getting to what we

254
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Think of you

255
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
As one of the best finish line

256
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Technology development

257
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Graham can get to it

258
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Which is to say

259
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
You're going to hand this off

260
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
In this case right side

261
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,999
To the Marine Corps what are the next steps for that tab

262
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
What we're doing with the the Marine Corps is working with them on

263
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Some of these various exercises and and

264
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Experiments in

265
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
In parallel the Marine Corps has been very

266
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
Forward-leaning in Spectrum operations

267
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
Um Spectrum operation

268
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,663
Since they have been adding it to their Doctrine

269
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,015
They have been looking at techniques procedures

270
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,111
How they might use the electromagnetic spectrum in a war fighting sense

271
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
And so they've been for leading on Helen

272
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,255
Some of these ideas of if they have the technology

273
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,631
And so what we're doing dark has developed the technology and we are transitioning it

274
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
To the Marines where they can then start to use it

275
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,823
I'm in in exercises first and then in the in the forces we roll forward so

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,407
They have you know identify this is a key technology

277
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,247
That will be inserted as they roll forward in there

278
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Budget planning and their program

279
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
Let's let's talk about another program that is when not as far along

280
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
About to be

281
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Detransition

282
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,279
Yet this one goes by and acronym Spark

283
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
There's two s's in the front of that essay

284
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Sparcc

285
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
That stands for shared Spectrum access for radar

286
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
And communication

287
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,335
This does relate to what we were just talking about specially in the sense of

288
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Where where are they

289
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
There's a very busy

290
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Electromatic magnetic Spectrum which

291
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
How to say where

292
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Kinds of

293
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
People and devices 1

294
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
Kind of have access to that

295
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,695
So there you are exploring something called Spectrum sharing maybe we can just

296
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Talk about that

297
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Concept

298
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Becoming ever more

299
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
Important sure so one of the issues with the spectrum is that it is very heavily used

300
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,775
You can just think of you were cellular your cell phones they are

301
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
Using more and more of the spectrum there's Wi-Fi your millions and millions and millions

302
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
4 Dirhams water Wi-Fi and sell cell phones

303
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Pretty sure it is

304
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,855
Answer there are there there's is heavy use of the RF Spectrum

305
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
That is a new modern phenomenon

306
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
If you look back in the

307
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,559
Yam 1960 70s even the 80s

308
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,911
Most of the RF Spectrum use tended to be governmental and Military

309
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,007
And so the the Advent of cell phones and then

310
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Laptops and

311
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
IPads and so forth with wifi-connected refrigerators all of that has started to

312
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Did you really be the dominant use of the of the Spectrum which means that the military has to

313
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,183
Adapt to having less and less freedom to to move in that spec

314
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,303
And so one of the things that we're doing in the spark program is looking this idea of sharing

315
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,423
Between Communications tactical Communications and even maybe commercial Communications

316
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
And Military radar

317
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
We have looked at the

318
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Ladies Radars and how they might interact

319
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
With reuse the same Spectrum

320
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,479
As LTE cell phones and in some Spectrum bands

321
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,111
And all we've also looked at how military systems can share with military sis

322
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,975
So for example we've done some things that I have transition to the Army

323
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,071
Where they're developing a radar that will use the radar

324
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Free communications with other radar sites

325
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,727
Oh and so there's that to get improve radar overall system

326
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
It's other things like that were that's smarter use of the

327
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
The Spectrum

328
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
Enables the military to use less

329
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,503
And the commercial world has this constant pressure that it needs more spectrum because of

330
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
Used by individuals and

331
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
The individual consumer

332
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
What in this this sounds like it relate

333
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Its 2

334
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Awesome work

335
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,047
That colleagues in the Microsystems technology office

336
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,399
Are working on I'm referring here to the Spectrum collaboration show

337
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Which also

338
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
Is really all about trying to bring this whole idea

339
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Spectrum

340
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,103
Sharing almost like a new ethicon how to use and think about the Spectrum

341
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Into a material ey

342
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
White contacts

343
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
You know where where you been

344
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
The radios

345
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
We'll have to get smarter

346
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
And I know what's going on

347
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,159
Absolutely going back a little bit in my personal history

348
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
In 2003-2005 I was a

349
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Program manager over at the national

350
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Science found

351
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,423
And one of the things that I started today or was program looking at

352
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Taking smart radios and doing dynamic

353
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Access

354
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,895
Listen to might not have heard that term before smart radio can you just

355
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,247
Usher for so so smart radios really a software-defined

356
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
Radio in the sense of the radio

357
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Characteristics it

358
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
The frequencies that uses the

359
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,999
Types of waveforms that sends over the electromagnetic spectrum

360
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,095
Those are all the find my scroll saw for familiar

361
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Am and

362
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,263
Amplitude modulation frequency modulation at the at the lowest level Defenders

363
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Yeah you can think of Wi-Fi

364
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
Why is being a have having it at

365
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Subway for mother

366
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
All of these

367
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
Different types of waveforms

368
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Canby

369
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
Basically implemented using software these days

370
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
Because of the the vast increase in

371
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
Computing power available

372
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
As well as improvements

373
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
The RF device

374
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,023
Radios capable of doing

375
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Exactly

376
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
And those capabilities are getting smarter and smarter more and more

377
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
Capability is being jammed into

378
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,543
You know it's smaller and smaller handset

379
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
Yeah I'd like your cell phone

380
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Tactical radios

381
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
In the military

382
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:52,319
So when I was at the National Science Foundation at NSF started this program on dynamically accessing this

383
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Spectrum

384
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
That is using different frequency bands

385
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
2

386
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
They are essentially

387
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,767
Share the Spectrum were more intelligent

388
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
That was

389
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Academic work

390
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,447
A lot of that work has matured to the point where that starting to show up in

391
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,519
I'm chips and systems that can be used

392
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,103
Throughout both the commercial world as well as the military world

393
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
MTO with a Michael

394
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
Patron XO technology offices helping to

395
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
To move that

396
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Wave of Technology forward

397
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
By making better

398
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
Devices and creating

399
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Better techniques

400
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Through things like the Spectre

401
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Challenge

402
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Me to wear

403
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
They're looking at different

404
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Techniques for sharing

405
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
There's definitely been a a movement throughout

406
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Academia industry

407
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
To try to make the the

408
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Spectrum access

409
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Play smarter

410
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
And then we traditionally.

411
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
On the traditional way of accessing the Spectrum were

412
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Has been

413
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,015
The traditional bureaucratic top down

414
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Types of ways of managing

415
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
The Spectrum the FCC

416
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,903
Normally would say you get to use

417
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
This

418
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Frequency

419
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
This time

420
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
Under these conditions

421
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
And what we're talking is making this

422
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Is Almar

423
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Fluid solo

424
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
My all of these connected

425
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
Devices

426
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
Can can figure out how to

427
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Make best use

428
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,519
Of this incredible resource

429
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Absolutely

430
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
Play in both the FCC and on the government side there's

431
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
The ntia Nash

432
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Haitian

433
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Information Age

434
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
AR

435
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Looking at

436
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
These new technologies as

437
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Kind of the way you feel * of the

438
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,231
We're hoping that some of these technologies that darpa's developing

439
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Will

440
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Make their job easier

441
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Basically

442
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
In the future on the policy

443
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
Okay so let's just touch on one other

444
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
Rub your program since I know that some of your program

445
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Program Center on

446
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
Innovative ways of ensuring access in a whenever a

447
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
And wherever

448
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Oppressive in use

449
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Drones

450
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Attwifi

451
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Routers

452
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
That sort of thing

453
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
Program I want to talk to you back here though is

454
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Called geospatial

455
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Cloud

456
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Analytics

457
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
By doing a lot more with satellite data than it has

458
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Has been

459
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Done before

460
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Things like using database

461
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Geospatial

462
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Characteristics

463
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,447
Crops in distress and may be using that to the dated

464
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,775
Predict things like security relevant

465
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
What phenomena like social

466
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
Unrest that's

467
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
So

468
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Talk to me about

469
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Tell me what kind of

470
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
Data is available that you're hoping to

471
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
Accessing new ways and then how that might be valuable

472
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Some of the Genesis of this idea really.

473
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Major General

474
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Was the

475
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
Vast amount of new geospatial data that

476
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
Being created from commercial source

477
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
I'm so traditionally the

478
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,471
Satellite imagery marketplace with government

479
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
Special government satellites taking

480
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,407
Pictures for either military use or for

481
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Things like

482
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Agricultural products

483
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Things like that

484
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Lamps at 4 Mass

485
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Some of those

486
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
That's radically changed

487
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Beers with the

488
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Launching of

489
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
How many new

490
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
Commercial satellite some are already launched summer

491
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
I'm in various ages of

492
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Deployment

493
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
And

494
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,727
What that's providing is much more data on a

495
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
A daily basis

496
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
One of those

497
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Ways I like that

498
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Describe this is

499
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,199
Yeah back when darker was found it a comeback in 1958 and it was really founded in response to Sputnik

500
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Being launched

501
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
And

502
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
Some level of panaca in the populist valteau

503
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:42,463
Well the Soviets can see what I'm doing all the time they're flying over with the satellite and

504
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
And they can see me in my backyard

505
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
Well what's interesting now is we're finally getting to a point where there are enough commercial satellites up there

506
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,239
That they are really are going over every day

507
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
And imaging everywhere

508
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,663
And it's one of those things that was unexpected I think

509
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
From a

510
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
Governmental side

511
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
What the impact of that could be the the vast amount of new and useful data

512
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
That might come from the commercial side

513
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:19,327
So then this is pictures yo data as they they say like it Optical is a second

514
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
In The Biz it can be other things are there are satellite constellations that are collecting RF data is

515
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
They they fly ever

516
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Other

517
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
Satellite constellations that are doing radar image

518
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
As well

519
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:37,503
Combine all of these are Avast new data source to understand what's happening in

520
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
In the world

521
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
It is so much data however

522
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
That people can't keep up

523
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,999
It is a firehose of data to an extent that never been been really seen before

524
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,071
People talk about Big Data this is

525
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Bigger than big

526
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Data

527
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,447
I'm just in terms of the amount of data that's being collected from the satellite

528
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,287
So people can't keep up I can't look at all this data

529
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,359
So then you have to do automated processing

530
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Machine learning types of

531
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
Show the algorithm so you really have to set up the

532
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
The pipeline's of

533
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
Processing

534
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,575
To get useful information out

535
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
Out of all that data

536
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
And

537
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,464
What we're trying to do in the gestational Cloud analytics program

538
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
Is make use of all that data to set up

539
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
The architectures to do that and then setup

540
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
CenturyLink business model so that

541
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:30,496
DOD customers can get that information rather than just the data

542
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
I'm in a in a sensible way so

543
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:38,432
The geospatial part of the GCA of the geospatial cloud analytics program

544
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,320
Geospatial part is all the new satellite constellations all that new geospatial data

545
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,648
There is the cloud part which is well you need

546
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,696
You put it in the Computing clouds the

547
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,328
Yeah I hear about Google cloud and Amazon web services those

548
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,216
So becomes widely accessible and then also can be processed at high speeds

549
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
In those Cloud resource

550
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
So you can

551
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
Actually

552
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,384
Crunch through all that data in the cloud

553
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
In order to produce a result at the back that then a Warfighter

554
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
We're kind of where the analytics come in

555
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
So I imagine that the ideas

556
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
Reply on Linux and various kinds of models where you

557
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Triton lconnect

558
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Redis raw data

559
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,328
The things that are even more interesting than raw data which is

560
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
What it might mean

561
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
To the conditions of crops and how

562
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
That can lead to

563
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
Food security or insecurity and then

564
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Groups of people are behaving

565
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:44,992
Exactly so it's so for example one of the thrust we have is looking at Food security

566
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
And understanding what is happening in particular regions of the world in terms of how the wheat crop is devel

567
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Doll thing over over the year

568
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,792
And a circle using these new data sources that are so much

569
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Phresher

570
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,168
Then it ever was before using that new fresh state-of-the comes in

571
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Daily your

572
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
Maybe weekly in some cases but

573
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Much more frequently than in the past

574
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Using that

575
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
2 then

576
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,432
Crunchbase analytics algorithms that predict

577
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:20,320
You know that this crop is going to do well this year or this crop of wheat is is going to be poor

578
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
In this part of the world

579
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
And what we

580
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,208
Seen over even the past few years is

581
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,792
That crop failures can lead to social instability

582
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,888
The Arab Spring excited as one of those examples where that was kind of the spark

583
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
That led to the Arab Spring

584
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,336
And so if we get our a little bit of more advanced warning maybe we can improve stability

585
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,640
Why you no identifying

586
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
That there may be a need for

587
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:52,320
Going to a particular parts of the world or at least EOD can position itself so that it's not a

588
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
A surprise

589
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
So that's one of the challenge problems

590
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
What's in the geospatial and

591
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,024
Another one of our problem areas we've been looking at is

592
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Illegal fishing

593
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,656
There's a real problem in certain parts of the world with illegal in the unlicensed

594
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Fishing

595
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,824
And there's also nongovernmental organizations looking at this problem as well but we're using that

596
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,664
As a way to try to identify when

597
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
Vessels Maybe

598
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Showing out the in particular

599
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,552
Territorial Waters where their unwanted

600
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:30,208
So we're trying to use the program to explore that space and really push the low

601
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
Limit of what you can get from this

602
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
Geospatial commercial GSP

603
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Right now I don't

604
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,168
Usually think of the defense department is as policing unit

605
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
Fishing practices around the world so can you just

606
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,568
Explain a little bit about how that connects to what might be a DARPA and DOD interest

607
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,432
Sure and Enzo in the in the case of illegal fishing it is a also a good

608
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
Proxy problem for General

609
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:59,136
Maritime situational awareness types of a problem so you know the Navy may desire assistant

610
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,536
Understanding of what vessels are in a particular area and kind of large-scale

611
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
I want to know where

612
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
We are all of the

613
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,424
Traffic is in the Pacific

614
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,800
And so these new commercial data sources are providing a way to

615
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
Ring together

616
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
Satellite imagery

617
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
Radar satellite data

618
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,016
Things such as a is which is one of the beacons

619
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
On

620
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Commercial vessels that say I'm here in this is who I am

621
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,976
There are various things like that they can poop be brought together

622
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,584
Just to improve overall the understanding of what's Happening

623
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,936
In the maritime just last night I was looking at

624
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
Add a website that tries to track

625
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
As many of the aircraft that are in the air at any one time and uses something much like an assist

626
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
One of those Beacon

627
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,016
And here I am systems I was amazed to learn that at the moment I was looking at this

628
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,600
Realtime website that they were 14000 aircraft

629
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
In the air

630
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,976
At at that moment so so this in some ways is a little bit related more than

631
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,560
Kind of contact exactly Enzo in the maritime contact

632
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
What's the trick is

633
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:17,728
That if a vessel doesn't want to be seen it will turn off it say I have speak and

634
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,544
And so then you're interested in using some of those other

635
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,152
Data sources from the the satellite data and so forth to understand

636
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,552
Yeah well there really is a vessel there it just turned off its Beacon right now

637
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Doesn't mean that you

638
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
Exactly

639
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
Okay so

640
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,232
We're kind of getting toward the end of our discussion here but I

641
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:44,096
Because you are someone who is experienced in Academia of experience

642
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,912
In the government that NSF before

643
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Coming here

644
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,264
If you have experience in

645
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
The private sector

646
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,128
You're somebody else a kind of interesting view on the overall

647
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
Innovation ecosystem and symbol

648
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
Now that you're here at DARPA

649
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,808
I'm just wondering what you know what you are discovering about

650
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Where a place like this

651
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Fits into that overall

652
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Innovation

653
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,280
Obviously DARPA has been on the Leading Edge of of Technology

654
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Before

655
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Decade

656
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Certainly I've been

657
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:22,240
Working on and around the internet for most of my career and DARPA

658
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
Was that out there first in terms of networking

659
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
Tat technology

660
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
So it's both LED the way and opened the doors for four things happening in the commercial

661
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
A world

662
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,088
And I mentioned yeah the Spectrum sharing work well

663
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
The same time as

664
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,416
I was at NSF working on on that

665
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:45,024
Throws another program manager over here at DARPA working on similar issues and we

666
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
They would work together

667
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
The moves that that technology forward so

668
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
It's it's always been on the Leading Edge

669
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:56,032
One of the interesting things to me coming to to DARPA has been really the opportunity

670
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
You understand

671
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,872
Even more death than I thought I had

672
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
The specific needs

673
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
For the millet

674
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:09,600
Been very eye-opening what you know what problems there are that need to be solved and

675
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
One of the things that's been

676
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,720
Phone is putting together programs the kind of address those

677
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Their specific needs

678
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
It's so dark of both those are the kind of

679
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,216
Move the technology forward but the other part that's been very interesting to me is

680
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,104
That doctor really I believe is the key agency in terms of military innovation

681
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
For the Warfighter

682
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
The

683
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Opportunities to

684
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
Think about

685
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
The

686
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,040
Kind of big problems

687
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
Facing

688
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
The department of

689
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Defense facing the military

690
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
As we move forward I'm not sure where else

691
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,512
You do that other than a place like Garba

692
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,120
Are in addition to your work as a program manager as a

693
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Professor

694
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
The University of Kansas

695
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
I mentioned

696
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
The introduction of these other

697
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Experiences

698
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Pilot

699
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,336
I saw a picture of you

700
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,176
Look like you were skipping Abode and actually pretty scary

701
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,528
Conditions would like to me you think these kinds of Interest

702
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
I have some kind of

703
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
Influence in the way you

704
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,624
Think about you

705
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
Electrical engineering

706
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
In about how you do

707
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Do your program manager

708
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
I do think that one of the

709
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:26,144
Things that has been helpful from those experiences coming to a place like

710
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
Like DARPA is that the opportunities offered to a program manager are very much like skippering a boat oar

711
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,360
Flying an airplane in the sense that you have great

712
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
Freedom to do

713
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:42,528
What what you want you operate within the limits of the technology whether it's the airplane or the

714
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,368
For the sailboat but you upgrade freedom to kind of set you work

715
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
And I really do think

716
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
But that's

717
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
Yeah wonderful

718
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Opportunity work

719
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
Since you've been here in Washington have you been able

720
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
Get get into a plate and

721
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
Wise Guys

722
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,288
Around here not so much with all the restricted airspace around here is this is probably the

723
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
The single most challenging place in the

724
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,384
In the in the country to

725
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Can't go for

726
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Fun pleasure flight

727
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,624
Russell near a lot of water and we're nearly Lauder I've done a little bit better on that and doog occasionally get a chance to go

728
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Gosick

729
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,024
And I'm happy to hear it there is one biographic detail that I find particularly amusing I mention

730
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
Literally right before when you were student Princeton

731
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
Yuan somebody's were in a band called Nasty

732
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
Short which you know is I

733
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Saxifrage

734
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Tom Hobbs

735
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,872
One of the less optimistic or pessimistic views on life

736
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Century thinker

737
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
So

738
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
This does not represent you if you want

739
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:50,112
Absolutely absolutely not pretty

740
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
Maybe it was more describe grad school then

741
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
The wonderfully Fun Band

742
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
List of characters from the air

743
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,424
Ended up his

744
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
University

745
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,288
The president of a university Provost and I think they're

746
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
Senior technology

747
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,408
Cheerleader at a place that does business with DARPA so I won't mention it but

748
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,760
DARPA program manager

749
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:22,624
We are really you know just a few minutes left is there anything

750
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
About

751
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Technology

752
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
General about

753
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
DARPA

754
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
About your programs that did not

755
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,864
Come up during our discussion that you think would be of interest to Arla

756
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
Just a general thought

757
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
And that is

758
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
One of the other things

759
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
It's really been one

760
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Careful about being

761
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Starbucks

762
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
DN

763
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
I'm seeing the

764
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
New idea

765
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
Folks in the in the Sciences

766
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Technology industry

767
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,552
Are working on an end bring in and dust

768
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Discuss with

769
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,904
Hey a broad Vision that that you

770
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,488
Don't really get in a lot of other

771
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Parts of either the

772
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
Academic world war

773
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
The commercial world

774
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,424
And the thing that really comes through from that is

775
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,776
That as much as technology has evolved in as mature as some

776
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Ideas are

777
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,688
There are still you know vast opportunities out there for continue to innovate

778
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Really has been

779
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
Experiencing that in

780
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
I'm seeing all the other the new ID

781
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Still

782
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
Yeah I mean I did that just makes me think of

783
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,256
About you know the some hundred program

784
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
Is here and when you really think about

785
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
All of the kind of

786
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,424
Individual Technologies their developing we are in this era now

787
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
About almost a kind of a mix and match

788
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
We were you get into a permutation game

789
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
This is what strategic

790
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
Technology officer

791
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Is kind of about

792
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,200
Where all these existing Technologies

793
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,784
Can come together into amazing diversity of

794
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Assemblages

795
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
Absolutely and that is

796
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
One of the wonderful

797
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Are the systems off

798
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Carpet glue

799
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Turn all the office

800
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
Is that you do get to

801
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,120
CDs Technologies across the board that are helping to

802
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
Are provided

803
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
Capability that will make

804
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
Make the difference

805
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
For the US

806
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
So it's

807
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
It's really

808
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,360
I'm fun to to see how you can put those

809
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,176
Individual innovative ideas together

810
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
