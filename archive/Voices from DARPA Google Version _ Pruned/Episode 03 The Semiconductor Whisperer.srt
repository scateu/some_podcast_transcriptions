00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
Dell Technologies

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:18,432
The internet

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Technology is a driver of our time since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War.

4
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:30,464
Defense Advanced research projects agency has been a driver of Technology

5
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,536
Welcome to voices from DARPA

6
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
A window at the DARPA score of program managers

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Their job

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,448
Redefine what is possible

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,848
My name is Dan Green since 2013 I've been a program manager and darpa's Microsystems technology office

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,896
And I'm your DARPA host

11
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Ivan Amato

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,112
Tell me a little bit about your background and how it relates to what you hope to accomplish in your time here at DARPA

13
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,000
I came here through a series of fortunate events I got into science from an early age I like physics

14
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536
I did physics in college

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
I got into semiconductor physics

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
So semiconductors are the

17
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
Materials that underpin the electronic

18
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
In all of our commercial Technologies today

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
And

20
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,568
Really fell in love with that area

21
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
At that point time which was in the in the 90s

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
When I started getting into Electronics in in

23
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,552
Going out to grad school it was kind of a bad time to be doing Electronics because

24
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
There is a lot of maturity

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
In light of

26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
Concerned about where it was going to go from there because of

27
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,744
Established players like Intel work

28
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,096
We're heading there hitting the stride and Along came a new material system

29
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Call Kelly nitride

30
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,960
Until I was part of this first wave of Engineers that were brought up

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,336
Looking at gallium nitride to understanding its properties as it applies to transistor technology

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,664
Can you just spend a few seconds talking to us about

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
What is interesting about different kinds of Seneca

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
So when you look at the history of semiconductors

35
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
Straight the transistors came out

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
From the labs of force

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
After the after

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
Did the second world war so it's been around for a long time

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
Maybe interesting pieces that

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,096
As dominant as silicon is today that was not at all obvious

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
When I started

42
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
And in fact when you look at the

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
The first transistors they were made of germanium

44
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
And they look like crazy little Contraption correct the size of a palm almost they jabbed a couple of

45
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,480
Wires into this block of material and were able to extrapolate from that very

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Very rudimentary experiment that

47
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Hey we're really onto something here

48
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
It's obviously translated

49
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Too many billions dollars of

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
Commercial activity now and

51
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
The complexity of this we can do things today is

52
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Astonishing

53
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Really the key was

54
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,912
Going from germanium to silicon and and a lot of the technical reasons that

55
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Made silicon

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Work

57
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
Relate to the fact that it's just

58
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
It warms combinations with other materials called oxide very easily

59
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
And so having that oxide layer

60
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,944
Really help control where the electrons flow

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,784
The ability to manipulate the the material structure

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
Is really wet separated

63
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Silicon

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
From the other competitors of that time

65
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,000
Nht peace that happened with the you know the semi characters zoo in the 80s and 90s

66
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,352
Was the dramatic expansion of the materials that were able to manipulate in that matter

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
And so we went from

68
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,520
Things like Silicon to our notice compound semiconductors where we use combinations of element

69
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
To create new material sets

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
So the first

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Material set that

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
Hit the mainstream is called gallium arsenide

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
Instead of being at your regular Crystal just made of silicon atoms it has an alternating pattern of gallium and arsenic

74
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,696
Right and my understanding is going from Silicon to a Compound Semiconductor

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Igallop arsenide

76
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
With hard enough

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,120
That it became a program by DARPA to to try to

78
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
Make sure that material make it useful as a

79
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
DARPA made early investment to take

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
What then was experimental technology of gallium arsenide

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,896
That was useful for things like amplifiers and

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Really scale it up

83
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
To make it manufacturable

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
Because they realize that it was going to enable us to do things like a raise phased-array so what is a phased array phased arrays

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Is it is a

86
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
A combination of amplifiers in a repeated pattern

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
So that you can project electromagnetic waves

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
So that means things like

89
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
Radars that go on our

90
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Airplanes and ships

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
Can leverage that capability to see what's around them and to communicate

92
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
And what ended up happening was because of the

93
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,943
The defense interest in between that technology in the end the ability to bring it to a manufacturable state

94
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
I love you will realize that hey would be useful for

95
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
Commercial sector as well

96
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,647
It so that same gallium arsenide technology that came out of the early DARPA

97
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
So-called mimic program

98
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
In the 90s

99
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
I was really what set off the cell phone release

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Because it enabled

101
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
The amplifiers that let

102
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Those small handsets that you carry around with you

103
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
To talk to

104
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
The cell phone towers

105
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,335
And that expansion of of the semiconductors do we we we started with germanium with

106
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
Talked about silicon we talked about gallium arsenide

107
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,271
This might be a good time to consider moving to some of the programs that you've been oversee absolutely

108
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,855
Kellie Martin I was was really exceptional because it showed

109
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
How different material properties can be by moving away from

110
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Silicon

111
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
But by no means did that exhaust the periodic table

112
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Pinterest people were looking around

113
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
They realized

114
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
That there's a lot of other rocks

115
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Late 90s early 2000

116
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
This was out

117
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,055
An individual researcher actually develop the technology to grow high-quality

118
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Gallium nitride material

119
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
Elementary materials is special because

120
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
It. It offers a wider band Gap so that's a characteristic energy the material

121
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
And it enabled

122
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
Devices to be made which could emit Into the Blue

123
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
Part of the electromagnetic spectrum

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Which was not available before

125
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
That's what off a whole wave in terms of lighting until we're saying that today with our pixelated stoplights and and the LEDs that we see now

126
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Houses

127
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,191
But the correlation that was an able that material set

128
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
How to be more Wylie

129
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Available

130
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,847
And enable those of us in electronics domain to use it for other purpose

131
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Places like high power amplifier

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Enable us to

133
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
To look at

134
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Things like more efficient cell phone towers

135
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,319
But also higher power a raise for

136
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
The Navy and the and the Army and airforce

137
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
For the sensors and Communications and the

138
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Electronic warfare equipment that we use everyday

139
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
Read and I know that one of your own passions has been to try to

140
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
Look at the strengths of these different kinds of semiconductor materials in and then try to put them together to mix-and-match them

141
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:40,639
Craze that might not have been so easy to do before partly because their Crystal structures are a little different and they might

142
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
Not stick together well but these are some of the challenges right that you've been taking on as a program manager

143
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,551
Part of the interesting piece

144
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
We can learn I try it is

145
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,415
Nothing much that it provides all these advantages but then it works at all

146
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,999
It's a very different material set then historical Summit

147
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
It has a mechanical element that's a part of

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
The way that it operates more than just the way that it moves Electronics

149
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
It has what's gonna Speers Electric

150
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
And so it actually

151
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
Depends upon being compressed

152
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
By the combination materials

153
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
In a certain state

154
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
To enable the electrons to exist

155
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Where we can use them

156
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,015
So we can mix in a little aluminum for there are gallium and nitrogen

157
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
To create a different alloy and we

158
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
Can grow those crystals right on top of each other

159
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
So that they maintain their structure from letter to letter

160
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
And a lot of the development that happened in the early DARPA mimicry was enabling those techniques where we can control that Crystal

161
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Flaring at the atomic scale

162
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
Which enables us to create

163
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
These types of very finely

164
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Characterizes structured

165
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Devices

166
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Over very large area

167
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
So we can create very complex circuits

168
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
That are structured at that atomics

169
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
So where all this goes from here

170
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Because it has this

171
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,647
Funny characteristic of mechanical and electrical coupling that's different is that

172
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
There's a whole swath of degrees of freedom that haven't really been explored

173
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
So I entered the field just as it was maturing

174
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
And worked at a company to help bring one of the initial products

175
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
To life in terms of

176
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
High power amplifier for the cell phone community

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
But my time at DARPA has really been about

178
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Where Do We Go From Here in terms of

179
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Leveraging all these

180
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
Hidden attributes of gallium nitride that really haven't been

181
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
I brought the bear yet

182
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
So things like scaling the gate lights down to the links that we do

183
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,391
And what that that enables us to do is push up higher and higher

184
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
So how do we understand that well

185
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
The

186
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,583
The frequencies that we we commonly encounter for like our cell phone is around to kg

187
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,703
And really because the scaling advantages and that we can do with gallium nitride

188
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
The higher power density that we can't we can start to realize

189
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
The ability to transmit power

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Up in the millimeter wave

191
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
So that's a

192
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Towards

193
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
30 to 300 gigahertz

194
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
It's the ability to dress that higher frequency range

195
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
Really opens up a whole part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we have been able to

196
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Why do you want to go there

197
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
Because that will enable things like 5G

198
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
In the commercial sector

199
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
There's a lot of activity right now.

200
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
That's going to help us all stream video from wherever will

201
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,239
Auburn also enables us to do different things like look at different material properties

202
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
As we interrogate what's going on with with different materials with

203
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
This different party like a mini spare

204
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199
So we can actually literally see the world in a different way

205
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Because we're using light

206
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,343
That the possibilities of what we can do there at just starting to be explored

207
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,207
And the capabilities that we're developing with gallium nitride are a building block in a tool to help us

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,815
Then how would you imagine the Technologies

209
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
But you are nurturing you spoke speaking a lot about gallium

210
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
Imagine that Finding Traction

211
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
Both the National Security and civilian

212
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
So the

213
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Technologies were developing with gallium nitride

214
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
Are going to be very are going to be very important

215
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
For National Security because

216
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
It doesn't he wants to get into these new parts

217
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
I'll be like him a nice pair

218
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
So that underpins

219
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
All of our capabilities when it comes to things like

220
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Communications

221
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Or sensing

222
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Coming from the civilian sector I didn't really understand until I worked

223
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
With some of the military

224
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Is that

225
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Rethink why do you need to send something

226
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
And

227
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
And we know it's down the block and we're walking down the street

228
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
But if you're in the Navy and you're on the ship in the middle of Pacific

229
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
You're in a very very dark place

230
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
And you don't know what's around you in the world

231
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Shenzhen becomes very important

232
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Because you're you're really out in the middle of nowhere

233
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
And that's

234
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Part of the

235
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
The piece that's missing I think when we think about this in

236
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Context of art everyday

237
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
That the military is doing things that are very different

238
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
From what we do in the car

239
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,375
What we're doing with John Knight Rises enabling the technologies that will help them with those particular mission

240
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
And what will happen at the end of the day is that once we have them

241
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
People are creative

242
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
And they will find ways to use those piece

243
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
There are more relevant to what we doing

244
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
In our everyday life

245
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,967
So what might be some of the larger societal technological in

246
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Security context in which your

247
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
Program in interest reside

248
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
It's a very interesting time right now in electronics

249
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
And because

250
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,231
Historically the US has had such a dominant position in the development

251
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
From the initial development of transistor Bell labs

252
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Through the

253
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
The mass roll out of

254
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
PCS from Intel

255
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,007
And what we've seen it just in the last decade or so

256
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
Is the globalization of that technology has

257
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Spread around the world

258
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,455
What are the byproducts of the early going where DARPA funded a lot of these gallimard Senate Technologies

259
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
That rolled into our defense

260
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Defense Communications

261
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Consulting Technologies

262
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
Was that we had a very comfortable

263
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Place in the world where we

264
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
Could make all those components at home

265
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
And use them

266
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
And in very controlled matters for our perp

267
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
And with this globalization that's taking place

268
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
It's because of the Advent of cell phones

269
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Consumer electronics

270
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
We're seeing now that

271
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
All these electronic pieces in these different developments

272
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Are happening all over the world

273
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
It's a really challenges

274
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
The way that we

275
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Consumer electronics

276
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
In the apartment

277
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Offense

278
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Because now we

279
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
We don't necessarily have all of those

280
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
Best components at home because there's a lot of

281
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Activity all over the world

282
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Until there is

283
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
There's challenges both understand what pieces

284
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
We should develop

285
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
And

286
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
Can continue to own at home

287
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
And what pieces we should leverage in that Global Marketplace

288
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
And how to put the the best of those products together

289
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
So that we can confirm a competitor

290
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,407
What you're talkin about here in some ways is the study of the

291
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Technology

292
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Ecosystem the engineering ecosystem

293
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
Innovation ecosystem it makes me think about

294
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
We're DARPA

295
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Listen to these very

296
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Ecosystem

297
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Siddhartha really is

298
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Fantastic in that

299
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
It has the ability to go in and make

300
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Significant investment

301
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
It's too advanced

302
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Technologies

303
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
Critical

304
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Really be a difference-maker

305
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
For instance

306
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
It's in in gallium nitride

307
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
I mentioned

308
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
The

309
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
Newport's again as it came along

310
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
To advancing what we can do in the RF Spectrum

311
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
And really that

312
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
Technology was

313
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
Without in the world

314
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Because of the LED Market

315
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
But DARPA came along and

316
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Made a significant investment

317
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
In wide bandgap semiconductors or which

318
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
To push the matter do that

319
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
That's base

320
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
For the electronics to me

321
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
And because of that early investment DARPA

322
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Has created capabilities

323
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
That are being rolled out now to the services and in

324
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
The form of new

325
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,495
Radars that are going to the Navy and communication systems that are going

326
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
Around the services

327
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
And

328
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
It's also dominant

329
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
Provided the backbone for

330
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
Industry players that are serving commercial Market as well

331
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
Then can you describe one

332
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,367
Science fiction technology either that you read about in the past

333
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
Come up on your road you woken up in the middle of the night with his dream of a technology

334
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
It doesn't exist now but that you really wish

335
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Could exist

336
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
This is what we do here cuz I know time dreaming about different technology so

337
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,823
It's such a fascinating time because a lot of these things that we formally just dreamed about our

338
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Coming to life around us

339
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,455
The one Comic Book Guy I did read when I was a kid was Iron Man and so

340
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
We now have all these Iron Man movies but

341
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,879
What's fascinating is walking around the building and seeing how parts of those Technologies are trying to make it look

342
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,695
Less and less crazy you starting to see

343
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
People are actually working on exosuit

344
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
People who are working on

345
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
How we connect the body to electron

346
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
How we actually

347
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Interface with electronics

348
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,055
So you're talking here about complex and potentially powerful Technologies which means they could lead

349
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
To both good and

350
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Perhaps Troublesome results

351
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,967
How do you think about the potential consequences of the technology

352
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
You're helping

353
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
So I think

354
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
That's a

355
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
Explanation question that we do struggle with alot

356
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
As we continue to

357
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Expand our capability to

358
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Compute

359
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
And

360
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Projector

361
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Into the electromagnetic spectrum

362
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,143
Really raises the ability for us to

363
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
To be always on

364
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
And always connected and it

365
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Not only did that

366
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Erase all the issues that

367
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Received today in terms of

368
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
Having your cell phone all the time and

369
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
In that sense always on

370
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
But also this

371
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
Always aware

372
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
So that there's no way to hide

373
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,551
Until it becomes a very open and transparent

374
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
Place2be which has pluses and minuses

375
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
In terms of how we operate

376
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
As a democracy in the world

377
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
So I think there's a lot of

378
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
Implications of technology that are yet to be trifled with

379
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
But it's also

380
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
A a law of physics that technology will advance

381
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
We will continue to explore the world so

382
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
It doesn't help

383
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Do not try to advance

384
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
And see what's

385
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
What's possible

386
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
The whole point of Darkness

387
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
To prevent surprise

388
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
And really part of our job here is to go out to figure out what spots

389
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Hope that we can start that process

390
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Understanding

391
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Early

392
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,439
Well then I really enjoyed our conversation here today

393
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
They got

394
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,071
Thanks for listening and tune in next time to hear another voice from DARPA

395
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
For more information about DARPA new program managers
