Retire

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
In his case either is Army fatigues or a dress uniform

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Either way he always wears the smile of someone

38
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,824
Who finds himself in a place where he just might be able to

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Realize a dream

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
And he has said publicly

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
That he wants to stop all info

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
From killing p

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Maybe so

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,856
Turtle Matt Hepburn though I will call you Matt from now on it is my pleasure to have you in

45
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624

It's fantastic.

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,512
To be here and and thank you Ivan for inviting me to be on the podcast into

48
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,608
Tell my story and tell you what I care so deeply about

49
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
Greatly looking forward to the discussion

50
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,032
And so your medical professional who Embraces clinical and field practice

51
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
As well as leaving

52
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Edge research

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
What are the origins of those in

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
It started pretty young

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,552
I have this childhood memory of being ass at my school

56
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,648
The Catholic school and I was meeting with one of the priests and they simple what do you really want to do

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
And I said I wanted to be a pediatrician

58
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
And they said

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Why an end and I said well

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Cuz

61
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Just want to take care of people

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
I want to take care of children

63
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
And I do think it stems from my mom was a nurse and so I think less so from the info

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Florence Ave

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,176
Being around someone in the medical profession but more so just being around somebody that cares very deeply about other

66
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:04,576
Again very early on and it's a but it's been it's been sort of a consistent part of my life that is really

67
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Yeah this was in fourth grade this whole like you know I wanted to be a pediatrician the toys I was on this trajectory and I didn't know

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,328
Of course what I was talking about you make these decisions early in your life

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,448
But my parents and my family always had this incredibly strong ethic of service

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
And very deeply and fundamentally cuz I reflect on the soffit

71
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Actually it's like

72
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
Who am I in and what am I supposed to be and I think

73
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
What I do is I survived

74
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
That's that's how I defined my

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Maybe one of the greatest gifts from my parents was

76
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,696
My dad was active duty Navy officer did RTC and served as a nuclear engineer

77
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
On a Surface Warfare ship

78
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
It was actually for five or six years stayed in the Navy for another 20 plus

79
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
Retired as a Navy captain in the reserves

80
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,728
You couple my mom's passion for helping other people in the medical

81
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
Field with my dad's passion of serving our country

82
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,408
This is almost like all I knew until that trajectory his would have guided me through all of my

83
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,064
Okay well if that's actually talk a little bit about that in before you came to drop you spent almost 15 years in a variety of

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Simon Says

85
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
U2 for example 40

86
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Dietrich

87
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Premier facility for infectious

88
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Disease

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
Koreatown

90
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
UK

91
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
At the Republican

92
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Georgia

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Azerbaijan

94
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,423
Erectile and other places I'm sure what did you learn from

95
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
All of that Global Experience

96
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
I would start by saying what a privilege

97
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
What a privilege

98
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
To have those types of life experience

99
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
All in the context of

100
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
Again feelings that I'm serving my country and make

101
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Some of the work that I'm most proud of frankly is work I did in the caucuses with Georgia and Azerbaijan and

102
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
The program

103
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
What was under the auspices was called The Cooperative threat reduction

104
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
But really my rule there was

105
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,911
To engage their Public Health Community

106
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
And their medical research community

107
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,103
To establish that capability of finding infectious diseases diagnosing them in Ultimate

108
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Treating them

109
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
And it was a capability that was

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,039
Those public health systems were all part of the Soviet Union but when the Soviet Union fell

111
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
These countries were kind of left to their own to

112
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Recreate a public health in.

113
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
And so the privileged

114
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,071
Was to work with those experts in the host country to say how do we build that back up a

115
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,679
So that you can tell us that there's an outbreak going on and then we can

116
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Collectively work together to respond to that

117
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
So did you bring in models like

118
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
The centers of Disease Control

119
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
Did we did we work closely with the Embassy Suite work closely with the state department we work closely with the CD

120
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
DC at the end of the day

121
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,855
It was myself and some of my DOD colleagues on the ground

122
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Near rolling our sleeves up

123
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
Helping these countries develop the system

124
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
Developing laboratory capabilities

125
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
Developing the ability to do clinical research

126
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,167
2 ethical standards that would be accepted all over the world and to

127
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Figure out how to do this you know again I look fat

128
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
What a privilege to be on the ground

129
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,895
I'm at and at this point fairly Junior in my career and to help by the entire nation

130
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Improve the public health

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Another cat sound like

132
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
The great privilege

133
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
What is the sequence of events matthat

134
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Resulted in your

135
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Current position here

136
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
DART bus app

137
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
Drop my medical career I had heard about.

138
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
And I had seen

139
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
Amazing technology that is

140
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
Come from DARPA that were aimed at addressing infection

141
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Kisses

142
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
So I always admired from afar

143
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,239
Before I joined our pie was over at the White House National

144
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Security Council

145
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,847
And in that role my job was to

146
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,199
Identify what capabilities we do not have to respond to pandemics

147
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,319
And then how we can organize ourselves as a government not just DOD but as an entire government

148
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
Towards addressing this Gap so we're ready for the next

149
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
And while I was there I got tapped on the shoulder

150
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
And the

151
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
Concise phrase was

152
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,911
You're doing all of this policy what we should do as a government

153
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
How would you then

154
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Like to implement

155
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
And actually

156
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
Make investments

157
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
They're going to address us

158
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
So that's where you literally tapped on the shoulder

159
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
Was supposed to say It was Doctor Jeff Ling was the death

160
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
AP director of DSO at

161
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
The time

162
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
And

163
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
He at least I met him for coffee one morning

164
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
And he

165
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
Didn't literally actually put his hand on my shoulder but

166
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
Figuratively imagine a hand on my shoulder

167
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Saying

168
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,543
How would you like to try a DARPA to actually invest make a difference

169
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,127
For all those things that you've been talking about in her the big policy word

170
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,551
Well and of course he provided a model of audacity because he really took on Trump

171
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,927
Prosthetics and other programs to really help by the Warfighter why don't we Segway than into

172
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,511
Your life is a program manager here in this tremendous portfolio

173
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,887
That you've developed which is I think a portfolio that also reflects some kind of audacious

174
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Point of view

175
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
As of course

176
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
A reflected by that statement earlier

177
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
You want to take the lethal power out of infectious disease so the names are fantastic some of them like

178
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,735
Prometheus and Thor dialysis like Therapeutics in vivonet

179
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,295
A Platforms in will probably talk more about one of them and

180
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Particular

181
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
The pandemic prevention plan

182
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
What I'm hoping to do now is if you could briefly take us

183
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
For a tour of your program

184
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Cuz we can't go in depth about any of them

185
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
At this point

186
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Take me to a little bit of a torrent

187
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
What you're hoping to achieve with some of these programs

188
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
And then we'll focus in a little bit more

189
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Pandemic

190
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
Yeah so that tour starts by saying

191
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
What what problems are we trying to solve

192
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
And again

193
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
At the White House Nashville

194
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
Security Council staff I got a chance to say

195
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Look for these

196
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
Major outbreak

197
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Pandemics are near pandemic

198
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
How have we done as a government

199
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,951
Think about the 2009 H1N1 pandemic

200
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
I think about the West Africa

201
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,095
Ebola crisis H1N1 influenza

202
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:13,471
Influenza think about the West Africa ebola crisis think about how we've recently responded to zika

203
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,591
They're coming themes throughout and some of those common themes are we need to be much better

204
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
At diagnosing if someone has

205
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
And we need to go A Step Beyond that and imagine a world

206
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
That if we could

207
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Figure out if someone

208
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Is going to be sick

209
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Or is going to be contagious

210
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
We can intervene and stop the outbreak writing

211
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
And that's for me

212
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
And that's the Prometheus

213
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
But we also need to make vaccines and treatments much fast

214
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Then we currently

215
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,959
And that's one of the examples is the pandemic prevention plan

216
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
We need alternate ways of how we treat infection

217
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
And using portable dialysis

218
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,895
To filter the blood and remove any type of path

219
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Is a good example

220
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,319
But the purchase in that case is that mean I might by might have been exposed to some kind of pathogenic agents

221
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
In my blood certain

222
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
Level so it would this kind of Technology

223
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
Remove that before could take hold and actually get me sick

224
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Was that the idea of that yes

225
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
And it the idea would be

226
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Again

227
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,423
Especially for pathogens where we don't have a vaccine

228
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Where we don't have it

229
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,335
Especially think about now with what we're seeing so much of antimicrobial resistance

230
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Bacteria

231
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Imagine if

232
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Where we can't use antibiotics

233
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
So if we can filter your blood and remove that Passage

234
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,367
What has ultimately gives a leg-up for your own immune response to ultimately

235
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Make you well again

236
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
We like that technology especially

237
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,815
In those first days when we need to buy some time to develop a vaccine and when

238
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,679
And so my point across the portfolio is that

239
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
We have lots of investments in medical diagnostic

240
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
Text we're investing in modeling to forecast where infectious diseases are going to go we have Investments and accelerate

241
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Braiding new treatment

242
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
But they're all connected together

243
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
They are all linked

244
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
And let me give you an example

245
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
With our Prometheus program

246
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
Predicting if someone is going to become contagious

247
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Awesome right

248
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
We can do that

249
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,047
But once we predict and identify that person

250
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
We still have to

251
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
To treat them

252
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
And so

253
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
We're going to need

254
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Treatment

255
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Fast as possible

256
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
With our pandemic River

257
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Pension platform

258
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,847
And the beauty is that those treatments are probably going to be most of

259
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
Active when they're given as early as possible

260
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
So

261
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,247
I think of our whole portfolio as interconnected

262
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
That we develop a lot of different specific projects to hit capabilities

263
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,671
But that their ultimate league going to intertwine

264
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
So that we stop the outbreak in it

265
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
Tracks well when I think of programs or darbydale have a kind of

266
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
Lifecycle to them right I mean lately certain started

267
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,703
Glimmer in the eye of Someone Like You matter program manager

268
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,775
There's a. Wedding and working with others here to really

269
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Articulate

270
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
And formulate the program is

271
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Best of candy soda

272
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
It's can be most effective and then kind of smoke signals go out to the world and seeking people who maybe think that they can pull offs

273
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,855
Some of these audacious tasks that we'd be without course then the research is done and hopefully

274
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
In the end

275
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
You succeed or if not

276
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Fully succeed you learn from

277
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
All the research

278
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
What's going on

279
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
What is the status of that life cycle

280
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Of the pandemic

281
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Prevention platform

282
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
The democratization platform

283
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Just launched

284
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,287
And so and by lunchtime those who might not know what that means in the DARPA context

285
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,383
Said that that means that completing the Contracting process

286
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
So that are performers

287
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
That were selected in a very rigorous process

288
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Can now accomplish the goals of

289
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
The program

290
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
So they're just starting in there for 6

291
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
As part of the life cycle

292
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
These are early days

293
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,279
Early days because the ultimate goal of that program is so

294
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Difficult

295
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
I'm we have a lot to eat on some ways I feel like what we have

296
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
We have a long way to go

297
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
One of the key points though of the pandemic prevention Platte

298
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Is that

299
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
The goal is

300
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Incredibly ambitious

301
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
But there is foundational scientific evidence

302
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
That this can be done

303
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,759
And that foundational scientific evidence is derived

304
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
From a previous DARPA program

305
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,647
And that previous Circle parade other approved the concept of depth

306
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
That's the Adept program

307
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,279
Because when I looked over the program it's fascinating to me cuz it looks like

308
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
We're trying to rev up the whole

309
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Brilliance molecular world of anybody

310
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,543
And so I want you to go through this the sequence events beginning with this earlier program at depth

311
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
Yeah but walk us through some of the steps because when I look at anybody's to Armand my favorite proteins when I look at them

312
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
William things like

313
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
So selective

314
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:47,135
Find the thing that we don't want our bodies like gloves anyway you tell us the pieces of the program

315
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
And you know I haven't I couldn't agree more

316
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
I think all of us that are fascinated by DARPA right this very uncommon thing is we are just a man

317
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Amazed

318
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,191
By the natural world and what the natural world has developed

319
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Antibodies are grade exam

320
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
I mean there are millions and millions

321
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,407
Of these different versions of antibody circulating through your body at all times

322
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
And

323
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
The mechanisms are so refined and intricate

324
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
To select

325
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Okay

326
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Which are the antibodies that are most protective

327
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
When you're exposed to an infection

328
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,743
And your body goes through the process of them making a lot of those in a short. Of time

329
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
I think it's mind-boggling how advanced that system is

330
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,679
We've learned so much about antibodies in the last 50 years

331
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
You're absolutely right we want to Leverage

332
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,847
All of that information that we know how they work now and we know all that we know about their structure

333
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,175
We know how to make them in big vast and why can't we use that

334
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
And you're seeing incredible progress in medicine

335
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Where we are using the

336
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
Where you're seeing antibodies approved as products now

337
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
For cancer tree

338
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
For treating autoimmune disease or the category of biological index in the category of biological tomasovic

339
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Explosion in that space

340
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,911
And we want to use all of that knowledge in that technology

341
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
To solve infectious diseases

342
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,055
What we do at DARPA though is the fun part is we couple different fields together

343
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
And so

344
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,943
As you correctly pointed out this extraordinary powerful tool of antibody in

345
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
Engineering but can we couple that

346
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,063
With the the revolution that we seen in in genetic

347
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
And that's

348
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
That's DARPA right it's taking two different areas

349
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
Seeing if we can mix them together

350
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,095
Again an antibody specialist might not think about the opportunities with genetics

351
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,423
The genetic specialist might not think we'll wonder if I could

352
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,495
Use my use genetic engineering to make an antibody

353
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,847
You bring the two Fields together in the more you know by RR Magic

354
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
Bringing them the disciplines together we achieve that effect

355
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
And so

356
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
The proof-of-concept

357
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
Which I find exhilarating

358
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Chills up and down my spine

359
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Is that

360
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
We can give you a

361
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Piece of DNA

362
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Or piece of RNA

363
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
And

364
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
We can

365
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Put that into your muscle cells

366
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
And that your muscle cells

367
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Say okay got it

368
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,751
I am going to make this antibody that is so protective

369
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
That someone's knocking

370
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
And that's encoded by these nucleic acid

371
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,943
The RNA and TRNA tells that muscle cell to the muscle cells doing what a muscle cell does

372
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
But once that RNA gets inside that muscle cell

373
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
The muscle cell size

374
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Right

375
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,135
I'm going to make a protective antibody is going to protect you from evil

376
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
And to do that in a

377
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Fairly short period of time

378
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,791
And that idea would sound crazy 10 years ago

379
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Too many obstacles can't be done

380
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
The foundational investment

381
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
I'm from DARPA

382
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Prove that console

383
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
In many different animal models for many different

384
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,103
Fight because we're DARPA we said we're great we proved the concept

385
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
That wasn't good enough

386
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,455
It wasn't good enough for me it wasn't good enough for the DARPA leadership

387
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
DARPA leadership said

388
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
Okay that's great but we need to burp the baby

389
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
If we're going to take

390
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Pandemics off the table

391
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Nets

392
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Why I'm here

393
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
We need to be able to

394
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Put this together

395
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
As a platform

396
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
That can go start

397
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
To finish

398
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,983
From Once Upon A pigeon is identified to making thousands of doses

399
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Of this

400
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Miraculous

401
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Antibody-based antibody-based treatment

402
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Incredibly short

403
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Period of time

404
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Right and let's let's talk about the time scale for a minute cuz that's part of the

405
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Did the big deal here right

406
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
What I've seen is

407
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
Within 60 days of identifying the the pathogenic agent actually have these doses right in hand

408
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
I'm in a distributable for MS

409
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
That's correct

410
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Rain-X wipers to what

411
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Is it to what's the state of

412
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
The state-of-the-art today depends on infect

413
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
But let's use some some reason example

414
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
We currently have some zika vaccines in clinical trials but

415
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
We've been working now for a few years

416
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
And we don't have a license

417
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Steak and Shake

418
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,575
You think about our Reese when we talked about gaps you think about all of these recent out

419
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:06,719
And one of the fundamental Essence is that we haven't had vaccines and treatments that are ready in time

420
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
And

421
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
We came up

422
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
That the 60-day

423
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Golf

424
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
Has been controversial

425
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
When we talk about audacity

426
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
You know I have

427
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,127
Professional colleagues laugh at me I've been on panels

428
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,711
We're right here discuss the program

429
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
And the other panelists joined with the audience at laughing at me

430
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
So I knew we were in the right space

431
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,183
The counter-argument that I continually make to the critics is

432
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
60 days is dictated by what we need

433
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
To respond to pandemic

434
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
So if you don't agree that our approach has the right way

435
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,679
Then come up with an alternative

436
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:52,543
Because we can't negotiate with Mother Nature and say what would like another 6 months if

437
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
If you don't mind

438
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
Especially when you think about the catastrophic consequences

439
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Accordingly

440
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
So

441
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
We have to be

442
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
We have to do this with

443
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
And I think again

444
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
Profoundly excited cuz I think we found a way to do it

445
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,695
I want to try to make this concrete for a listeners

446
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
What you've actually done fairly well just now what I thought of another way we met

447
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
I do this

448
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
By combining

449
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
You know kind of almost at the the

450
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
Gaming out to the Future where let's say you are success

451
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,543
And may you be successful with this P3 program

452
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Pandemic

453
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Prevention plan

454
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Program

455
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
Let's say that you had that P3

456
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Ability

457
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Back in the 1918 Spanish

458
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
I've seen different numbers of

459
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
50 million

460
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Pandemic

461
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
If this technology existed back

462
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
In the early part of the

463
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Last century

464
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
How would that unhappy

465
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Have unfolded

466
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Well my hope

467
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Is that

468
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
50 million people down.

469
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
That

470
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,079
Leanne Again part of this is

471
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Can you detect that we have a new virus

472
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
RI new version

473
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Of influenza

474
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,807
And we detect very early on in the process when it's first starting out in a given country

475
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
I'm satisfied that it's happening

476
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
We flipped the switch

477
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
And we say

478
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
For that new virus

479
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
We need 20000 doses

480
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
That have to be ready within six

481
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
And then we go to win that outbreak

482
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
His first start

483
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
Wade NFI who's sick

484
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,007
We treat those people

485
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
I'm that are most likely to be contagious

486
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
And we stop the outbreak

487
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Strack's

488
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
If we added we could have stopped the Spanish Flu

489
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
I think even more important

490
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,039
Right now today you and I both know

491
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
People who are getting very sick with influenza we're seeing a severe season

492
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,231
And we're seeing unfortunately children.

493
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
We're seeing unfortunately

494
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,887
Otherwise completely healthy people having dianping Hospital

495
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,215
Influenza does that to us every year

496
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
We imagine a world where this platform

497
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Could be used

498
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
To take seasonal influenza

499
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
Write an amazing thought because

500
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
I mean this gets back to

501
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Several times

502
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
You said what a privilege

503
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
It is

504
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
To do what you're doing because

505
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Succeed

506
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
You will know and I know you won't take this

507
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Pumping you up personally

508
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
It's more for what it do

509
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
You know

510
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Kind of humanity

511
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
But you will know you've had a pardon

512
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
Potentially saving

513
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
People's lives

514
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
By cutting leaves

515
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
A pandemic

516
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
Experiences

517
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Does off

518
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
I'll before they really get going and spread so

519
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,408
Really quite an amazing event and I would make two points the first is that

520
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
DARPA

521
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,016
My my put my team does not do this alone

522
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
DARPA does not do this

523
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
We work incredibly closely

524
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:52,256
With our colleagues in Health and Human Services with other experts in the department of

525
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Defense in the US government

526
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
As well as philanthropy as well as

527
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
The private sector

528
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
And as well as the global community

529
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,496
Is It ultimately a global teamwork

530
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
That's going to take these infectious disease

531
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
Off the table but make no mistake we can say

532
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
It sounds hard and it's ambitious and it's crazy

533
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,504
But I challenge you to say why not

534
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
Need a white why aren't we as a society putting incredible

535
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Even more effort

536
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
Into taking these infection

537
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,488
Tri-Cities is off the table if we have the if we have the scientific know how to

538
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,792
This is what I think we should be

539
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
It's a moonshot

540
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
But why not go friendly

541
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,680
And why not go for a moon shot for

542
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
Again something that could

543
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Kill another 50 million

544
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,336
Why not take a moon shot against

545
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,944
Infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis I mean we've seen

546
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,552
You know there's there's effort in there there's Global effort that's absolutely tremendous

547
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Why not more

548
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,184
Samantha just a little while ago you and I were kind of gushing about the molecular

549
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Beauty in the biology

550
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
SHOW beauty of antibody

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Specificities

552
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
To go out in

553
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Find whatever

554
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,400
The hell threatening agent might be in

555
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
Kind of man

556
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,984
The role that plays in our own bodies

557
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Fight against

558
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Health compromise

559
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Exposures

560
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,968
I guess I kind of want to ask you to do you have a favorite

561
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,040
Infectious disease in the sense that you admire

562
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
What the bacteria

563
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Virus

564
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
Does is learn how to do over

565
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
The course of evolution

566
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
So

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
Lights are in a slightly different way

568
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
I think it's a

569
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
When we say we want to take infection

570
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
Diseases off the table

571
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
In some ways its it's ridiculous because

572
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
We're always going to have

573
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
We're always going to have

574
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,200
Viruses and bacteria that are part of the natural world

575
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
And

576
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
We

577
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
And we've always seen them as the enemy or

578
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,880
Pathogens is the word that we use

579
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,488
One of the interesting ways to think about the problem though is that

580
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,120
Part of it is that they are a pathogen but part of it is how we respond

581
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
And

582
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Modulating

583
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
How our own body response to pathogens

584
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
Is a major theme of what we're trying to do

585
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,616
With antibodies being one of many example

586
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
And so

587
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,968
You're one of the traditional attitudes of antibiotics has

588
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
Antibiotics that have been wonderful and certainly profoundly impactful

589
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
In terms of our society

590
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
As we were as we come along

591
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:31,232
But we've also discovered the unintended consequences of giving a broad-spectrum antibiotic

592
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Concurring my

593
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
Antimicrobial resistance and

594
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
Things like that as well

595
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
So

596
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400
The world that I imagine

597
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Is that

598
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
There is I guess

599
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,776
Like you said before it appreciation of Passage

600
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,080
Depreciation of viruses and bacteria

601
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Understanding

602
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
What they do and what they don't do

603
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
And

604
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:56,064
It's not always wiping them out but more about rendering them harmless or figuring out ways to cut it

605
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Coexist

606
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
Is where I would like are thinking to go on the toy

607
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
It makes a lot of sense

608
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,328
Statistics about the number of mammalian cells in me and you and the number of bacterial cells

609
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
And there's for the world's most from just the numbers perspective way more bacteria than we are we are

610
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
But there most of the time this is

611
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
This is a symbiosis

612
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
This is a mutually beneficial relationship

613
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
And so

614
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
I did really we shouldn't always

615
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
I think about these

616
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
These microbes

617
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Things to eat to

618
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
2

619
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Consider the minute we shouldn't consider

620
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,904
That's right that's right and the other part is that we learn from them

621
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
It's its their evolution

622
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
That also kind of inspires us and so

623
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
It's a

624
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,632
That in some ways there are adversary but in some ways they're sort of that

625
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,800
But you know when the superhero novels and things like that this idea of the the the balance between the hero and

626
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
The villain in sort of that

627
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:55,456
Estranged relationship that often develops between the two end if you will meet mutual appreciation

628
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
Is that I think that's awesome pathogen

629
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
Tonight we're coming toward the end

630
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Part-time hero

631
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Just wondering if

632
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Something that didn't come up

633
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
During our discussion that you think would be oven

634
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
To our listeners

635
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
You know your

636
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Go hero

637
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Scrubzah

638
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
Ridding us of

639
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Some of some of the

640
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
The concerns we have

641
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
The pathogens

642
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,616
Yeah what are munchers at DARPA is this idea of

643
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,712
Inspiring inspiring creativity and new solutions to

644
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
And often times

645
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
We say by sort of

646
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,624
Recruiting in people who have not traditionally thought about our problems

647
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
To help us with the solution

648
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:43,072
And so you know I would love for the listeners of this podcast

649
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
To be more inspired

650
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
To address

651
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Other problems in infectious

652
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Diseases

653
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
What I mean by that is

654
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,616
I always say people like me have to leave investor in tires

655
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,944
Careers in our life work into this and we have deep knowledge

656
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
The subject

657
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
I love the thought of

658
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
People that have expertise in

659
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Computer science

660
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
In

661
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
In

662
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,256
What we would say well maybe those fields aren't necessarily obviously related

663
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
How to

664
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
That's how we're going to solve

665
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,888
The infectious diseases problems of the 21st Century

666
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,448
And so when I speak on this it's almost part

667
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
One part recruiting

668
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,080
It's especially recruiting those that may not have all of the biases

669
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
Of the traditional experts in infectious

670
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
To come up with a creative solution

671
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
The solve it

672
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
So

673
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
That makes me think of a term that

674
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Innovation

675
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Ecosystem

676
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Cuz you just mentioned

677
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
Whole bunch of discipline

678
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Put in a maybe

679
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,328
When you first think about infections that you might not think some of the

680
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Come together so it is there something about

681
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
You and being here at DARPA

682
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
That

683
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,312
Is conducive to show the shaking up that Innovation ecosystem in ways that

684
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
Maybe move for the goals that you have

685
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,920
DARPA enables me to do that

686
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
Because

687
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:08,576
Again they are our program announcements we say okay we set the requirements

688
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Solve this problem

689
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Make us a treatment in 60 days

690
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,280
We know that they can't do that alone and it takes a multidisciplinary team so

691
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
If if you want funding from dark but you're going to have

692
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
To work with

693
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,216
People you're going to have to recruit it we design it so that you will have to recruit in people that may not be the

694
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Traditional Subs

695
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
But furthermore

696
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,104
Every time I get a chance to speak

697
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
And to talk about this problem

698
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
Like Imus podcast

699
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
You know again I see it as a work

700
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Recruiting

701
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
As a recruiting tool

702
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
To inspire those

703
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,696
I'm to help us address these infectious diseases threats

704
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
Well what I'm realizing now

705
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,376
I do not want to prevent you for another minute from going out there and realizing your goal

706
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
Taking The lethality out

707
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,776
And we are out of time also so I just want to

708
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
Thank you this is been immensely fast made

709
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
I just want to thank you

710
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152

Ghost stories about

712
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Got your life

713
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:13,600
As a medical professional and and how you're expressing your interests and goals here at DARPA

714
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Well thank you very much

715
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
For allowing me to be part of
