The internet

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
Technology is a driver of our time

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:28,416
Since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War DARPA the defense Advanced research projects agency

5
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
Has been a driver of Technology

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
Welcome to

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
Voices from DARPA

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,352
A window at the DARPA score of program managers

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Their job

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
To redefine what is possible

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
My name is Ivan Amato

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,264
And I'm your doorposts

13
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,336
Today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio Dave Palmer

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
Program manager in darpa's

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920

00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,784
2012 he has been in that office overseeing a portfolio of projects

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:00,416
All of them with the goal of pushing Electronics into smaller faster and generally more capable territory

18
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,464
The welcome Deb two voices

19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
Thank you Ivan

20
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,912
Semi truck to start by just finding out a little bit about you and that's what maybe you can tell us something about your back

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Compound interest

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,240
And how you became a program manager

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,408
Well like every red-blooded American teenage boy I started playing Electric

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Guitar

25
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
Back then

26
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
You play through an amplifier that use vacuum

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,672
And there was some cash today with the soft glow of the vacuum tubes in the warm sound that you get

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
When you play your guitar through them

29
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,048
But that being naturally curious so

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
Started to wonder

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:44,448
How they worked and how does the guitar take the motion of the strings and turn it into an electric

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Signal

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
That led me a day

34
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
Studying electromagnetics

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,408
I ended up pursuing engineering electrical engineering as a career

36
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:58,016
And started working as a government program manager for the Army research office about

37
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
15 years ago

38
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Until I ended up here

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
Let's talk a little bit about some of the programs then since

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
The 2012

41
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
That you have been overseeing

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,352
And I'm thinking perhaps we can start with the terahertz electronics program

43
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,192
And I'm going to try to steal your thunder slightly here by telling

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,080
Our listeners that in 2014 that garnered a Guinness World Record but I'm going to let you talk about the programming

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,896
And what that does superlative moment was

46
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Cuz when you were

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
That was a lot of fun

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Indeed

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,880
You can think about transistors like you think about guitar strings

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,488
The low-frequency guitar strings can be heavy and

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
Loose

52
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,144
But as you move up in frequency the strings get thinner and you have to wind them tighter

53
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,032
It's kind of the same with transistors when you're working at low frequencies you can get away with large dimensions

54
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
And

55
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
As you move up in frequency

56
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
Does Dimensions have to shrink

57
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,248
So the terahertz electronics program we really took that to an extreme

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
It's like when you're

59
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,088
Put new strings on your guitar in your tuning it up

60
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,416
And you're winding the strings Tighter and Tighter you think they can

61
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
Get any tighter in there about to break

62
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
But you still keep whining and finally you hit the note you want

63
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
It works kind of the same way in the terrorist electronics pro

64
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,728
So they let me just stop you a little bit before you say more about the program

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
Because I'm not sure all of our listeners would have heard the

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
The term terahertz

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
I know the a above middle C

68
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,944
On a guitar vibrates at 440

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
Hertz at 4.

70
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
40 vibrations

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Prosecco

72
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Tell us what one

73
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Terahertz isn't

74
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Comparison to that

75
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
1 terahertz is

76
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
10 to the 12th

77
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Vibrations per second

78
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Which is one

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Cycles per second

81
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
That's one trillion

82
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,104
That's correct 1 trillion cycles per second so that's very hard to achieve

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
In an electronic circuit right

84
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Yes very hard

85
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,040
In fact when the program started none of the performers believed it could be done

86
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
And during the program there were many instances when

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
We were thinking that maybe we should just circle the wagons and try to make the

88
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,815
Electronics work better in a lower frequency

89
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
But one of my colleagues Bruce Wallace

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Said that

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
Chuck Yeager didn't get famous

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
For flying 85% of the speed of sound

93
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
So if we were going to have a terahertz Electronics program

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
We were going to have

95
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
Electronics at work at 1 terahertz

96
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
So everybody found a new knobs to twist

97
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
And

98
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
Kept working on it and finally we did hit that Mark

99
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,999
Right okay in the end at that time that what if perhaps it is now you can

100
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Please let me know what the status is

101
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
But it did it actually was

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
The fastest switching electronic circuit on the planet

103
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
It's the fastest Linear Amplifier on the planet

104
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,335
At the time and still is and I imagine it will be for some time to come

105
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,967
Okay so it took you in a few hundred Inspire your performers those

106
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
Groups that work on this to to wax

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Achieve this

108
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
You went to Great pains to do this

109
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
What what what what do you get by having a terahertz

110
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
There's two things you get

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
Removing transistor performance up in freak

112
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
One is you access much wider bandwidth

113
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
Which is like having a bigger pipe

114
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
How to push your data through in a communication

115
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
And the other is

116
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
If you work on a transistor enough to

117
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
To make it

118
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Capable of working at a terahertz

119
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,783
You have to eliminate all the parasitic capacitances resistances inductance

120
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
That limited

121
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Performance

122
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
And then when you take that same transistor and operate down

123
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
At lower frequencies saying the millimeter wave

124
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
The performance of the transistor is much better

125
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
You get lower noise

126
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Better linearity

127
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,703
Better dynamic range and maybe most importantly better power a fish

128
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Interesting soda get this

129
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Circuitry that that

130
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
That can switch it

131
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
It hurts

132
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
I got that has additional benefits just because you push the technology for it and you can apply it elsewhere

133
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Electronic space

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Exactly right

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Let's move to another program that

136
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Bully gets back

137
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
That's what we were talking about

138
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
For which is vacuum line

139
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Electronics

140
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,071
Ice-cold invest in that stands for Innovative vacuum Electronics

141
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Science and Technology Program

142
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
I'd love you to tell us a little bit about

143
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,031
The origin of that program what problems and where what technologies is it is

144
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
Designs to create

145
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
And what its status is at the mall

146
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,015
Terahertz Electronics program pushed solid-state Electronics up to an extremely high frequency

147
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,647
But if you're trying to get extremely high frequency and extremely high power at the same time

148
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
Vacuum tubes are pretty much her only option

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
The problem is that vacuum tubes scale

150
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
Without braiding frequency the dimensions get smaller and smaller as you go up in frequency and so at some point you just can't build

151
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,519
So the invest program is exploring

152
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
Several different areas one is

153
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
Advanced manufacturing for example using

154
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
3D printing

155
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
Additive Manufacturing

156
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
Division there is to be able to draw the tube in a CAD program ship the cad file to the printer and ended

157
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
End up with a millimeter wave tube

158
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
While I write out of the machine to computer aided design

159
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,423
You have to make the cavities in which

160
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
The frequency

161
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,311
Occurring really small smaller than ever

162
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
4 for the frequency

163
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
The cavity Dimensions get smaller in the alignment requirements get more critical so if you could build the whole tube at once

164
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Do you have the dimensions and the alignment

165
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
In one shot

166
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,767
There's another thrust in the program that's looking at modeling because as you move up in frequency

167
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,655
Small variations in the manufacturing process can produce large variations in device performance

168
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
And you'd like to be able to know

169
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
Which of the dimensional parameters is most important

170
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
So you need a modeling program to do that

171
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Then there are

172
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
Other components of the tube

173
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
The cathode

174
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,807
In the beam wave interaction structure where we just went out looking for

175
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
New and interesting ideas

176
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Maybe that would just blow away the current

177
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,791
Way of building tubes and eliminate the problem with manufacturing all together

178
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Okay so let's say the program

179
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,935
Ends up being successful and why shouldn't we think otherwise

180
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
So you end up having

181
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,079
A new kind of family of Technologies where you've got

182
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
Does high frequency

183
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
And you got the high power

184
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:54,015
Where do you imagine these Technologies of finding an important place

185
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
So you hear a lot about

186
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,415
5G is the next generation of cell phone communication

187
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
You're talking about using frequencies are in the millimeter wave

188
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Region of the spectrum

189
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
But still

190
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
Hard to get

191
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Devices

192
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
That operate in that

193
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,495
Range especially with enough power to close a Communications link over a long distance

194
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
So that's where the invest program comes in

195
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
You get millimeter wave operation

196
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Anti power

197
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
In an affordable

198
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Power efficient

199
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,807
Device using your pipe metaphor which I really like you have your

200
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
Will have bigger pipes on it

201
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Connecting our cell phones to the system

202
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
With this technology that

203
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Might come out of

204
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Yes absolutely

205
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,559
You're not going to find a vacuum tube in your handset

206
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,423
I'm pretty sure but it could see some using base stations and definitely military communicate

207
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,799
All right. So let's talk about just one more program and if this is one of your latest

208
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,919
Which is a mouthful to say I wanted to the short forms I like is

209
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
M cubic

210
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
He actually write that out that's m

211
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
3 IC but the wheel long form

212
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Alce

213
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,183
It'll take 2 seconds or 3 magnetic miniaturized

214
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,047
And monolithically integrated components program did I actually say that right

215
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,887
Yes that's exactly how I feel like I've accomplished something

216
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
Okay well the primary goal of the program is to be able to integrate magnetic materials with the semiconductor

217
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
Doctor devices that everybody knows and loves

218
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Today

219
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
If you

220
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
Dive a little deeper into it weave

221
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,575
Achieved an incredible degree of integration of electronic components like

222
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
Resistors transistors and capacitors

223
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
Largely because

224
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
You have a large

225
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
Pallet of materials to work with

226
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
That have properties that are relevant to electronic components

227
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
With Magnetic components

228
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
You're only three elements

229
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
That have intrinsic

230
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Magnetic properties

231
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
So we've been very difficult

232
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
To find a way to integrate those with semiconductor process

233
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
What we're trying to do with the program is leverage some work that

234
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,295
It's been done in Material Science on magnetic materials

235
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
Over the last decade or so

236
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
With microwave engineering

237
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
To produce integrated components

238
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Where you can actually access that magnetic physics

239
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
In an electronic circuit

240
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
In a very compact

241
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Form factor

242
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
So let me ask you this because I'm already Amazed by the chips in Arlo

243
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
They can do so many things they have

244
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
First part of somebody Technologies

245
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
What more are you going to get by by taking

246
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,551
Small magnetic components now and integrating them into those those ubiquitous chip

247
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
From the user point of view you probably won't see anything much different

248
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,815
But from the technologist point of view lower frequency systems use magnetic components all the time

249
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
But they're large and heavy and

250
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Tend to be

251
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:56,287
Difficult to integrate so you kind of push that functionality out to the edges of the circuits

252
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
And use it in a non-ideal way

253
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,455
Give me an example or two though of a specific technology where these magnetic

254
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Components

255
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
Are Central to it even though they're not

256
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
Yet integrated onto the ships themselves but they're somehow in the overall system to what might be an overall system that has the electronic

257
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
And some of these

258
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Magnetic components

259
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
Wall picture of walkie-talkie for example

260
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
You've got a transmitter and receiver

261
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
But you've only got one in ten

262
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
There's a magnetic component

263
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
That isolates

264
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,847
The transmitter from the receiver and connect both of them TV antenna at the same time

265
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
If you didn't have that you have to have two antennas

266
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
No weapon higher frequencies

267
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
You can still

268
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Do that

269
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
But the

270
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
Performance of the components drops off some

271
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Substantially because

272
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
They're separate from the electronics

273
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,559
What we're hoping to do with in cubic

274
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Is bring

275
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
That functionality back into

276
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,727
Interaction with the electronic circuit so you can have that same kind of

277
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
Ease of operation at the higher frequency

278
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Right now you have to

279
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,711
Try to mimic that magnetic physics with electronic components and there's really nothing that

280
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Does quite the same

281
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Job

282
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
And for those engineer types

283
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,463
Out there who are listening I think the component you were referring to just now is that known as a circulator

284
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
Wow I've been this great yes it is

285
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,167
I guess I just impressed you and Jessica you mentioned three complaints were not going to talk about them but I'm just now intrigued by what they are

286
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
The circulator is one of them at one of the other two

287
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Well in the program we're looking at

288
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Frequency selective limiter

289
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Which

290
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Can

291
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
Through the natural physical process

292
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Cancel out

293
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Interfering signals whether there intentional or not

294
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
And also at a degraded inductors which

295
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,231
Have been kind of a holy grail for a millimeter wave circuits for a long time

296
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
And just

297
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Give Me One Reason Why

298
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
There they've been soaked up

299
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Well right now since you don't have access to Magnetic materials on chip the inductors 10 to take up

300
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
A substantial percentage of the circuit

301
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Hbase

302
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,151
If you have a magnetic material you can shrink goes down substantially

303
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Make a hole chip smaller

304
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
That means it works better and it's also cheaper

305
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Can can you say in a sentence or two what

306
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Function inductor

307
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
The inductor

308
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Smoothes out

309
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,023
High frequency signals it tends to pass lower frequency signals

310
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
And stops higher freaking

311
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
So

312
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:33,215
A very low frequencies there used to filter power supplies make noise Quiet power supplies

313
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
At higher frequencies are used is part of

314
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,871
Filter circuits to select out the frequencies you want and the frequency she don't want

315
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,991
So text me or talk about all of those programs there others that you

316
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Also overseeing

317
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
We're not going to talk about all of them now

318
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,231
But what I would like to talk about is these programs and you as a program manager in a place like DARPA

319
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,607
And what I'm getting at here is going to drop it is it's just part of it ate the overall innovation

320
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:07,007
Ecosystem you've been here since 2012 you got these programs we've talked about what is it like to be

321
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Be here in end

322
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,591
How do you think DARPA is unique

323
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,175
In The Innovation ecosystem

324
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Coming to DARPA is like

325
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
Grabbing the nose cone of a rocket and holding on for dear life

326
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,391
It's a fast-moving place

327
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,719
That has a significant impact on the trajectory of

328
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Technology for the nation

329
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
And being part of that is an incredible

330
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Thrill

331
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
The idea that you can

332
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
Come up with a technical idea that

333
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Interesting to you

334
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
And

335
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Create a community

336
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,335
To pursue that ideas is

337
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Add experience you won't get anywhere else

338
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,503
You can take flyer bets on crazy things like integrated magnetics with semiconductors

339
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
End

340
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
People will actually Soldier up and tell you how they're going to do it

341
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,183
Right so what you just said about creating communities is just something that

342
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
That I and II guess I've observed here to in the short time I've been here

343
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
And I think maybe press one of the most valuable things that happens here

344
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Sword art by which is

345
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
Is it true that you are the program managers do bring together

346
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
Handfuls of research groups

347
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
That otherwise probably would not have gotten together

348
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
But in getting together now

349
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:21,503
Create event bring together mindset skillsets toolsets ways of doing ways of thinking

350
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,831
That are unique and therefore can push into new

351
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Technological Terror

352
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Did I overstate things are that about right

353
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
Now that's about right it's very exciting

354
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,071
Can you name one science fiction technology that you just

355
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Wish

356
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Live

357
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,495
Since I commute weekly between DARPA and my home in North Carolina

358
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
That would be teleportation of course

359
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,919
But I don't think we'll ever get there we don't have any wireless communication technology that can

360
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Can transfer the amount of information

361
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
It would take you

362
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Completely disassembled Enrique

363
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Construct a human

364
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
In any reasonable amount of time

365
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
Imagine having to encode the information that

366
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,231
In every strand of DNA in every cell of your

367
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Your body

368
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
Every memory you've ever had

369
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Every scene you've ever seen

370
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Scene

371
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Take that apart

372
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Turn it into beds

373
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
Send it somewhere and then rebuild it in

374
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Physical world

375
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Driving might be

376
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
Dev I do hope that teleportation does become a reality at some point in the future is a very least to make your

377
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
Commuting and traveling around a little bit easier

378
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
I've really enjoyed the entire conversation Devin I just want to
