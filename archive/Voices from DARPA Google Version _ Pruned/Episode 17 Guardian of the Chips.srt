00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
Dell Technologies

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:18,432
The internet GPS in the palm of your hand

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,576
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War

4
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Derp

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,904
The defense Advanced research projects agency

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Has been

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Driver of techno

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
Welcome to voices from DARPA

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840
A window on a door piskor of program managers

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Their job

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,168
To redefine what is possible

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,240
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,568
It didn't please have with me in the studio Carrie Bernstein

14
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,872
A program manager since 2012

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,176
Enterprise Micro Systems Technology

16
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
That's the office

17
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
I mean the agency six technical offices that is devoted to doing more with electrons photons and electromagnetism

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,928
It's been possible in the history of Technology

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,024
Terry's curiosity and Science and Technology knows no bounds

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,656
What is background in the micro lectronics industry has everything to do with a mission he has taken on a DARPA

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
More than anyone

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,776
He's been pushing Technologies to reduce or even eliminate

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,920
The vulnerabilities to are billions of micro Electronics chips to things like hacking counterfeiting cloning

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,296
Tampering and other nefarious actions that are just no good at all for National Security

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
Pretty coming to DARPA

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
Carry an electrical engineer by training

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Like more than 30 years at IBM where he worked on a dizzying array of technical subjects including Mike

28
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
Microprocessor circuit design

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,192
High-performance low-power devices circuits and architectures

30
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,080
New technologies that could replace the basic logic switches that underlie almost all of chips today

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,944
Three-dimensional chip integration and the ways radiation can damage chips

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
Terry has co-authored

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,064
Text books on circuit design he holds 155 patents

34
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
And is a fellow of the

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
Institute of electrical and electronics engineers

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
It's my pleasure to have you in the studio today

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
What's really mind

38
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm always fascinated by the way people get interested in science and technology if there was some transformative moment or

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
Key person in your life that pointed you in that direction

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Ivan it's sort of an ax

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
And if one of the most fortunate.

42
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
Accidents I've ever known

43
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
So you can it's a little kid I was always

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
Very interested in astronomy

45
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Astrophysics

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
And God bless my daddy

47
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
He didn't understand any of the lecture

48
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
But I'd identify famous

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Astronomers

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Who's coming to

51
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Lecture at the University

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
Chicago or University of Illinois and you would take

53
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Was Wonder

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
And

55
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
I went to college anticipating I would

56
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Study apps

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Astronomy

58
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
And

59
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
I come from a family of fairly modest means

60
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
It became very apparent that

61
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
I needed to

62
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Be able to pick up my

63
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
My college cost

64
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
And

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Astronomers in St

66
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Physicist just not in real high command at

67
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
What's the time

68
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
So I looked around in my credits

69
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Reply to

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
To electrical engineering

71
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
And a normal physic

72
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
The night embarked on a career of engineering

73
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
And was the most wonderful accident

74
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,536
Let's talk about that move you made that pivot into electrical

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:20,192
And really electronic engineering as it turned out right so you can cuz you ended up going to IBM one of the most store

76
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,056
Ohrid companies and organizations when it comes to certain the entire history of micro Electronics

77
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,688
And I just would be interested in hearing about the numerous hats that you did wear there and

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
And what you learned about that

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Technology

80
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Timing is so much

81
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
And at the time that I graduated college

82
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
The technology that we use in current

83
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Computing

84
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Sea moss

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
Was just in its infancy and just for listening to might not know that that's such a familiar term if you're in that micro electron

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Phonics world the cmas stands for what terry

87
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
I've always wondered

88
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288
CMOS stands for complementary

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Metal-oxide-semiconductor

90
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
And this is this is so that the work

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
Horse technology that underlies pretty much any chip that any of our listeners might have in their computers were were

92
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Is there a dominant

93
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Capri seating

94
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Sea moss

95
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
Field-effect transistors

96
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
What's the technology called bipolar

97
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
The bipolar was very power-hungry

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
And the power was really limiting

99
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
How much you could do

100
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
So when I first

101
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Entered

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
The space

103
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
CMOS was just starting out

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
And I had the great Fortune

105
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Joining IBM

106
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,639
And IBM was leading the field in the development of

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Processes

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Circuit design

109
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Architecture

110
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
For truly high performance computing

111
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
It's over a career of 30 years

112
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
I enjoyed this

113
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
This incredible ride

114
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,999
Bringing through new materials new applications

115
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Producing the technology that went into machines that we used to play chess

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Play Jeopardy

117
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
Quite a ride

118
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,727
There's two things about your experience there that fast they make

119
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,311
One is that you became part of that IBM team

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
With a bachelor's in electrical engineering right this was from Washington University in st. Louis and then you've got several

121
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
Phds worth of Education while you were there because you don't have a Ph.D here Ivan I don't even have a masters

122
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
Don't even have a masters but when I see you in action oh my gosh right it didn't clearly you got everything that that any of them

123
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
Hyper educated people here have

124
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Are you learned it

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
Kind of insult you in the in the industry

126
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
He was

127
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
A matter of luck

128
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
That

129
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
When I entered the field the industry was moving so fast

130
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
That for me to take time away to

131
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
To take time out

132
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
To go for my graduate degree

133
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Was actually putting me behind

134
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
Because I was not getting to participate in all the game-changing

135
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
New process

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
And Chip design

137
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
Technology

138
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
She's at work

139
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Being produced

140
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
So I did take a few graduate courses

141
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
And at that point decided no I really want to

142
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Being on the

143
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
The ground floor

144
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Ryan just never look back

145
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,703
I've been very fortunate to be surrounded by just incredible human beings

146
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
There's this notion of a rising tide raises All Ships

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,639
And I've been so fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by Truliant credit

148
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
Human beings continues here

149
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,527
There's one other thing that I think emerge probably largely out of your ID

150
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Am experience

151
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
And that's your hundred and fifty-five

152
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
Who knows by now maybe this week you got another one

153
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Tell me a little bit about

154
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
Some of the ones say that

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,167
Sick in your mind most that you're most proud of or that perhaps had the most contact

156
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
Perhaps the one that sticks out in my mind

157
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
The

158
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Foremost

159
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Is general purpose

160
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Registers

161
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
4 high performance

162
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Computing

163
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
At the time and you'll have to explain that for me and what does that mean

164
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
So

165
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Clearly and thread parallel machines

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,671
There's simultaneous need for the same data in multiple locations

167
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
In microprocessor

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
And at the time

169
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
The notion was well let's keep

170
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Keep interrogating a memory over and over and

171
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Send its results

172
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
To each of the separate place

173
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
This is where it might be needed

174
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
The GPR

175
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
The general purpose register

176
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Invention

177
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
How did I develop with her

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
13

179
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,919
Allowed us to simultaneously access the same data

180
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
And send it to

181
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Different locations

182
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
At the same time

183
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
And

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
It it found its way into a lot of very high performance

185
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Which computer application

186
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
If I was to this day

187
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,999
And went when did you make this development and get this patent

188
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,863
Early my career is one of one of my first one said sometime in the 80s

189
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Yes ladies

190
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
Okay so let's not move to your dark adventure and another thing I really like to learn about from p.m.

191
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
Is the mechanism by which you ended up

192
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Getting here

193
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:49,759
So some a program manager and office director at a conference

194
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:55,135
Others just were in love with DARPA for years and years and they kind of made the initial

195
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
I reach out

196
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
How how did you actually end up here

197
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
So without going Kiki on you

198
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
Over the 30 years that I was at IBM

199
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
This this happened about seven years ago

200
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
About 7 years ago

201
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
There was a

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
I was involved course in the design and

203
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Fabrication

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
High performance

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
Computing elements

206
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
And

207
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
Became apparent there was a class

208
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Defects

209
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
The class of failures

210
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
That were

211
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Exquisitely difficult

212
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
2

213
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
A diagnosis

214
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
And a very difficult to image

215
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Or to lie

216
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Try to Define

217
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
But none the less they impacted yield BMP

218
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Performance

219
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
And in some cases

220
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Even had the ability to change

221
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
What the

222
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Computer chip was supposed

223
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,383
To do it so you're talking about defects that really go all the way down to sort of the

224
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,711
Micron scale the transistor level element level

225
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:58,111
Scale of of these chips right near exactly right and I am not smart enough to be a high-level Ark

226
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Architect I was very much

227
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
A hardware engineer

228
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
Very much about the hardware the physical design

229
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,399
And Fabrication of the actual listener is just a vision of this I believe we're probably talking of

230
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,007
About defects that could be the size of like individual biological cells 50 microns across

231
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Even smaller

232
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Indeed

233
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
Indeed and as technology scale

234
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,687
The size of the defects that were vulnerable to also

235
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Continue

236
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Shrink silk

237
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
It's essentially

238
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Beekeeper

239
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
A very very clean environment

240
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
So

241
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
If you can clear to me that there was a class of defects

242
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
That we were vulnerable

243
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
Not just from a yield or functional point of view

244
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
But that potentially someone malicious

245
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
Could intentionally assert upon a process

246
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Or a pond design

247
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
2

248
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Perhaps

249
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Compromise

250
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,615
The component or its function or its reliability its lifetime

251
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
Make a long story short I

252
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Became a

253
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Contractor

254
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
Consultant to DARPA

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
And Amethyst insulting era

256
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:06,207
Or phase of your intersection with our boys at 2 to begin to define the kinds of programs

257
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
That you ultimately would end up

258
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Running

259
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,911
With the aim of addressing the concerns that you learned about when you're a type indeed initially it was

260
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
To consult an existing program

261
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
And

262
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
I

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
Became involved in actually doing things

264
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
To computer chips

265
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
And then

266
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
The DARPA program would hire

267
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
Reverse Engineers to try to find

268
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
What was done

269
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
And

270
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
We continue to make progress

271
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
At both.

272
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Detecting

273
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
Identifying those

274
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
Those features which couldn't couldn't be detected

275
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
And

276
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
One thing led to another and after

277
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
After about a year of Consulting DARPA finally set one or two

278
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
You come to DARPA

279
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
So I retired from IBM at that point

280
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Then came the dark

281
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
To assume

282
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
The swim Lane if you want to swim Wayne of

283
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Hardware store

284
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Right and released

285
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Three of your programs and the names of them really kind of

286
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,879
Reflect just some of the goal that you have had in mind that I've been working toward

287
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
Summer referring to trusted integrated circuits which is known as

288
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
In the short form is Trust

289
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
Integrity and reliability of integrated circuits known as Iris

290
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,703
And the supply chain Hardware Integrity for electronics

291
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Defense

292
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Which

293
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
Is it known as short as Shield

294
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,407
Each one has its own individual aspects but together there's a certain kind of theme

295
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
And I'm wondering if you can actually sort of talked about them

296
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Collectively

297
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
And of course diving into each one as you might

298
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
Feel so inclined indeed

299
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
God bless our warfighters

300
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
It is critical now

301
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
For us

302
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
To make sure that

303
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
Not just the mission is successful that that were protecting the warfighters

304
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Executing atmel

305
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
Electronic components

306
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
We used to support that mission

307
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Need to be

308
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Authentic

309
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,895
We need to make sure that those parts do no more and no less than they're supposed to

310
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
But they were built where they claim to be when they were claimed to be

311
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
We have to make sure that they last for the full stated lifetime

312
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
We have to make sure that

313
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
There is no

314
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,719
Nothing done to that component during the supply chain during distribution

315
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
But there are no Trojan horses

316
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Or Easter eggs

317
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
If you will better built in

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
And this is challenging right to rebuke because in the

319
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
Creation of a chip in the fabrication of a chip

320
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
There's so many players

321
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
It's so many different places that

322
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
And somebody can have your fingers on it

323
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
That that you really need some way of tracking

324
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
That's exactly right

325
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Once Upon a Time

326
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Chain of custody was a sufficient means

327
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
Up tracking

328
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
The authenticity and integrity of our component

329
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
But micro-electronics

330
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
Has indeed become global

331
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
And right about the time that I warned DARPA

332
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
That there could be

333
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
An issue in the space

334
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
V electronics

335
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Space indeed

336
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Went global

337
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
This the design is

338
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
We're not the only smart

339
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
People in the world

340
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
And so

341
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Because of this

342
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
It was critical

343
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
That we develop those tools necessary

344
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
2

345
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
To be able to

346
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Confirm the Integrity of the

347
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,975
One of the most audacious trajectory that you've been taking it and I get it just amazes me the progress that you and your performers

348
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Is

349
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
With

350
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
Tiny little triplets about the size of

351
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Glitter particles

352
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
I don't want to say anything more cuz I want you to

353
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Tell listeners said just what you been up to with your

354
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Performance on this task

355
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
Before you can go there

356
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
I'm reminded that

357
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
It's one thing to come up with a challenge

358
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
But it's quite another

359
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
To go

360
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Execute

361
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Go accomplish

362
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
Such a challenge

363
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
And to be clear the heroes in the space

364
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Are the performers that DARPA has

365
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Tired

366
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Be a contract

367
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
To go solve this

368
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
I'm astounded daily just

369
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Pick 3

370
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
Creativity the amount of themselves that they pour into the ceph

371
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
Birthday they skip holidays they stay home over

372
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
State they work

373
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
True Christmas sometimes in order to deliver

374
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Products

375
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Pictures of

376
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
The one that you're referring to Shield

377
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
The threat space is large

378
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
The threat space

379
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Of mic electronic Component begins InDesign

380
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
It goes right through fabrication

381
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,207
And then after fabrication and packaging it goes through distribution

382
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
Shield is a tagging

383
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Shield

384
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
Is is a means of authenticating

385
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
The parts that

386
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
We

387
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
Use it are most sensitive applications they have

388
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
To be the correct part

389
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,591
For a number of reasons the existing authentication Technologies were

390
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Necessary but not

391
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Sufficient

392
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
So Shield is a microscopic tagging

393
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,551
We hope to get it into the world records here before we are all done

394
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,391
But it is used to make sure that this is the part

395
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
That we intended

396
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
To go into

397
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Our defenses

398
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
It has five special sauce

399
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
The first

400
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
Is a hardware root of trust

401
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Every single microscopic

402
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Shield

403
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Chip

404
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Has a unique identifier

405
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
II

406
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Special Sauce

407
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
The heat shield I contains

408
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Is an AES 256-bit

409
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
Encryption engine

410
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
100000 transistors

411
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
On a chip that is 100 microns by odd

412
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Backgrounds

413
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
The 3rd

414
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
Is sensors that sense

415
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
If

416
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
The Shield ship has been corrupted

417
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Compromised

418
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Could Michael Dan any

419
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Given way

420
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
The 4th

421
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Is an antenna

422
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Because it's way too small

423
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Contact

424
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,103
And so because that we have to talk to with RF physical contact is too small

425
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
That's correct

426
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
V is

427
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Self destruct capable

428
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
But if you attempt to remove it

429
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
From The Host

430
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Component

431
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
It will cease to be functional

432
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
The part is powered

433
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
By the

434
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
By the interrogator is it

435
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Sweetly supper

436
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Heard from the host component

437
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
The goal is that at any time

438
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
At any place

439
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
An untrained operator

440
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
With no special

441
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,007
Equipment in this case being just an iPhone or smartphone

442
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,567
Can test the Integrity of their components

443
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
At any time and place

444
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
And get immediate

445
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Trustworthy

446
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Results

447
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
For free

448
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Shield cost one tenth of a cent

449
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,599
And the entire operation would cost less than $0.01

450
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Every time

451
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
You wished authenticate the part

452
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,511
When you authenticate the part it also reports the GPS location

453
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
And the TCP IP network address

454
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Of where it was two

455
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
In this way

456
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
At least for the most

457
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Serious

458
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Over counter fit in phone threats

459
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
We believe we have a very cost

460
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Effective solution

461
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
The goal is to make sure that

462
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Counterfeiting and cloning

463
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Becomes

464
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Too expensive

465
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
It takes too long

466
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
For the bad guy

467
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
Right absolutely amazing description I mean this sounds to me like a bat

468
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
The highest of high technology

469
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
A certain length in the synthesis the way you're mixing and matching

470
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,863
Different kinds of Technologies also is just to me one of the things that characterizes

471
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,007
A lot of what's going on here at one thing I'm somewhat of a pain in the rear to my performers about

472
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,079
Because I'm just a knuckle-dragger hardware engineer

473
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Everything we do

474
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
You have to be able to hold it in your hand

475
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
And this is a program

476
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
Especially this program where it's not rainbows coming out of keyboards are unicorns sleeping over Terminals and Magic

477
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Will happen

478
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
This has to be

479
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Deterministic

480
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Quantitative

481
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,279
Very analytic real engineering

482
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,607
And after the initial Technologies were developed

483
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Shield

484
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Is about

485
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Good engineer

486
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
We've engineered

487
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
A beautiful Prada

488
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,031
All right well since you're all about that kind of ground truthing

489
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
Where are we at with the with this

490
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Program with these tiny little

491
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
Triplets how would you characterize the status

492
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Shield is a 3-phase program

493
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
Phase one was to go develop

494
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
Those five core Technologies

495
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
Because they really did not exist

496
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
At that scale all five

497
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
Have been demonstrated to be

498
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Functional

499
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,351
Phase two is the integration of those Technologies

500
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Into the shield

501
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Prototype

502
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
Phase 3 of the program

503
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Which is the field test

504
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Of Shield

505
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Will begin

506
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
Early in 2018

507
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
The field testing

508
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
Is supported by

509
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,575
Some wonderful companies that we won't identify right now that have volunteered their supply chain

510
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
And we will do things

511
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
What's the components

512
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Windshield attached

513
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
And use their supply chains

514
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
And we will see how effective Shield is

515
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
In Catching

516
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Hickory we talked about

517
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Shield

518
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
I do want to go back to to the other programs that you work on one of them is completed now and one of them is still in progress it was

519
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
Start with trusted integrated circuits Trust

520
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
I wish I believed

521
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
Kind of one of the earliest programs YouTube

522
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,015
Trust was the program that I actually began supporting before I enter

523
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
Trust was a program

524
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,879
To make sure that we could verify

525
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,975
Set apart is doing no more and no less than it is supposed to do

526
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
Trust was a large program

527
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Lots and lots of achievements

528
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
We developed microscopes

529
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
We develop Solutions

530
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,007
For pulling netless if you will the schematic

531
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
From Chip

532
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,591
To make sure that the schematic is what it's supposed to

533
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
We look at both cots

534
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
Commercial off-the-shelf product

535
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
As well as Gods parts

536
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Government-owned components

537
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
We looked at field programmable gate arrays

538
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
As well as Asic

539
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
The output of that program

540
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
Is installed in a number of agencies

541
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
All over the country

542
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
And stopping Leverage

543
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,447
Ready when you mentioned a 6in field programmable gate array names for

544
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
Other kinds of categories of integrated circuits

545
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
That have different capabilities

546
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,407
But all of which are used today and all of which we really need to feel very confident about is correct

547
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
So that's trust in that completed

548
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
A year or two ago when did that included

549
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
About

550
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
18 month

551
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,439
So obviously there's parts of the spirit of that program that are part of Shield

552
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,303
And the other program I just wanted to say a little bit about this one continues

553
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,935
Today and that's the integrity and reliability of integrated circuits program or Aires

554
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
The question that Iris answered was

555
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
If indeed we know that this component

556
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
Has not been compromised

557
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
In its function

558
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,455
Can we still be assured that it has not been compromised

559
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
And its integrity

560
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
How do we make sure with

561
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
With a low sample size

562
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,391
That this component indeed fulfills

563
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
Its lifetime spec

564
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Its reliability

565
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
That it is up to the task

566
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
A performing

567
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
For $20,000 an hour

568
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
Or 100000 power in hours

569
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
Or whatever the spec is

570
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
That mission that is critical

571
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
2

572
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
To the defense

573
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
That it's installed in

574
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
Okay and this is to defend against such things as counterfeiting practicewear an old

575
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,855
Call Chip might be taken out of some unit it might than the blacktop right where new kind of

576
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,000
Packaging is put on with new printing looks new but in fact it's old and so might not be able to actually live

577
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Up to its

578
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
Suspect that a user expects

579
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
That's correct Ivan

580
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
Just like human beings age

581
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
In automobiles rust

582
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
There's a lifetime to electronic components

583
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
And

584
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,848
The lifetime must be we depend on that lifetime when the Windows system

585
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Is built

586
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
For that part to execute its function

587
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,504
Even without the malicious intent

588
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
We need to know we need to be able to

589
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Very quickly assess

590
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
The reliability

591
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Of a part

592
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Concurrently

593
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
The reliability science

594
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Is is a

595
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Is very involved

596
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Painful

597
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Long-term

598
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
And so

599
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Iris

600
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Looked

601
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
To try to

602
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
Improve the turnaround

603
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
I'm the testing

604
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Reliability

605
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,920
I want to move to a couple of other questions before we we close out

606
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,784
One of them is really I want you to reflect a little bit about micro Electronics

607
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
As a technology in your

608
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,904
Roll your beer several decades roll in

609
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,792
Pushing that technology forward and doing whatever you can to ensure the integrity and safety of it

610
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,632
And you know with some programs even moving forward thinking about

611
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:34,496
Next Generations of Mike electronic devices even in the nanoscale area

612
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,080
So so that we continue to have a

613
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Progressive technology micro Electronics

614
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
As you think about all of that me what excites you about this category of technology and Terry what

615
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
I've been few months ago I had the

616
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Privilege of

617
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,000
Spending a week with a 311th Fighter Squadron

618
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
At Holloman Air Force Base

619
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
In New Mexico

620
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
And after spending a week of them sharing

621
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
With me

622
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
What they do

623
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
I have the opportunity at the end of that week

624
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
To describe

625
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
To them what I do

626
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
And that's when it hit me

627
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,408
My son is training to be an A-10

628
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Fighter pilot

629
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
The warthog

630
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
And when I

631
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Got in front of the audience

632
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
They all look like Mikey

633
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Y'all look like

634
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
My son

635
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
And I'm retarded

636
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Steven hard now to talk

637
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
It's not just

638
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,912
As a DARPA program manager

639
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
Where is an engineer

640
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
As a parent

641
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
How many people

642
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Everyone of course Wishes the best

643
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
Our warfighters

644
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
How many people actually

645
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Current position to do some

646
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
It was one of the greatest

647
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Epiphanies

648
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Of my time at DARPA

649
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
Worcester realize that

650
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
I've been trusted

651
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
With

652
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
All this

653
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Resource

654
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
And funding

655
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
And

656
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Security

657
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
And

658
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Given everything I need

659
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
To go do what I know needs

660
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Redone

661
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
If I fail it's my fault

662
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Because this

663
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,616
God bless this agency is giving me it's giving me

664
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Everything

665
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
I need to succeed and it's all on me

666
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
And that's what's driving me and

667
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
In front of an audience like that

668
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
They deserve no less

669
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
Thanks for that.

670
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:32,768
You've been here since 2012 so you've been here longer than a lot of program managers and you probably are coming toward the tail end

671
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
When are you leaving

672
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
A September of

673
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
September 18th

674
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,776
I'm not actually sure you're even going to be able to see Shield through all the way to the end I know that that's you're going to

675
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,104
The most of the way but I'm I imagine you're going to be handing off some of the final

676
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Testing

677
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:54,528
I'm just wondering with six years of of participation in this agency which is part of the the

678
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
Innovation ecosystem

679
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,928
What you have learned about it as an organization is it

680
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
Culture index

681
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Darpa's incredible

682
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Place

683
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Just incredible

684
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Place

685
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,400
Of course it's a human organization so it's given to

686
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
All the variation that

687
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Human

688
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Endeavor

689
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
Introduces but it's such a rare place

690
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,848
To be given the opportunity

691
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
To go

692
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Develop those ideas

693
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Which you know

694
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
Can be made to work

695
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Is a once in a life

696
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Do you have any thoughts about

697
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,136
Post DARPA phase of of your professional Adventure

698
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,696
There are certain capabilities

699
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
This nation urgently needs

700
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,560
And I'm pouring the concrete in those holes

701
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,608
As quickly as I possibly can

702
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,680
My intent when I complete my DARPA post

703
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:48,032
Is to be able to move into a position where I will be allowed to continue

704
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Toopoor that cock

705
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
Well I for one will be excited to watch you as you take your programs through to the point that you will be able

706
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
Able to end to see what you do

707
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
When you leave here now bringing your dark experience my preps back into the private sector and Industry whatever you might do

708
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,512
Where was I wish you the best of luck

709
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,328
We are at the end of our time here

710
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,400
This podcast I just want to thank you for

711
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
Spending this time with me

712
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Oh thank you Ivan

713
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
Composure

714
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,544
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us

715
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,128
I hope you join us again for the next voices from DARPA

716
