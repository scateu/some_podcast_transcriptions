00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,992
Technology is a driver of our times

00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,160
DARPA defense Advanced research projects agency

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
Has been a driver

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Technology

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Welcome to

00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
Voices from DARPA

A window into darkness core of program manager

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Their job

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
To redefine with

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
My name is Tyler McQuade

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,592
Since 2013 I've been a program manager and darpa's defense sign

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Lance's office

15
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
And I'm your docker host

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Ivan Amato

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
Tyler I'd like to

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Start out with

19
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Learning a little bit about you

20
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,832
So maybe you could tell us

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
Something about your background and

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
How that relates to

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
The kinds of programs

24
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
You've been

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
Developing and

26
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,048
I've been on the molecular

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
I love Molly

28
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
I have since I was in high school

29
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
And even Beyond

30
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
High School too early

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
I'm a Survivor Nova Junkie

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Cosmos

33
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,920
Billions and billions of stars while I was more interested in the billions and billions of moloch

34
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
I've always wanted to be in

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Explorer

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
By the time I

37
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Got to the edge

38
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
Yo I might explore some

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Aldi

40
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Charted land

41
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
Charted and there were no more Uncharted

42
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
So

43
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
I looked kind of Frontiers that

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
You couldn't see

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
And molecules fit

46
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
Little more defined in physics

47
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Cuz you can put it in a bottle a lot of times

48
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Especially in the area of

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Berri Conker

50
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Organic Center

51
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
You can make

52
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Stuff in NC

53
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Set the properties

54
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Play with

55
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
The combination of atoms that are together

56
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Really it

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Was sort of this

58
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Pallet that

59
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
I really like that

60
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Or in the world

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
Always been amazed at how

62
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
YouTube

63
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Just putting together atoms and

64
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
Certain geometry certain bonding

65
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
Can come together into materials

66
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
With all kinds of

67
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Different properties

68
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Skin

69
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
I mean

70
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Hugo from

71
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
Having something that can form life

72
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
To something that is

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Explodes

74
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Do something to make

75
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
It's beautiful colors to something that makes

76
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Is your cookie

77
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
You smell great

78
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Taste great

79
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Your molecules

80
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,232
Directions are not that many molecules people.

81
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
So as a rep

82
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
This minority

83
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
How are you taking that info

84
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
In the form of

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,264
In the defense Sciences office one of the things that's going on right now one of the

86
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Zeitgeist

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Inside

88
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Revolutionising science

89
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
How do we do

90
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
Science but faster

91
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Better

92
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
And one of the things that is interesting about chemistry especially when we're talking about the makers the people who make meth

93
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
Materials make small molecules make medicine

94
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
It's a really slow process

95
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,864
I really like the idea of Reinventing science and in chemistry there's a lot of opportunity to reinvent the science

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,424
Somebody ask when you say Reinventing science

97
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Did you mean the actual process that we were asking questions that we were trying to answer those questions and if so can you be

98
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
No more details about what you have in mind

99
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Chemistry is a tough subject

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
We have lots of parameters that we don't often know how we're controlling them but if we did all of the chemistry in much more

101
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Controlled environment where the environment was being constantly monitored we might come up with much much more reproducible

102
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
Which will then mean if it

103
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Transportable

104
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,936
So another words if I have a machine that's doing the chemical reaction recording how it's done

105
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
The knock code

106
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
That record

107
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Can be sent from one laptop to another

108
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
So you could accelerate it in the same way that the internet allows you to accelerate how information was transportable would if you could

109
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
To do that with

110
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
With molecules

111
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,088
Tell her this might be a good time to talk a little bit about

112
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,696
But you were the programs that you're working on and what I have in mind is the full defect program

113
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
And the make it

114
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Program so why don't we start with

115
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Old effects

116
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Old effects

117
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,191
That's a program that stands for folded non natural polymers

118
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
With biological function

119
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
In the fold effects program

120
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
We're making

121
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
A polymers that mimic natural polymers

122
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
So that we might

123
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Make

124
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
Biotherapeutics more Robux

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
The right now if you

126
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
I'll get one of the more modern drugs right now

127
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
A good portion of them are made from proteins think

128
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Something like

129
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,303
Entire bodies so for example Humira

130
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,631
Or insulin those are examples of protein Biotherapeutics

131
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
The problem is they are not heat stable

132
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
And

133
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,543
If it's something isn't heat Sable it's not going to end up in a medic bag

134
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,895
To our soldiers at the very place where they're going to be most vulnerable

135
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,759
Don't have access to the most advanced medicine because many of them were just fragile

136
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,599
And so we have to transport them back to an environment where

137
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
You have refrigerators you have

138
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,743
Handling equipment that can allow you to control that

139
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
That environment around the medicine

140
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
What if you were to make

141
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
An unnatural

142
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,679
There are lots of natural fibers that we used to use

143
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,031
And we've replaced them with non natural fibers because there more robots to me like Silk

144
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Tonight

145
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Yeah exactly

146
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
So if you were to take those same sort of beneficial properties of yet

147
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,295
Plastics in the word merge them with the beneficial properties of the biological polymers like proteins and DNA

148
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
And so that's

149
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
The full defect program but it's a platform it's about

150
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,207
How we make those and then how we discover them

151
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
So anyway if you think about

152
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
All of the possible molecules that one could make the small ones you know like like an aspirin or the larger one

153
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Ones like these

154
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
Protein-based medicines you're talking about

155
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:08,127
They're really sort of an infinite to two possibilities like an infinite space that you could possibly search the app

156
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,711
What you're saying here is your trying to develop some tools that will enable

157
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
Even just a few people to 2

158
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
Go explore some of the regions of this Infinite Space that just have not been looked at before am I getting them on track

159
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,047
Oh you're so untrack you get back to my whole desire to explore that I talked about you know it's from my childhood

160
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
It is really about giving

161
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
Researchers a capability to be able to explore these these universes it's almost like a Hubble

162
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Horoscope for

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,359
This particular Galaxy or Universe of molecular space

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
So that was fold effects yam

165
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,271
I'm also interested in the make it program can you say a little bit about what you're doing there

166
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,367
Make it is a platform technology for making small molecules

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,231
And in this particular case were trying to do is we're trying to democratize

168
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Chemistry

169
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
So what if you could have

170
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
A system

171
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,911
Did a biologist or any scientist came up and typed in the target

172
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
And the Machine figured out how to make it

173
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
Even if there was no recipe available

174
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,127
So that the machine would figure out a possible set of

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,271
Ways to make something and then would go about testing each one of those ways until it found a solution

176
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
Then it would log that solution in a cloud or in its databank

177
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,975
And now that molecule could be made anytime in addition the

178
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
System would also figure out how to make more of it

179
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
So they usually it would do really small scale synthesis that means no mg and then once it figured out a solution

180
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
Send it with an also automatically scale it up

181
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,103
Can you offer to us in a concrete example maybe you could think of a

182
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:48,479
Problem or a particular receptor for example on a cell that you might want as a Target

183
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
And then explain how

184
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
The make it

185
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Framework would go about

186
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Interacting with that

187
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,231
The receptor in prep solving a medical or other biological problem

188
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Yeah

189
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
You'll for example one very popular Target for the heart disease areas pcsk9

190
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
And so there's probably

191
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,543
Many papers that come out every year that describe

192
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
Inhibitors that have been discovered against that

193
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Target

194
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
The structures are available

195
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,831
Let's say that I'm a researcher and I want to study some aspect of a complex cellular system and having access

196
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
To the pcsk9 inhibitor

197
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Would be really useful

198
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,535
But maybe I want one that's selected in a certain way that isn't commercially available

199
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
But somebody's reported it

200
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Now I might contact that researcher who's made it before and maybe they ran out and scan take them three months to make it

201
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
But if I have access to a make it device

202
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
I can just go type in the structure

203
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
And have the material

204
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
Maybe the next day or at the end of the week

205
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
And in addition to that

206
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
I have it memorized

207
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
The machine has

208
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Kept that in his memory bank so if someone else in my

209
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
University environment for example wants to make that

210
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
They type it in and it'll be out that day

211
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
Cuz the solution were already be there

212
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
It's a way of saying

213
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,191
Chemistry has been documented

214
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,263
Since its Inception especially some type of synthetic chemistry

215
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Through

216
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
What are called experimentals

217
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
These are documents that the researcher is

218
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,271
Using to try to capture what they did in the laboratory make something to writing it down like a recipe

219
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
So a lot of times we'll leave out details

220
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
That we think are not necessary

221
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
But are necessary

222
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
And sometimes we didn't even know they were necessary so when another researcher comes in and tries to read that cookbook like it

223
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
Experimental it might take them months to reproduce

224
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
And I mean ever

225
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Why should we

226
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
Waste our human effort

227
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
By not making sure that we document that outcome that experiment in a way that can guarantee reproduction

228
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
So you're talking about

229
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Capturing procedural knowledge

230
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Correct

231
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,207
Yes the make it system is not just a artificial intelligence system Mora

232
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
Cloud system that's

233
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Archiving

234
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
It's a machine that's doing the chemistry

235
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
So that the machine will be reproducible you'll be able to recreate that machine in any lab you want as long as

236
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
You replicate that machine Faithfully

237
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,383
And it runs the routines that you've recorded in one lab

238
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Versus another Faithfully

239
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
You're going to reproduce chemistry

240
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Everywhere

241
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
You want to

242
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,111
What are the things that I find fascinating about DARPA is

243
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
That it is perhaps unique in its place in the overall technology developed

244
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Ecosystem

245
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
And it's a program manager and someone who's been in academe and I think also an industry and now here

246
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Adorable

247
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
Can you talk to us a little bit about

248
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
How dark I might be playing some interesting or breathy the unique roles in the overall technology ecosystem

249
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Yeah I think it's a

250
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Very exciting role

251
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
DARPA is that one

252
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Place

253
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Where

254
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
We are thinking about

255
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Innovation unconstrained

256
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Like where can we go

257
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,143
In my mind the reason why we're doing that is because it fits our mission space if you want to

258
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
Creator for been surprised it's best to get to that new

259
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
Universe of chemistry sooner

260
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
Rather than later

261
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
And so we take

262
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,967
Innovations from all of the other funding agencies in other words they're seeding it

263
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,087
And we look for when a wave is beginning and we push it hard and let it crust fast

264
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
DARPA is

265
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
Critical because we are

266
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Or structuring

267
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
What I consider to be that

268
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Crescendo investment

269
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,911
As we are trending toward something amazing and no

270
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,567
The internet is an example and I'm really emulating that with make it I want to create the internet

271
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Of molecules

272
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,431
How do you transfer molecules from one place to another

273
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
In the same way is a 3D printing concept

274
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,575
You have a design you can put that design in the cloud

275
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,415
And then if you have a 3D printer you could transfer that design from one place to another

276
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
So they're related

277
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
And I'm

278
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,071
Constantly inspired by what DARPA has done previously

279
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,471
Is there a question Tyler that you wished I'd ask you during this discussion that I didn't end up so

280
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
Ask the question yourself and answer it

281
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,615
What's my favorite aspect of chemistry

282
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:37,247
The answer for most, what what's the answer for most of this chemist Ivan do you know

283
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,367
I love that the structure of a molecule relates to its function

284
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
I love that one

285
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,719
Yeah most of my friends maybe or Serta cro-magnons I guess

286
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
Everybody likes explosions

287
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
But actually like the smell

288
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
Of organic chemistry so pretty much almost all Asters like you know when people go into like 31 flavors

289
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
Laborers are thinking of maybe in a mint chocolate chip I'm actually smelling all of the Esters and wondering I wonder if

290
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,271
Is that this Ester or that after directly refers to a particular

291
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,623
Chemical Motif if I work off my own organic chemistry part of it there's a

292
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
Carbon with a

293
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,255
Oxygen double bond and a few other things we don't have to go into the details except to say

294
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
That is a particular kind of

295
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Molecular variation

296
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Yeah classic compound

297
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,959
So I really like the class of compounds that are

298
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
Associated with flavorings and I don't mean just not natural flavorings I mean natural and non natural light

299
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
A coconut

300
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
It smells the way it does because of chemistry

301
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,575
Not that that always just really made me excited that's how it really enjoyed

302
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,671
Talking with you today about that your programs about chemistry that DARPA

303
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
I said thanks for being here

304
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
Ivan it's always a pleasure to be with you and thanks for having me I'm really glad to relate my thoughts about chemistry and DARPA

305
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
And thank you listeners for sharing this time with us

306
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
