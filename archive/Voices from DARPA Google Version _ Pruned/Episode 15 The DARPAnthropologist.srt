00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
The internet

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
Palm of your hands

3
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War DARPA the defense

4
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
Advanced research projects agency

5
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
Has been a driver of this technology

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:36,096
Welcome to voices from DARPA a window onto darpa's core of program manager

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Their job

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,424
To redefine what is possible

9
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,752
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host

10
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,056
Today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio

11
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
Adam Russell

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,176
Program manager since 2015 in Darkness defense Sciences office

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
Sometimes referred to as

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
DARPA Starbucks

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,576
Because it's programs dive deeply into fundamental science

16
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
In search of New Foundations for never-before-seen technology

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,304
Adam stands out at DARPA partly because he is 6 feet 4 inches tall and carries a rugby players physique

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
But more importantly because he is an anthropologist and social scientist

19
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:16,288
That makes him a rare bird of the agency where the social sciences have not had a strong presence for decades

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,640
Adam earned his bachelor's degree in cultural anthropology from Duke University

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,760
And his doctor of Philosophy degree in social anthropology from Oxford University in England

22
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,064
Where he was also a Rhodes Scholar

23
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,928
Prior to joining DARPA he was a program manager at the intelligence Advanced research projects

24
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
Activity I arpa

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
A DARPA like organization under the office of the Director of National Intelligence

26
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
At DARPA

27
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,728
Adam Russell has been taking the agency into Uncharted territories with ambitious goals and include

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
Fundamentally recasting have social science is done

29
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
To the

30
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,176
The questions experiments data and conclusions of its practitioners

31
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
Are better more reliable more telling and predictive

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Of The Human Experience

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
Never in the history of social science

34
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
One more thing

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
His new baby girl has been schooling him in ways

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
The institutions of Higher Learning have been unable to

37
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Adam Russell

38
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Thanks for joining me this video.

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Don't think there are things around me

40
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
So let's start off by talking about how you became interested in science in general and more specifically in the social science

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
And even more particularly in cultural anthropology

42
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
My real exercise comes from my own experience

43
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
As a child I moved around a lot

44
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
My stepfather was in the Foreign Service

45
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,368
I was in different schools every year for about 5 or 6 years straight

46
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Africa

47
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Europe

48
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
And it just because

49
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,816
Mini cultural context with offenders in formal education

50
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
As you pointed out being the

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Set a primary driver there

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
Realization quickly that 13 year olds are not the same ever

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,288
Toughen up being 30 year olds now move two entirely different culture

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Expectations rules

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Rules change

56
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
Well you start figuring out first ball

57
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
That the world does Andre differ

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
But that that is not an attractive

59
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
Boundary that you can actually understand what the world

60
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
In some cases

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
If your 13 and a new school you have to

62
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Survival

63
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
In other cases it's really to Dalton with your benefits

64
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Did you understand how

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Sync work

66
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
In an organism cell

67
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,984
So even at the age of 13 you were we were observing cultural differences and

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
Evidently you brought that into your program when you got into college well right the social sciences

69
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Swath of of disciplines

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
And I'm fairly as a

71
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Is Regina.

72
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,856
But I wouldn't anthropology specifically I think because it was obvious

73
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,696
That anthropology allows you to come to be a practitioner of all trades

74
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Caressa master of none

75
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
But you touched every facet

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
Of The Human Experience

77
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
So

78
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
You can't do as apology if you don't also understand something

79
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
About economics

80
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Politics religion

81
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Exchange symbolism

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
And what I was particularly focused on which was identity

83
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
The concept of identity

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
I think really is what distinguishes

85
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,760
Humans human social behavior from other natural

86
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Physical sciences

87
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,368
Identity is a very rich and complex idea

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,000
I mean they're all kinds of identities that that we can assume I want you to talk a little bit about identity I know that

89
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,351
When you were at Oxford that your dissertation really focused on the subject

90
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Right well so I was

91
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Focus on what

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
I was described by thinking in some areas of crisis

93
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
And let me give you a little context

94
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
4/4 a

95
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,199
So we talked about Johnny English anthropology is well

96
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Twokinds

97
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
A different husband

98
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Physical anthropology

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Wichita

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
My grandmother when she's asking for

101
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
What the hell are you doing over there

102
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,743
Food is apologies really the study like other Natural Sciences of the world that makes us

103
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
How Evolution has led to her

104
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Species

105
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Trades

106
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
Metaphysics that are that are play

107
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
Cultural ecology really study the world we make for ourselves

108
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Into their we

109
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
Veer into the realm of collected fictions

110
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
Economies the organization

111
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
And as I said that genitti's that we have and share

112
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,759
Develop and just wait when you say collected fictions just to be clear because I think of

113
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,855
Of Economics for example as a real thing but when you said when you use the language

114
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
A collective fiction just

115
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Explain that for a listener

116
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,231
Well it's the great term from Harare who wrote

117
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,583
Sapiens and I think he's right that our species competitive Advantage is our ability to sort of

118
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Agree to believe in things at

119
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Actually aren't real

120
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
But in the process I should make him real

121
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Anacondas are just like

122
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
As you can see

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Genesis the challenge

124
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
That we want to model sort of financial crises

125
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
The crashes as

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
Beobank certain fundamental physical law straps

127
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
What kind of top models from physics

128
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
The problem is

129
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,695
Is that by virtue of action modeling a phenomenon you can lead people to believe

130
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
That it could occur

131
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
So you actually created the phenomenon you were trying to stand the first

132
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
Show

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
That that

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,447
Fiction fiction doesn't mean it's not still impact or effect

135
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Affecting the real

136
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
And we've all that way to do that because there is great power

137
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
We all believe in kind of this

138
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Efficient

139
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
Do we can get along we can solve the coordination

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Which is which is

141
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
Fundamental to complex societies

142
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
We also need two sources of complex

143
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
If my flight to fiction is differ from your class

144
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
We are we at work

145
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
Alright so let me steer you back though it took you away from

146
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,071
The crisis of identity which was again the focus of what you were studying as a graduate student at Oxford

147
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:32,447
Write this in the gym machines or the other world that makes us in the world we make for ourselves

148
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Well he freaks me those words are blurry

149
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
All right we have increasing power over the physical natural world

150
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
Crises in which the world we made for ourselves no longer

151
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,783
Fits or explains or aligns with the natural world

152
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
Show all the categories that we use to classify the real world

153
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Things like masculine

154
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Tricia Nixon what makes a man

155
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,839
Well that doesn't actually works only in a world in which

156
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Men are not making more money than women wear

157
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Eventually that has been sore

158
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
A cultural stereotype

159
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
But when the fundamentals of the world being the shift

160
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Identity sometimes

161
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Whack

162
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Behind have to catch up

163
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
That leads to crisis

164
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Because

165
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,247
I'm in very real sense of human I am my identity

166
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
That's how I see my

167
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Repurpose gives

168
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Behavior

169
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
Chesak the crises really not to

170
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
How do we add Associates

171
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Social behaviors and I

172
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
And identity

173
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
When the world is changing

174
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
And some people do it more successful than others and I use the term crisis

175
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
In this case not in the same way it's like a refugee crisis

176
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
I'm over there in Portuguese did not unrelated

177
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
When you see these

178
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
Disjoncteur you see the discrepancy between

179
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
A social identity and

180
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
In the world

181
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Once explained in August please

182
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,599
Unfortunately you know what the nature of our species sometimes to respond violently to try to push the world back into the category that we

183
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
We think it should be in

184
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
Or that it wasn't where we know we understand things

185
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Now we dumb

186
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
And that can be really disturbing for

187
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
Right and just think again to give listeners some sense of the

188
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Kinds of identities

189
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
That

190
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
You are

191
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,799
Probably beginning to think about and and preps investigating a new ways to your programs here

192
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
There we have a sense of

193
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,943
Who we are as as individuals as

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
Individuals within different social context

195
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
We have gender identity we have belief proof

196
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
That we belong to

197
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,023
There are State identities are School identities their national identity some of us try to be worlds

198
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
Citizens and Southerners there's our Global identity

199
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,471
It rated me that's the kind of mix of things that you're talking about we're talking about identity in and Ivan it it took you all of that

200
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
10 seconds to identify why social sciences

201
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Are up against such a hard problem

202
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
You just listed

203
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
All those things that are probably important Relic

204
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
For any particular social

205
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Question

206
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
How do you factor all those things in how do you figure out what the most

207
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
Important to understand the Dynamics

208
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
And I Look to You know I'm a psychologist if people study

209
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Animals

210
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,791
Where they live somewhere challenges in the complexity of sometimes it's like chimps

211
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Gemporia station beer

212
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
But to date no one has had to deal with

213
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
As far as we know Mars is chimpanzee

214
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,495
Gypsy junk in cells develop new social identity

215
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
And have those identities

216
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Be more less router under different conditions

217
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,735
Well you just give me an excuse to ask you a question, based on some prior discussions we've had things I've heard you say witches

218
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
That social science is harder than say physics

219
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
Which I love the idea and I think you've got a good

220
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Argument which is

221
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Well 80

222
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
It's not my arm

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,167
Wright's out Nobel prize-winning physicist Murray gell-mann in 5 min

224
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
Richmond Inn in Murray

225
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
But he's mine

226
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,407
How much harder physics would be if electrons could think and had feelings

227
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
Summarizes nicely I think

228
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Open question

229
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
That I'm actually trying to tackle here at

230
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,927
Through couple programs potentially more and ideally with

231
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
It was support for

232
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,559
A future part of managers interest in this area and we will get to those in particular later

233
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,679
You know you can tell the difference between the billions of dollars

234
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Time invested in physics

235
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,591
And the probably Millions if not billions of hours of intellectual labor compared to weapon of essence social

236
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
Are we at the stage where we just need better tools

237
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
Do understand these things like identities that done amateur play

238
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
Or we about to discover that wow this is really a dick

239
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
This is the stuff I sort of

240
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
Standard scientific approach

241
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
We need to think about this in new ways

242
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Is because

243
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
There are these are wicked problems waiting for

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
One of which is

245
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
You change the very system you're studying

246
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
I'm so so that's an open question but I do think right now

247
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
I would I would say is harder

248
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
The weather that's always the case with it's a function of we just haven't

249
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
The tools whether it's a function the subject matter itself

250
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,431
I think it is like I said no one question and one that

251
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
I think really we need to understand from

252
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Even a National City

253
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
Right well and one of the things DARPA

254
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
It is charged with doing is not only

255
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
Doing R&D that that's sort of

256
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,023
Specify begins to determine what is

257
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Possible

258
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:19,935
But also to get a handle on what are fundamental constraints and limitations so

259
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,543
And that's actually an exciting kind of space of uncertainty to be in

260
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
We're going to move into into a sort of a DARPA segments here in a second but

261
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,943
But before we move away from your

262
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Schooling in your

263
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
Time-It Oxford I just want to ask you about your your rugby career in your rugby experience because I think in some ways

264
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,999
Your experience in that social and cultural context

265
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Has informed

266
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,911
Some of the questions that you asking and the way you go about thinking about cultural anthropology and now

267
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
In

268
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
The kind of DARPA

269
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,311
National Security contact so talk to me about you know rugby and how informed why you think now

270
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
Interesting I probably haven't reflected enough upon that

271
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Did they give you an intelligent answer

272
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
That's right that's right

273
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,135
There's a selection bias problem perhaps in that did I choose rob you to drive you choose me

274
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,439
I'm not a natural athlete by any means but I

275
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
For some reason to

276
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Cookwell for sport and I think part of it is

277
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
Because it is such an inherently social

278
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
It really is a team Orange

279
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
40 degrees

280
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Level up

281
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Goagent

282
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Required in teamwork

283
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
Is room for everybody in rugby

284
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
Seems to be

285
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Chili good at building character

286
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
I'm in

287
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Scar tissue

288
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,647
But but but I character part I think is tested on a regular basis both

289
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Against other teams but also even with your own.

290
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
I became really interested in the imponderable

291
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
As I

292
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
Describe these things like cohesion and teamwork

293
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
Leaving frankly Beyond identity commitment

294
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,287
These things are clearly important that clearly impact

295
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
The real world

296
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
Even in areas where we have Simple Rules like rugby

297
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Humble that are really hard to measure

298
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
And

299
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
And remain at this point almost kind of like a match

300
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
And we look to the best coaches

301
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
Greybull to sell some of this magic and produce

302
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
My performances from teams that really help a person I've gotten there

303
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
And likewise

304
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
Dysfunctional Dynamics

305
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Where you to have the best Superstars and they just don't seem to

306
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Perform

307
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
That's where his remains like I said kind of this

308
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
Imponderable

309
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
The area of

310
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
Mystics and tradecraft in

311
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
In a wisdom of the ages

312
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
What is your science

313
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Imats

314
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,063
That that's why I let you know I really is a long time studying the rugby team itself

315
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
I'm and I'm

316
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
Given particular date in dod you know we we we

317
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
We fight and we work

318
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Live or die in teams

319
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,095
Exact actual price of an excellent

320
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Target

321
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Our focus on which two

322
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Did go after these in pond

323
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
Fasting to just

324
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:08,127
Think about you what is it what is that magic is you call which maybe is something discernible and something that you want kids

325
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,455
That will take a group of individuals a team

326
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,527
And have this team achieve collectively

327
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,391
Human Feats that are often absolutely astounding so

328
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
I don't want to talk too much about that now but it just said that you kind of Cadillac that thought will

329
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
It's an ectopic this is an example where I think

330
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Social science

331
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Falls down

332
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Because there's a lot of literature on team

333
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
But I guess you woke in the literature

334
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
Deathly reflects Duncan Watts

335
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Sociologist

336
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Incoherent

337
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
That the way people study teams

338
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,087
Varies tremendously the measures that use vary tremendously the results

339
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Oftentimes not

340
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Highly reliable

341
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
There's no replication of the studies

342
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
Actually this is part of my frustrations when you turned it to where

343
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Presumably they would have the answer

344
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Is it magic resist

345
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
There's very little

346
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
That can be drawn confer

347
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
From the literature

348
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
What's a i

349
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,127
God forbid given the opportunity to be organized a large group to achieve something important

350
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,431
What can I draw from the social science literature

351
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
It helped me

352
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
There's not a lot

353
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
Right now that I would consider be reliable or bus enough

354
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
Really help me dry Ford

355
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,439
Does it have to be that way or their way so we can improve

356
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
The research itself so that I

357
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
As Commander at leader

358
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Even / Commander

359
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
Know how better to put my team together

360
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
To really get

361
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
The other most

362
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Out of out of

363
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:41,055
We're trying to do okay well I can tell that you're hinting about something that will talk about you just didn't in the very near future but I want to move

364
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,383
Move our two men scrum here toward DARPA

365
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
How did you actually

366
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,319
What was the sequence of events where you met somebody to talk to somebody scene

367
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
There's always

368
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,927
How did I get my job story soap

369
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,279
Well I'm so don't you drive me to the rugby choose me did I choose. About to drop it to me

370
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,095
I can say, in this case DARPA and chooses you

371
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
So I was

372
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Fortunoff I think

373
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Tube having been in

374
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
As you mentioned

375
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
I've been moving in the circle of

376
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
We are program managers and this Advanced research area for

377
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
National Security

378
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
And I think

379
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,271
Getting to know some folks who have done work both it was in DARPA and for DARPA

380
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
It's hard not to swear to be effective

381
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
To realize that

382
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
They really do want to walk

383
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
They're willing to take these chances

384
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Risk Investments

385
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
That another

386
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
The areas might be

387
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Be considered

388
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,447
You know given what I said earlier about you know the difference between the amount of money and time spent on face

389
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Social science

390
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
If there's agency that can actually

391
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
Make-out we've been three five years over the 20 years we might need a normally

392
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
How you know doctor did nothing

393
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
Well how do you how do you not say that

394
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
So have you made a couple of connections with

395
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:59,391
Within the building and then also have been called in by some leadership I think really understood

396
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
That

397
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
But he's a really important question

398
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
Coordination cooperation competition ultimately

399
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Every national security question

400
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
We really care about

401
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
Has some fundamental human

402
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,935
Social and behavioral aspects to it

403
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
But

404
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,823
UFC referees my order comments about the state of the literature and they sent to which you can really inform

405
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Are solutions this problem

406
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
They realize I think and I

407
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Things might be changing

408
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,575
Culturally with a new emphasis on reproducibility

409
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
And transparency in the science

410
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Ultimately I hope

411
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Improve the quality of

412
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Kelso 10

413
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
So technologically we now have capabilities to

414
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
You run experiments scales whenever

415
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
We have the ability to analyze

416
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
New complex weight

417
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
We have the ability to

418
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Pre-register stop

419
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
That is where I announce my study publicly

420
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Joe Alves

421
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
Almost community peer-review

422
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,407
So we're reinvesting Andre investigating

423
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Regular does conventional models

424
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,551
DARPA leadership realize okay maybe now is the time

425
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
To take that risk Estep and see if

426
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Bring that science

427
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
Okay perfect time then just to just just

428
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
Talk a little bit about each of your program

429
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,815
What's what start with the first program that you managed to

430
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,655
Get through the difficult wedding and approval process your

431
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,263
Referring to the Next Generation social sciences program which

432
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,103
Is pretty transparent about what you're trying to do with 2nd generation

433
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Next Generation

434
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
Social site transparent in just

435
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,759
The most surface sort of way so what do you actually mean by that

436
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
Right so we're trying to accomplish two

437
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
I would say probably insanely ambitious

438
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
But that's that's what we do here

439
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
The first is were trying to get after

440
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Experimental

441
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,119
Those imponderables as emergent phenomena we were referring to Earl

442
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
The things like

443
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Quite the vagina

444
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
How does the me

445
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
Yoga by the other selves to the me becomes the

446
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
What's most important

447
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
For that serve emergent Behavior

448
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Well

449
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,479
We know we have lots of case studies with lots of people who serve observe this in the world

450
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,807
But we don't have his experimental evidence to begin to test

451
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
These different mechanism

452
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
So we're trying to Leverage

453
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
What we think are advances now technology

454
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
Detectorpro out that experimental

455
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
In the process and this is the second bowl

456
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,631
We're trying to do it so that we can have greater confidence in the reproducibility of the war

457
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
All the way from

458
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Testing multiple models

459
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
Rather than being married to a single model that I will then try to prove is true I'm actually

460
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
Actually trying to figure out which models are

461
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
More effective than others

462
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
And again these would be models about what

463
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
About Industries Collective identity

464
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
So there's lots of literature about what leaves

465
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
I made a bunch of the week

466
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Will they all make

467
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
In many cases they make very different predictions

468
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
Under similar conditions

469
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
If you can actually get the models

470
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
That's another

471
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
His many social science model

472
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Apples are so

473
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
That is almost impossible to say what they would predict but

474
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Prediction predictability is a Hallmark of what we might consider going to the hard Sciences

475
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:04,479
You come up with the theory and if you can predict when Halley's Comet is going to come back around then you say hey I

476
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
I've made it

477
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
I'm approaching

478
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
I think that's true and I and I and I think there's another side that witches if you make prediction in your wrong at least you know that how wrong

479
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
When you are and that's how you make

480
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Improvements

481
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,815
But you never make that prediction or you engage in a practice

482
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Parking

483
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,191
Which is a hypothesizing after the results are known in this is very common if you if you

484
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,519
Collect your data and you analyze them and nobody ever knows what

485
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Question was you rash in the first place

486
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
I can always go back

487
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
And claimed I was looking for the answer I found the first

488
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
Republic

489
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,015
And then rationally reconstruct a plausible story that makes sense of what you think

490
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
An n in social science in particular

491
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,927
It's hard to come up with a scenario in which no matter what answer you find you can't come up

492
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
With a post-hoc story that makes sense

493
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,047
No matter what I find in any experiment in social science the most part

494
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,631
I can go back in time and tell a plausible story is that well why that's obvious

495
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
That is a real problem

496
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,775
Okay so if we get utopian for a minute and you succeed wildly

497
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,151
In this insane Ambitions of actually coming up with next-generation social science

498
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
What will social science

499
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Will be reminded again

500
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:13,087
Social sciences Awards live brush but if we

501
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Extrapolate from what word

502
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
The question we're asking right now.

503
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Extended to other questions

504
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
Things like

505
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Deterrence and cooperation

506
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Competition

507
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
The process to me would look very similar

508
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Which is

509
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,960
People will be mining the literature that already exists

510
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
To come up with different models

511
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
That make predictions

512
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
Not just sort of qualitative descriptions of how the woman

513
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Where's my predictions

514
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
But then can be

515
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
Tested empirically

516
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
In experiments

517
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
1/10 scale if necessary

518
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
That are transparent

519
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Better

520
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Queer

521
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
That are pre-registered

522
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
And that also

523
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Are replicated

524
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,024
So the replication process is really important

525
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:58,400
Especially with you social systems because the answer you get the next time around won't be the same the world that will have changed

526
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,960
The participants will change the behavior will change

527
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,056
But if you don't do that your process if you don't replicate you won't know

528
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
When your model begins to fail when it doesn't

529
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
And incentives right now

530
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,224
Frankly in many ways are just to get published

531
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
As opposed to getting a ride

532
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
We are trying to figure out how to close those inside

533
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
So that

534
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
Getting it right Altima is what gets you pumped

535
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:24,768
So you are running another program that really sounds relevant to what you're talking about right now the ground truth

536
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,096
Program and the name of that really fascinates me because

537
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
The first time I ran

538
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
Across that term

539
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,520
I actually was related to satellite remote-sensing of

540
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,920
The snowpack in need what would happen if there's natural herb status briefly the Earth emits snatcher microwave

541
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
Radiation it goes through

542
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:48,064
Snowpack this is the signals can be picked up by sensors on satellites

543
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
And then with a model

544
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
The satellite then can

545
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
Convert those raw signals into

546
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,840
Some measure of exactly what the snowpack is and that's important information for

547
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,192
Example farmers who are going to need to know how much snow is going to be coming up nearby mountains

548
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,032
Toast but input in order to be confident about the model

549
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,360
People would go on the ground in their snow boots with

550
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
Long rulers and actually measure the depth

551
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
I'm in and that way

552
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
Could you validate that the models were

553
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,880
We're working well so in this context ground-truth and in in social science

554
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Well

555
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,232
So this is a question I think you can only ask you to place a DARPA

556
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
So we will

557
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
We do not have

558
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
That kind of grouchy

559
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
In

560
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Partly because

561
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
The very measures we take from the very beginning of making assumptions

562
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
That were measuring

563
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,312
We can't see the things we really care about so we have to use it

564
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Inside of Hope

565
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
That were caption constructs

566
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
At the end of the day

567
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
We actually have very little idea how Acura

568
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
We are crew

569
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,696
In this question fundamental imitation

570
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
Accurate we actually alter webe

571
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
When faced with these complex

572
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Systems

573
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
My social behavior

574
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
DARPA

575
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,448
Has given me the chance to serve in Port that question will be

576
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
And say okay

577
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
We have these amazing advances in Social stimuli

578
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,104
How to give you have you talked to John about

579
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Upper GI Joe is very interested in this

580
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,760
There's enormous advances agent-based modeling that allow you to

581
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,576
Run lots of little agents and see how they interact

582
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
The Crazies

583
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,952
Emergent and very complex behaviors from fairly simple rules and by agents you mean

584
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,048
He could be people doing things people doing things in this case

585
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Lil Wayne Avatar that I have

586
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Rules

587
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Those avatars in a rack of my computer

588
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,752
I am because my computer now holds his enormous amount of computational power

589
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
I can really start scaling this up I can start

590
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
Simulating behaviors on

591
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,944
On the scale and some cases of of Nations and International

592
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Interactions

593
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,344
Right now our approaches we use a simulation to try to understand the real one

594
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
We are asked the question well

595
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
What if we put that on hold for a moment

596
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,744
And I using simulations instead as a wind tunnel

597
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Right almost that ice pack

598
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,584
So that I have causal truth

599
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Or ground

600
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
You know I grew this

601
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Alternate world

602
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Which I'm seeing

603
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Social behavior

604
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
What is so complex

605
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,872
Now I give that as a wind tunnel

606
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
2

607
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Social science

608
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
Social scientist and other

609
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
Other areas so researchers

610
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,552
And ask them can you give me

611
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,648
Using your meth is your best approaches can you tell me what causing the behavior

612
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Can you predict what's going to happen in this simulation when something happens like a resource dries up

613
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
And can you also may help us understand what are the

614
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
The framers

615
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
Their most important in the behaviors

616
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
How close can you actually get

617
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
What happened

618
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Mentos is a couple

619
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
1 which tools are most appropriate for which kind of socially complex

620
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Questions

621
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
To what

622
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,944
What if any are there theoretical limitations of being able to understand and predict

623
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
And that's really important

624
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,040
Hey you people talk about what why do you want to know what you can

625
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,136
Well am I spring certainly within National Security

626
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,744
Dude in particular very comfortable with risk they have to make decisions

627
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
Under incomplete information

628
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
Why do you want to figure out what you can't know how is that useful

629
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Well

630
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
That gives you the boundary

631
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Of

632
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
What you can plan for

633
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
And if you know for

634
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
I see both

635
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,872
4 facts that you can't know something

636
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
If you can plan for that too

637
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
It's a much different planning price

638
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
But that's really important

639
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,088
And again at DMV in particular constantly has to operate in

640
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Highly uncertain environment

641
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
But being able to say

642
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
Yes sir or mam

643
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,280
This is a dynamic this is a situation that we cannot predict what's going to happen next

644
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
You can plan accordingly

645
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
That's very different from

646
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
Believing you know what's going to happen

647
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Being inaccurate

648
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
But being very confident and that leads to bad

649
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,152
You can't bear it Universe any idea to kind of be a World creator where you can control that world

650
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
Throwing in a very certain situations how does social behavior unfold in the simulated environment and hopeful

651
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:09,696
We learn something that you can take out of the box the computer box in the NFL plaid to the test for the real world that we live in

652
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Breathin

653
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
I want to just talk about one more program is actually not a program it's it is a preliminary phase of what could become a program

654
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:22,240
I would show you sent out is what we call insert government speak a request

655
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,312
For information and that is an RFI about

656
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,968
About this particular request for information I was looking at the possibility

657
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,016
Of using semi-automated

658
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Rules to give us

659
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,856
Calibrate the confidence we can have

660
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,672
In the social Behavioral Science research that already exists

661
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
How we can do social science going into

662
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,632
Ground rules that program is for looking at how how effective we can actually be

663
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
Even if we're wild lyrics

664
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
And in developing

665
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
This our request information

666
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
Is an analogy that there's tremendous amount of literature and research has been done I'm questions that you know DOD National Security care

667
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,272
We just don't know how much confidence we should have

668
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
In some of those claims and models

669
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,672
And that's best exemplified by the recent reproducibility project

670
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
I was a different

671
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Research

672
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Scientists Center for open science has the most

673
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Famous

674
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
Before that where they actually took

675
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,936
Canonical studies in Psychology the replicated

676
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
And they did not all rap

677
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,264
In fact more often. They did not Rebel

678
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
And it's

679
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,640
Yeah there's lots of renting of clothes and gnashing of teeth that have this happen

680
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:38,528
Well part of it is working the great name for this to write for the crisis of reproducibility

681
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,088
Now it is and it's not just by the way social sign

682
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
Right

683
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,976
But part of it while part of it is because the science is hard part is also stems from

684
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
These these requests will research Praxis

685
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
That are invited by

686
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
Import centers

687
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
Some cases just

688
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:01,312
Enormous degrees of freedom that is if I'm given a large dataset there many things I can do with those data

689
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
And if I'm

690
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
Only going to publish positive results don't be surprised when I only tell you about the positive result

691
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,528
This is our natural human reaction it's not that people are malicious or nest

692
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Play faking data

693
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
This is just a result of housing Centerline

694
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
And yet much of the research is solid

695
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
Right mid there many things

696
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
You can soar Bank on if you're building a model about humans

697
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
Behavioral Services

698
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
We just don't know how to disentangle them

699
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:28,704
Answer the question of race is asking are there new ways of putting together Pratt weak signal

700
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,312
Inherent to a study or article me the stats are off a little bit

701
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
The perfect

702
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
Has the study been replica

703
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
Has been tested on more than one population

704
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,504
You know has anyone I should bother to reproduce the results

705
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,088
And then I think increasingly there these other signals that we haven't

706
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
Historically been able to

707
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Things like discussions and social media

708
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
Social media in some cases actually an open peer review process

709
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,584
You will get some more controversial Studies have come out reason

710
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
I think you know the discussions have occurred

711
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,960
Informative

712
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
Yes I'm that is is ad hominem attacks

713
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,664
Subjective discussion about the tapping into the wisdom of the crowd absolutely

714
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
The hard part is

715
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
You know the crowd is very busy

716
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
How do we

717
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Better Weber

718
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Those that do signals

719
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
How to make them

720
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,232
So that if if it is successful

721
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
I see two outcomes one is

722
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,352
I can more more easily more rapidly more confidently

723
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,656
Where is the normal filter for the story out there

724
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,240
Second is frankly crate almost kind of a road map

725
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,312
So that if I'm a young researcher or I'm a program manager

726
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Funny research

727
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
I can look at

728
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Des algorithm

729
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Or this credits

730
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
For lack of a better term

731
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,272
And I know how I can improve confidence in my research

732
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,344
I can look at the things that matter for increasing confidence

733
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
And I can

734
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
I can do the right thing

735
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
I can replicate my stuff

736
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
I can make my data available

737
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
Independent party

738
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
I can test it on multiple

739
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,864
You know I can't I can be transparent about my analyses

740
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
Where they working where they didn't etcetera

741
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:09,312
Gauging you in this conversation it also is occurring to me there's another reason why

742
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:15,712
Bringing social science into the DARPA portfolio was so important it's just it's because of the way the vulnerability landscape

743
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,528
The risk and threat landscape has been changing its so much

744
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
There's so many more

745
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,672
Kinds of risks that are inherently in that social

746
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
Behavior and cultural Behavior space I'm just thinking about the wild wild place of the internet and how

747
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
Identities are made and created

748
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,680
And manipulated in in that

749
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,728
Global environment so

750
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,800
Maybe just before we close out

751
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:46,944
Talk to me a little bit about that in with respect to the kinds of efforts you're making your

752
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
It doesn't take long to talk to any driver

753
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Peugeot manager

754
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
4

755
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
They begin to

756
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Bringing this discussion you did

757
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
Of the social complexity no matter what platform

758
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
No matter what technology

759
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Software developer

760
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,328
You pull that string a little bit and it leads quickly to

761
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
This

762
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Threat landscape as you said

763
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
That's right landscape sometimes it's

764
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Just not even understand

765
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
What should I think

766
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,592
This is Mario

767
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Frankly we have to go

768
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
To be in to get a better sense of those questions

769
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Erased

770
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
I think

771
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
You know we should be excited

772
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,064
About our new capability

773
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
We can use

774
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
To try to get there

775
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
We should remain humble

776
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
As weak as you go forward though

777
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
Daddy Riggins are magic rotation

778
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
But I but I do think

779
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
But if I do nothing other

780
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
With my time at DARPA

781
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
The idea that we can use these tools

782
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:43,008
Did the re-engage and try to get after that social complexity

783
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
That it has something

784
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Contribute to National

785
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,360
Security that will have been a win for my respect

786
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,968
Okay well may we come to know ourselves better Adam Wright

787
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,344
And with that I just want to thank you for spending this time with me in the studio

788
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
No thank you I appreciate it

789
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,720
And I want to thank you listeners also for spending the time with us

790
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,048
I hope you join us again for the next voices from DARPA
