EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:09,024	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But because they are hard
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:14,656	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You're persistent I love that because you've been trying to get me on this podcast for a long time
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:16,192	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And until I saw you
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,240	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	On another podcast
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you said you were rushing
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:21,824	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did I call you back
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,848	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There was over
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:26,176	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because Russia to me you know is leading the world in wrestling
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,480	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Almost every year
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:34,880	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What's the difference between American wrestling in Russian wrestling you show me this painting while it's a mighty it's science it's science
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,648	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yale and
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:41,536	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They really study the sport they're really good technically they're really really good in strategy
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,584	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They Don't Really push like
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:47,168	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The real toughness they don't push like
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,448	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Conditioning
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Right and so Americans we need what they have
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:57,152	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Russians Niva we have and when you get to two together
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And for me
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,736	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Why could beat the Russians is because
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,296	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I went away a little bit
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,600	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I kept my toughness
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,928	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But you're known your you're known for your toughness
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,232	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I wasn't known for my art
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,048	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I wasn't known for my science
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,352	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So when did you become a bit of an artist
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It took a loss
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:24,544	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Celerion block because I 181 straighten the dominant 7
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,104	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And not just winning but you don't care.
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:28,896	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Punisher
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	People gas and
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:35,040	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	From from that point of view yeah I might have been pretty good but I had a long ways to go yet
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,808	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I didn't
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,880	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Really realize that or I should have said I should say
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,160	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I didn't
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:45,024	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Really know how to get it out of me until I had a loss and then I realized I got a buckle down
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,560	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Learn some of that science
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,096	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Become more of an artist
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,376	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How do you become an artist
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,448	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That's the Russian way has this
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,496	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Drilling technique
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,288	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Thousands of reps
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,312	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How do you how do you think
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,128	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You work on the science to Artpark
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,200	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You got to study the best in the world
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,760	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think Dave Schultz was our guy
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:08,064	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In America that probably
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,112	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Showed us that
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Being artistic
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:15,488	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You needed that and he studied that he went over there as a high schooler
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,559	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And Russell and some major tournaments over there
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he saw their ways
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,191	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He use that Russian science and then he
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,239	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Was already in American
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he saw what
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How I
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:32,383	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Trained athletes he saw what I did in the Olympics solid other people
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,407	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How we held up
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Any applied that as well but
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:41,599	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I have to say he has more the artistic type he was more of a Russian than an American when it came to
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wrestling
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,927	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You've coached
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:49,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	45 national champions 106 Big 10 champions
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,303	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And 8 Olympic medalist
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Which is incredible
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,423	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What is a Common Thread between them
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,959	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,983	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What are
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,031	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe some of the fundamental differences
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,847	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think the Common Thread is
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,127	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:11,295	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They all had one of those two avenues that we talked already
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:15,135	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Can because we intertwined them
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,719	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So in a Russian wrestling room they got the same people
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Most of time in American dressing room are the same people
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,583	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But what I was out recruiting
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,399	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	At first I recruited just attitude
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,239	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I needed more than that
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I needed some
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Genetics in that wrestling room
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,871	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Actually
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,175	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That hard work people
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,735	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know they can look and see
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wow
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That execution
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,599	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That's unbelievable
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But yet
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I can beat that guy
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	After the first minute
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,487	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So you think
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,071	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You think the art the the technique
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:01,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Is genetics a you're born with it you think it's nice I think your pop and your speedo your ability to
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,031	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Remove a timing and timing and
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,847	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Your quickness and your strength
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,615	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know the Russians
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,919	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Late
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Usually picked out
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,783	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The people that can go into that sport
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,087	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That was the old fashioned sports car
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:22,207	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But it it's it's mostly like when you see when you walk into a rest Russian dressing room
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	UCM hitting
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,511	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Skills
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Techniques
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,863	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You don't you don't see him against each other that much
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,655	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Silver
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:33,983	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You might not see a bunch of Sprints you might see him walk over to the
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The ropes
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,055	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And they
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,591	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Drop down from the ceiling
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:42,943	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And they'll jump up and climb a rope and then they come down
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And then
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,247	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They don't jump right back on
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They got three or four other guys go and then they jump back on where is
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:53,695	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I probably made my guys climb get right back down climbing right back again
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:54,975	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I also realized
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That

EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:24,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You had to be the first guy there in the last guy to leave and you had to be the most dedicated guy even though they were the ones that's trying to win the
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Having ships
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,207	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You had to
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,279	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Prove that you're going to work just as hard as they were as a coach
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:32,351	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And what does that look like what do so you can see it when you
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:36,447	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know it when you see it while you're there ahead of them and you're
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:40,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There after they leave simple
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm picking up after him
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,847	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you're analyzing them

EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Incel use that type of strategy in overtime
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,575	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When you prove it works
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,647	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Some of my
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Kids that were the best kids in the world
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Really
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Should have been a wrestler I mean there weren't very coordinated
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,703	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But they work so hard to develop
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Themselves
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:15,103	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What was your role in that process I mean that means pushing kids to their limit
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:19,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If you're not going you can't push this to their limit and even when you push them to their limit
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,735	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That's not their limit
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz their limits above and beyond that I mean
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,319	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,623	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Coaches sometimes accidentally don't
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Palouse kids
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because of the heat because of
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:35,327	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Hard work and all that you got to know where to go in the back off
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You got to read your athletes
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,399	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:45,311	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	By that I mean you got to know him pretty well not every once in awhile you make a little bit of mistake but if you don't react right on that
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,103	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A mistake before it gets too far
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:51,455	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Then it's going to be a casualty somebody dying necessarily
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:54,271	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But maybe something that could turn them off
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:57,855	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Or maybe something that can run them away or maybe something that
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:02,463	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wow that was close to it maybe should have pushed in that far
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:05,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So you really have to be very educated
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,815	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And it's not just
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What you know
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's what you know about them
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:16,031	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I'm not talking about the team I'm talking about each guy individuals yeah you know it
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,591	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How you see in their eyes because
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:26,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The first one there your last one to leave and and you said in the environment with him you're there for in the morning
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Practice sometimes you're there in the afternoon for 2 or 3 hours
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,855	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	After practice
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You might have a
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A hot rumor
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You might have a sauna or steam or whirlpool
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you get in there with them
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,303	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you listen
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:41,119	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know you're not just feeding out information
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,655	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You do that
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:47,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But you're taking in a lot of that too and I'm telling you when you get in an atmosphere
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,103	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That they're relaxed and they feel comfortable massage
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,431	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that's after practice in one of those
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Areas that
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:58,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	People around you learn alot
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean you got a lot to learn as a coach
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:04,671	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And when you get in that atmosphere when you all of a sudden you feel like very comfortable
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Word start flowing
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It was those words flow
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:15,679	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You take a man as a coach and there's something probably going to be said
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,495	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That you can do an act upon that's going to help
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,799	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Certain situations
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:22,847	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I've saved a couple gets lice for sure
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That were on the brink
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:27,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know sometimes performance is at such a high level
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,503	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know high-level atmosphere
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Life and death is actually
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Involved and I don't mean pushing a kid to worry it just dies
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:40,767	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I mean he might feel himself as a failure
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,071	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Then you may go home and take his own life
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,143	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah I mean but that's part of it you putting
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:52,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So much heart somebody's blood in the heart and sweat and every year your whole meaning of life becomes
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:57,663	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Winning so and sometimes it's so hard to lose within that context
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:03,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If you know I think the first wrestling life you wrote about Chad zapotal
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,551	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Who

EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's not broke by
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,455	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Another 20 seconds
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:49,343	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean it by 700 people yeah people and
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:55,743	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's pretty much the common Ali's are you got to run a four-minute mile if you're going to go somewhere now or or below if you're going to win
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Events
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:58,815	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It said major level that you got to be able to do that
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:02,143	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so if you can take that and you can look at what
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,751	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In time history
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Has as its
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,823	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Record performance
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,151	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you can realize that
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,199	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	At record performance
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's going to change
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And they don't take it to all the factors
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Acknowledge
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,903	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They don't taken all the factors of
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Better shoes
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,743	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They don't take it all the factors of
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Better understanding in nutrition
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,351	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean it's like me as an athlete
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I went to practice everyday in high school for
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	At least
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:42,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	My sophomore in my junior and part of my
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,639	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Senior year and all of a sudden
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,431	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A new rule came out
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,759	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The rules are dumb
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,295	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Before that said
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,879	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Diesel motor coaches
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,671	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How you feel
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,999	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We don't drink in water practice
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,279	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:05,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Gave wife cuz you got to toughen you up as a weakness
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:05,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Water
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:11,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so we would go through practice I mean and you're sweating and then you're sweating so much that
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:14,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You're almost out of sweat and so
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:18,943	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You're mostly at the end of practice you're not even wrestling excuse me
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,759	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You're sitting against a wall cuz you're tired
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,783	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So then all of a sudden
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They say okay
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,903	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Call drink water during practice print Gatorade during practice
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:31,743	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It all of a sudden at the end of practice we're still out there competing
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,511	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:36,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I look at my career for 2 and 1/2 years where I Junior High to
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So I got another three years
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Or I didn't really
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,031	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wasn't able to push as good as I could because
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:44,543	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I just
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Who's Bobby under
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:50,687	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah so what so but at the individual level
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,223	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In terms of the impossible
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When did you first believe
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:58,879	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The thing that maybe probably people would laugh at your boss that you would be in the Olympics
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Champion
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,439	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Well I always
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,303	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Visualized me being the best you believed it in the very forever
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:06,815	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Forever
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah I was
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because I was
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,191	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't need to call it a dreamer or somebody that
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:16,799	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I was just involved with competitive Sports at the YMCA from
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	H5
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:24,735	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did you tell people that dream that you're going to be an Olympic champion Monday give me the best in the world I think they knew
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:28,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And the only reason why they knew cuz there was something
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:33,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Build-A-Bear about this guy
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:39,327	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he was swinging baseball bats you know what's 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,631	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he was swinging baseball bats
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:47,007	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So much right handed and so much left hand with nobody even there throwing the ball
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:52,383	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That all of a sudden they walked by and all the sudden the grass was down to dirt
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So it's like
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,271	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They saw me on the yard
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,087	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Playing by myself Sports
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:06,463	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Oriental we are you get the neighborhood kids you play a lot but if they weren't there
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:13,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know if you want in my front room I was hiking a ball like I was a quarterback and I was running not and run
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,143	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Through the
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:14,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do the furniture
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:21,823	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:27,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And the coaches at the YMCA level 2 junior high level they saw this guy come first and
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,247	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And end up last but
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,295	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I wasn't that great
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,623	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I wasn't the fastest guy at that time
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,927	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I wasn't as strong as guy
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:41,791	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You no answer before I went to the Olympics when they tested me they tested everybody
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,351	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I probably came back with one of the highest scores
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But it was
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,423	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It was not like the highest
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Person on this and this and that
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,615	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I was all high across the board straight across the board High
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,639	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	On every one of them
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:59,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But it was always people that were higher than genetics
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,503	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But then they would go down
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:04,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They never test on something else and go back up
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,623	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Mind-state High all across the board
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:09,695	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so I really didn't have too many flaws
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,975	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I didn't have any
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:13,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Things that also said that you were going to be
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,583	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Unscored upon at the Olympic Games
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Alright so take me
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Through that day if you could
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,007	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	1972 when you were gone for the 68kg
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,799	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Freestyle Wrestling gold
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Discord
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,103	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	50
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,151	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Seven points found correct
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,943	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I had zero points scored on you
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,735	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	57
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	0 Sol
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:41,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I take me through the almost the details what was your routine what was your process what was going through your mind your thoughts of that
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,487	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah first of all
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It was quite a day
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,071	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Everyday
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,399	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	At that time
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:54,495	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And we wait in 2 hours before the start of the competition
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:20:00,639	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And saw that is mean that you weigh in 2 hours for your Russell cuz you didn't know whether you going to wrestle right away or later on
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:03,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In fact in that day I don't think I Russell's a until
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,271	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Later on in the evening so
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:11,135	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Had all day to recover but I didn't really need it anyway cuz you don't know wasn't really
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,927	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Pulling a whole lot of weight but just
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I was just interesting
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:20,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What was in your mind what were we thinking when you're nervous for you I was confident
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I was confident how you knew you were going to win the gold
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah I know
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,215	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,495	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In reality
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:29,055	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm not I didn't know if I'm a cocky point of view
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,591	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I only knew it
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,383	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because for the last
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,479	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Three and a half years
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I've been going to practice
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:46,719	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'd be winning every practice you felt good I hardly ever lose it if I lost it
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,999	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Somebody scored on me
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:49,791	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It was like
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Too bad I couldn't sleep until I
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Figured it out
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Or if I didn't figure it out
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,751	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I would fall asleep
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:04,639	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I would be what I would wake up with the answer what I needed why got scored upon
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:11,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So maybe now that you won the gold can you tell me in the practice from somebody took you down
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:17,184	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How do you take Dan Gable down in the rug in the practice room
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:18,976	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They were going for one move
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,096	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	All I wanted was one move
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:29,216	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Somebody has no practice or half a practice or at least 10-15 minutes
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,288	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And they were maybe going to score
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,640	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If they can work it in their mind
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,736	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But they knew that was going to be their victory
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:42,528	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In the practice room
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,832	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe you can educate me
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,648	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that when you go for the Olympic gold
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,744	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You didn't want to allow any takedowns
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:58,144	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So there's no such thing as working on some kind of weird position of week for into something it's important to not let.
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,168	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	May I take down
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,472	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I like what we're saying before
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,264	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If something happened and
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,056	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Somebody scored on me in a certain way
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:09,920	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I would go over that situation situation over again
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,712	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I would come up with an answer
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,760	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And then I would actually test it
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:16,576	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe I won't go back the next day
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,112	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz I didn't want the guy to
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,160	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You do not have some
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:24,512	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't want him to think that I was thinking about it all night I didn't tell him
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,816	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But maybe three days later went to wrestle again
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,400	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I actually had it figured out because
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,960	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He wasn't able to
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:37,824	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Or if even if I was it on to take it offensive move
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,616	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I got stopped and didn't score
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,920	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know I had to go back
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Filter that
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,736	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But it wasn't something that
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,296	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Usually I couldn't solve
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:49,088	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I could usually solve it
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,672	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Let's go back to the Olympic Games so I get up in the Olympics in the morning
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:55,232	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I'm not sure when the Wayans were but
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,792	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think I was probably a pound over
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:01,888	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know that's about a half a kilo in 1.1 pounds
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:08,288	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Is a kilo cuz we wouldn't kilograms so what do you do with that pain you are soft
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:08,800	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Asana there
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:13,920	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I got in the sauna and the funny thing was the morning of the of the
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:15,968	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Of the finals
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,784	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It was it was another athlete in
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,064	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Lisanna
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,928	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And it American or no
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,696	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It was a European
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,256	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I did I don't remember where she was from
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,280	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Adoration
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:31,328	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Well you know what I kind of think
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,376	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Was applied
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:35,424	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz it was a girl
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,984	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I just think and she didn't have her top one
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,032	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Ella
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:42,080	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that was pretty common
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:44,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so you know it's kind of interesting
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,176	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You think back about it
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,456	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,016	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There's some funny things that
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,808	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That go on
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,344	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Behind the scenes
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:56,416	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In Olympic Games in world games anytime
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:01,792	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When you have country gets country and so there's some crazy Stein goes on any of it affect you
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:08,704	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did you it was there any almost stayed too long in the Sun
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You lost a little bit over
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,544	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:18,688	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It didn't really bother me cuz I wasn't likes that wasn't like cutting a lot of weight so so
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:25,088	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Your match against the Russian the house your life is not to be at two times
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,136	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Will Champion the silver medalist as well
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Is an incredible wrestler
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,976	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So what was going through your mind
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:37,376	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Before stepping on the mat with that guy you beating a bunch of wrestlers haven't had a point scored on you
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:41,728	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you're stepping on the Media serves Russian who you said was
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Really they pick the Soviets pics
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,288	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To beat you
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:48,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I know why they picked him because he had a great attitude
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:51,712	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So he wasn't just the typical artist
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,248	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He was a good artist
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,296	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He hooked elbows like
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:25:01,440	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Star July 11th he's from that area of the world where they have some of those types of moves but
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,720	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He said he was a Gore
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,000	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:07,072	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I cutting down a weight he lost some of that go
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,888	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I don't know if
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,192	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If you got that's a process you got to
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,704	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cobalt
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:15,264	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Scientifically
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:18,336	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so you know if you don't do it is it American
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:23,712	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You can really hurt your performance if you don't do it as a Russian you can hurt your performance and they already
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,736	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Didn't really
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:30,112	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do that a lot work usually Russell's await where it was more like your weight
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:34,464	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so by cutting him down maybe slotus
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:41,120	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Belief down a little bit. You saw him the spirit was a little bit gone when your face
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:46,752	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You don't rest the matches and he was in the round-robin and he was able to go to the finals
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:49,824	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But he had lost another match
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:53,152	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Actually against in the round robin against the Japanese self
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,944	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:02,624	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I had already gained enough of artistic being able to finish a match once I lost my match in college
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,440	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	For the last two years I took on some of that artistica
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,720	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'll working
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think that he was already
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,072	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Hoping to win
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:14,144	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But he's hoping to win by a long ways because
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,704	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He had to pin me or beat me by
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,984	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	8 points
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To be able to win the gold
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:26,944	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know that wasn't going to happen to have any chance of pain is pretty good is it hard to pin down Gable versus takedown
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,712	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Down
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:30,528	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Like have you taken risks where you can pay for them
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:34,368	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I can't remember too many that I took
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:36,928	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That would actually put me in a danger position
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:42,304	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I taken risk but the risk for so scientifically technically correct
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:43,072	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:46,144	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I wouldn't land in that danger zone
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:52,800	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's like 5-minute lock up and throw you I'm not going to throw you to my own back and Roy through I'm going to turn in the air
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:57,408	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Scientific about it exactly I ate all you just
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:00,736	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I learned the hard way early on
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:03,040	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There was moose from Collegiate wrestling
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:05,856	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That you did that expose your shoulders which
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:10,464	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It cost me some early freestyle matches against wrestlers
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,488	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,792	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I would go back to my
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Collegian
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:20,960	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Escaping type moves to where I hit a Granby roll where you suppose your shoulders you lose two points every time
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:26,336	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But you learn that that's not the system but if you hadn't wrestle much
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:26,848	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You would
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,640	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Get exposed under
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,176	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,968	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A desperate situation you would hit it
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,016	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So you won the gold
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,528	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Holiday
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,552	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Feel
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:38,112	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know you have accomplished really the highest
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:44,768	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think it would have I think the question would be how would it feel if you lost the gold
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,072	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	For me just
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,608	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I already went through that once
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:56,032	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Not that highest level but the National Collegiate Championship level my senior year to Larry Owens lawn Larry Owens yeah
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:28:00,896	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that didn't set well will you afraid of that happening again
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,736	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	At the Olympic level was that you know I really wasn't
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:07,296	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But it was why I changed my
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:10,880	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Philosophy of training and added
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,392	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	2
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,696	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The science
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,232	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Tific artist type
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,536	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I asked if I'd have won that match
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:19,840	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Even though I wouldn't have felt good about it even though
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,376	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Squeaked it out
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:22,912	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I wasn't
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:27,008	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Feeling good about that match it would have affected me a little bit
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,056	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But if I don't want it I would have got over it
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,616	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean I'm not over it now
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:33,664	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean I don't know why I was
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,200	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Doing this kind of stuff
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,992	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Right before my badge
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:40,576	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Light by that I mean this kind of stuffs

EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,600	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I put up a lot of Champions
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:47,392	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But you learn
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:50,464	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Through mistakes that even in your own career that you had made
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:53,536	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know it's it's it's an Ever learning process
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,560	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Saint ever learning process
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,400	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have you ever been afraid on the map
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:00,192	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Does Fear have any role
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:00,704	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do you think
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,008	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	For wrestler
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,824	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Why must be a launcher fear is out there
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:12,480	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time I'm sure my Olympic finals is really a
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:15,040	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He had these doubts he probably had these doubts
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,856	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that gays gives me
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,392	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The edge
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:22,720	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I don't know if I Really Ever
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Had fear
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,328	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:31,936	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Obviously it was points and times where I didn't perform as well
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,216	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Not many but
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:33,984	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A few
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:38,848	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And if I look back of it look back at it I don't think it was that
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:43,456	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	American Inn Aurora Rasta
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,480	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think it was
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:47,040	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Probably the fear of
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,344	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Not being an artist
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,928	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	As much maybe this guy might be better than me
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:55,232	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Scientifically
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,792	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you know you're a scientist
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:00,608	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think that got to me more than anything else
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:04,192	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I said early on that I want to eliminate
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:06,752	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Ever having to worry about getting tired in a match
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:10,336	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So I kind of eliminated that so I got rid of that point
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:13,408	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I do think that in wrestling
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,944	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That is one of the fears
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,736	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That a lot of wrestlers have
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:21,088	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Actually how they feel during the mansion and
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:23,392	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do they get are they going to get tired
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,440	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And is it going to affect my performance
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:31,072	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	As a coach that really was one of the things I tried to eliminate on all my athletes
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,864	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So it was not Fear Factor
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,656	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But that Fear Factor would be
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,216	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Put upon my opponent
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,752	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Which would give me
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	An edge
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,312	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,104	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That's not what I needed as much
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,176	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I need to just focus make sure that I was doing the right things
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:50,016	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I need my team to be focused so I make sure that from my mistakes
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:53,856	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	As an athlete or even as a coach sometimes that I didn't repeat them
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:56,160	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Getting repeated man
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:58,208	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do you make a mistake once if you can repeat it
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,000	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's like
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,048	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You didn't learn anything
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:09,216	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You are go throughout your wrestling career as you beautifully put what's the work so hard that you pass out on the mat
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:11,520	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That you'll be carried off the map
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:17,920	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So you never did successfully in that's one of the ways you failed in your careers you've never work so hard that you've
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,432	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Passed out
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:23,808	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have you ever come close do you remember a time you come close to even push to the limits
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:26,880	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Exhaustion questions really a good question about
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,160	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:30,464	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Pushing to you collapse
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:33,280	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because I don't have a coat today
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:35,072	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have I said that to my athletes
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,888	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't know I could get in trouble
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:44,032	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because I understood isn't it by the athletes
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,824	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah they understand it
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But the outside might not understand it
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,432	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because it's almost like
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:56,576	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When you push him to the point where they go collapse I mean to him
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:33:01,696	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you know that's dangerous that's dangerous we can't have our kid in that
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,976	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Type of atmosphere but
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:09,120	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's something that's highly unlikely that's going to happen but I'm going to Taylor's many times in a practice
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,912	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What I pushed myself
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,448	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To all of a sudden
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:15,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The whistle blew or it was time to stop
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:19,360	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And when I got up off the mat or whatever I was at
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:19,872	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,408	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Needed water
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:22,432	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I need
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,480	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I needed fresh air
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:28,064	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz you're usually a fairly small room with a lot of guys
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:29,856	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That the heat rises
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,648	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you cannot it's hard to breathe
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:38,816	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that I can remember and I stayed a lot of times not by the door at the far end of the room I can member walk
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:43,936	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Walking from the far end of the room to that door and I can remember am I going to make it the next step
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:50,080	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Am I going to make it to next step I need air I need water I need oxygen I need to get out of here
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:56,992	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It didn't happen often but I can country count for five times in my career that I push myself to that level
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,272	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Where I thought I was going to maybe
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:33:59,296	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Go out
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,112	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Every step I was dizzy
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,904	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Once I got to that
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:06,720	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The door I was able to open it and go out
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:09,792	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Add water and gets cold water on my face and
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:12,608	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Don't know I never really was able to do that
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:15,168	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I think the story is it in a book where my
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,448	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	My daughter
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:21,312	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Push the collapse Molly made you proud
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:24,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah no
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,408	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did she
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,200	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Suffer because of that
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:29,760	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Washington get to go to the next
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,784	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Event
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,832	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz you didn't she had to qualify but
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:34,624	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think it
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:40,512	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Probably helped her to realize because she was winning the race and she was beating people she normally never pushed
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:44,608	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But she was at a new level that she had never been before and she only needed about
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:46,144	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Five feet finished
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,936	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And it was just one of those things that
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:52,288	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I bet there's a lot of learning that she did there and it probably
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,568	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Need to realize that
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:56,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	She'll be better but she had to hold up though
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,968	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So you mentioned in wrestling life
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,016	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That the Brand's Brothers
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,296	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Looked up to
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:07,648	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Royce Alger who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,696	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But not getting too rough
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:14,048	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So how do you find the line between extreme physical wrestling
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:18,400	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But at the same time not rough wrestling or angry wrestling
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,680	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So that line
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,984	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Between aggression top wrestling and
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:22,752	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Anger
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:24,288	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Letting anger
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,568	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Would cause
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,152	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Less successful wrestling
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:32,480	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think anger would cause you to make mistakes
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,528	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And actually get out of position
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,576	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because I think
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:38,880	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Anger is kind of a loss of control
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:40,672	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:45,024	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There should be a furious type of
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,840	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Pack
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:52,448	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I think if I cross the line to anger
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,032	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Then you're going to be vulnerable
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:57,824	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Install
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:00,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Royce
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:02,176	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And the brands
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,712	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wrestled
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:05,248	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To the edge
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,040	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Through the edge
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,320	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But when the whistle blow
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,344	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They stop
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:13,184	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And there's people that when the whistle blows they keep going
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,000	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's like in a football game
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,816	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Fight breaks out in south of the whistles bulk
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:22,144	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Well when the whistle blew
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,424	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They they backed off
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:26,240	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So that whistle
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:26,752	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Was
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:29,568	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Something that in a match
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,128	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That that
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:32,640	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Kind of
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,688	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Gave them the boundaries
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,760	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But perhaps give you a little bit of fuel
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:42,624	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Don't arresting tough the book that you just got for Mike Chapman now the new edition
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:45,696	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Talks about Bill Cole undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:46,720	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:53,632	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How he talked about how my strength speed and abilities thinkware increased tremendously
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:56,192	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	By just sitting apart from the action prior to the match
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:59,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And getting into a state of controlled anger
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:00,800	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,104	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Can anger rolling control
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:07,200	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So anger could be fuel as long as it's controlled

EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:16,160	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Poor performance in the other side of the line
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:16,928	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:21,024	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If you go beyond that it's not going to be for performance going to be for
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,840	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Not performance cuz you going to lose points
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:26,400	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's a fine line there's definitely a fine line
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:32,288	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You're talking about Royce Alger you're talkin about Tom Brands you're talkin about Terry brands
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:37,664	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean that world championship titles are you got Olympic Championship Tyler you got to World silver medalist in
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:38,176	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Anna

EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:43,552	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that's what I
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:46,624	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Talk to him about the world silver medalist
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,672	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He's haunted by that
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,488	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz he was actually 20 seconds
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,768	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Away from winning
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:55,328	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When he got beat in the end therefore that's part of the game
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:56,608	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:37:57,376	00:37:58,144	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:03,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't know whether he's okay with it or not cuz he says after talking about things he goes
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,824	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm okay with it now
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But then he keeps talking about it
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:11,456	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So I don't really think he's okay with it
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:16,320	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Actually make amends
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:17,088	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	John South
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,904	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When you really don't do it
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:25,024	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean it's no matter what the situation even with the Owens loss
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,792	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:29,376	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It still eats world champion
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,656	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he wanted to be
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:37,056	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm Olympic champion he's not who you wanted to be the greatest coaches of all time
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,592	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It also Heat
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,384	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know it's like
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:42,688	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Why do I keep going back to it
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,808	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because you're not you don't get over those things
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:49,856	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's a royce really keeps going back to it
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,160	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Even though he says he's fine and
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:55,488	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But then he realizes he's really not fine
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:39:01,888	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because that's just the nature of the game and that's why he was able to win national titles in and make world
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,936	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Games and stuff like that
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:09,568	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Even what's interesting about him and he's analyzed all the people that he's Russell
EDL	00:39:09,568	00:39:12,640	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And a lot of men have one world and Olympic championships
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:14,944	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he's beaten every one of them
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:20,320	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	At one time or another and he didn't get to that world championship gold living cold
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:21,344	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Add
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,416	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He says it because
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:27,232	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They did it so he's he's showing people
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:27,744	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,304	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I beaten those guys
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:32,352	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:34,656	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Apparently didn't beat him at the right time
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,448	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Add
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,984	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So it's still hunting
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,776	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You don't get away from that stuff
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:41,312	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean it's just like

EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:28,576	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because I was only a sophomore
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:30,624	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	15 years old in high school
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:31,904	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And

EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:57,247	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They they were the ones that were
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:59,551	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Suffering much more than me
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,087	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Even though
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I always
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:09,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Look back upon one area that I wasn't good at was communication at that time except inside the resin room
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:11,583	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz I've been tipped off
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,143	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And tipped off what do you mean
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,191	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Well they really said that
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:18,239	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Something to me about my sister
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:21,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Just Cause 3 weeks before that that really
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:22,335	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wasn't
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,895	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Normal or practical
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:27,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I said nothing to nobody
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:29,503	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You don't
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:32,319	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Is there a part of you that blames yourself
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah

EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:37,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Absolutely
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,279	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I'm 15 years old
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:41,791	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:43,583	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You make mistakes
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:48,703	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you don't really act on everything that happens in your life
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:52,799	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I can tell you how it affected me if I acted a lot on
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:56,895	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Anything that maybe wasn't even of that consequence
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:43:03,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean cuz I had four daughters and I'm telling you when they left every time to go somewhere in a car or go out with some place
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,575	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I always said something to him
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:07,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And they always say Dad you said that last night
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Care

EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:32,991	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Thinking ahead a little bit
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:35,295	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Just in case of something
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did happen

EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:48,863	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Once I found out she had been murdered
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:52,191	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It took me maybe
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	25 to 30 minutes

EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:40,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he said something about Diane
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,879	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And it wasn't good
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:43,903	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:46,719	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I can Ingles why did you say something
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:53,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Hi Daddy I just boy talk you though so you don't hug me hug me hug me
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,655	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:57,215	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know it was one of these things that
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:44:59,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's definitely made me
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:02,591	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A lot of who I am
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:07,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because there's been a lot of choices and I don't I took the word choice out of my life
EDL	00:45:08,479	00:45:14,879	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I just like to say I could do the right thing do the thing that's so you should do and so I don't realize it's like
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,903	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We going to do this or that
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:17,695	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Well what do you mean which one is better
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:20,767	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Halo I don't have that choice
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:22,815	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Just give me the right way to go
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:23,327	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so
EDL	00:45:23,839	00:45:27,679	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Perfect by any means but it's made a big difference in my life
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Oh and how I
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:32,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I handle my life is probably
EDL	00:45:32,799	00:45:37,919	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Give me the opportunity to be married for 44 years it's just giving me opportunities
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,479	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do I'll be better in my life and
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:42,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I you know I I want to thank a
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:44,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	My sister for that you know it's so
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:49,439	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I think my family was ready to
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,463	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Make a split
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:52,511	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because of that incident
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:54,559	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They're blaming each other and I think that
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:02,239	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I was able to help but more than that they really like each other but they didn't really know it at the time
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:04,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Until I got out of
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:05,823	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The House 2 years later
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:10,431	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It probably was going on for a couple years until I moved on and went to college
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:12,223	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Then they found out they really like each other
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:13,503	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When they were alone
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:18,879	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And it worked out pretty good but I think them being able to follow me
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,671	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Not just true
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:24,255	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Collagen Olympics and world
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:25,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But my coaching
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:29,119	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So it's the same the same success and Factor
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:33,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know the excitement and and all those things gave them a real purpose
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:38,335	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I gave my four daughters they gave my wife
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:42,175	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Real purpose to be able to be close to
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:44,991	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Ollie's champions in championships in
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:49,087	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And it and now it's because now it's like is a family of 22
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,135	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And they're all interested in what
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:54,207	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What Richardson in and it's going good knock on wood but
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:47:00,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know it's something that when all of a sudden you got too much time on your hands and you're not doing the competition much
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That thing's probably
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:04,447	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He'll get off get off track
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:09,311	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What do you think is the role of family in wrestling can a man do it alone and if not
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:12,383	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Where is family most important
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:14,943	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know you can do it alone
EDL	00:47:15,711	00:47:18,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The why would you want to
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:18,783	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:23,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think the chances of do it alone or much less in the chances of doing it together
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:29,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I know they say don't bring your profession home sometimes I say that
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:34,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I never got away from my profession and an awesome time
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,983	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's like my house right here
EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:41,055	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So when I'm moving home
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,103	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm not going to have an office
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:47,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Cuz I'm not going to coach anymore or I'm not going to be an assistant athletic director for a while
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:49,759	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:52,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Got to do something that
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:59,999	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Gives you a little bit of a break not Eunice La maybe the person you're living with
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:04,863	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so I don't know if you looked outside their I got a cabin right on the backyard probably can't see it right there but
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:05,631	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What's in the cabin
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:07,167	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That's my
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:09,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	House away from my house it's only

EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:49,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Well I tell you she started getting all emotional
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:53,663	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And if I want to stay married for another year 45 years

EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:21,311	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe even closer

EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:48,959	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Looking for them is to get them all on the same page
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:50,751	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Instead of
EDL	00:50:51,263	00:50:52,031	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Just
EDL	00:50:52,031	00:50:54,847	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have new highlights by that I'm saying
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:51:00,735	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Who let you look and see who won this year will the three guys that have never won before one this year we have three world champions
EDL	00:51:00,735	00:51:03,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Rdr2 past world champions
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:05,599	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Didn't win this year
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,367	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:08,671	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Is it okay you know I got metals
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:11,487	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The debit debarros win no he did not
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:12,255	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You got third
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:15,839	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Oh that's right you got bronze yet I mean
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:18,143	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Schneider got second so
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:19,935	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Those two are men guys
EDL	00:51:19,935	00:51:20,959	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He also
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:22,751	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The three guys that came through
EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:24,543	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We're guys it hadn't won
EDL	00:51:25,055	00:51:26,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	World gold
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:28,383	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Vacuum have never made a world team before
EDL	00:51:28,895	00:51:31,199	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so we have three world champions this year
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:34,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But we needed all five of them to come through to win the
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:35,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The Championships
EDL	00:51:35,807	00:51:37,343	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so the key really is
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:41,695	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Get them all to do the same at the same time
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:43,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Year-in and year-out
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:45,791	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And not just based on
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:49,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Okay girls got beat this year so he'll win next year
EDL	00:51:49,375	00:51:54,239	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's got to be every year if you're capable of doing that and that's what the coaching staff has to do
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:56,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence
EDL	00:51:56,287	00:52:01,663	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Actually on the coaching stats right now at the USA level because of the women's freestyle got
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:02,943	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Guy is up
EDL	00:52:02,943	00:52:06,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Is Terry Steiner and he Russell for memes a national champion
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:09,855	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Got a twin brother that's at Fresno State
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:13,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And then Billy's attic is the freestyle coach
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:16,511	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And hear us over the Hawkeyes back in
EDL	00:52:16,511	00:52:19,839	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The early days and now he was a national champion so
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:21,119	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We got a lotta
EDL	00:52:21,887	00:52:25,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A former Google influence on their butt
EDL	00:52:26,239	00:52:31,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In 2013 the international Olympic Committee ioc voted wrestling out of the Olympics
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:33,151	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:36,479	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A lot of folks know about this the absurdity of it
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:37,503	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So on
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:43,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Butts in a big picture you can step back now is five years later what did you learn from that experience
EDL	00:52:44,159	00:52:45,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	First of all
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:48,255	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did it surprise me
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:53,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did it really surprised me know
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:57,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You got to run you got to have
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:52:59,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	People running
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:01,311	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The organization
EDL	00:53:02,591	00:53:03,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Better
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:04,127	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Top notch
EDL	00:53:05,407	00:53:07,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If you take anything for granted
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:10,783	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you're not the person of authority
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:11,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Somebody can
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:14,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Kick you out
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:16,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And even though
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:21,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We had a lot of authority because we're wrestling where the one of the first sports to know
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:21,791	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Olympics
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:22,303	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Ever
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:23,839	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that we
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:25,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Think that
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:29,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know where and 180 some countries
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:30,495	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:32,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Some of the
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:33,311	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Number one
EDL	00:53:34,079	00:53:35,615	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Countries in the world
EDL	00:53:35,615	00:53:38,175	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That are politically strong
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:39,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have the sport
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:43,551	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know we thought we were okay but then you got to look and see who's running the ioc
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:48,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The international Olympic Committee
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:51,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Then you got to see that
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:54,303	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In wrestling we don't have any money in there
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:56,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm not shocked me
EDL	00:53:56,863	00:53:58,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We never had anybody
EDL	00:53:58,911	00:53:59,935	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	On the ioc
EDL	00:53:59,935	00:54:01,215	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	From wrestling
EDL	00:54:01,215	00:54:01,983	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know why
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:04,031	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because we didn't have to
EDL	00:54:05,567	00:54:07,103	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But yes that's wrong
EDL	00:54:07,871	00:54:08,639	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You have to
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:10,687	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And if you don't
EDL	00:54:11,455	00:54:14,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have somebody looking out for you right within the structure
EDL	00:54:15,807	00:54:18,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That is pretty easy people turn their head
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:19,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	00:54:19,391	00:54:20,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	All it took
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:21,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Was
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:24,511	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Statement
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:26,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You guys are kicked out of the Olympics
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:32,191	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You guys are done every came together I think it's the first time in ever in history
EDL	00:54:32,191	00:54:35,519	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That probably all this cup compared to people
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:38,335	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That we're working for their own agenda
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:41,151	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Turn that agenda
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:42,687	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To the sport
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:46,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So that made a big difference
EDL	00:54:46,527	00:54:48,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And we got a lot done in fact
EDL	00:54:49,087	00:54:50,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In America
EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:52,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There was several people
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:53,439	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That were
EDL	00:54:54,975	00:54:55,999	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Really
EDL	00:54:55,999	00:54:58,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Out there that we didn't know about
EDL	00:54:58,047	00:54:59,327	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Until this point in time
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:01,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And when they came aboard
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:03,935	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Now they're still aboard
EDL	00:55:05,215	00:55:07,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That doesn't mean we're doing everything perfect
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:11,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Because just because we got voted back in before we even got kicked out really
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:13,407	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That doesn't mean work
EDL	00:55:13,407	00:55:14,687	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	By any means safe
EDL	00:55:15,711	00:55:21,087	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We got to do some of the things that I'm talking about or the some of the things that we didn't do before
EDL	00:55:21,087	00:55:23,903	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We can't fall right back into the same mess
EDL	00:55:23,903	00:55:25,951	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's hard leadership got changed
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:27,487	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And it's
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:28,255	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Better
EDL	00:55:28,767	00:55:30,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But it's got to stay better
EDL	00:55:30,815	00:55:32,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But there are things
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:34,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That we could still be
EDL	00:55:34,911	00:55:36,703	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Doing to make sure that
EDL	00:55:36,703	00:55:37,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	We don't
EDL	00:55:37,983	00:55:39,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have situations like this
EDL	00:55:39,775	00:55:41,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Happened when I first learned about it
EDL	00:55:42,079	00:55:42,591	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I was like
EDL	00:55:43,871	00:55:44,895	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I broke down and wept
EDL	00:55:45,919	00:55:46,687	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Again
EDL	00:55:46,687	00:55:48,735	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's like every once in awhile I'll break down and
EDL	00:55:48,735	00:55:50,271	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I'm cry about
EDL	00:55:51,551	00:55:52,319	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	My sister
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:54,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Or I'll break down
EDL	00:55:55,135	00:55:57,439	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't know if I cry about losing the wings but
EDL	00:55:57,951	00:55:59,487	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I thought we get more determined
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:01,279	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But that's kind of
EDL	00:56:01,791	00:56:06,655	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You have to go back at it and think about those moments when you heard what I heard that moment and I
EDL	00:56:09,215	00:56:10,495	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It just
EDL	00:56:10,495	00:56:13,823	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Overcame me was like 4 or 4:30 in the morning
EDL	00:56:14,335	00:56:19,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	When I heard about it and my wife had been up been up looking at the internet and see if she woke me up I thought you were joking
EDL	00:56:20,479	00:56:24,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I jumped out of bed really quick when she said that I know she was serious
EDL	00:56:25,343	00:56:27,391	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Making phone calls right there
EDL	00:56:28,159	00:56:31,999	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To find out if it was true in my phone I was truly. Was just like devastating
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:33,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He.
EDL	00:56:33,535	00:56:35,327	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah it was one of these things that
EDL	00:56:36,095	00:56:36,863	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It's a nightmare
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:38,143	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:56:39,935	00:56:41,471	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Don't let it happen again
EDL	00:56:41,471	00:56:42,751	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I said it's that simple
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:46,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah and you keep getting stronger
EDL	00:56:46,591	00:56:52,991	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And people haven't read they should read the loss of Dan Gable by Wright Thompson the ESPN article that kind of
EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:54,527	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In this very beautiful poetic way
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:56,575	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Ties together
EDL	00:56:58,111	00:57:04,511	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Are all the losses of Dan Gable the losing your sister losing to Larry always losing
EDL	00:57:04,511	00:57:07,583	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wrestling from the Olympics all of these tragedies
EDL	00:57:08,351	00:57:09,631	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Various forms
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:12,191	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So
EDL	00:57:12,191	00:57:17,311	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So that's the ioc is politics and your serve being very pragmatic
EDL	00:57:18,335	00:57:22,431	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Stepping back wrestling is one of the oldest forms of combat.
EDL	00:57:22,431	00:57:26,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Dating back does cave drawings 15000 years ago
EDL	00:57:26,015	00:57:27,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If you look at
EDL	00:57:27,039	00:57:31,135	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The Olympics 27 years ago
EDL	00:57:31,903	00:57:35,487	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Did you ever when you wrestled a coach do you know
EDL	00:57:36,511	00:57:41,119	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	See wrestling in this way freestyle and folkstyle wrestling the purity of
EDL	00:57:41,631	00:57:47,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There's two human beings locked in combat the the roots of that that's just human beings
EDL	00:57:47,775	00:57:51,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Fair struggle between two men or two women
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:53,151	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't think I ever
EDL	00:57:54,175	00:57:54,943	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Looked at it
EDL	00:57:57,503	00:57:59,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	As anything but just
EDL	00:57:59,039	00:58:00,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A combat
EDL	00:58:00,831	00:58:01,343	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:05,695	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think there's times
EDL	00:58:05,695	00:58:06,719	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That have made me
EDL	00:58:07,487	00:58:09,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Figure out how to make that combat better
EDL	00:58:10,815	00:58:12,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	There's little
EDL	00:58:12,095	00:58:13,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Markers
EDL	00:58:13,887	00:58:16,447	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Are little points and time in your life
EDL	00:58:17,471	00:58:18,239	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That make you
EDL	00:58:20,031	00:58:23,103	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Wonder AR should say determined
EDL	00:58:25,151	00:58:27,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To be able to get more out of yourself
EDL	00:58:28,479	00:58:31,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And to be able to take it to a new level
EDL	00:58:31,551	00:58:33,343	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't think people can actually
EDL	00:58:34,111	00:58:38,719	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Feel that way unless you actually had a lot of accomplishments in anything
EDL	00:58:39,231	00:58:40,767	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think there's anything out there
EDL	00:58:40,767	00:58:44,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean no matter what sport are or breaking the 4-minute mile
EDL	00:58:44,607	00:58:45,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I mean when you broke that
EDL	00:58:45,887	00:58:48,959	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Roger Bannister
EDL	00:58:48,959	00:58:51,519	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I can imagine in breaking it from
EDL	00:58:51,519	00:58:53,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Is best time being 4:30
EDL	00:58:54,079	00:58:56,127	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know it's one of these things that
EDL	00:58:56,895	00:58:58,431	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Along the line there
EDL	00:58:58,431	00:58:59,199	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Daddy did
EDL	00:58:59,967	00:59:02,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Had some close calls
EDL	00:59:02,783	00:59:03,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Or
EDL	00:59:03,807	00:59:08,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He had some coaching that was giving him the opportunity become a little better
EDL	00:59:08,415	00:59:09,695	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I think because
EDL	00:59:10,463	00:59:13,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Was doing well and being very successful
EDL	00:59:14,559	00:59:19,423	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That the opportunity came and saucer me it's like the same thing I had so much
EDL	00:59:19,935	00:59:21,215	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Success
EDL	00:59:22,495	00:59:24,287	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so many practices
EDL	00:59:24,799	00:59:25,823	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That went well
EDL	00:59:26,591	00:59:28,127	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so much
EDL	00:59:28,127	00:59:30,431	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Goodness out of this sport
EDL	00:59:31,455	00:59:32,223	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That it
EDL	00:59:32,223	00:59:34,271	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Gave me the opportunity
EDL	00:59:35,039	00:59:35,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	To really
EDL	00:59:36,575	00:59:37,855	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Look more
EDL	00:59:37,855	00:59:38,879	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Finite
EDL	00:59:38,879	00:59:41,439	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And look more how I could even make it better
EDL	00:59:41,439	00:59:42,207	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so it's like
EDL	00:59:42,719	00:59:46,815	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	If you look at my library upstairs I got a library upstairs
EDL	00:59:48,351	00:59:50,399	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And there's a lot of books up there
EDL	00:59:51,679	00:59:53,215	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	From the family and
EDL	00:59:53,215	00:59:55,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But if you look Gable books up there
EDL	00:59:56,799	00:59:57,823	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I got a lot of
EDL	00:59:58,335	01:00:01,151	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Russian technique books
EDL	01:00:01,151	01:00:02,943	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I can't read
EDL	01:00:02,943	01:00:03,455	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The book
EDL	01:00:04,223	01:00:06,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I can see the diagrams
EDL	01:00:06,783	01:00:08,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I can see the figures
EDL	01:00:09,599	01:00:11,647	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They don't really show it in pictures
EDL	01:00:11,647	01:00:12,927	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They do it in drawings
EDL	01:00:14,463	01:00:15,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	01:00:15,231	01:00:19,839	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so it's like when I was trying to beat the best that as
EDL	01:00:20,351	01:00:22,399	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Label the best because
EDL	01:00:22,399	01:00:27,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They won the World Championships every year since they been just about involved
EDL	01:00:27,263	01:00:30,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't think they got started involved you like the 50's but
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:31,871	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But you know it's
EDL	01:00:32,639	01:00:35,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Something you know you study the best
EDL	01:00:35,967	01:00:36,991	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Who's out there
EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:38,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But then you
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:42,367	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Don't Focus so much on the best that you can't beat the best
EDL	01:00:43,135	01:00:44,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You learn from them
EDL	01:00:44,927	01:00:47,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But there's something that they don't have
EDL	01:00:48,767	01:00:49,535	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That you can have
EDL	01:00:50,303	01:00:56,703	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Toughness to technique to the Arts to the science
EDL	01:00:56,703	01:00:59,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do you when you're sitting over there you love MIT
EDL	01:00:59,263	01:01:05,663	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you're bragging about it over Harvard you know it's cuz it's true
EDL	01:01:05,663	01:01:08,735	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Verizon internet
EDL	01:01:08,735	01:01:11,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But but it's the same type of thing
EDL	01:01:11,551	01:01:12,319	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That
EDL	01:01:12,831	01:01:16,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah there's something that you're probably stealing from Harvard that but
EDL	01:01:16,927	01:01:18,463	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do you want give them credit
EDL	01:01:18,463	01:01:19,487	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Well then
EDL	01:01:19,999	01:01:21,023	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In the interest of time
EDL	01:01:21,535	01:01:24,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I've read that you're pretty serious
EDL	01:01:24,607	01:01:25,375	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Your
EDL	01:01:25,375	01:01:26,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Pretty serious into fishing
EDL	01:01:27,423	01:01:28,959	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So what's the biggest fish ever caught
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:35,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Are we talking about here I wait you talk about
EDL	01:01:35,359	01:01:38,175	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't think I've ever caught
EDL	01:01:38,175	01:01:43,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	How big ocean fish, River Lake Ray Sherman
EDL	01:01:43,039	01:01:44,831	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Child problem
EDL	01:01:45,855	01:01:47,135	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Probably Northern
EDL	01:01:47,135	01:01:49,439	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I probably caught in Northern Italy
EDL	01:01:49,439	01:01:50,719	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	27 pounds
EDL	01:01:52,511	01:01:55,071	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Official like to catch walleyes
EDL	01:01:55,071	01:01:59,167	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that's the reason why I like to catch him cuz they're really good eating fish
EDL	01:01:59,167	01:02:01,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And the best eating fish and not the real big ones
EDL	01:02:02,751	01:02:07,871	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I know it's got you kind of interesting that I got people hunting deer right on my land and
EDL	01:02:08,383	01:02:13,759	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	They're looking for the big bucks but they're not the best either see if you want if you want to eat but they're the best trophy
EDL	01:02:13,759	01:02:17,087	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So you know I do have a couple trophy walleyes on the wall but
EDL	01:02:17,599	01:02:18,623	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But
EDL	01:02:18,623	01:02:22,207	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Most time I throw the big ones back and put them back in there so
EDL	01:02:22,207	01:02:26,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I love you know there's a book by Hemingway called old man in the sea
EDL	01:02:26,815	01:02:28,607	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Atrovent and
EDL	01:02:28,607	01:02:31,167	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Ernest Hemingway Ernest Hemingway
EDL	01:02:31,167	01:02:37,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he said there's an old man that basically catches an 18-footer but it's can't pull it in.
EDL	01:02:37,567	01:02:39,615	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have the strength so they together spend
EDL	01:02:39,615	01:02:41,407	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Iwata sharks eat away at it
EDL	01:02:41,919	01:02:45,503	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Miss is very powerful story I think one of the Nobel Prize but
EDL	01:02:46,015	01:02:47,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He says it's better to be lucky
EDL	01:02:48,319	01:02:50,111	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Dogman says better be lucky
EDL	01:02:50,623	01:02:52,927	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I would rather be exact than that
EDL	01:02:53,695	01:02:55,743	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	That way when luck comes you are ready
EDL	01:02:58,815	01:03:00,863	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What do you think about luck
EDL	01:03:00,863	01:03:01,631	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do you believe
EDL	01:03:02,143	01:03:04,703	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And Free Will that we have actions
EDL	01:03:04,703	01:03:07,007	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The control the direction destination of our life
EDL	01:03:07,519	01:03:08,799	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	What does luck
EDL	01:03:08,799	01:03:10,591	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And some other outside forces
EDL	01:03:11,103	01:03:11,615	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Really
EDL	01:03:12,127	01:03:14,175	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Land you where you end up
EDL	01:03:15,199	01:03:16,223	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	For me
EDL	01:03:16,223	01:03:17,247	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm not about luck
EDL	01:03:18,015	01:03:19,807	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I do think there is
EDL	01:03:20,575	01:03:21,855	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Luck is involved
EDL	01:03:22,367	01:03:24,159	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I think it's mostly created
EDL	01:03:24,671	01:03:26,975	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Just how lucky you are
EDL	01:03:26,975	01:03:27,999	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Do preparations
EDL	01:03:28,511	01:03:31,071	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And things have things have happened in my life
EDL	01:03:31,583	01:03:32,351	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Forever
EDL	01:03:33,887	01:03:35,167	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A lot of good things
EDL	01:03:35,679	01:03:39,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	A lot of people could say hey you've been pretty lucky to win all these Awards
EDL	01:03:40,287	01:03:42,335	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't know if you analyze
EDL	01:03:42,847	01:03:43,615	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	My life
EDL	01:03:44,639	01:03:49,503	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I don't think it was involved with luck you know I think it was more involved with preparation
EDL	01:03:49,503	01:03:51,551	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And you don't and again science
EDL	01:03:52,063	01:03:57,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Had you been smarter had you understood that you could do some things
EDL	01:03:57,183	01:03:59,743	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And be just as lucky that be great but
EDL	01:04:00,255	01:04:02,559	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm only as smart as today
EDL	01:04:03,839	01:04:07,679	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	So when I was training in my life and maybe even training people
EDL	01:04:07,679	01:04:08,703	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	In my life
EDL	01:04:09,727	01:04:14,079	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	As of that moment that's how lucky I am to be able to
EDL	01:04:14,591	01:04:17,151	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Have whatever is available to me
EDL	01:04:17,663	01:04:20,991	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And that's what you call that a lot of science so for me I
EDL	01:04:20,991	01:04:25,855	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I think that you don't like right now if I look back I got to do a Lot of Things Different
EDL	01:04:26,367	01:04:27,647	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Just because
EDL	01:04:28,159	01:04:29,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Things are proven
EDL	01:04:29,695	01:04:30,719	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Differently like I
EDL	01:04:31,487	01:04:34,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Give people water coming practice and I did
EDL	01:04:34,815	01:04:39,679	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I would let them change their running wrestling shoes into running shoes to run sprints on the country
EDL	01:04:40,959	01:04:43,263	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Or I would actually maybe
EDL	01:04:43,263	01:04:47,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe I've had a guy climb 12 ropes after practice one after another
EDL	01:04:47,871	01:04:49,407	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And then maybe the next day I'd do it again
EDL	01:04:49,919	01:04:53,247	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I might not make him do it the next day
EDL	01:04:53,247	01:04:55,039	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Lane recover little bit more
EDL	01:04:55,551	01:04:56,063	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	01:04:56,575	01:05:01,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You got to learn keep adding to your philosophy
EDL	01:05:01,183	01:05:05,791	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And your father may have been great at that time but it's at that time
EDL	01:05:05,791	01:05:08,863	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And what is really important is where you at
EDL	01:05:08,863	01:05:10,655	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	With this time today
EDL	01:05:11,423	01:05:13,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And so there's better ways to do things
EDL	01:05:13,727	01:05:15,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Now you'd be ever take attitude out of it
EDL	01:05:16,287	01:05:17,823	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And just depend on
EDL	01:05:18,335	01:05:19,359	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Total science
EDL	01:05:20,639	01:05:23,455	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Then you know you're not going to be as high as
EDL	01:05:23,455	01:05:28,575	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I think it's a listen to a couple people that are really pretty famous people
EDL	01:05:28,575	01:05:33,183	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You want a massage on Irving he was a writer and
EDL	01:05:33,183	01:05:35,231	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He told me so you think I really
EDL	01:05:36,255	01:05:38,559	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Learn how to be a great writer
EDL	01:05:38,559	01:05:39,327	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Henna
EDL	01:05:40,863	01:05:41,887	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Writing School
EDL	01:05:43,679	01:05:44,959	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Ice ice
EDL	01:05:44,959	01:05:46,495	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Yeah I learned a lot there
EDL	01:05:47,007	01:05:49,055	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But really what gave me
EDL	01:05:49,055	01:05:50,335	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The ability
EDL	01:05:51,359	01:05:52,895	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Stay focused
EDL	01:05:52,895	01:05:59,295	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Just to work extra hours to be more discipline was wrestling practices
EDL	01:05:59,295	01:06:03,903	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He was a wrestler go back to that that's what gave me that chance
EDL	01:06:03,903	01:06:06,975	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	You know it and there's a guy and I will that
EDL	01:06:07,999	01:06:09,791	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Guy named Norman Borlaug
EDL	01:06:10,303	01:06:10,815	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Kia
EDL	01:06:11,583	01:06:13,119	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Eevee learn
EDL	01:06:13,631	01:06:15,935	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He invented a process to feed
EDL	01:06:15,935	01:06:17,727	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	The underprivileged countries
EDL	01:06:18,495	01:06:19,775	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Of the world
EDL	01:06:19,775	01:06:20,543	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And
EDL	01:06:21,567	01:06:26,431	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	He was a wrestler and he said the same thing and eat any worth extremely hard
EDL	01:06:26,431	01:06:27,711	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And he said
EDL	01:06:27,711	01:06:30,015	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I give a lot of credit to the sport of wrestling
EDL	01:06:30,015	01:06:36,415	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And even though I was I'm known for this I got a statue in in Washington DC because I
EDL	01:06:36,415	01:06:38,207	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I saved a Billion Lives Plus
EDL	01:06:38,719	01:06:41,279	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	I'm going to get wrestling a lot of credit
EDL	01:06:41,279	01:06:42,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Self
EDL	01:06:42,047	01:06:42,559	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And I think
EDL	01:06:43,327	01:06:44,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Some of these
EDL	01:06:45,119	01:06:46,911	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	MMA Stars
EDL	01:06:46,911	01:06:48,959	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And some of these guys that
EDL	01:06:48,959	01:06:53,567	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Maybe warrant wrestlers that had to Russell Russell had to fight wrestling guys
EDL	01:06:53,567	01:06:59,967	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	And stuff missed a little bit there but I ain't the ones that did have wrestling probably have a really good chance in Canada
EDL	01:06:59,967	01:07:00,991	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Adapted the other ones
EDL	01:07:00,991	01:07:02,783	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	But I think they are every
EDL	01:07:03,295	01:07:05,599	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Martial art or every activities
EDL	01:07:05,599	01:07:08,671	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Good and you probably can't skip any but I don't think they're ever going to
EDL	01:07:08,671	01:07:14,047	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	Overlook and say that rustling pretty nights are not valuable because
EDL	01:07:15,071	01:07:16,095	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	It is
EDL	01:07:16,095	01:07:20,191	| takeituneasy_dan_gable |	However that doesn't mean you're going to make it you still got to take the values and apply it
