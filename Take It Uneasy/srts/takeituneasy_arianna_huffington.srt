00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304

00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,888

International best-sellers

10
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
These books explore

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,480
How to both work hard

12
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,552
I keep a lifestyle that seeks well-being wisdom and wonder

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
I got a chance to sit down for this quick chat after a conference we both spoke at

14
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
And got right into the big topics

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,024
Immortality Obsession meaning happiness

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
And

17
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Love

18
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,096

Alex Friedman spelled f r i d

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
And now

24
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
Is my conversation with Ariana

25
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Huffington

26
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
Be true to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
But because they are hard

28
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:09,120
You tell a story of getting recognition for your first book the female woman

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,680
When you are 23 and sitting in a hotel and

30
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Wondering is this all there is

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
The old question of you know meaning and purpose

32
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
So now

33
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:24,992
A couple of few years later let me ask from your perspective Now what is

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
The purpose what is the meaning of life

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Well

36
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Review

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Believe azzam

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Every

39
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,584
Major philosophy in every major spiritual tradition

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Argues

41
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,216
That that life does not end with death

42
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,824
Whether there is another dimension of consciousness

43
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
Then clearly

44
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,992
A full life and meaningful life includes exploring the dementia

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
And for me

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
And that exploration has

47
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
Being part of my life from

48
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:10,560
My teenage years yeah I went to shantiniketan University in India

49
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,912
When I was 17 to study comparative religion and

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
I always wanted to understand

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,336
What life was about because I never believed that

52
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,408
All this whole experiment and sweet

53
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
Each individual death

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,112
And so that's for me at the heart of my life I mean I've always been very active

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
And

56
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Books with a having unpause now with Dr David but that's being an underlying Dimension that thing gives away

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Real meaning to life

58
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Immortality that really interests

59
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Question at the core of

60
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
All these velocitycu mentioned also

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
Memento Mori the Latin remember death

62
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
That the other

63
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,664
The reflecting on one's own mortality puts things into

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Respond yes

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Do you

66
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
And in a tough question perhaps

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Perhaps not

68
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,904
You often think about your own mortality and what perspective

69
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
Does that help you gain

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
Yes I think about it a lot

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,912
And that and it does give me perspective and it does help me focus on the things that matter to me

72
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
In times of

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
My children my close friends ain't back that want to have

74
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,432
So what we're doing at 5 I have zero interest in what is known as Legacy

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
Because

76
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
Seaside dog thing

77
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Life ends with death

78
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,696
I'm just much more interesting what happens to my soul and

79
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,304
Then what happens to my legacy on.

80
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Do you have a sense

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
So what

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Happens

83
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
After you die

84
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Absol

85
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
Do you have a

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
Is it more of a feeling if you have a more concrete sense

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Spiritually

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
How do you see the world what happened

89
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
Do your soul

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
2 feet 500

91
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
The heck you were while you were here on Earth what does that become

92
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
An Entertainer in time

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
So my son

94
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
Is that

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,768
We are a personality the body them

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
The mind

97
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
Is like a car that we rented

98
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
And we

99
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
And we

100
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
Return

101
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
I'm at the airport and get on the plane

102
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,919
And go to another city and rent another car

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
I want to rent another car if you believe in reincarnation depending on where you are and your state of evolution

104
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,159
But definitely that what survives is the soul

105
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,047
And that's why how we live our lives and the choices you make an

106
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
How we treat others

107
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,935
I'm is so Central to what happens after death

108
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
All of those elements

109
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
You believe kind of feed

110
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
So you've also mentioned that

111
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Under

112
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,271
On the harsh challenging part of life that failure is an essential part of life

113
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,903
So what may be a major failure that stands out to you for your for yourself

114
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,023
One of the toughest ones for you psychologically to have bounced back from if you ever

115
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Dead

116
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Bounce back from

117
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
Yes Run Festival

118
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,935
I don't think there is any if I don't think there's a single successful

119
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Compassion

120
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,543
I was not saying that long the way I mean I

121
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,175
I challenge you to find one if you do let me know but in my experience

122
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
Everybody has failed along the way and

123
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
I think it would be great if

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Successful people talk more about their failures

125
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
The difference is resilience and

126
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
How quickly do you get discouraged

127
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,351
In my case I actually probably the hardest failure

128
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
Was when I was 28

129
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
And them

130
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
And my second book you mentioned my Facebook with

131
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Did very well

132
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
My second book witches on the crisis in

133
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
In political leadership in the West

134
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
Was it rejected by

135
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,671
At 27 Publishers unit one after the other after the other

136
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
And then Empire

137
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,791
That time I had to run out of money

138
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
I've been living off the proceeds of my first

139
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
And I remember walking kind of depressed on Saint James Street in London

140
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Where I live

141
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,175
And thinking when maybe my Facebook was just a flu

142
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
And I'm not really a writer and I have to go get a real job

143
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
And then I saw Barclays Bank in the corner and I walked in and asked to see the manager and ask them out

144
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
What the

145
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
Brits call an overdraft

146
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Is that allowed

147
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
And I have nothing

148
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Not now I said

149
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,703
And for some reason the manager whose name is Ian Bell

150
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
Gave it to me

151
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
You and that kind of changed my life because it made it possible for me to keep things together for another 13 rejection

152
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Samsung

153
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
At that point I got an acceptance and

154
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,551
I sent in Bellaire holiday card every year

155
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
And that he's a little bit like you know in fairy days when the hero are the heroine gets lost in the.

156
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Darkfall Reston

157
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
And then suddenly

158
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,935
Helpful animal comes out and gives them out of the forest world

159
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
Sometimes helpful animals in our lives

160
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,639
Sign in the form of a bank manager

161
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
A Modern Fairytale

162
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,527
So I spoke with Elon Musk recently on the podcast

163
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
And you've had the

164
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
A friendly exchange with him on Twitter

165
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,439
Last year about work hours and sleep

166
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,791
So I myself as an engineer I'm obsessed with the work I do

167
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
I keep a schedule closer to

168
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,239
One that Yolanda's I would say A+ I'm Russian so I believe suffering is good for the soul so

169
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
How do you square

170
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
How does a singular Obsession in the soda

171
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
The term wall of innovation

172
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,015
I fit into a lifestyle you discussing Thrive one focus and well-being wisdom in wonder

173
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
So how do you score that would like singular obsession

174
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
Oh I think singular obsessions are wonderful all my favorite favorite people are addicts

175
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Dave and obsessive personality

176
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Abbott if you're obsessed

177
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
About

178
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Whatever it is you're looking to achieve

179
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
If I wear this in research

180
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,591
Electric cars are going to the moon or anything

181
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
You need to look at the science and the data that shows that you're going to be more creative and more

182
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,111
Productive and more likely to achieve the results of your obsession

183
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
If you actually

184
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
And

185
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Take some time to recharge

186
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
That's really what we're talkin about

187
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
So you're

188
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Your senses

189
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
So science and data

190
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
These things you talk about

191
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
Things of rational people so you think

192
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,615
You think I The Impossible can be achieved by rational people

193
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,919
Does Madness play a role

194
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
I'm at Madness plays a role

195
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
But also

196
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
Looking at the results

197
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Needs to play a role

198
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,255
Like I can't miss and I have huge admiration for alien mask and I wrote the op-ed letter to him

199
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,839
With that in mind kind of lovingly and admiringly

200
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
And then helping him

201
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Ihob look at

202
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
The laws of human n

203
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Because

204
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
If you

205
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
A violate the laws of human energy

206
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
Violating the laws of gravity. Consequence

207
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
And he's facing the consequences

208
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
He's being distracted

209
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
Prom shoes amazing obsession

210
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
And you think there's a way to do better

211
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,255
Absolutely I mean I think you should look at what happened

212
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
The results of

213
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Twitching in the middle of the night because he's

214
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,959
You know he's cognitive impairment makes him do things which you know if you should not be doing

215
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,591
And then the ending up having to step down as chairman paid 20 million

216
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
Having to go to car to deal with the SEC who needs that when you're building something amazing for Humana

217
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
You think of more balance

218
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,135
Sleep cycle 25 balance

219
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
Because I agree with you that

220
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
There's no balance when you're trying to achieve something big

221
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,215
I mean that times when I've pulled all-nighters at times when people are thrive

222
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
Have pulled all-nighters to ship a product

223
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
In fact we make that very clear

224
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:59,711
When we hire people we're not at 9 to 5 operation where you just balance

225
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Spanx

226
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Baidu

227
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,063
You need to after that take time to recharge

228
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,671
And the faster you do it the more effective you're going to be with Carlos drive time

229
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
So let's say you pulled an all-nighter

230
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,279
Take something the next day to recharge

231
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Before

232
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
And

233
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
Yara exhaustion becomes cumulative either you do stupid things are Eufaula sake are all the same

234
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Things that we're staying around

235
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Catches up to you

236
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
On another topic you

237
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Have evolved

238
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
Throughout the years your political views

239
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
From

240
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,135
Maybe you can correct me but from right of Center to left of center

241
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,743
Can you take me through your journey of political thought and how do you see the evolution of

242
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
The greater political landscape

243
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,863
Along with your Evolution throughout the last

244
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Several decades

245
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
So my Evolution was from being

246
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
A kind of them

247
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
Republican that's practically extinct now

248
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
Kind of broad choice

249
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Breguet rides

250
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
Pro-gun-control Republic

251
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,599
To someone who realize that

252
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,951
My understanding of the role of government was limited

253
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,047
You know I really was a republican because I thought that the private sector

254
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
Wood-stack bopping address

255
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Inequalities and

256
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
They needed a

257
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
Care of people at the lower

258
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
SSE economy

259
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Rags

260
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,919
And I saw if I said this was going to happen and that you needed the real power of

261
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Government

262
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
Appropriations to be able to achieve that

263
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
He does my shift

264
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:45,183
In my understanding of the role of government that led to my shift in political views

265
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
I think what's happening right now at this moment

266
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Quimet

267
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
The chickens are coming home to roost

268
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Like a lot of fun

269
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
A lot of problems that you seem coming

270
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,919
That they've been discussing at endless conferences I don't know how many conference I've been at

271
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,783
With titles like inclusive capitalism the dangers of growing inequalities

272
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
We talked about them I didn't really do anything about

273
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,463
And I saw that is on some

274
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,791
Different forms of right-wing or left-wing populism

275
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,399
And them is a very serious moment but I don't think it's going to be

276
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Solved

277
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
By living in a Perpetual state of outrage

278
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
So

279
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
You've also launched this incredible

280
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
Platform in 2005 of Huffington Post

281
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Apus is now called

282
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
What impact

283
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:47,391
Do you think it had over the past 14 years on the nature of public discourse if you look at what

284
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
At this course is today

285
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
The divisiveness

286
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
What impact does the

287
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,119
Digitization of our conversation to the online of Twitter

288
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
And then

289
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
Of more journalistic type of content like Huffington Post contains

290
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
What what do you think it

291
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
Has done for our discourse was it been a positive thing

292
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,503
Was it been a catalyst for the divisiveness or do they simply reveal the divisiveness those late in there already

293
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
What do you think

294
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
What the Huffington Post

295
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
Help democratize the conversation

296
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Github elevate

297
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,327
What blogging was you know when we launch the having a Boston 2005

298
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,447
Blogging was dismissed as something that people who couldn't get a job we're doing in the

299
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Parents basement

300
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,127
And because we brought in people who could have written for the New York Times like

301
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,711
Walter Cronkite the Nora Ephron and Larry David

302
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
We elevated

303
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,855
The opportunity afforded to all of us to Expresso

304
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Bobblehead very very

305
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Careful

306
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Guidelines

307
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,655
So for example we everything was too late that we did not allow ad hominem comment

308
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Want some point

309
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,823
Before I left the hobbiton bus I even ended Anonymous comments all together

310
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
Because it was becoming too hard to police

311
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
So from the beginning I wanted to democratize the conversation

312
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,367
Side by side with the investigative journalism and all the things that

313
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
I loved and honored

314
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
But at the same time

315
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
I saw the dangerous of

316
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Diabetic ccd.com

317
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Infiltrate

318
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,007
These conversations if they're not monitored and there is no real curation

319
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
So one of the core things

320
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,175
That emerged from The Huffington post's I mean there is a little bit of a viewpoint

321
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
Underlying it is left

322
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,063
El Centro College laugh there's definitely a viewpoint

323
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,391
In fact we called our journalists Beyond

324
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,975
Right and left I think the right left divisions

325
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
The way of looking at the world in terms of right and left

326
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Is incredibly obsolete

327
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,239
Being concerned about a growing inequality

328
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
Is not a left-wing position if you are somebody who cares about Law and Order

329
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
You should care about that

330
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
Unless you want the country to be turned into it

331
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
Banana Republic with rich people living

332
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Behind Gates

333
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Security guards

334
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
If you care about

335
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,999
Climate change does it mean your on the left

336
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
What does it mean that you want to preserve the planet

337
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:40,959
So I think by looking at the world in right or left breast implant polarizing

338
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
The conversation

339
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
But

340
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
So that's a beautiful idea

341
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
And that I share it

342
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
But nevertheless

343
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
It seems that

344
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,039
Did there's a strong gravitational field that pulls people into left and right and no matter what they will place

345
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
Different venues into those

346
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Polaris

347
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,951
So is it seems that the hogs in the public perception

348
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
Huffington Post kind of gets into the left and there's

349
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
These opposing forces

350
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
How Breitbart and so on the deck to get this

351
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
Placed somehow and to the right

352
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
And then there's the right team in the blue team

353
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,799
I guess my question is do you see do you notice this

354
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Do you see a path forward in the coming decade

355
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
In the air of our current president

356
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
Maybe bringing us back together

357
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
And having a healthy disagreement on the issues

358
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
As opposed to having

359
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
Teams and tribes of red and blue

360
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,327
I absolutely do I think that two things that I sent really not to achieve that one is a reverence for fat

361
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,519
You and I have the right to our own opinions but we don't have the right part on side of face

362
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
So that's number one

363
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
And them and number two is to

364
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,759
Do and the view of journalists. Jay Rosen has described

365
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
Has the view from Noah

366
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Like I think

367
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
Climate change is not a matter of opinion

368
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,303
So a lot of journalists feel that their position is to

369
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
Have one person who thinks climate change is real another person with things it's not and their job is to stay in

370
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Midland play ponponpon

371
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Spiral to me

372
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
That's like

373
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Not at all

374
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:29,759
Great journalist men's that about having a bus definitely had to Viewpoint as you're sad

375
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
But it was a Viewpoint based on fact

376
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
And I actually recommend that people listen

377
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,511
Do your podcast with a special conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson

378
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,119
That kind of emphasises talks about science and the importance of

379
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Why people have

380
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Teresa

381
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
The seriousness

382
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
Amongst our leaders towards science

383
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,335
As a thing that you shouldn't politicize

384
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
Well last question

385
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
How do you balance

386
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Love

387
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
And ambition

388
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
Thinking about your work with thrive

389
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
This Obsession towards

390
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
What is building like your car is going to Mars

391
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
Building Huffington Post

392
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Obsession with your work life

393
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:21,215
And a genuine deep obsession with your family or people in your life that you love

394
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
How do you balance that

395
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Time

396
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
And energy

397
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,687
Well let me give you an example right now you know Thrive global

398
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
He's an obsession

399
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Ending a

400
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
The stress and burnout epidemic

401
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
He's our mission and I

402
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,583
I've see that's having a huge impact on our hands on our mantel has an aura and they're not performance

403
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
But at the same time

404
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,959
I have two daughters that I adore

405
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,615
And everybody in my office knows that when I get a call from one of my daughters at any point

406
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
I will take it

407
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,223
And that and that they are a priority

408
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
That doesn't mean

409
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
I can't dogs have be obsessed

410
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
About

411
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
Why do I doing and are gross

412
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
I think this is what a false dichotomy

413
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
It's because I think when

414
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
When we

415
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Nurture

416
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
The part of us that is about love that is about connection

417
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:31,359
We also natural the deeper parts of our humanity and it's from those parts that wisdom and creativity

418
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Become

419
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
The More Love

420
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,759
Will strengthen all parts your life and improve improve productivity in Alaska

421
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,807
Exactly do you know interesting enough

422
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Jack Ma

423
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,207
Highly awaiting Violet in the obsession Department

424
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
I'm sad in Davos

425
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Last year that

426
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,423
What's going to win the future is not just IQ

427
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:01,311
Or even EQ emotional intelligence but I'll kill the last question

428
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,663
Average of something surprising coming from Jack Ma

429
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
But I think it's part of the shape that's happening

430
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
Where we recognize that

431
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,903
While Ai and machine learning are going to

432
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,512
They cover a huge part of our life and Destroy many jobs

433
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,888
The things that AI is not going to be able to do other distinctly human thing

434
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
And loving is one of them

435
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
And

436
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,800
So I think it's a beautiful place then Don is love

437
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Ariana thank you so much for talk today

438

Thank you so much

439
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
Be true to go to the mall in this potato and do the other things not because they are easy

440
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:49,440
But because they are hard
