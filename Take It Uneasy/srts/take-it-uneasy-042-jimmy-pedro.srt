00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy

2
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,760
Has co-authored by you first

3
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,064
Astride quick hypothetical question

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,440
If I told you right now that I have with me I brought I told you I'm Russian I brought with me

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
Back in the car

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,560
Two guys there waiting outside with a 73 kg players

7
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,864
They happen to be in the top 10 in the world

8
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:42,496
When is Russian the others Japanese and I'll give you $1 if you beat one of them in Judo

9
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,312
And you don't match which one do you fight

10
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
Tough question

11
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
Russian or Japanese which one would you play

12
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,040
I think I take my shot against the Russian

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,416
And the reason is that there's so much more technical

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,512
Give directions that we have great Judo explosive power

15
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,608
Don't get me wrong it's a tough decision either way but

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,680
When I look back at my statistics in in which

17
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,240
Which style of player I beat more often

18
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
I had more success against Russians an idea did against Japanese alright that's the voice of Jimmy

00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456

Those people have been on this podcast so

34
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
Nice

35
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
First Judo coach was your dad

36
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Still your Judo coach

37
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Always will be

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
Always will be

39
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,984
Can you talk about your relationship with your dad when you first started Judo

40
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Did you put a lot of pressure on you to win

41
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
So my dad

42
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
For those of you that have ever had the

43
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Privilege of meeting him

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
He's Unforgettable

45
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
When I was a kid

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Genewiz

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
Was mandatory

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,976
It was no such thing as I don't want to go to Judo today it was you're going to Gino's tonight and it was every night

49
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,096
Yeah we only had practice when I was a little boy three days a week but I was at the Jojo

50
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,704
5/6 days a week running around the Madison watching classes and things like that but

51
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
My dad was very heart of me as a youngster

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,336
Push me to compete push me to train

53
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,224
He gave me exercise routine to do when I wasn't doing Judo I had to do conditioning off the mat

54
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
You know that he brought me through circuit training and stuff like that so

55
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
Yeah my dad was very demanding father but

56
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
Is his mentality was that

57
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
Good good for me not just

58
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
To become a great athlete but

59
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,376
For the life lessons that I would learn through the sport of Judo and what it would do to

60
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192
Tell me become a better better person

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Pandora

62
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
Yeah you know many many parents want their kids to eat vegetables because it's good for them and eat healthy cuz it's what they want

63
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Father wanted me to digital

64
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Cuz of what I could do for me

65
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
And so I mean that is a story

66
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
A lot of great

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
Since port in wrestling and Judo

68
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
So the question for me is

69
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Your father now

70
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Your coach now

71
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,048
Do you and did your dad's struggle that balance between

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
No letting your kid do whatever they want

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
And

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
Dragging them Kicking and Screaming to training

75
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,568
Well I'm a different I'm a different father than my dad was but I also have

76
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,384
My kids have to live in different shoes than I had to live in

77
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:06,528
So my father wasn't an Olympic champion he wasn't you know a national hero in in

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
He fell short of making the Olympics himself

79
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,696
So I was I was almost doing it with him and in for him

80
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,536
Where's my kids feel like you're doing it for me you know where they

81
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
State

82
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,191
Every tournament they go to they have a ton of pressure cuz the whole world is watching them because they're Jimmy Pedro son

83
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,567
You know there's a lot of parents that are that can be obnoxious and when their kid beats my kid it's

84
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,151
It's the biggest deal on the world so my kids have to deal with all that pressure that

85
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
No kid should have to deal with

86
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,039
So I'm a different father I I give my children to choice

87
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,647
What sports to play of course as a yacht as young individuals at all did you know

88
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
They all competed up until they were teenagers

89
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,351
But it's at point I let them decide what sports they want to play what they want to do right now I have a son who's

90
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Ranked number one in the nation in the sport of wrestling

91
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
As a sophomore in high school

92
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Now he's chose wrestling as a sport

93
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
I have a daughter that went on to play hockey and softball and now she's a freshman in college at Bentley University

94
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:12,319
But I think that they're digital training that they did get when they were young helped mold them as individuals and as good peep

95
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
And so I wanted him to do it for that same reason

96
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,743
Anything is possible what certainly is possible but

97
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
The path to success is

98
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Doesn't have to acquire

99
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,167
Excessive pressure from the coaches in the parenting in the early years

100
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
Everybody's different

101
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,287
I think everybody is different a response that pressure differently

102
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
You know what had I been given a choice I could tell you right now I probably would never have made any Olympic teams or

103
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Wouldn't have

104
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,575
Excelled in the Sportage you at all cuz it's not something I would have pursued

105
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
My dad didn't give me the choice and it wasn't until I was about

106
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
15 years old where I started to become a man

107
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,303
Start to really want to do this for digital for myself

108
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,935
Up until that point I was too immature and it didn't understand what was going on and

109
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
You know I felt all that

110
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,079
Pressure from my father and I despise doing the training sometimes or

111
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
You know it was difficult but as 1516 was am pretty damn good at this thing

112
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,575
You know what I like being around other athletes and I get to see the

113
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,463
At that in a white 1560 is that the travel you start to go away from home you going to Kansas City

114
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,303
In Oklahoma or Florida are you going on trips overseas

115
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Try to become fun as a teenager right

116
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Get to see the world show

117
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,471
That's when I started doing it for me and that's when it really became enjoyable

118
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
And so in those years. Late teens

119
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
How did your

120
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Relationship

121
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Evolve

122
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
Then it really became I was motivated you know I was always a self-motivated kid anyway but

123
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,599
Really when I was 15 to 16 I turn the corner and I and I

124
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Decided that I was

125
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,743
Giving 100% all the time and in my dad truly became

126
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
Not just a father but

127
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,655
I saw him as a great coach somebody that that had a wealth of knowledge

128
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,007
That new how to train athletes that knew how to get the most out of his athletes

129
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,383
And it did actually expose me to the world I think the biggest credit I can give to my father as a coach

130
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
Is that he sent me away

131
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
To learn from other people

132
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
The biggest mistake most coaches make

133
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Is that

134
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
They keep their students

135
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
To themselves and they hold them back from reaching their potential

136
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Because you were afraid

137
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,607
Did that students going to go on and learn something special from somebody else and no longer give their their original Coach credit

138
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
Especially as a father and a scary thing 2

139
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
Give up your son to somebody else

140
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
That's what my dad said he said Sana is technically technically I've taken you as far as I can take you and I

141
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
I never made the Olympic team

142
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
I want to surround you with greatness

143
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
I want you to go see

144
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Did these other athletes

145
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Adjust people to

146
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
And if they're not these days

147
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,255
Heroes that you put on big pedestal but they're everyday ordinary people that make mistakes that fall down to get back up

148
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
I want you to be around them because champions

149
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,215
Be around Champion To Be A Champion see how they ask you how to behave see how they think and also learn from them

150
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,567
My dad sent me the all the best coaches in America at the time which were Irwin Cohen who

151
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,919
Recently passed away and Patrick Burruss was on two Olympic teams and

152
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,247
Daniel Adams in England and I learn from Neil and

153
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
I sent me to Japan and sent me to Germany in

154
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Gunther No Rider and

155
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
I learned from some good coaches in Japan and

156
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
I picked up something everywhere I went

157
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
My dad said hey

158
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
I want to send you away don't just train I want you to learn

159
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
What should I do

160
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,935
Bring back a new technique from everywhere you go show me what it is

161
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
And I can tell you

162
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
That as I gathered all that

163
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
All those new techniques and all that new knowledge

164
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,175
To this day I can tell you who I learned all of the different techniques that I did in my career from

165
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Which is amazing

166
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
You know

167
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
So that's the biggest mistake I think the most most coaches make is

168
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
And tattoo exposed

169
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
To the rest of the world

170
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,791
And I give my dad a lot of credit for having the foresight

171
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
To do that for me

172
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,423
Is slightly darker side was there

173
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
As a competitor

174
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
Was there ever a time you consider quitting jail

175
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,383
Absolutely every Champion wants to quit I can tell you numerous times

176
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
When I was only

177
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
16 years old

178
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
I went to the US Open

179
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
In Judo it's

180
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
At the time it was one of the hardest tournament so I'm in the world

181
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Cuz the whole world love Coming to America

182
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,511
Kids compete so we're Japanese and we had Russians we had friendship we had Brazilians and

183
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,863
In as a young boy it was a super hard tournament to compete in a computer gets all the men

184
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
And I got tournament

185
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
I had a great

186
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
Day I lost to the

187
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
Eddie lady who took third in the Olympics

188
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
1084

189
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,199
And then I battled back and I was fighting for bronze medal against the guy from Korea

190
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,295
And I scored in the first like 30 seconds I threw the Korean guy

191
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
24 years old strongest hacking

192
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,487
Physical and Technical Honors

193
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
But

194
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,839
I threw all my score right away and then he grabbed me

195
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,167
Crossmatch started shaking my gay and stabbing

196
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
I ended up getting 3 penalties

197
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
And losing the fight

198
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
My father

199
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
What natural on me embarrass me in front of everybody

200
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Taking that match

201
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
That I was calling to my father

202
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
I fought afraid I was scared to lose

203
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
Physically I couldn't match this guy he was so anyway

204
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,559
Long story short I went out in the snow took my GF laid down in Colorado Springs in the snow just cried

205
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
Just bought my heart outfit like 8 fights

206
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
You know I lost for a bronze medal of 16 years old and one of the toughest tournaments

207
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
I felt like a failure

208
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
My dad my dad

209
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
You know Danny embarrassed me in front of everybody so I want to quit

210
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
At another time

211
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
I was in Japan

212
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
And I'd spent six weeks training Japan

213
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
And I went to the kennel cough

214
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
McConnell

215
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
Is one of the best time is in the world

216
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
If that tournament

217
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Mai Tai

218
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,279
I sucked a lot of weight after being in Japan for 6 months 6 weeks

219
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
I slept a ton of weight and I was all excited to fight well

220
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
My first round was against Sergey cuz minion

221
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Cuz meaning of the Russian

222
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
First match of the tournament kuzmania

223
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Truly free phone

224
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
I didn't know I didn't lie was

225
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
That was all

226
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,735
Cuz me and then threw Macklemore free phone

227
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,831
And I saw my friend cuz menu and on anyone that tournament is it first

228
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
My second was against Nakamura

229
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,255
He beat me by Pancho and Owen to in the Kanto cup after being in Japan for 6 weeks

230
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303
Dieting and losing a lot of weight

231
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
Made all this sacrifice

232
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
I remember sitting on the steps at the Budokan

233
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,727
You know at 19 years old sick of myself

234
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
I hate the sport

235
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
I just want to quit

236
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Terrifying

237
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
The will

238
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,199
Where do you find how do you continue

239
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
Every Champion wants to quit I love that

240
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
The hardest thing that I think the

241
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
Thing that most people don't realize is that they only see Champions as winners they only see the times when they succeed they don't see the

242
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Dark days

243
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
I don't see those days where they struggle though they lost are they failed

244
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
Weather for the day in training when they got their butts whooped

245
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Right

246
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
All those tournaments where they just fought miserable nobody ever hears about those days but we all go through it because nobody

247
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
Doesn't happen

248
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
So really what makes Champions is

249
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
How do you want to go out

250
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,743
You know do you want that to be your last competition do you want to go out as a loser as a quitter

251
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Are you going to

252
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
Suck it up learn from the loss

253
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Dig deeper get better

254
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Re motivate yourself

255
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
Nnn become a champion of that take that was my mindset my whole career I wanted to be on the top of the world I wanted to be topped

256
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Napoleon

257
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
World Olympics that was my goal

258
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
And quite honestly

259
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
That same guy clothes

260
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
You know he beat me in the 91 world

261
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
The next year

262
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,951
And then finally 92 I got them in the finals of the Italian tournament

263
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
The Guido's

264
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
You know it perseverance and tenacity and

265
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Sometimes it pays off

266
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Is there something

267
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
You're a grass fire early Judo

268
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Years of training

269
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Something you wish you would have done differently

270
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,039
I think early days now because you know I played a lot of sports as a kid

271
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
My dad allowed me I played in a football Pop Warner football I played baseball as a young kid I wrestled and

272
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
High School

273
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
I did you know so I had a good balance to my

274
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
Adolescent years and my childhood

275
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Forgot to

276
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
Play a lot of sports in in learn

277
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
A lot of things about team working

278
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
It really found out that

279
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
The best thing about Judo and wrestling an individual sports is that

280
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
You ought to know we decide how good you going to be you don't have to rely on the rest of your team or you don't have to worry about having a crappy coach

281
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,367
You know being in a bad situation you get out of it what you put into it

282
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Show

283
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,207
I don't think I regret anything as a youngster other than

284
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
I wish II

285
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Could have enjoyed it more

286
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
As a child

287
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
You know I had a lie went undefeated

288
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
In Judo until I was 11 years old

289
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
What about when I was six

290
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,823
So I 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

291
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
I didn't lose a match until I was 11 years old

292
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
And that was the finals of the national championships

293
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
So think about

294
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
Pressure of going undefeated for all those years there scams

295
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
Right and having your father

296
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
Is Bump you up to the next weight class or fight the harder person or the next age category or always challenging

297
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Yourself

298
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
Should I have all that pressure and push the envelope threshold

299
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,983
I had anxiety about every tournament I went into up until I was

300
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Till I finally lost

301
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
You are you talk

302
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Often

303
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
You yourself are graduating

304
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
How you talk often about the value of Education

305
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
So

306
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Do you think there's room

307
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
Life outside of Judo for

308
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
Somebody who wants to make the podium at the Olympics

309
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Absolutely

310
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
Unquestionably I believe that

311
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
Athletes who lived live a balanced life

312
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,959
Who don't put all of their energy into just sport

313
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
End up becoming better athletes

314
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Because it

315
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
When you fail in sports

316
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
You feel like a complete failure

317
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
If that's all you do

318
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
But if you have

319
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,831
Something else that you're pursuing parallel to the sport whether it's an education

320
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
WeatherTech rear

321
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Whether it's family

322
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,743
If you have something else in your life that you can put your energy to

323
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
It makes you feel good about yourself

324
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Then

325
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
They kind of balance each other out

326
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
Sailing sport

327
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,239
But I get an A on this exam I still feel good about myself

328
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,335
Or if I do lousy in school but I just won this tournament

329
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
I feel good about myself

330
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,943
Because I found some reward in something I did

331
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
Where is all you do is sports

332
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
And you fail

333
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
Then you have nothing else

334
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,671
You feel like I sacrificed everything I gave my everything for this moment

335
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
It didn't happen so I think the Lowe's end up being lower

336
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
And that's why I encourage my athletes

337
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,959
Yelp eat at rental teach other students get involved in some other way like they can

338
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
They can take pride in their in their students winning tournaments

339
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,103
You know it is that's a parallel path

340
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,199
Like I said educational work or something else to provide some sort of enjoyment

341
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,831
What's so that's not you don't think that's a negative a distraction to that One Singular Focus toes

342
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,695
I think there's certain times were obviously six month before the Olympic Games

343
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,023
It's time to focus and put all your energy into Spa

344
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,607
Okay so I took it when I was at Brown I took a break from Brown

345
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Focus just on training in Judo in the Olympics

346
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
Yeah but I never really put my life on hold

347
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Swissport I had kids

348
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,895
Before I won the 99 world I mean I had

349
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Two kids already

350
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
In one on the way

351
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
You know so I was a father and in

352
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Coming home from a long training

353
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
Tripped or competition ronen

354
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:36,767
Overseas and coming home and seeing you two and three-year-olds run up to you and you forget about

355
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,375
You forget about that guy that just whooped your but it was right

356
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Perspective

357
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
So you meddled

358
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
In 91 the world

359
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
And in 2000 for the Olympics

360
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
How many times in between

361
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,527
That's it at least 13 years of being one of the best YouTube competitors in the world

362
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
So what

363
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
What would you what would you attribute that longevity to

364
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
For so long being at the top

365
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
Well like I said

366
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
I wanted to be the best in the world show my motivation was to to be world or Olympic Channel

367
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
Nevada injury in there

368
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Yes

369
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:23,615
Also plays into everything everything happens for a reason and everything plays into what you ultimately

370
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Become

371
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,711
My injury was pretty devastating

372
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Describe

373
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
People that don't know

374
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
I actually was in a tournament in the finals of a

375
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Korea

376
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
And I got picked up in front of my head

377
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,791
And I tournament in really instead of taking the fall and just losing

378
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,911
Stuck my head out and I can write down on the top of my head and then my feet went over and I did a bridge

379
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,263
I didn't think anything of it I got off and I finish the fight and I lost

380
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
But then

381
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
Going home on the airplane and noticed it

382
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
My

383
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,711
It got harder and harder to lift my chin up off of my chest

384
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
By the time I landed

385
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
In Boston

386
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
The neck and the disc and swollen so much that it was hitting the spinal cord

387
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Cancel Mike my chin. Pinned to my chest

388
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,071
Then I just had radiating shooting pain down my arm into my hand

389
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
That was no

390
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,191
It was like that for quite a while so I'll just say I went to the doctors

391
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
First

392
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
MRI

393
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
Doctor said you will never

394
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
You said Jimmy I'm sorry but you will never do Sports again in your life

395
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,271
Did someday I can get you to become just a normal functioning human being again

396
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
Remember going and I cried

397
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Elevator

398
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
23 years old

399
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,255
Thinking that your career is over

400
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
And at the same time

401
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
I couldn't sleep

402
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,935
Because I couldn't lay down in a bed mites in my chin have to stay here

403
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,983
In my arm have to stay here

404
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,591
Ross the pain was excruciating for lifting my head in anyway I just couldn't move

405
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
Well that's cool arm in that chest muscle

406
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
Tricep Shrunk the zero

407
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
All the nerve damage wood

408
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
Happened on the right side so

409
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,391
I slept many a nights just sitting in the traction unit with a

410
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,999
Await over-the-door in my dorm room and I would just sit there with my head trying to pull up

411
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
And I will try to sleep because it was the only time I could ever get comfortable

412
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
I had about six months old

413
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Living like that

414
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
For how long did you believe is it

415
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,663
That you're not doing Judo ever again entire time I was injured in the painting

416
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,247
Dull throbbing pain

417
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
You had no feeling in your hand to your ear

418
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
So I knew it was serious

419
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
And I tell you I

420
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,023
Sometimes the only thing I could do is I would drink like 8 or 10 beers

421
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
To pass out I couldn't

422
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,119
I I couldn't stand the pain I couldn't move

423
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
You know I didn't sleep in a bed for that whole time

424
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
You know and then

425
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
Even when it started

426
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
I got lucky

427
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
I just kept taking anti-inflammatories I kept

428
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
Doing good

429
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Traction

430
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,247
And I think I just got lucky over time

431
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,855
The nerve regenerated itself the disc started to go back and I never had surgery

432
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
And

433
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:21,536
I started getting a little bit of range of motion back and then I was so excited I went back to the doctor I said.

434
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,400
And I was like

435
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
You made a lot of progress and you know he would he said okay

436
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,616
I don't want you to run you can't do Judo know wrestling is too but I want you to go back in the weight room

437
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
I want you to start

438
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
Retraining that muscle in that those muscles to move again

439
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
I remember the first day on the Nautilus machine

440
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
No wait

441
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
There was no way

442
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
I was just like this

443
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
Trying to train my muscles to move

444
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
First time on the bench press

445
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
Just the bar

446
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,616
Girls in the weight room

447
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,248
I just

448
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
A lot of rehab

449
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
To get that tenant finally

450
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:24,512
Overtime I got stronger and stronger neck muscles and traps and

451
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
It came back and it took about nine months to

452
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,472
Be back strong enough where I could get back on the mat and said doing what you call me Zin

453
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
Start to train again

454
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
Incredible

455
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Jonestown years after that

456
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
What up

457
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Right

458
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,136
How is Jimmy Pedro 1991 different from the one of 2004

459
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
So

460
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
At the beginning of the dominance to the end of the

461
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
I would say that the young Jimmy Pedro was Fearless

462
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
Was raw

463
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Talented

464
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
Dodger gritty

465
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
And

466
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,872
Got after it just that just talked just flat-out

467
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,320
You are so not so explosive though cuz I cut a lot of weight when I was younger so I wasn't so explosive in 91 in

468
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,672
Mike my best years in the sport of Judo Workwear between

469
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:30,048
95 and 99 was when I was explosive technical

470
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
Superhero really strong on the mat

471
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,680
Physically real explosive

472
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,240
Is real technical

473
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,312
Those are my best years in sport 95 to 99 in fact

474
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
95

475
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:48,736
I look back and I I should have been in the finals of the world that year I could have been world champion 95

476
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
I lost or

477
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Korean in the semi-finals

478
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
By Split Decision

479
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
And

480
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
Judo

481
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,696
It was a split flag decision that I thought I won

482
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
And I think the Korean thought I won

483
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,352
In that year the Japanese who won the who won the world

484
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,960
Three months later I beat him pretty easily and in Germany so

485
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
Thought I should have been world champion 95

486
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
And then

487
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,616
2 weeks before the 97 World Championships

488
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
Which I was undefeated

489
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
Wake the whole year winning everything

490
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,856
2 weeks before I was supposed to go to World Championships I went to where

491
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
Training camp that the coach

492
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
Talk me into going to

493
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
And

494
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
To the heavyweights

495
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
One guy got thrown into my leg

496
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
You took my MC my MCL

497
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,008
Second-degree sprain of my MCL he just fell into her swelled up

498
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,080
And it was only two weeks before I had to step on the mat at the world

499
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
And that MCL

500
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Couldn't hear one time

501
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,480
So I didn't I didn't actually fight in the 97 World Championships

502
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
As a result of that

503
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
So

504
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,648
But 99 I was 9899 I I don't think I lost

505
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
Maybe two or three times and then I'll run

506
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
You know when really it was because I completed so many tournaments Right In A Row 1 week after another week after another week and body is broken.

507
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
Padang 2004

508
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
You know I was

509
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
I retired after 2000

510
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
Only because I told my family that

511
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
This is the end of my run supposed to win the Olympics

512
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,248
This will be my last Olympics it's time to start life my wife is sacrifice

513
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
12 years waiting for me to come home

514
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
And

515
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
But I didn't win in Sydney

516
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
I started life I started working

517
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
I just didn't want to go out as a loser

518
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
If somebody who didn't fit medal in the Olympics

519
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
And I just couldn't accept it

520
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
So

521
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,240
I was inspired as a 2002

522
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Olympic Games

523
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
And I was really inspired by that my son

524
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
I want to do this one more time

525
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,664
So she said of course I knew this was coming and

526
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
And that was the most enjoyable

527
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,832
2 years of my life from 2002 to 2004

528
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
I was in the finals of every single time

529
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
Every time when I made the finals

530
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
All the way through

531
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
Aetna matter what time it was and I just enjoyed the life of an athlete again and you can be selfish

532
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
You can focus on you

533
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,008
Focus on yourself you can train you feel great

534
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,824
You never get that same feeling out of anything else in life

535
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Lesbian

536
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
A winner or champion

537
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
Having a crowd roaring

538
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,576
You don't get that from everything else in business and I can do something deals but

539
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
It all on you all

540
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,696
It's it's all eyes are on you right

541
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,304
It's awesome and so I enjoyed that and so ice 2004 athlete I was

542
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,888
I was physically strong I had the cardia

543
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
I had

544
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:51,008
Great cardio I knew how is efficient with my muscles I knew how to

545
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,616
Y'all spend energy I wasn't as good of a deal player in 2004 that was in

546
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
95-99 but

547
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,224
Good enough to win

548
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,808
Do you think do you think

549
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
Like you said with age

550
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,928
Athletes lose

551
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
VR the fearlessness of Youth

552
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
That is how essential is that

553
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
That's stupid

554
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
Hurt being brazen

555
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
Stupid in your singular focus on this

556
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Just drive

557
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
Absolutely

558
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
Gallant

559
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,152
It depends on how the athlete deals with the pressure

560
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
You know going into the

561
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
19

562
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Going into the 2000 Olympics

563
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
I was 99 world champion

564
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
So all eyes are on me to win the gold

565
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,792
All the newspapers all the magazines everybody was talking about America's first ever goals I had all that pressure on me

566
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,936
And it wasn't that the pressure got to me it's just that first round I had

567
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,032
The Korean guy was top five guy in the world and he was always a tough match

568
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
So I just didn't wasn't meant to be

569
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
But going into 2004

570
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,456
I was old I had experience

571
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
But I wanted it

572
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,832
I was hungry again I wasn't afraid I didn't have pressure I will put weight

573
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
To compete

574
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
2004

575
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
You know so I was older

576
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
But I have the hunger

577
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
And what happened was ironic with Kayla Harrison

578
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
You know when she was world champion 2010

579
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
She tried to repeat

580
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
In 2011

581
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
Well all you could see it in her training

582
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
You can see it in her competitions

583
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
The pressure

584
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,944
I'm trying to repeat as world champion

585
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,856
Was so great she kind of cracked under the pressure she felt it similar to what I did in NC

586
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
Didn't you feel the pressure you don't

587
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
Not sure if you're doing enough you're not sure if you're ready

588
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
And

589
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,304
Probably the best thing that ever could have happened to her

590
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,120
In 2011 was to lose and finish third

591
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Because

592
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
It shut her up

593
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,008
She wasn't the top dog going into London

594
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,384
She was one of the favorites but she wasn't ranked number one she was number four

595
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
And she's Underdog

596
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,296
And she wanted to climb back on the top of the podium again so she she had she was hungry again

597
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:17,440
Where is if she had been 2011

598
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Never would have

599
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
What's up

600
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,376
Admit this but

601
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:31,008
Have you ever been broken on the Madden competition for whatever reason you lost hope for confidence in the match

602
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
Has there ever been a guy Tough Enough

603
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,712
I've never I've never been broken in a judo match and I've never quit

604
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Ever

605
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,088
Just not my mentality I bought some guys that were tough as nails

606
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,696
You know that that I had to fight for my life against but I never back down

607
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,744
Never back down to anybody

608
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
I might have got beaten

609
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,376
But I went out fighting that I never quit never in a match

610
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,984
Can you think of anyone in particular was a toughest guy I've ever faced the competition

611
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
Are you personally

612
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,104
I mean I I had so many tough

613
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
Tough fights

614
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,992
It in Judo competition I mean I had some real matches of the Little Koala malls

615
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:18,368
German he was two time world champion Olympic champion and widowed and I

616
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
Fought hard you know

617
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
56 *

618
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
Those were Wars

619
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:30,400
That golden scar we might still be fighting today

620
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
In-N-Out does a Japanese guy

621
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,336
Nakamura yukimasa Nakamura he was never beat my career

622
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
I never be that guy

623
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
Beat me on Sammy's of the junior world to beat me in the seventies of the senior world

624
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,552
Give me the channel copy beat me in the finals of France

625
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
I remember every lost

626
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
So it was just a very skillful in ERG does a lot about matchups if you don't match up well against somebody

627
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
I had a hard time to eat

628
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
But I never back down on the Never

629
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
You know nobody ever just ran over me

630
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,824
So I remember I talked to Taraji Williams and you said you was really depressed

631
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
After his Olympic run

632
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,384
Thanks II

633
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
What is that

634
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:20,832
Life after the Olympics so will you haunted by the losses is there a depression is like you never achieved this kind of

635
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
What is that transition

636
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Do normal life until life of a coach

637
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
It's really hard

638
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
And I can tell you haven't been to for Olympics they were all very different

639
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
My first Olympics that I lost

640
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,520
I want two matches I lost my third

641
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
But the three guys that were on the podium

642
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
With three guys that I had beaten

643
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,456
And I did many times so I felt as if I should have been there

644
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,808
And sitting in the stands and my father I remember crying thinking

645
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
I give up my entire life

646
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,160
I sacrificed all those

647
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,816
Trainings in the gym in all that time overseas

648
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
That's it

649
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
It's older

650
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Make sure it matches I'm done

651
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,472
I didn't do anything in the Olympics I failed

652
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
I feel like crap

653
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
It was depressing

654
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Luckily I was young enough

655
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,176
Stupid enough that you know I wanted to try again

656
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
You know

657
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Winning in Atlanta

658
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:27,392
Was America and walking around town and have everybody

659
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,512
Treat you like it hero and welcome you into their store the restaurant of their bar or whatever it was in

660
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,120
Show your mettle and take pictures you are a rockstar in Atlanta and it was awesome

661
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
But when you come home

662
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,032
You get tugged in a million directions by a million people that want your time

663
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
So what ends up happening is

664
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
You start doing everything for everybody else

665
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
Hey can you show up to this kids thing and

666
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,064
I'm talking to school what can you come to this appearance

667
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,904
Is all about giving other people your time

668
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,232
And you don't really ultimately enjoy it anymore because

669
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:10,400
You could see how sometimes Stars just feel like they never sent her some celebrity

670
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Peace for yourself

671
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,984
Speed up doing any Purcell was always one of the people

672
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
That becomes hard

673
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
But it comes with the

674
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
I'll take the win every day of the week

675
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Over not right

676
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Then

677
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,504
Sydney was denisdaily

678
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
Losing in Sydney was the worst ever

679
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
It really was a

680
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,208
Start a retired can I retire.

681
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,608
Replace the Olympic Games for me was a total failure considering I was supposed to win the Olympics so

682
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,960
That was a hard one to swallow and that's why I couldn't ever swallow it forever

683
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
I needed to fight again

684
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,152
But yeah I could see how somebody like a Taraji who didn't medal in the Olympics super suit

685
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
Do you know as long as you did and made to Olympic team

686
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
As great as everybody else sees that feet

687
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,600
Is it a state when you have your sights set on

688
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
Achieving excellence in you don't

689
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
You definitely feel unfulfilled

690
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
And you can see that like I said in sport

691
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,864
You really don't get that same sense of elation

692
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Anything else in life

693
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
I ran a marathon

694
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
And I ran the Boston Marathon one time

695
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,848
When I got done people

696
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,896
Awesome I said no I couldn't wait to go home

697
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,456
I would not hurt you. I just want to lay down and eat

698
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,624
But wasn't the greatest feeling now why would I do it again

699
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,696
You know the most people for them in such a massive

700
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,024
Coppersmith for me it was just okay did it I'm done move on

701
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:45,376
Childbirth I hear people say childbirth is awesome and it's

702
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
It is it's different

703
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
The sense of it but it's a different feeling then

704
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
What you get from from

705
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,848
Winning in the only thing that has ever come close

706
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Me

707
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
Doing it was

708
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Michaela 1

709
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Being apart of something

710
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,808
And I believe that was destiny that she came here

711
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
For specific purpose

712
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,464
Some reason why I didn't win in Sydney

713
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
Because that girl was supposed to win in London

714
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,840
And we were supposed to help around that Journey my father and myself

715
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
That we were supposed to be a part of that

716
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,264
And that was the Magic Moment amazing Channel

717
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,360
Tune to me I cannot believe in that Destiny and I believe in

718
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Carmine good things so

719
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,224
Repeat in 2016

720
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:37,088
It's setting up nicely

721
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
In the United States

722
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,768
A country where Judo I struggle to gain ground over the years or wrestling jiu-jitsu

723
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,328
Compared to other nations in the world

724
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
You have produced

725
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,728
Almost all it's not all of the US medalist at World Olympics in the last

726
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Two decades

727
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
What would what is the secret

728
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
What

729
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,712
What is the system B follows licey if if I

730
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
How do you take a six-year-old

731
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
6 year old 6 year old with an interest and you don't give them a shout at the Olympics medal stand at by the time

732
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
R22

733
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,512
What is the process you follow to make out something champion

734
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,840
Well first and foremost there is a system

735
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
And that's that that's the thing that most

736
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
Most other places in America don't have

737
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,520
And that's really the problem with the entire

738
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,360
USA judo is that we don't have a system

739
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920
To produce high-level asset

740
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
We've done it here in Boston

741
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
And

742
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,808
I was part of this Elite

743
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,416
Under-23 program where we took the 20 most talented kids in the country

744
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
Informed of that

745
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Crop came

746
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Marti Malloy

747
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Travis Stevens

748
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,352
Kayla Harrison Nick Del popolo

749
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,656
They were part of that U23 program

750
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
That I was a part of for 6 years

751
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
So that was

752
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Also my system

753
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
And really it's it's

754
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,408
Obviously to be great you got to be you got to be willing to work

755
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
Right you have to be willing to

756
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
Hours and you got to be willing to take the punishment

757
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
Show it's a mentality

758
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
Number one and two championship

759
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Mindset

760
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
You have to have second

761
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
You got to know how to train

762
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,304
We believe in a system of conditioning

763
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
We believe in

764
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
Grip fighting

765
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
We believe in the water

766
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
When it was big into strategy

767
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
So

768
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
We know that we cannot

769
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,872
Beat the Russians we cannot beat the French we cannot beat the Brazilian Pizza

770
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Japanese

771
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
By doing more Judo than they do

772
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
Because you're awesome

773
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,040
We can beat them with Judo cuz they have

774
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
We want people to train with

775
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
Way more opportunities

776
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,816
Physicality technical strategy gripping conditioning toughness

777
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
In the mindset

778
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,680
It will going to win in this is how we're going to win and you got to get

779
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,752
You're still at the believe in that system that okay

780
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,800
We're doing all in

781
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
We trained very intense

782
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
When I go to Russia

783
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
Is Japan

784
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
Russia's a lot of drilling

785
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,088
Buttock technique a lot of lot of free motion in free feeling

786
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
Not a lot of randori

787
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
When you go to Japan sea opposite

788
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
It's all random

789
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,144
15 rounds of randori a day in Japan it's insane in Russia

790
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,936
They like if they do 15 a month

791
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
Chuck is very technical

792
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:39,104
But you differences. We do really intense focus training here

793
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,248
And we were smart with the periodization of our athletes that so you

794
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
Tok ideas

795
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Peking

796
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Tick performance

797
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,368
So what is

798
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,512
Is it essential to psycho like it is why can't you be your hundred percent year-round

799
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,120
Because is it a mental lapse

800
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
And mentally you can't be

801
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
You need to have times of relaxation and you have time to focus focus training and actually is it

802
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,408
You just recently got my 16 year old boy who's trying to be the best in wrestling

803
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
You can't go 365 days a year

804
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,296
Banging your head against the wall

805
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Not enjoying life

806
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Because

807
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
In the end you'll be like this

808
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
You'll you'll be great

809
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
And you'll be here

810
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
Never have that

811
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Performance of a lifetime

812
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,656
Do you need

813
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,752
Your body needs time to heal your muscles need time to heal and rest

814
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
Your mind needs time to heal and rest

815
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
In order to have

816
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,640
Otherwise it gets used to being an

817
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,200
Get used to being right here all the time in the zone

818
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
We want to have a Zone where

819
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
It's above that

820
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,088
That's was Olympic champion that's what world champion is

821
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
You know what nerd

822
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
You got to let your body come down

823
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,744
So that I can build from somewhere

824
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
Igc

825
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,680
Pretty good at that and they take it to an extreme where they get so fat and so out of shape they

826
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,752
Lennox air training camp for 12 weeks is 16 weeks

827
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,616
But that's the idea is that I'm not training now I'm relaxing but having fun so that

828
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,200
I can focus when it's time to focus and get real serious about this

829
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,992
I can push my body to limits

830
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
And that's what we believe

831
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
You mentioned

832
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:31,488
Your father is a big part of the club what role does he play

833
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
At as part of the system

834
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
Is a huge part of the system

835
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,424
You ask any of the athletes he gives his time

836
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Alabama

837
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
I work full time I have four children

838
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
So you don't never going to make me Rich

839
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
Crack jokes

840
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
My Life as a joke that has helped me

841
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Become

842
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
Pretty wealthy because of

843
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
Being involved in martial arts

844
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,904
I mean I just started a brand new

845
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,792
Just started that have been involved in in selling Fuji and how to shoot a sports goods for the last year or so

846
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,888
So I've been able to make my life through martial arts in Judo

847
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
But the sport of Judo is not what

848
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Put food on my kids table

849
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,384
In order for it to become great they need to train more than once a day

850
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,456
So my dad is down here with the every single morning

851
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
He runs a morning technical training session

852
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Try guys

853
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,904
Describe at least broad Strokes what

854
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
A weekly program looks like for an elite-level judoka

855
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,816
So our athletes train

856
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Monday

857
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,424
Monday morning they train here

858
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,752
It's about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes of Technical Training

859
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,592
Winning by Technical Training

860
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,199
I sometimes depends on how many bodies we have in depends on who's in town

861
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
For the most part it's mostly drills

862
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
Gripping drills nawaza drills

863
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,671
Throwing throwing drills Tremont 3 man what you call me

864
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
Speed drills

865
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:10,047
Sprint's in the morning at the end of practice and conditioning

866
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,375
But they're good training for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes every more

867
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
When they leave here

868
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,495
They then go to a professional strength coach

869
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,895
Some of them go to Mike Boyle's strength and conditioning Woburn some of them go to the place I went in with pulse

870
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Sissy

871
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,967
Wonder Woman strength training in North Andover

872
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,295
After they work out here they have a break

873
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,111
Been mid-afternoon they were there to strength training

874
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Play

875
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,695
Judo specific strength training it's not

876
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Powerlifting it's

877
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,351
Some type of circuit training depends on

878
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,679
What phase of training ran what type of lifting or doing it

879
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:53,311
So the pain but they are they're doing something focused for again between an hour an hour and a half

Training almost everyday

890
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511

Tuesday

892
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Wednesday

893
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Thursday they have the morning off

894
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
So they just do

895
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Weight training in in Judo

896
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
And then Friday morning only

897
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
They train

898
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
So

899
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,591
Shadilay depends on

900
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,431
The weightlifting scheduler run sometime like a Friday only have one training

901
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,991
Consolidating only have one training away train

902
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
But to get Saturday night off and Sunday

903
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,903
Less were fighting a tournament to go to the sermon of the week

904
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,327
What has been the biggest challenge for you in preparing for the 2016 Olympics in Rio

905
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
China team

906
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,703
For me it's bit for me personally it's been balancing family

907
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
With team

908
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
My wife's been at this for a long time right she's been open since 1992 she's been living with me going to the Olympics opening

909
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:09,343
After the 2012 Olympics that really took a hard toll on my family cuz I tried to travel so much

910
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Watching

911
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
So

912
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,927
I took a break

913
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:19,327
When I've been home a lot and I've been focusing on the family have a daughter that 6 I have three teenagers that give Mom

914
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
Pallet home when I'm away

915
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,399
I'm so

916
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
I've been really focusing on family

917
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:30,847
So that's why it's been hard for me to balance because I loved you I loved the sport I love helping me outfits I love being in the game

918
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
And I genuinely feel that

919
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
Beyonce's benefit with

920
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Having me

921
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Honor

922
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
Charron

923
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,391
With them and it inspires down and give him a lot of confidence

924
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,207
But that's been the challenge for me is is

925
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Bouncing balls

926
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:52,607
Now is the Olympics is ramping up again here and we're just about to turn 2015

927
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,423
Jamberry lot more travelling to come in with the team in

928
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
But my dad's picked up

929
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,751
My put my dad in that role

930
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,871
You know because the best to athletes in our country are Kayla Harrison and Travis Stevens oh

931
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,199
They're from our our territory they're from our home Club so

932
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,759
My dad is a coach and I'm their coach show

933
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,575
They can't have me to have the next best thing and that's not my dad

934
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
You know

935
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,439
What is the most painful moment

936
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Remember

937
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,511
Maybe one that stands out as a coach

938
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
Watching Travis Stevens lose at the semi-final match at the Olympic Games unquestionably is a coach with most painful

939
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
Woman I've ever been involved in

940
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
Because I see all the boy works

941
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,127
See how much you want City sandwiches sacrifices he doesn't

942
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,711
He's a kid easy doesn't drink alcohol he doesn't

943
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
He's straight as an arrow

944
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,599
You know any like gave you that schedule of three times a day training

945
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,927
But he's out there right now doing to get you

946
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
So he trains for five times a day

947
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
IKEA mattress

948
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
You know he wants it

949
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
When he's hurt

950
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,143
Pushes through New Zealand part of it

951
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
I felt really bad for him because you don't really get those moments back in life we are in the semi-finals of the Olympic Games

952
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
Acumen never get that moment

953
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Hope he does

954
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
But

955
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
That was

956
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,247
Flip of a coin who wins the fight

957
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,319
He was silver medalist or gold medals in Olympics

958
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Yeah

959
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,927
That was really painful and I watched him cry on the sidelines

960
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
For an hour after that

961
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
And then he had to stop for bronze and

962
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,351
Normally nine times out of ten he'll beat that Canadian

963
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,215
Don't you beat the boy before the Olympics many many times it's just

964
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
He had physically drained his body of all the emotion

965
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
LeBrons

966
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,687
So your coach now but you're also and forever judoka

967
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,063
House of Jimmy Page worth today different from a guy who won bronze in 2004

968
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
In terms of

969
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
How's your Judo develop

970
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,743
How do you say technically how you think about Judo how you approached Dido

971
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
IGG.

972
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,143
Well I tried and I tried to

973
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:09,055
I take a lot of what I learned in my career and I pass it on to my students

974
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,103
Nobody ever

975
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,663
I really had nobody that gave that to me

976
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,991
What is a mental disease mental side of this game

977
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,295
That I learned and I trained my mind

978
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,367
I visualize success myself

979
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
I had some good self

980
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
Talk that I did with myself all the time

981
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
Pass that on to my students

982
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,375
How to use their mind to achieve success Odyssey

983
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
How to believe it

984
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
Even before they do it

985
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
They have to believe it

986
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
And they have to see it

987
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:44,127
And I'm a firm believer that if you treat that pathway in your mind enough time

988
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,455
What happens is when the moment comes for it to happen

989
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Your body

990
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,295
Think she's been there before and that's where it's supposed to go

991
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
So it'll go

992
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,367
In most people

993
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:59,231
They never see it happen and I hope I want to be an Olympic champion someday

994
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,023
But they never really

995
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
See it

996
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
Believe it experience it

997
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,423
Before it happens and therefore it

998
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
It never will

999
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
Because they don't think it's possible

1000
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,335
I never talked about it that is something you taught her and then she just felt like

1001
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
The Olympics you felt like

1002
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,199
It's almost like you're in autopilot

1003
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,015
It's an obvious fact as you getting the gold

1004
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
She's almost walking through the

1005
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,415
Right does the steps that she's visualize a million times I was able to pass that on

1006
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,719
And they say sports is

1007
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
Like

1008
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:36,351
Ninety percent mental right I mean because if it was just training everybody Train everybody would train

1009
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,399
365 days a year

1010
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:43,263
Write 24 hours a day 7 days a week I'm that's it it's just whoever changed the most but it's not

1011
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
We all do the physical

1012
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,967
Focus on that side of the game as well as the strategy and

1013
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,295
Looking at videos and studying how to be disappointed

1014
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:01,695
In what are objectives are in this match and I think that also rather than just walk out blindly and just fight

1015
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
Strategy going in

1016
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,607
I think taking that professional approach to the game

1017
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
You know and with our system

1018
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
You look at the number of people we have in this dojo

1019
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
In terms of elite athletes

1020
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,127
The number of bodies we have to train with this go every doing something right

1021
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,503
Right because Japan and Russia and France and everywhere else

1022
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,063
With what we have and we don't have very much money either

1023
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,391
So we're Up Against All Odds yet we're still getting it done

1024
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,767
I'd say hi. How is it different I think I'm a little bit more syrebral

1025
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:41,631
As a coach then I wasn't it as an athlete because I had to learn a lot of it on my own

1026
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
One of the player

1027
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
Last topic

1028
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,079
But in the last half-decade

1029
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,175
Ijf the international Judo Federation

1030
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
Has made a lot of rule changes

1031
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,295
Starting from

1032
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Like crabs

1033
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:04,927
Can you summarize the rules the rule changes and

1034
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,535
Say whether you think they have had an overall positive or negative effect on Judah

1035
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,095
The IGA have goal

1036
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,655
Ways to differentiate

1037
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
Judo from

1038
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Wrestling

1039
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,519
I really wanted to differentiate the two

1040
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Sports Chalet

1041
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
In case the Olympic Committee

1042
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:28,735
We need to get rid of another sport which sport are we getting rid of

1043
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Just get rid of one

1044
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
So they really want to differentiate

1045
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,903
Itself

1046
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,719
Show that was one reason

1047
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,047
Second is they tried to make it a little bit more

1048
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Fan friendly

1049
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:50,495
Wright's old men how much time has been gripping you know in ripping and gripping so they've taken a lot of the gripping rules

1050
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,823
Who's out of the game and you not allowed to break rib so many times anymore

1051
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
They thought that was a boring elements of Judo

1052
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:00,735
But the reality of the situation is that Judith never going to be

1053
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,527
Fast and friendly live sport

1054
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
Interested

1055
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
It's never going to be

1056
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,183
And if you're not a judoka and you don't have an interest in

1057
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,487
Fighting is boring

1058
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
You'll can be very sore and spectacular

1059
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
If you create a story behind it

1060
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
And you do a one hour show

1061
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,983
We only showing highlights of

1062
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,359
Behind the scenes and who is this athlete and get to know him and get the

1063
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:31,199
Then show his series of fights and show his throws a submissions and

1064
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,759
Income up to watch the final and then

1065
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:39,903
When the final happened just show the best clips of the final and have some commentary going about what's going on

1066
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,279
Then it can be a good sport never be a good live sport because it's very boring and it

1067
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,303
Always will be

1068
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,839
No matter what rules you put in

1069
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
I love I love wrestling

1070
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,191
But wrestling if you don't know who

1071
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,471
Is wrestling

1072
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
Belaboring

1073
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,383
Same with American football know if you truly

1074
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,991
All the Europeans age football so boring you start your stop you start your stop and get it

1075
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:09,599
Aunt because they don't have an interest in any of any team that they don't care who wins

1076
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,927
They're not from New England rooting for the Patriots you know

1077
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
Set when we watch soccer As Americans

1078
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Abhorrent

1079
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:22,911
We're not rooting for any team that's really the story that people fall in love

1080
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:28,287
Like yeah they do the game

1081
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,871
The fan was at who has never done Judo

1082
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,687
Is ever going to enjoy watching Judo and less

1083
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,783
It's a highlight reel in real life

1084
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
Cool stuff going on

1085
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,671
So I think all the rule changes for for not I don't think they're affecting

1086
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,487
They're not going to check the popularity of the sport

1087
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,535
Unquestionably the knock-on effect

1088
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
I go to

1089
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
All of these big Grand Slam tournaments

1090
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,167
In Abu Dhabi and there's nobody in the stands

1091
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,495
You know you go to all these tournaments and there's nobody watching

1092
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,311
Everybody's watching online but nobody's watching

1093
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
So

1094
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
I think the rule changes

1095
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,967
To be honest with you I think it's gotten more towards sport

1096
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,831
Rushed towards if you think about what Judah was founded on it was founded on

1097
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,671
On sport the Olympic sport was founded on self defence

1098
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:21,023
Write as an element as an element of the sport Judo has no self-defense element

1099
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
Whatsoever anymore it's all about sports

1100
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,143
No dojos really teach

1101
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,447
Self defense element of Judo

1102
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
In what Allegra

1103
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,847
It's really like grabbing self-defense and some guy attacked me with his legs

1104
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,711
Right so they're taking that out of it and even as a judo player who's in the sport

1105
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,271
Some guy who's very 6 ft 1

1106
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
M545

1107
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,135
He's got really long legs so if he comes in high should be able to grab it

1108
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,207
So you're taking that part of the sports I disagree with that

1109
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:57,119
I mendakota you know that they're the prearranged movement Nobody Does that anymore really

1110
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,911
You know I was lost a lot of its

1111
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,727
I'm down to just being an Olympic sport

1112
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
These days

1113
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,287
Which is impractical

1114
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
For the masses

1115
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
Because

1116
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,687
The masses are never going to compete in the sport is too dangerous

1117
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Do physics

1118
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:19,391
So if you like Jiu-Jitsu succeeded because it's taking it to a safe place it's taking it to the ground

1119
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,231
Nobody's tumbling and falling and doing 360s in

1120
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
They're rolling

1121
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,327
They're getting a good workout during some self-defense

1122
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,007
But that's okay that's what if you want to make the sport popular

1123
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,567
Everybody has to be able to do it

1124
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,103
In right now

1125
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,663
Judah has become a sport that only the young can do

1126
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,479
That's why I think it's failing

1127
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,807
The question is Judo Olympics in 60

1128
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
496

1129
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
Before that's exactly

1130
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,391
50 years ago

1131
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
So

1132
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Martial arts

1133
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,279
In general has gone a long way in life

1134
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,327
50 years

1135
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
And even night

1136
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,703
I think very importantly thanks to mix martial arts where they kind of

1137
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,567
I'll put like Sumo in karate and all these things together and you realize that

1138
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,639
The grappling Arts have a lot to contribute to

1139
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
This is a really effective are

1140
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
Exciting art

1141
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,063
So where do you think Juno will be this is a weird question

1142
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,343
50 years from now

1143
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,159
So do you think there's something

1144
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
Timeless

1145
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,791
In the sport of Judo

1146
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,911
Jill is trying to become more professional

1147
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,007
Right but it's also becoming a very expensive sport

1148
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,079
So then what I see happening over the course of time

1149
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,895
Is all of the big programs

1150
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:49,759
I'm going to continue to be big in the sport of Judo because there in the world

1151
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
It's only a big program

1152
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
So what's going to happen right now

1153
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,159
They have a Cadet Circle

1154
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,463
Show kids 14 to 18 years old

1155
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,583
They can get on a world ranking list and there's a Cadet other Cadets

1156
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,119
Then there's a junior circuit

1157
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,447
You know that's up to 21 years old and all these juniors

1158
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,007
Have world rankings

1159
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,823
Competitions all over the world to develop

1160
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
And then there's a senior circuit

1161
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,895
The problem is

1162
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:23,039
The big countries like a like a Japan and a Brazil and France and Russia

1163
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,343
In all lot of European countries

1164
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,927
They have the budgets and they're investing in their youth

1165
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,463
Ultimately Road

1166
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,511
Run from Cadet to Junior to

1167
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Tasheen

1168
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:39,679
So they're going to continue to flourish as countries and get stronger and invest more money in

1169
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Grow

1170
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,519
All of the other countries including America

1171
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,567
Who don't have money

1172
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,919
Why don't we invest any money right now at all

1173
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,479
Not even I figured our Cadets are cadets

1174
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,015
We the parents

1175
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,343
Have to pay us Judo just to have their kid dude you know but

1176
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,903
We don't give us nothing and I Junior

1177
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,439
Cuz we don't have the budget for it

1178
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:06,303
So all we focus on it the elite side and it's becoming more and more expensive

1179
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
2

1180
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,167
Fun visa to qualify for the Olympics

1181
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:14,751
Soon as you shut off that opportunity for us to qualify for the Olympics

1182
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,799
Gerald's gone in America

1183
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
It'll be non-existent

1184
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Okay so

1185
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,711
That's the direction we're headed we have less Elite athletes today in America

1186
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
Then we did

1187
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
4 years ago

1188
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,087
Then we did eight years ago then we did back in the 70

1189
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,647
Is less elite players today than there was that

1190
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,487
The more expensive it becomes

1191
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,303
I don't even see countries countries like

1192
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Peru

1193
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
And

1194
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:46,751
A lot of the South American countries Argentina

1195
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
Good full teams of athletes

1196
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:53,151
Nowadays the number of athletes that are competing at the world

1197
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,479
The less and less and less and less there less money

1198
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,783
If no budgets they're going to disappear

1199
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,087
So what you do is going to be, is going to become

1200
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,903
A much smaller sport

1201
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,975
In terms of number of countries that participate

1202
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:11,327
Cuz there's no going to be any programs in any of those other countries that can compete with the rest of the world

1203
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
That in show 50 years from now

1204
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,935
I don't think you'll see

1205
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,727
How to get the anybody

1206
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:26,943
Ibiza Club from Boston

1207
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:33,087
The preservery

1208
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,023
You'll be lucky to see two two Americans on that caught on fire

1209
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
2

1210
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
We get one

1211
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
Guaranteed

1212
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
Cuz the idea from give you one

1213
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,471
So but you'll be like in ac2 in in in in Tokyo

1214
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
The direction we're headed

1215
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,895
The old is Marty going to lose Kayla going to lose Nick

1216
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,711
Best athletes right now

1217
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,271
And I really don't have on a pipeline coming out

1218
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,903
I hope that doesn't come too

1219
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,927
Reality book

1220
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975

Equity sports.com

00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:50,399
Girls Fuji like I'm moving to California now

00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
Closet full of

1231
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:56,799
Figure out what to do with them but

1232
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
Before we end

1233
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,895
I'd like to comment like that

1234
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
I've done

1235
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,735
Considerable amount of interview interviews in my day

1236
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,015
And Through the Years

1237
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,599
I will say that this is the most well thought-out

1238
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,159
Comprehensive intelligence

1239
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:16,255
Thought-provoking questions that I've ever been asked in my career

1240
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,791
Thanks I appreciate that

1241
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:24,703
Since you said that I will not hold you, in the beginning about you choosing the Russian against you

1242
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,031
Awesome thank you very much for the warm welcome has been fun
