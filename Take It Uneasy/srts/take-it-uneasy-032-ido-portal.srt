1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:13,312
Buckle Conway AR

3
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,504
Is any particular sport

4
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
Define rules

5
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
Mastery

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,600
Chief of specialization

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
Taking a few skills and perfecting

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
So naturally most experts and teachers of movement

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
Eye specialist

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
A skill sets like gymnastics

11
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
Hand balancing

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Olympic lifting

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,984
Capoeira Jiu-Jitsu Wrestling Judo and other martial arts

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
So, cross a general

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,360
Someone who takes a holistic approach

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
I guess today is Ido portal

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
He is a guru of movement

18
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
A teacher

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,088
With a large and quickly growing following

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
As he says

21
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Luminous bag

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,952
Bigger than a specific discipline

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
We're all human first

24
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536
Louis 2nd

25
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Special

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,704
I actually just finished reading a biography of Albert Einstein

27
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
By Walter Isaacson

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
And the two of you have something in common

29
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
I desire to arrive at the unified theory

30
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
His case was unified theory of physics

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Forces of nature

32
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
In your case it's the unified theory of movement

33
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Can you

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
Tell me the story of the journey

35
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
To become a generalist

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
First of just say that

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
It says something that the

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,168
People use but I have a really hard time with the word master or Guru

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
And then

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,080
I didn't arrive at the gospel truth I am not sitting on any mountains and

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
I'm on my way

42
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
So

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
People who join your students are

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
I basically

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
Following you know in the same Journey

46
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
Maybe being in certain certain circumstances I'm a bit further ahead or sometimes I'm a bit behind

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,560
But it's definitely walk along and not walk behind kind of scene

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Yeah my journey

49
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
I started as in

50
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
First and then I became specialist and then I

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,800
Detect movement basically

52
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
Silhouette

53
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,688
Fall started in young age and some some Chinese martial arts

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
Developed

55
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
I'm into some physical Sports and

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
Games

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,160
In school Primary School in high school

58
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
And then I met a couple

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,536
I was completely amazed basically baidu

60
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
This is art form

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,912
Pursuit that for a good fifteen years

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,032
In the middle somewhere military service and other physical layer

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Physical Pursuit

64
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,968
And changing and developing and moving between disciplines and exploring

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
I just kind of

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
Got the same relation again and again

67
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
There is some

68
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
Threads to oldest discipline something that is

69
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Attracting me back and basically was movement to I realized

70
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
And the next thing was

71
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
I want to learn movement I want to get better

72
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
Is a mover in a general way

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
Seeked out a movement teachers

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
Went around the world and looked around

75
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,992
Are some people who mentioned

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
Offered myself as a student in

77
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
They kept on ditching me

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Disciplines

79
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
Another isolated approach

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Another speciality

81
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
And I was very disappointed.

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Eventually I decided okay I'm going to become

83
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
That person

84
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
I'm going to become the movement teacher

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
And then

86
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:59,360
The next realisation after years and years of trying was it impossible

87
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,272
And with that I stayed basically because I realized if that's impossible it's a good goal to have in life

88
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
Something that will keep on

89
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,928
Moving myself and my students and anybody involved forward

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
That's where I'm at

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Right now I'm in

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Teaching and

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Learning

94
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
Moving around and trying to

95
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
Trying to gain some more knowledge about this impossible task

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
Yes so you still yourself are forever a student

97
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,615
How to fry prefer to be a student any day of the week than a teacher

98
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Being a teacher is

99
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
Parts of human culture

100
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
We are all teachers

101
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,903
We will teach all the time whether you want it or not somebody asks you

102
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,463
Four Direction in the street you become the teacher

103
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
You as a child

104
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
She looks so cute you're a teacher

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
Practicing

106
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
Teaching and practicing too

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
The student the discipleship

108
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,031
Both of them are extremely important for your development as a moving

109
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
What is the price

110
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
The specialization specialized

111
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
We lose Humanity first and foremost

112
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
As humans we we evolved

113
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
To become humans

114
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Is generalist we are the most

115
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
General list of all animals

116
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,023
We're able to imitate the 8nn in Tiger rents

117
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,607
And we can hold their breath underwater and we can do

118
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Everything

119
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Just

120
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
A tiny bit

121
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,031
We can't really run very fast we can't really fight very well

122
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
No we can't you know climb

123
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
Is as good as other animals

124
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,247
But we can do the most complex and generalized tasks

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Out of all animals

126
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
And no one will even come close so speciality the price is Humanity the price is your happiness

127
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Is the price is your

128
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
Fulfillment as a human being

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,351
It's the pits its philosophical but that's that's who we are

130
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Do you think there is some beauty and fulfillment

131
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
And some value in specialization in becoming

132
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,335
The best of the very specific movement at a particular sport

133
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
Giving your body to dedicating to that

134
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Sport

135
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
That's an interesting thing because

136
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
S a human race

137
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,367
We benefited tremendously from the work of specialist

138
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Photo specialist

139
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Suffer

140
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
That's a very very important points

141
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
Without specialist we would never be here we would never be Skyping right now on this computer is an end

142
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
Wearing these t-shirts

143
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
All kinds of stuff

144
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
The butt

145
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Those

146
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Especially those human beings

147
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
Suffered

148
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
The result of their

149
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Highly specialized nature

150
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
And we become more and more specialized

151
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
The reason move towards

152
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:54,719
Being generalist again in the last few years maybe the last decade there is a bit more talk about that

153
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
But definitely

154
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,631
We are also still pursuing highly specialized

155
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Fields

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,727
If I make a joke in my My Worship and I saved

157
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Nowadays you go to it

158
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,151
If you even break your heart you know your break your hand you go to a hand specialist orthopedic surgeon

159
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
5 or 10 years you'll go to

160
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
And left hand

161
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Specialist

162
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,391
And most evident problem is also our leaders were especially

163
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
The required to be generalist leaders

164
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
A lot of stuff

165
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
And there she leaders

166
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,911
We we keep on having the same problems again and again

167
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Because they are

168
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,055
X specialist whether it's a lawyer or a military person

169
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Economist

170
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
These are not

171
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
Specialities that allow you the full grasp of

172
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Running a country

173
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,367
Yeah I think I think you put a beautifully that you might specialization that lead to innovation

174
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
But you lose their Humanity

175
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
What

176
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Do you find

177
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Is

178
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
The most underdeveloped

179
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Range of motion in athletes

180
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
At what movement

181
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Is most restricted

182
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
And high level athletes

183
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
In your experience

184
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Who's everyone

185
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Standoff

186
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Shoulders

187
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
Particular other joints

188
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,479
Well it's all depends on their speciality of course in habits

189
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
The shoulder

190
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,367
The glenohumeral Joint is the most hypermobile joint in the body

191
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
Even when it's restricted

192
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
It still offers

193
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
Tremendous range of motion compared to other areas

194
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
But

195
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
What eats restricted

196
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Even if it's just a little bit

197
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,727
It can cause huge problems because we are dependent on that

198
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Range of motion and Mobility

199
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Around the glenohumeral joint

200
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
And the simple reason is because with the hands humans manipulate

201
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,295
That's what were meant to do with our hands and we need that

202
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
Complexity around the scapula

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
It's been a few years since I've said it first

204
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
That the scapula craves complexity

205
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,607
But this is complexity around the scapula and range of motion so important

206
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
Across-the-board

207
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Ivory

208
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Your concept of

209
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
If isolate

210
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
In a gradient

211
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Improvise

212
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
Can you describe the role of improvisation

213
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
In movement

214
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
Any profession any speciality

215
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
Should arrive at improvisation

216
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
Tirta top-level

217
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
And whether you play the violin words

218
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
You know you box

219
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
You're going to reach improvisation

220
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
Improvisation above all

221
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
The Human Condition

222
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
It's the human

223
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
The human ability the highest form of living

224
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,543
Is improvisational improvised basically life is improvisation you're born

225
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,383
You died in between doing provides a shitload of improvisation

226
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Movement is no difference

227
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,039
The thing is people started to isolate concept and

228
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,367
Some people went the next level and integrated them

229
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
They present themselves as improvisation but actually

230
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
The cheating people

231
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
It's just

232
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
A bit more integration yet

233
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
It's just another integration

234
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,007
Improvisation open improvisation reading provation as we call it

235
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
That's very rare

236
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
And that's the most

237
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Enjoyable state

238
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,711
It's cold so cold dazone it's also called the tunnel

239
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
You just experienced

240
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
Is beautiful thing to be empty

241
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,135
Just to let things happen through you as Bruce Lee said

242
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
I don't eat

243
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
It just happened so you know and zachys

244
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
You need to do

245
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
Who is movement if you Aspire for the highest things

246
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
I like how I

247
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
A guy on Reddit

248
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Described you as Ido portal

249
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
But not be the nicest guy in the world

250
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
But he's a great coach

251
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
So that nice guy part

252
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
I come from the wrestling world

253
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Work

254
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
The goal of a good coach

255
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
And a good program is to basically make you quit to break you

256
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
There's zero patience for people who don't want to

257
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Put in the work

258
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
To work hard

259
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
Do you find that tough love is the best approach

260
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Coaching people

261
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
Whatever their level of ability

262
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,727
No not necessary I don't I don't like the term tough love

263
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Because it kind of

264
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,359
Assumes that it's importance is

265
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Excel

266
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
It's not enough for me it's like

267
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
That's how that's the best way why that's the best way

268
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
But on the other hand

269
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
I don't see

270
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
People are made of sugar

271
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
And I really believe it

272
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
We've lost a bit side of you know

273
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Resilient we are

274
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
And another isn't

275
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
People

276
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Don't like the truth

277
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
You know it's just dishonesty is

278
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,895
When people describe me to stop lab it's not because I believe in tough

279
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,711
100% of the people will be in

280
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
With head issues with me on a

281
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
Personal level or through coaching

282
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
People

283
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Couldn't accept

284
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Criticism what I offered

285
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,303
You know how to get personally weren't able to deal with it

286
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Etc

287
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
I can't even

288
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
You know in my head find one example

289
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
The person I've been working with

290
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Who received

291
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
The criticism worked with it

292
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Insteel complaint

293
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
But it's always this complainers and who fucking cares

294
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Complain first and do nothing

295
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
Yeah you know it's like

296
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
When you go mainstream as

297
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
We've went with certain level

298
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
You have to deal with it because

299
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
I'm not operating

300
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,511
My Elite you need my special ops unit anymore

301
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Now it's an army

302
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
And I need to accept the fact that I'm going to meet

303
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
A lot of slackers a lot of

304
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,239
Foxing Poindexter is in all kinds of

305
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
They don't want to work they want to talk about it they want to do this they want to do that they don't want to hear the true state of one

306
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
Accept criticism or hear how much they suck

307
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,575
And I just don't do that so you don't have to accept the fact that

308
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
I'll have DC Shoe in

309
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
I'm sure it will continue

310
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
You traveling

311
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
All over the world you think there's a difference in this aspect

312
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,935
In attitudes in the United States and Israel and other countries

313
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,335
The other many countries where I I don't have this issue or very rarely

314
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,455
We have a working in Hebrews actually is comes from German I think.

315
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
It says topless

316
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
It's like down to it

317
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
You know the heart of it

318
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,671
Apocalypse people are people who are like no bullshit you know directly

319
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Tell me is it

320
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Vista Palace

321
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
It exists in certain cultures

322
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,143
In other cultures eats a lot of chitchat and walk around it

323
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
You know I didn't know how to cheat chat

324
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,079
Few days ago one of my student told me you know I can teach at it's exactly how I felt you know

325
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
When I first

326
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
Came out of Israel started to teach around

327
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
It was Russia saying God

328
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
That was so similar to

329
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
I'm where I come from him anyway so

330
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,415
No problem but then when I went to the US or Canada

331
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
I had a lot of issues

332
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
With the chit chat with

333
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,143
Politically correct and walking around the bush and don't give it to me too harshly you know

334
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
Coverage with a lot of

335
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
Sponges around it's often the Heat

336
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,103
And the difference between various countries and

337
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
I need nowadays I need filters

338
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Which are

339
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,783
Might might might have stood my top students were helping me teach

340
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,623
Some of them are great filter housing in certain countries

341
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
The W much better than me

342
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
What is perfect practice

343
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
This look like for you so do you believe in the value

344
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
Maybe this applies more to specialized Sports

345
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
But

346
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
Like I Come From Russia actually

347
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
And from the wrestling world where repetition

348
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
50000

349
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
100000 repetitions on a specific movement

350
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Is

351
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Is how you achieve success

352
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,759
Do you believe in the value of that repetition even for a generalist

353
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Framework

354
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,831
Repetition is the mother of skill

355
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
Tipping those that corrected in set

356
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
Perfect repetition is the mother of skill

357
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Those who usually say it

358
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Are those who don't achieve Heights

359
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Usually

360
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Usually

361
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
So

362
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
I'll be very Frank again I'll be very extremely honest

363
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
A lot of people talk about

364
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
Perfect perfect perfect

365
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
But that life is not

366
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Our surroundings are not

367
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
And when I press this and when I move

368
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
It's never on the perfect

369
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Conditions

370
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,951
It's never with the ride optimal

371
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
Blood sugar level in

372
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Under the specific could you know

373
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
I don't know what

374
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
And in riding the wave of supercompensation in the perfect way and usually when people try to

375
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,591
To adhere to set Concept in imperfect

376
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
They end.

377
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Falling off the wagon

378
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
The other side

379
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Don't be a

380
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Don't be stupid

381
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
Don't judge yourself

382
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
It's not black and white

383
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
The truth is somewhere in between

384
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Annie's varies between people

385
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
For me after

386
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
17 years teaching

387
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
18 years now teaching moving

388
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Seeing people

389
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
The hardest workers

390
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Usually

391
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Elite performers

392
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
Of course some of them are

393
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
Sharing a certain Talent or this or that but it's always

394
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
Who is very dedicated practice

395
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
They have built up that work capacity through that dedicated practice

396
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
And they cannot move that ability to other

397
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
True

398
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
Not sure how much you are aware of it but

399
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Marcelo Garcia is one of the greats

400
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
He believes

401
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Boldly

402
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Against

403
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
The status quo I think that you should only train

404
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
Jiu-Jitsu a sport

405
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Jiu jitsu

406
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Search of success

407
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Channel is at

408
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
But the majority of other athletes

409
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,343
Dennisport believe that you should do strength and conditioning programs

410
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Sedates

411
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
At least move slightly towards the more generous family

412
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
What do you think

413
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,327
You think that's value for the generalist mindset for like I know your athlete's

414
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Or should they just focus

415
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Omnisport

416
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
To some level

417
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
To some level

418
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,311
Speciality can can reach a plateau because of lack of General

419
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Base of the pyramid in some cases

420
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
But it's not a very high level of

421
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
Penal gennett generalism

422
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
Nowadays you're practicing again specialist and they devote more and more time to discuss reality

423
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
When you're doing other stuff

424
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
So it's a complex riddle

425
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
You know I'm into each case

426
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Ezone

427
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
But I'll tell you something else

428
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,935
When you reach the top of your field like Marcelo Garcia.

429
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
In BJJ

430
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
You stop being inspired

431
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Buy your own scene

432
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
You can

433
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
Gain inspiration knowledge and motivation

434
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
From your own scene

435
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
Because you are the leader you're on top of the mountain

436
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
You have nowhere else to climb

437
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
So what do you do

438
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
You look to other scenes

439
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
In

440
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
That's where it's really really valuable

441
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
To become a bit more generalized

442
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Related to that

443
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
The many people in the US in particular

444
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
Focus on learning more than doing

445
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,127
Focus too much on acquiring knowledge

446
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
Verses using that knowledge

447
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
Do you struggle this yourself

448
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Like how do you approach

449
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Learning new things

450
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
Verses putting more time into

451
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
Old things

452
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
That you've already messaged

453
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,511
It's not only US thing or North American scene

454
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
It's generally all across the globe all those are more practical people unless practical people in

455
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,031
Country has his own characteristics

456
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
But it's a good question you need to be

457
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
It's kind of being

458
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
Super intelligent in

459
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
Oriented towards team formation

460
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
But then have this

461
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Dumb down

462
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Practical mind

463
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,463
Okay I need to work you know and having a balance across that

464
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
And that's probably

465
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
And it's at

466
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
Probably means that

467
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
You know a certain

468
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
IQ

469
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
Example will start to work against you

470
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
In certain fields

471
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
And vice versa

472
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:02,687
Hey you when you become too much you know as the Chinese say The Men Who lives inside his head

473
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,039
You you start to have this issue you know you have a thirst

474
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
For information

475
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
Great thirst

476
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,159
Information is toxic

477
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,767
It's exactly like water water is toxic as well almost all compounds are

478
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:22,399
Isn't we drink we drink we do we kill ourselves we kill the process

479
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
And the knowledge it turns against us

480
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
And then

481
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
That's a serious problem

482
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Index

483
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,663
The problem of the age of misinformation that we live in

484
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,271
It's not only the Technology's toxic even when it's good knowledge

485
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
Now we also have

486
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Dad knowledge

487
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Mostly bad

488
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
Mostly shitty advice

489
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
The combination is Lisa than just people become paralyzed or just you know move from bling

490
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
Link to link to link with

491
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
Lazy eyes

492
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
Just never

493
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Actually do anything

494
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,823
I know you Advocate building shoes work

495
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
How many hours

496
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Today do you think

497
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
This is also a debate

498
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Specialist

499
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
How many hours a day

500
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
Is the most a person can train

501
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Before it becomes

502
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
Not sustainable boost before their mind

503
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Becomes uninspired

504
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Maybe as you said

505
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
24 hours

506
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Twenty-four hours a day

507
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,960
There was a choreographer in Israel very known choreographer

508
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:34,336
Call Johan Arena says when you wake up in the morning in bed Between the Sheets

509
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
You can you can practice movement

510
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
And he's not there talking about with your partner

511
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,088
Even there you can practice you know breathing moving

512
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
All the time around you but

513
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,696
Serious practice you know

514
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:56,096
Practice oriented success and building skills

515
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
From isolation to integration to improvisation

516
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
In most disciplines

517
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
It's around 6 to 8 hours a day

518
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,640
Some people go more and retrieving the 10-hour mark

519
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Periods of time

520
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,528
In the military you go even further than that

521
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,136
Other disciplines require less than in it's also a highly individual thing

522
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
So let's not even within the sport of gymnastics

523
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Do you answer in

524
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
A woman liking and not

525
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
Who trains 8 hours a day and next to her in the same team

526
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
Also winning gold medals

527
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:37,056
The same level more less you have Shawn Johnson training 3 hours a day

528
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
And she reached

529
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
The top of her field

530
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
Olympic gold medal

531
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
Indoor Olympics

532
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
So

533
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Time in the future

534
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
This is

535
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
Very rare

536
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
To see

537
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
History our gold medal sing

538
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
But definitely it exist

539
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
The difference there might be mental

540
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
So the question I have is

541
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Out of the

542
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
Various elements like breathing

543
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
In developing muscular strength are joints

544
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
Which is the biggest challenge to master

545
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,872
As a student movement

546
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
Highland obituaries

547
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,760
Depends on the person depends on his orientation

548
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
Some people never require any form of mental

549
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
Training for example of psychological training

550
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,048
Especially Shield saying was like sports in in team sports

551
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,448
Soap so that aspect is covered the winners are oriented there focused you know

552
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,288
And then other people require help in that regard

553
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,616
Some people have great difficulty developing

554
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Mobility

555
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
And just the nervous system is panic

556
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Hold on

557
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Text him too much

558
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,648
Other people are hypermobile and have difficulty creating townies

559
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
And in strengths and that he's a great challenge for them

560
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,120
Complex learners

561
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
They can name the can coordinate complex actions and learn movements very quickly While others are

562
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Highly limited so

563
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
It's very individual

564
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
So that process of learning

565
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
That journey is individual to everyone

566
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
How does one take that Journey

567
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Just listen to your own body

568
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
You can listen to your body till tomorrow

569
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
You know

570
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,328
You're not hearing anything you need to learn you need to create a relationship

571
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
With your body and you need to help us

572
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
Teachers that's there is only you know a lot of people saying I'll do it myself

573
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,968
Then you deny Collective knowledge the most powerful knowledge that mankind holds you know because

574
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Only animal

575
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
The tap Collective knowledge

576
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,880
We've been able to move knowledge across generations and that's how

577
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
We have reached space

578
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Building internet

579
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,048
You know who all these crazy surgery

580
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,400
And you know solved you know genetic issues and Etc

581
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
You're not going to do it by yourself

582
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,288
You are just one small person

583
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,896
And we have collected knowledge Generations upon Generations

584
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
So

585
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
Listen to your body that's nice to say

586
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,808
Most people going to your s*** it's completely silent

587
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:33,696
You need to start to decipher the signals that the body gives you

588
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232
And that goes through

589
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,304
Practice in learning discipleship

590
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
And exploring alarmed if

591
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Different stuff

592
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
It's a highly individual c

593
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
Don't have so much anymore

594
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Anymore

595
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,128
Mentor student or teacher disciple

596
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Relationship but I

597
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
I wouldn't be here

598
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,296
Without my mentors and my teachers

599
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
The shoulders of giants

600
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Dad lifted me up

601
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,928
I still believe in 18 Min away

602
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
There is no other way

603
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
On that

604
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Do you think that

605
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
For the majority of the time

606
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
Is a

607
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,704
Fundamentally solitary activity

608
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Or

609
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Do we gain from

610
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,568
The presence of others

611
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
So when you when you think of movement

612
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
When you're training

613
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
Is most of your training

614
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
Like the reputations done alone

615
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
I would dollars

616
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
Both

617
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,928
Years you know alone and with my Student Center

618
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
I spend large

619
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Periods of time

620
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
Alone just training alone but

621
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,656
I also spend a lot of time being in a community

622
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:51,264
Movement is the best reason for gathering around in a community

623
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,920
And you know people for example nowadays they go do Crossfade or they do yoga or whatever and then they have

624
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
The yoga friends

625
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Ndk

626
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,088
That's b******* you know your yoga friends can be your real friends

627
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
Because we've been gathering around movement since the age of time

628
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:14,816
Creating communities around movement around hunting-gathering dance around the fire

629
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
We've been moving together

630
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
I can recommend move with your last ones moved with the people around you you know you join a BJJ Club

631
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
It's a community

632
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
You know you go there you meet

633
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,176
UE move around you go to capoeira

634
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
It's a try

635
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
You go to a CrossFit gym it's a community

636
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
You go to yoga it's a community

637
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,160
You can move with your children you can move with your dog

638
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
In the park

639
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,000
It's important to move together

640
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,144
But it can also be done alone and some things are better done some things are better done together

641
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
How do you think movement

642
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Changes

643
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Soul movement

644
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,872
But that that whole pattern of movement will you moving alone

645
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
Versus the pattern of movement where there's two people

646
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Either working together against

647
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
Together is like dancing

648
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Partner dancing

649
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
I guess each other is like

650
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Wrestling or jiu-jitsu

651
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
Do you think the principles of movement

652
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
Are different

653
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
When is two people

654
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Horses one person

655
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Is this a whole nother world

656
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
First they spend more time moving

657
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,544
With others against others in martial art cuz I spend most of my life in martial arts

658
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,104
Less time exploring stuff alone

659
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,248
But there are some Concepts that still exist like the quality of movement

660
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,832
How you organize your body in space

661
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
Not in relation to the partner only

662
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
But first a BJJ practitioner

663
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
Or or stand-up fighter

664
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,840
He needs to organize his body in relation to space first

665
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,912
And then in relation to the partners what

666
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,056
Some of the concepts existing boat While others are very different to him

667
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
And that you can train alone or all your life when somebody else is in the equation it's going to change the game completely

668
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
A major reason why we are

669
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,856
Under the fight laboratory with

670
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Departed

671
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,464
In reality from a lot of traditional martial arts

672
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,816
The delusions of training alone and doing forms and

673
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,144
And repetitive movements alone

674
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
It's a shitstorm

675
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,264
You can't apply anything

676
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
You don't have any life practice and now we see that

677
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,736
The practices that stayed very real

678
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,808
State very dirty in away but very real

679
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,648
They are the ones who are providing tools

680
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,696
For the chaotic environment.

681
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,256
Terms of injury

682
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
How do you

683
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Treat

684
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
Recover

685
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
And work around injury

686
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,216
Injuries are

687
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
Ascertain

688
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,568
They're not the probability

689
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896
Injuries and diseases

690
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
They are also required

691
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:17,856
Has nothing solid one of my biggest Inspirations in these days the great philosopher

692
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,928
In order to antifragile eyes

693
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
Become antifragile to become robust to become

694
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
More than resilient

695
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,376
You must be able to enjoy volatility

696
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
You must be able to grow

697
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Sunday stuff

698
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
First

699
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
I said

700
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
I said it before and I'll say it again

701
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
I injure my student

702
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
This happens

703
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
End

704
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,736
I can do anything beneficial without it

705
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Animate basically

706
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
We all get injured

707
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
Constantly

708
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
On a micro-level and macro-level

709
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
It's part of our lives

710
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Of course

711
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
We don't want to

712
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
Pusheen to meaningless injury

713
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,376
And we want to be able to grow for meeting

714
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
How do you train a round

715
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
How do you train around it

716
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
The hard question

717
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
Involves a lot of stuff

718
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,176
1st and a big believer in movement

719
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
As a therapeutic tool

720
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,576
Movement itself if it offers you a Temptation and it does

721
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
It's the way out

722
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
Rest I don't believe in rest

723
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,488
I believe in movie

724
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,304
Which means when I'm resting

725
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
I might

726
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Help

727
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,936
On the short-term with certain aspects of the injury

728
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,848
But at the same time I'm creating a new problem because the process is taking me somewhere else

729
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,432
I'm not recovering towards movement I'm recovering towards no

730
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
So we have a problem here

731
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
In some cases you must rest

732
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
And then deal with the consequences later

733
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,696
What's the most cases

734
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Is there is a better approach

735
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,048
Then just resting in that

736
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,912
That requires a lot more taking responsibility which doctors

737
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,008
Don't believe in your ability to take responsibility for yourself

738
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,104
Be intelligent and to know the amount

739
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,808
And some some form of a knowledge and experience in most people can't be trusted with it so we offer

740
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
Advice of like just rest resting

741
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Stop

742
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
But but definitely

743
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,024
After years and years of working with people in

744
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
And taking them through

745
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:41,472
Crazy Ray's near my right hand odelia she went through a car accident she lost her kidney she broke her back

746
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
She went through three knee surgeries

747
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
Which my sister performed by the way

748
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
Nowadays she she can move like

749
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
Few people I know on this planet

750
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
And then just

751
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,344
Did the answer was always movement movement going back into movement

752
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Beautiful

753
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Continue

754
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Move

755
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
Continue to move you don't look stupid

756
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,304
Don't don't hurt yourself but that's an obvious no

757
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
I guess not because when I say these things

758
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
People write the f****** common

759
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
The butt

760
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
The bat people you know yet about you going to injure yourself

761
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Yeah

762
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Genius

763
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,640
Don't go into the injury

764
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
And it again

765
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,248
Deteriorated escalate the situation

766
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Of course not

767
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,064
You must move around it

768
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
And you must be smart in the way that you allow adaptation to take you out like a wave you need to ride

769
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Meditation

770
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
Out of the out of the problem

771
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
Index tricky we know

772
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,936
And that's something that we need to educate people on

773
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
Are we to believe in people's intelligence and ability to

774
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
Take this responsibility

775
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
In China

776
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,688
They still have in some areas and they used to have a bone set

777
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,272
They didn't put you in a cast you broke your hand

778
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,576
They think it is for bone setting

779
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,160
Yeah they didn't have x-rays so that's

780
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
A lot more complex

781
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
And not as successful as nowadays

782
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
But

783
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
Having said that

784
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,216
They did a chief amazing rates of recovery because these

785
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,824
Raps that they use in the process allows some

786
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Form of movement

787
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,176
Zachary to another PlayStation

788
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Note-taking arm

789
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
Healthy harm your right arm

790
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
What is in a cast for

791
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
6 months

792
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
Take down the cast what do you see

793
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
The opposite

794
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,488
The arm is basically moving towards death

795
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
Is Gotten Good at not moving

796
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
The Army's Gray

797
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,936
You have weird hairs growing out of it stinks

798
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,520
It really smells and looks like death because

799
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Movement

800
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Is life

801
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
No movement.

802
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
We know that

803
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
We like to

804
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,504
Just kill your arm a tiny bit so that

805
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
Children bones can

806
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Reform

807
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Together

808
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
And then we'll bring it back to life

809
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
That's one approach

810
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
In other cases

811
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,840
You can maintain the life and the demands on the tissue safely enough

812
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
At the same time allow the recovery to have

813
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
And diet

814
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
What are some guiding principles

815
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,360
Will diet is very individual sing

816
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,432
I've been personally following

817
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,760
Paleolithic Cave Man Diet for a long time

818
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
How long before

819
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,856
It was called the Paleo Diet

820
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
And since 1997

821
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Oregon 96

822
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,256
I've been doing this for a long time

823
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
Feel great on it

824
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,888
Still in our growing older and older and

825
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:54,752
Functioning only better and being able to sustain meeting

826
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Improve

827
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,592
But that is very very individual

828
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
There is a lot of exploration to be done there

829
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
What you can withstand

830
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
How resilient is your sister

831
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,928
Nowadays the reason new movement towards not improving the fuel sources

832
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
Choosing the quality

833
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,768
In the quantities of the food

834
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,840
But actually making the system more resilient

835
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
So he's able

836
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
To basically withstand

837
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Annie

838
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,264
Almost any

839
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Quality Inn

840
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
That's where

841
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
We have been lucky

842
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,968
Weeping neglecting this area that's something that

843
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,296
I believe is the latest innovation

844
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Although it's still highly misunderstood

845
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
And a lot of fat

846
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,512
A lot of folks are abusing this concept and giving Reaper advice

847
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Just two

848
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Be different

849
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120
Just to say I'm not the Paleo guy

850
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,520
So did that's that's a small addition that will get bigger and bigger a sink

851
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
So it's almost like

852
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
How you recommended movement

853
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,688
To go outside of quote-unquote proper alignment

854
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
This is kind of

855
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
The diet version of that

856
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
Is going outside of

857
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,856
Some kind of proper framework of diet

858
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,904
To some level but that's

859
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
The death was an obvious thing

860
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
You know all the ways

861
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
The problem is

862
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
It's not enough

863
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Because

864
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,216
What I'm suggesting with movement to go outside of their proper alignment

865
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008
It creates an adaptation

866
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,824
But what if that interpretation cannot happen

867
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
For example

868
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
Celiac disease person

869
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
You'll exposing to gluten

870
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
And you have a terrible consequences

871
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:49,696
No maybe if you can minimising the amount you can actually train him

872
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,816
But that's what the patient is not going to last very

873
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Very far down the road

874
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,424
He's going to get some games

875
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
But what if you could

876
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
Take that selling deceased person

877
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Put them in the garage

878
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
Fixes machina

879
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
Change

880
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
He's tires changes

881
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Oily map

882
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
Putting back on the track

883
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
Is a new animal

884
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
Annies vet

885
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,928
That is where

886
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
A lot of stuff is happening nowadays

887
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
So the genetic part of it

888
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
The gut biome

889
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
So so

890
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
Complexion in we discover that

891
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:40,128
You know we live in symbiosis with all this microorganisms dead

892
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Just

893
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,224
All over our skin inside of a saint

894
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,016
We leave in combination with that

895
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
And that's how you see

896
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,112
Some dudes in Brazilian in Russia

897
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
Walking around with

898
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
You know 5% body fat

899
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
Eating one cracker for breakfast

900
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
One cracker for dinner

901
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,912
Euro training BJJ all day long high performance

902
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,960
Fueling with Coca-Cola

903
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,056
And send at the same time you see people doing everything almost perfect

904
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,616
And still having poor

905
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
Poor performance and

906
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
Inability and that gain weight with any you know extra calorie or macronutrients they brought in

907
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Because their system

908
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,952
Is different and it's not only about genetics

909
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
It's more about

910
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
Epigenetics

911
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
I need some more about

912
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
What kind of

913
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,168
System besides your own DNA

914
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
What about these

915
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,776
Organisms that are supposed to help you

916
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,128
And live in symbiosis with him what kind of assistant do you have there

917
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
Disconnect spend more and more and more

918
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
And we're going to realize that

919
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,088
There is a lot to learn there

920
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,160
Do you think technology and science is ultimately

921
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
A positive force

922
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
4

923
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
You know you look at

924
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Movement as

925
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
As an element of our Humanity

926
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,168
Do you think technology is

927
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
Taking Humanity away

928
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Or

929
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Is adding to it

930
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,336
I'm not smart enough to answer you that man

931
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,944
Be questioning

932
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,248
Just eat a huge question

933
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,880
I think we're going to struggle with that question for many generations to come steal

934
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:31,744
It's definitely create a lot of positive stuff but also brought

935
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Tremendous suffering

936
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,608
Problems and perhaps

937
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Will be dead

938
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
You know the end of us

939
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
So technology might have been

940
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,800
You know the most terrible things that ever happened to us

941
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
Uno's

942
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Yes

To have a great team around me that they help me with that

956
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,696
So I saw you posted a couple of Tom Waits

957
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
And I even a Bukowski referee

958
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
On your Facebook page

959
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,096
And I understood something that

960
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
I think only another

961
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Asuc student

962
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,752
Of Waits and Bukowski can understand

963
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
You don't shy away from

964
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
The strange in the profound

965
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
Where we can find it

966
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
Yes have one way to put it

967
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,247
Is there a Tom Waits song that you find yourself

968
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,527
Returning too often

969
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
In your life

970
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
So many

971
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:08,511
So many is just so you know I I can barely listen to anything else

972
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Franklin

973
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
It's been a real issue in

974
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,863
Tom Tom Waits

975
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,655
He's discographies like it

976
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703
It's a lifetime of

977
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
What discoveries

978
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
It's been accompanying me for years now it's not all it's not the universal something you go through very quickly

979
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,455
I spend a lot of time on Alice

980
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,247
Example

981
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,855
Yea just so much stuff so much that's your way discover

982
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,927
Also you know III song to this disk

983
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,743
Weirdness is the Centre

984
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Argos

985
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
All things

986
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
It's so important

987
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
It's the only thing

988
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Reading

989
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
Is that can be you

990
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
Anyways

991
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Because as a culture

992
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,567
We're so glad we're becoming this

993
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,455
One thing you don't like you walk around in London it looks exactly like Hong Kong it looks exactly like Tokyo

994
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
Looks exactly like

995
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,063
We have this light

996
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,439
Huge human seeing going on which is great and we communicate very easy

997
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
But then we lost a lot

998
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
On our

999
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
Tyrone stuff

1000
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,119
There is only one Tom Waits you know because of his eccentric

1001
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:22,751
Partly because of his General this is where genius and that's why it's so beautiful to me

1002
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,615
To shy away from my own eccentric side

1003
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
To be to feeding

1004
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,367
But that's definitely an important see NSYNC

1005
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
So you recommend

1006
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
We cultivate the weird

1007
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,279
Yakult is writing the words cultivating yourself

1008
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
Because the da

1009
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,327
Truly you know

1010
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
Everybody's weird

1011
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,447
Everybody's in the reason of Homer Simpson

1012
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,335
Everybody has thus far everything has everybody has this interesting.

1013
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:03,199
That's what also interest me when I did I want to see that weird you know

1014
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,295
I want to see that weird in your movement

1015
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,975
And they don't tell and they put this perfect picture

1016
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
It

1017
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
I'm not stupid

1018
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,583
I know it's not perfect.

1019
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
So

1020
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,655
Just allow the witness to come out

1021
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
I think it's a great lesson earphone

1022
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
I'm waiting at bootcamp schedule

1023
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,847
Also if you don't mind I'm going to torture you something

1024
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
I would like to close

1025
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
Bear eating a

1026
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Bukowski poem roll the dice

1027
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
I want to force you to listen to it

1028
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Go ahead

1029
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,623
If you're going to try go all the way

1030
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
Otherwise don't even start

1031
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,767
This could mean losing girlfriends wives relatives jobs

1032
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
Maybe your mind

1033
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,351
It could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days

1034
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,911
It could mean freezing on a park bench

1035
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
Yakima Jail Division

1036
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
Commune mockery

1037
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
Isolation

1038
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
Isolation is the gift

1039
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
All the others are a test

1040
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
How's your endurance

1041
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,199
So how much you really want to do it

1042
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
You do it

1043
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,783
Despite rejection and the worst odds

1044
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,599
And will be better than anything else you can imagine

1045
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,671
If you're going to try go all the way

1046
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,719
There's no other feeling like that

1047
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,023
You'll be alone with the Gods

1048
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,071
And the nights will flame with fire

1049
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,887
You will ride life straight to perfect laughter

1050
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
It's the only good fight there is

1051
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,471
Amen

1052
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,543
