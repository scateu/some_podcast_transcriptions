1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,560
The following is a conversation with Dan Gable

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:06,144
One of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,008
The bigger than records in metals to Millions he's a symbol of guts

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
Spirit

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
Mental toughness

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,360
And Relentless hard work

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,432
As a wrestler he was undefeated in the high school

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,248
Undefeated in college until his very last match

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,296
And having lost that match

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,088
You found another level

11
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,672
And became a world champion and an Olympic champion

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,280
He didn't surrender a single point at the 1972 Olympic Games

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
As a coach

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,144
He led the Iowa Hawkeyes 215 national titles

15
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
He coached

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
152 all Americans

17
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
45 national champions

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,640
106 Big Ten Champions and 12 Olympians

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
Including 8 medalist

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,808
He's the author of several books including a wrestling Life 1 and 2

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
And

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
Coaching wrestling successfully

23
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,464
I also recommend you check out the painting called

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
The art of the fight

25
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:08,096
But Mike kopke that you can buy on Dan Gable. Com

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
And if you visit Iowa

27
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Like I did

28
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
You should try the Gable beer

29
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Single-speed Brewery

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
A portion of the proceeds

31
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104
I bought the painting and the beer

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
Support

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
The Dan Gable Museum in Iowa

34
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,248
Wrestling is one of the purest Sports

35
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
But beautiful

36
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
And brutal

37
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,904
We're both mental toughness and Technical Mastery of the highest form

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
I rewarded with victory

39
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
And everything else is punished

40
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
With the feet

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,912
And ever since lost weighs heavy on the mind of anyone who has ever stepped in the wrestling mat

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
The same is true

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
One of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the sport

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,848
The man who graciously welcomed me into his home

45
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
For this conversation

46
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
The legend

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Dan

48
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Cable

49
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Be true to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy

50
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
But because they are hard

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:14,400
You're persistent I love that because you've been trying to get me on this podcast for a long time

52
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
And until I saw you

53
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
On another podcast

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
And you said you were rushing

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Did I call you back

56
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
There was over

57
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,176
Because Russia to me you know is leading the world in wrestling

58
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Almost every year

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
What's the difference between American wrestling in Russian wrestling you show me this painting while it's a mighty it's science it's science

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Yale and

61
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,536
They really study the sport they're really good technically they're really really good in strategy

62
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
They Don't Really push like

63
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
The real toughness they don't push like

64
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Conditioning

65
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,520
Right and so Americans we need what they have

66
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,896
Russians Niva we have and when you get to two together

67
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
And for me

68
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
Why could beat the Russians is because

69
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
I went away a little bit

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
I kept my toughness

71
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,928
But you're known your you're known for your toughness

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
And I wasn't known for my art

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
I wasn't known for my science

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
So when did you become a bit of an artist

75
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
It took a loss

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
Celerion block because I 181 straighten the dominant 7

77
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
And not just winning but you don't care.

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Punisher

79
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
People gas and

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,784
From from that point of view yeah I might have been pretty good but I had a long ways to go yet

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
And I didn't

82
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
Really realize that or I should have said I should say

83
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
I didn't

84
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,768
Really know how to get it out of me until I had a loss and then I realized I got a buckle down

85
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
Learn some of that science

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Become more of an artist

87
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
How do you become an artist

88
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,448
That's the Russian way has this

89
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Drilling technique

90
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Thousands of reps

91
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
How do you how do you think

92
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
You work on the science to Artpark

93
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
You got to study the best in the world

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
I think Dave Schultz was our guy

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
In America that probably

96
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Showed us that

97
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Being artistic

98
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
You needed that and he studied that he went over there as a high schooler

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
And Russell and some major tournaments over there

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
And he saw their ways

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
He use that Russian science and then he

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Was already in American

103
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
And he saw what

104
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
How I

105
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,127
Trained athletes he saw what I did in the Olympics solid other people

106
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
How we held up

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Any applied that as well but

108
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,599
I have to say he has more the artistic type he was more of a Russian than an American when it came to

109
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Wrestling

110
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
You've coached

111
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
45 national champions 106 Big 10 champions

112
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
And 8 Olympic medalist

113
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Which is incredible

114
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
What is a Common Thread between them

115
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
And

116
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
What are

117
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Maybe some of the fundamental differences

118
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
I think the Common Thread is

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
That

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,295
They all had one of those two avenues that we talked already

121
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,135
Can because we intertwined them

122
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
So in a Russian wrestling room they got the same people

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,535
Most of time in American dressing room are the same people

124
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
But what I was out recruiting

125
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
At first I recruited just attitude

126
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
But I needed more than that

127
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
I needed some

128
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
Genetics in that wrestling room

129
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
Actually

130
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
That hard work people

131
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
You know they can look and see

132
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Wow

133
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
That execution

134
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
That's unbelievable

135
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
But yet

136
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
I can beat that guy

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
After the first minute

138
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
So you think

139
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,815
You think the art the the technique

140
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Is genetics a you're born with it you think it's nice I think your pop and your speedo your ability to

141
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Remove a timing and timing and

142
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Your quickness and your strength

143
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
You know the Russians

144
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Late

145
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
Usually picked out

146
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
The people that can go into that sport

147
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
That was the old fashioned sports car

148
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,951
But it it's it's mostly like when you see when you walk into a rest Russian dressing room

149
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
UCM hitting

150
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Skills

151
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Techniques

152
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
You don't you don't see him against each other that much

153
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Silver

154
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,983
You might not see a bunch of Sprints you might see him walk over to the

155
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
The ropes

156
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
And they

157
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
Drop down from the ceiling

158
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,687
And they'll jump up and climb a rope and then they come down

159
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
And then

160
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
They don't jump right back on

161
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
They got three or four other guys go and then they jump back on where is

162
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,695
I probably made my guys climb get right back down climbing right back again

163
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
But

164
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
I also realized

165
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
That

166
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
I had a mix of that what was the role what was your role I mean those guys looked up and Dan Gable and

167
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
What was the role in helping these athletes become their best

168
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
Is national champion in first of all prove that you are

169
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Knew what you were doing

170
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
In terms of technique or in terms of everything they just

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
You had to be the first guy there in the last guy to leave and you had to be the most dedicated guy even though they were the ones that's trying to win the

172
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Having ships

173
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
You had to

174
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
Prove that you're going to work just as hard as they were as a coach

175
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
And what does that look like what do so you can see it when you

176
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,191
You know it when you see it while you're there ahead of them and you're

177
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,031
There after they leave simple

178
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
I'm picking up after him

179
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
And you're analyzing them

180
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
You are welcome

181
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
You're welcome

182
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
And you don't think them

183
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
Incel use that type of strategy in overtime

184
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
When you prove it works

185
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Because

186
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Some of my

187
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
Kids that were the best kids in the world

188
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Really

189
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
Should have been a wrestler I mean there weren't very coordinated

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
But they work so hard to develop

191
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Themselves

192
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,847
What was your role in that process I mean that means pushing kids to their limit

193
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,711
If you're not going you can't push this to their limit and even when you push them to their limit

194
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
That's not their limit

195
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
Cuz their limits above and beyond that I mean

196
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Yeah

197
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
Coaches sometimes accidentally don't

198
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Palouse kids

199
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
Because of the heat because of

200
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,327
Hard work and all that you got to know where to go in the back off

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
You got to read your athletes

202
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
And

203
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
By that I mean you got to know him pretty well not every once in awhile you make a little bit of mistake but if you don't react right on that

204
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
A mistake before it gets too far

205
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,199
Then it's going to be a casualty somebody dying necessarily

206
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
But maybe something that could turn them off

207
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
Or maybe something that can run them away or maybe something that

208
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,207
Wow that was close to it maybe should have pushed in that far

209
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
So you really have to be very educated

210
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
And it's not just

211
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
What you know

212
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
It's what you know about them

213
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
And I'm not talking about the team I'm talking about each guy individuals yeah you know it

214
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
How you see in their eyes because

215
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
The first one there your last one to leave and and you said in the environment with him you're there for in the morning

216
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
Practice sometimes you're there in the afternoon for 2 or 3 hours

217
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
After practice

218
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
You might have a

219
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
A hot rumor

220
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
You might have a sauna or steam or whirlpool

221
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
And you get in there with them

222
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
And you listen

223
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
You know you're not just feeding out information

224
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
You do that

225
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,007
But you're taking in a lot of that too and I'm telling you when you get in an atmosphere

226
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
That they're relaxed and they feel comfortable massage

227
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
And that's after practice in one of those

228
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Areas that

229
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
People around you learn alot

230
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
I mean you got a lot to learn as a coach

231
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,671
And when you get in that atmosphere when you all of a sudden you feel like very comfortable

232
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Word start flowing

233
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
It was those words flow

234
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,423
You take a man as a coach and there's something probably going to be said

235
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
That you can do an act upon that's going to help

236
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
Certain situations

237
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
I've saved a couple gets lice for sure

238
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
That were on the brink

239
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
You know sometimes performance is at such a high level

240
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
You know high-level atmosphere

241
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Life and death is actually

242
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
Involved and I don't mean pushing a kid to worry it just dies

243
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
But I mean he might feel himself as a failure

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Then you may go home and take his own life

245
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
Yeah I mean but that's part of it you putting

246
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,031
So much heart somebody's blood in the heart and sweat and every year your whole meaning of life becomes

247
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,407
Winning so and sometimes it's so hard to lose within that context

248
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,783
If you know I think the first wrestling life you wrote about Chad zapotal

249
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Who

250
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Lost I mean incredible wrestler

251
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,719
But lost in three finals in the Nationals in has his tattoo

252
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,047
Pave Hawk hauling out the human heart yeah

253
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
So what lessons is there any lessons

254
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
From

255
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,495
The incredible wrestling he's done but also the incredible suffering that he went through

256
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,871
On himself again you like that we're suffering and which is okay

257
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Okay so I have to turn that suffering

258
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Ring around

259
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
What he makes

260
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
And feels good about himself

261
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Are better

262
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,463
Does not feel perfect

263
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Cuz you could lose

264
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
And so but you have to actually

265
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
Get him to realize

266
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
That yeah he's still unique

267
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,239
Compared to the Walk of the earth he was unbelievably unique

268
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,335
Raise the top just a little bit short of but because it was

269
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
You know he felt suffering

270
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
You now have to go about and change that in

271
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,623
Put into Goodwill some way and because he's you really have a lot of good well you can do a lot of good well

272
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Cancel

273
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
It's not easy

274
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
It took him probably

275
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Years

276
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
Years of tattooing

277
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
Years of covering the tattoos

278
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
And

279
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:29,311
Yeah he told me multicolor Iva way moving to California because he was here for a couple years after

280
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
Is rusting was done because he had a good job around here and he's

281
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
I thought he was doing a good job but you just

282
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
Should I had escaped you know same as a cut wrestling tattoo had a wrestling terminology I have to get

283
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Need to say that I have I hate to say this

284
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
I go where you going

285
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
California

286
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Hey Google is there a reason why you going to California

287
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
Because that's where

288
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Everybody goes to hide

289
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
But I said

290
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
I think it wrong everybody

291
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
You know I think

292
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
What will determine

293
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
Your life will be what you do for now on

294
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,343
If you can find a sexy turn it around

295
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
Exactly he went someplace that he thought

296
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
He can fit into

297
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
And I think you did

298
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
And I think he's got a good job and he's helping people

299
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
Covered that tattoo with the

300
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Feathers

301
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
Another tattoo

302
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
Well in the end it's a beautiful story

303
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,127
Yeah there's it really is afraid overcoming

304
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Yeah and he's

305
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Not done yet

306
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
Is not done yet

307
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
It's a lot more to do

308
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
So you mentioned Roger Bannister

309
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,439
Again I thinking your first book somebody looked up to

310
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
That's the man who broke the 4-minute mile

311
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,423
When everybody said it was impossible and when thought it was impossible it would die it's not cute

312
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
So what

313
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
You done your homework

314
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,431
Bought the book for what you've done your homework

315
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
Sitting here but Putin to do research

316
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
So what

317
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,135
What's lessons you take from that story for yourself The Impossible trying to accomplish The Impossible

318
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
Well The Impossible Is Possible

319
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
It's just that simple

320
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Time changes things

321
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
I mean

322
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
I mean if you look at

323
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
What

324
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
What are the mile time is right now

325
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Compared to that 4 minute mile

326
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,823
Which one it was broke by a couple tensor 3 or 4/10

327
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
It's not broke by

328
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Another 20 seconds

329
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,087
I mean it by 700 people yeah people and

330
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,487
It's pretty much the common Ali's are you got to run a four-minute mile if you're going to go somewhere now or or below if you're going to win

331
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Events

332
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
It said major level that you got to be able to do that

333
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
And so if you can take that and you can look at what

334
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
In time history

335
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Has as its

336
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Record performance

337
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
And you can realize that

338
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
At record performance

339
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
It's going to change

340
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
And they don't take it to all the factors

341
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Acknowledge

342
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
They don't taken all the factors of

343
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
Better shoes

344
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
They don't take it all the factors of

345
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Better understanding in nutrition

346
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
I mean it's like me as an athlete

347
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
I went to practice everyday in high school for

348
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
At least

349
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,079
My sophomore in my junior and part of my

350
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
Senior year and all of a sudden

351
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
A new rule came out

352
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
The rules are dumb

353
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Before that said

354
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Diesel motor coaches

355
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
How you feel

356
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,999
We don't drink in water practice

357
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
And

358
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,119
Gave wife cuz you got to toughen you up as a weakness

359
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Water

360
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,519
And so we would go through practice I mean and you're sweating and then you're sweating so much that

361
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,079
You're almost out of sweat and so

362
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,687
You're mostly at the end of practice you're not even wrestling excuse me

363
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
You're sitting against a wall cuz you're tired

364
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
So then all of a sudden

365
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
They say okay

366
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,647
Call drink water during practice print Gatorade during practice

367
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,487
It all of a sudden at the end of practice we're still out there competing

368
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
And so

369
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,607
I look at my career for 2 and 1/2 years where I Junior High to

370
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
So I got another three years

371
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Or I didn't really

372
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
Wasn't able to push as good as I could because

373
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
I just

374
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Who's Bobby under

375
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
Yeah so what so but at the individual level

376
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
In terms of the impossible

377
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
When did you first believe

378
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,879
The thing that maybe probably people would laugh at your boss that you would be in the Olympics

379
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Champion

380
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Well I always

381
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,047
Visualized me being the best you believed it in the very forever

382
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Forever

383
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Yeah I was

384
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Because I was

385
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
I don't need to call it a dreamer or somebody that

386
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,543
I was just involved with competitive Sports at the YMCA from

387
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
H5

388
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:24,735
Did you tell people that dream that you're going to be an Olympic champion Monday give me the best in the world I think they knew

389
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
And the only reason why they knew cuz there was something

390
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:33,183
Build-A-Bear about this guy

391
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,327
And he was swinging baseball bats you know what's 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10

392
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
And he was swinging baseball bats

393
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,007
So much right handed and so much left hand with nobody even there throwing the ball

394
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,383
That all of a sudden they walked by and all the sudden the grass was down to dirt

395
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
So it's like

396
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
They saw me on the yard

397
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
Playing by myself Sports

398
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:06,463
Oriental we are you get the neighborhood kids you play a lot but if they weren't there

399
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
You know if you want in my front room I was hiking a ball like I was a quarterback and I was running not and run

400
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Through the

401
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Do the furniture

402
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,823
You know who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents

403
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,711
And the coaches at the YMCA level 2 junior high level they saw this guy come first and

404
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
And end up last but

405
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
I wasn't that great

406
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
I wasn't the fastest guy at that time

407
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
And

408
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
I wasn't as strong as guy

409
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,535
You no answer before I went to the Olympics when they tested me they tested everybody

410
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
And I probably came back with one of the highest scores

411
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
But it was

412
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
It was not like the highest

413
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
Person on this and this and that

414
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,359
I was all high across the board straight across the board High

415
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
On every one of them

416
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,711
But it was always people that were higher than genetics

417
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
But then they would go down

418
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
They never test on something else and go back up

419
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,367
Mind-state High all across the board

420
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,439
And so I really didn't have too many flaws

421
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
I didn't have any

422
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
Things that also said that you were going to be

423
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
Unscored upon at the Olympic Games

424
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Alright so take me

425
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Through that day if you could

426
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,751
1972 when you were gone for the 68kg

427
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Freestyle Wrestling gold

428
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Discord

429
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
50

430
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
Seven points found correct

431
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
I had zero points scored on you

432
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
57

433
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
0 Sol

434
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
Maybe

435
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
I take me through the almost the details what was your routine what was your process what was going through your mind your thoughts of that

436
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Yeah first of all

437
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
It was quite a day

438
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Because

439
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
Everyday

440
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
At that time

441
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,239
And we wait in 2 hours before the start of the competition

442
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,383
And saw that is mean that you weigh in 2 hours for your Russell cuz you didn't know whether you going to wrestle right away or later on

443
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,711
In fact in that day I don't think I Russell's a until

444
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
Later on in the evening so

445
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,879
Had all day to recover but I didn't really need it anyway cuz you don't know wasn't really

446
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
Pulling a whole lot of weight but just

447
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
I was just interesting

448
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,839
What was in your mind what were we thinking when you're nervous for you I was confident

449
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
I was confident how you knew you were going to win the gold

450
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Yeah I know

451
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
But

452
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
In reality

453
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
I'm not I didn't know if I'm a cocky point of view

454
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
I only knew it

455
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Because for the last

456
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
Three and a half years

457
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
I've been going to practice

458
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,463
I'd be winning every practice you felt good I hardly ever lose it if I lost it

459
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
Somebody scored on me

460
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
It was like

461
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,607
Too bad I couldn't sleep until I

462
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Figured it out

463
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
Or if I didn't figure it out

464
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
I would fall asleep

465
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,383
And I would be what I would wake up with the answer what I needed why got scored upon

466
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,783
So maybe now that you won the gold can you tell me in the practice from somebody took you down

467
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,184
How do you take Dan Gable down in the rug in the practice room

468
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Because

469
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
They were going for one move

470
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
All I wanted was one move

471
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,216
Somebody has no practice or half a practice or at least 10-15 minutes

472
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
And they were maybe going to score

473
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,640
If they can work it in their mind

474
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,480
But they knew that was going to be their victory

475
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
In the practice room

476
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Maybe you can educate me

477
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
And that when you go for the Olympic gold

478
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
You didn't want to allow any takedowns

479
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,888
So there's no such thing as working on some kind of weird position of week for into something it's important to not let.

480
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
May I take down

481
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
I like what we're saying before

482
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
If something happened and

483
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
Somebody scored on me in a certain way

484
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,920
I would go over that situation situation over again

485
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
And I would come up with an answer

486
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
And then I would actually test it

487
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
Maybe I won't go back the next day

488
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Cuz I didn't want the guy to

489
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
You do not have some

490
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,256
I don't want him to think that I was thinking about it all night I didn't tell him

491
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
But maybe three days later went to wrestle again

492
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
I actually had it figured out because

493
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
He wasn't able to

494
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,568
Or if even if I was it on to take it offensive move

495
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
And I got stopped and didn't score

496
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,664
You know I had to go back

497
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
Filter that

498
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
But it wasn't something that

499
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
Usually I couldn't solve

500
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
But I could usually solve it

501
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,416
Let's go back to the Olympic Games so I get up in the Olympics in the morning

502
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,976
And I'm not sure when the Wayans were but

503
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,792
I think I was probably a pound over

504
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,632
You know that's about a half a kilo in 1.1 pounds

505
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
Is a kilo cuz we wouldn't kilograms so what do you do with that pain you are soft

506
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Asana there

507
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,920
And I got in the sauna and the funny thing was the morning of the of the

508
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Of the finals

509
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,784
It was it was another athlete in

510
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Lisanna

511
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
And it American or no

512
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
It was a European

513
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
I did I don't remember where she was from

514
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Adoration

515
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
Well you know what I kind of think

516
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
Was applied

517
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
Cuz it was a girl

518
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
I just think and she didn't have her top one

519
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
Ella

520
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
And that was pretty common

521
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
And so you know it's kind of interesting

522
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
You think back about it

523
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
Because

524
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
There's some funny things that

525
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,552
That go on

526
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
Behind the scenes

527
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,160
In Olympic Games in world games anytime

528
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,792
When you have country gets country and so there's some crazy Stein goes on any of it affect you

529
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:08,448
Did you it was there any almost stayed too long in the Sun

530
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,520
You lost a little bit over

531
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
But

532
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:18,432
It didn't really bother me cuz I wasn't likes that wasn't like cutting a lot of weight so so

533
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
Your match against the Russian the house your life is not to be at two times

534
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
Will Champion the silver medalist as well

535
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
Is an incredible wrestler

536
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
So what was going through your mind

537
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:37,376
Before stepping on the mat with that guy you beating a bunch of wrestlers haven't had a point scored on you

538
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,472
And you're stepping on the Media serves Russian who you said was

539
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
Really they pick the Soviets pics

540
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
To beat you

541
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,128
And I know why they picked him because he had a great attitude

542
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,456
So he wasn't just the typical artist

543
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
He was a good artist

544
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
He hooked elbows like

545
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,184
Star July 11th he's from that area of the world where they have some of those types of moves but

546
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
He said he was a Gore

547
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
But

548
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
I cutting down a weight he lost some of that go

549
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
And I don't know if

550
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
If you got that's a process you got to

551
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Cobalt

552
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
Scientifically

553
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,080
And so you know if you don't do it is it American

554
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,456
You can really hurt your performance if you don't do it as a Russian you can hurt your performance and they already

555
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Didn't really

556
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:30,112
Do that a lot work usually Russell's await where it was more like your weight

557
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,464
And so by cutting him down maybe slotus

558
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:41,120
Belief down a little bit. You saw him the spirit was a little bit gone when your face

559
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,752
You don't rest the matches and he was in the round-robin and he was able to go to the finals

560
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
But he had lost another match

561
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
Actually against in the round robin against the Japanese self

562
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
I think

563
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
I had already gained enough of artistic being able to finish a match once I lost my match in college

564
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
For the last two years I took on some of that artistica

565
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
I'll working

566
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
I think that he was already

567
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
Hoping to win

568
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,144
But he's hoping to win by a long ways because

569
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
He had to pin me or beat me by

570
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
8 points

571
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
To be able to win the gold

572
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
And

573
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,688
You know that wasn't going to happen to have any chance of pain is pretty good is it hard to pin down Gable versus takedown

574
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Down

575
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,528
Like have you taken risks where you can pay for them

576
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,112
I can't remember too many that I took

577
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,928
That would actually put me in a danger position

578
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,048
I taken risk but the risk for so scientifically technically correct

579
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
That

580
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,144
I wouldn't land in that danger zone

581
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
It's like 5-minute lock up and throw you I'm not going to throw you to my own back and Roy through I'm going to turn in the air

582
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,408
Scientific about it exactly I ate all you just

583
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,480
I learned the hard way early on

584
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
There was moose from Collegiate wrestling

585
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,856
That you did that expose your shoulders which

586
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,464
It cost me some early freestyle matches against wrestlers

587
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
But

588
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
I would go back to my

589
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Collegian

590
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:20,960
Escaping type moves to where I hit a Granby roll where you suppose your shoulders you lose two points every time

591
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,080
But you learn that that's not the system but if you hadn't wrestle much

592
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
You would

593
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
Get exposed under

594
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
Maybe

595
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
A desperate situation you would hit it

596
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
So you won the gold

597
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Holiday

598
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Feel

599
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,112
You know you have accomplished really the highest

600
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,768
I think it would have I think the question would be how would it feel if you lost the gold

601
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
For me just

602
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
I already went through that once

603
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
Not that highest level but the National Collegiate Championship level my senior year to Larry Owens lawn Larry Owens yeah

604
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,896
And that didn't set well will you afraid of that happening again

605
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
At the Olympic level was that you know I really wasn't

606
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,296
But it was why I changed my

607
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,624
Philosophy of training and added

608
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
2

609
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
The science

610
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
Tific artist type

611
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
And I asked if I'd have won that match

612
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,584
Even though I wouldn't have felt good about it even though

613
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
Squeaked it out

614
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
I wasn't

615
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,752
Feeling good about that match it would have affected me a little bit

616
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,056
But if I don't want it I would have got over it

617
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,616
I mean I'm not over it now

618
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
I mean I don't know why I was

619
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
Doing this kind of stuff

620
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
Right before my badge

621
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,320
Light by that I mean this kind of stuffs

622
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,720
Yeah and I really was a good talker that I mean me and you were talking pretty good right now except for I got a little cold but but

623
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,560
I don't think I could say two words Harley then and

624
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,400
They took takes Wide World of Sports

625
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
We want you to be the introduction for our next week she'll so just say hey I'm Dan Gable come watch me as I finish

626
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
We're undefeated 182 at all

627
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,944
That's what they want me to say everybody assume you be undefeated

628
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
How to take a 22 x

629
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
In the last

630
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
Two or three times that wrote it out

631
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
And I read it and it still wasn't

632
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
Like I just said it

633
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
Hi

634
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Dan Gable

635
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
,

636
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,656
If that type of stuff so it will be finally just close the book has a basket.

637
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,728
But I turned it was my time to Russell

638
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Until

639
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,824
You know you just you learn that

640
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
For me it was great coaching

641
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Experience

642
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
Cuz that's what I turned into be

643
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
You know

644
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
I coach for longer than I Russell

645
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Add

646
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,344
I put up a lot of Champions

647
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,136
But you learn

648
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,464
Through mistakes that even in your own career that you had made

649
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
You know it's it's it's an Ever learning process

650
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Saint ever learning process

651
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
Have you ever been afraid on the map

652
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
Does Fear have any role

653
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Do you think

654
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
For wrestler

655
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,824
Why must be a launcher fear is out there

656
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:12,224
And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time I'm sure my Olympic finals is really a

657
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
He had these doubts he probably had these doubts

658
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
And that gays gives me

659
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
The edge

660
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
And I don't know if I Really Ever

661
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Had fear

662
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
But

663
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,680
Obviously it was points and times where I didn't perform as well

664
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Not many but

665
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
A few

666
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,848
And if I look back of it look back at it I don't think it was that

667
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
American Inn Aurora Rasta

668
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
I think it was

669
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
Probably the fear of

670
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Not being an artist

671
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
As much maybe this guy might be better than me

672
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
Scientifically

673
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,536
And you know you're a scientist

674
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,608
I think that got to me more than anything else

675
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,936
I said early on that I want to eliminate

676
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
Ever having to worry about getting tired in a match

677
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:10,336
So I kind of eliminated that so I got rid of that point

678
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
And I do think that in wrestling

679
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
That is one of the fears

680
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
That a lot of wrestlers have

681
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,832
Actually how they feel during the mansion and

682
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,136
Do they get are they going to get tired

683
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,440
And is it going to affect my performance

684
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,816
As a coach that really was one of the things I tried to eliminate on all my athletes

685
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
So it was not Fear Factor

686
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
But that Fear Factor would be

687
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
Put upon my opponent

688
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Which would give me

689
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
An edge

690
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
But

691
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
That's not what I needed as much

692
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,920
I need to just focus make sure that I was doing the right things

693
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,760
And I need my team to be focused so I make sure that from my mistakes

694
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,856
As an athlete or even as a coach sometimes that I didn't repeat them

695
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
Getting repeated man

696
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
Do you make a mistake once if you can repeat it

697
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
It's like

698
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
You didn't learn anything

699
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:09,216
You are go throughout your wrestling career as you beautifully put what's the work so hard that you pass out on the mat

700
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
That you'll be carried off the map

701
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,664
So you never did successfully in that's one of the ways you failed in your careers you've never work so hard that you've

702
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Passed out

703
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:23,552
Have you ever come close do you remember a time you come close to even push to the limits

704
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,880
Exhaustion questions really a good question about

705
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
That

706
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,208
Pushing to you collapse

707
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,024
Because I don't have a coat today

708
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
Have I said that to my athletes

709
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,888
I don't know I could get in trouble

710
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,776
Because I understood isn't it by the athletes

711
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Yeah they understand it

712
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
But the outside might not understand it

713
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Because it's almost like

714
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
When you push him to the point where they go collapse I mean to him

715
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,440
And you know that's dangerous that's dangerous we can't have our kid in that

716
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
Type of atmosphere but

717
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,120
It's something that's highly unlikely that's going to happen but I'm going to Taylor's many times in a practice

718
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
What I pushed myself

719
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
To all of a sudden

720
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,520
The whistle blew or it was time to stop

721
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,104
And when I got up off the mat or whatever I was at

722
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
And I

723
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Needed water

724
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
I need

725
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
I needed fresh air

726
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
Cuz you're usually a fairly small room with a lot of guys

727
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
That the heat rises

728
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,648
And you cannot it's hard to breathe

729
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,560
And that I can remember and I stayed a lot of times not by the door at the far end of the room I can member walk

730
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,936
Walking from the far end of the room to that door and I can remember am I going to make it the next step

731
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,080
Am I going to make it to next step I need air I need water I need oxygen I need to get out of here

732
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,736
It didn't happen often but I can country count for five times in my career that I push myself to that level

733
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Where I thought I was going to maybe

734
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Go out

735
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
Every step I was dizzy

736
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
Once I got to that

737
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,464
The door I was able to open it and go out

738
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,536
Add water and gets cold water on my face and

739
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,352
Don't know I never really was able to do that

740
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,168
And I think the story is it in a book where my

741
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
My daughter

742
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,312
Push the collapse Molly made you proud

743
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Yeah no

744
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Did she

745
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Suffer because of that

746
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
Washington get to go to the next

747
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Event

748
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
Cuz you didn't she had to qualify but

749
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
I think it

750
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:40,256
Probably helped her to realize because she was winning the race and she was beating people she normally never pushed

751
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,352
But she was at a new level that she had never been before and she only needed about

752
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
Five feet finished

753
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
And it was just one of those things that

754
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:52,032
I bet there's a lot of learning that she did there and it probably

755
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
Need to realize that

756
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,384
She'll be better but she had to hold up though

757
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
So you mentioned in wrestling life

758
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
That the Brand's Brothers

759
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
Looked up to

760
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,648
Royce Alger who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling

761
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,696
But not getting too rough

762
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,792
So how do you find the line between extreme physical wrestling

763
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,144
But at the same time not rough wrestling or angry wrestling

764
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
So that line

765
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Between aggression top wrestling and

766
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
Anger

767
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
Letting anger

768
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Would cause

769
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
Less successful wrestling

770
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,224
I think anger would cause you to make mistakes

771
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,528
And actually get out of position

772
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Because I think

773
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
Anger is kind of a loss of control

774
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
And

775
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,024
There should be a furious type of

776
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Pack

777
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,448
But I think if I cross the line to anger

778
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Then you're going to be vulnerable

779
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
Install

780
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Royce

781
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
And the brands

782
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Wrestled

783
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
To the edge

784
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Through the edge

785
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
But when the whistle blow

786
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
They stop

787
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,184
And there's people that when the whistle blows they keep going

788
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
It's like in a football game

789
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,816
Fight breaks out in south of the whistles bulk

790
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
Well when the whistle blew

791
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
They they backed off

792
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
So that whistle

793
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Was

794
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,568
Something that in a match

795
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
That that

796
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Kind of

797
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Gave them the boundaries

798
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
But perhaps give you a little bit of fuel

799
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,368
Don't arresting tough the book that you just got for Mike Chapman now the new edition

800
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,696
Talks about Bill Cole undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler

801
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
And

802
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,376
How he talked about how my strength speed and abilities thinkware increased tremendously

803
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
By just sitting apart from the action prior to the match

804
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,776
And getting into a state of controlled anger

805
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
So

806
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Can anger rolling control

807
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,944
So anger could be fuel as long as it's controlled

808
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
Right exactly

809
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
You had that line

810
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
One side of the line you can have an anger

811
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,904
Poor performance in the other side of the line

812
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
You

813
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,024
If you go beyond that it's not going to be for performance going to be for

814
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,584
Not performance cuz you going to lose points

815
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,400
It's a fine line there's definitely a fine line

816
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:32,032
You're talking about Royce Alger you're talkin about Tom Brands you're talkin about Terry brands

817
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,408
I mean that world championship titles are you got Olympic Championship Tyler you got to World silver medalist in

818
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Anna

819
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,736
In & Royce Alger

820
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,552
And that's what I

821
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
Talk to him about the world silver medalist

822
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
He's haunted by that

823
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
Cuz he was actually 20 seconds

824
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
Away from winning

825
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,328
When he got beat in the end therefore that's part of the game

826
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
And

827
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
It's

828
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:03,776
I don't know whether he's okay with it or not cuz he says after talking about things he goes

829
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,824
I'm okay with it now

830
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
But then he keeps talking about it

831
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,456
So I don't really think he's okay with it

832
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,064
Actually make amends

833
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
John South

834
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
When you really don't do it

835
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:24,768
I mean it's no matter what the situation even with the Owens loss

836
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Yeah

837
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,120
It still eats world champion

838
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
And he wanted to be

839
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm Olympic champion he's not who you wanted to be the greatest coaches of all time

840
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
It also Heat

841
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
You know it's like

842
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
Why do I keep going back to it

843
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,552
Because you're not you don't get over those things

844
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
It's a royce really keeps going back to it

845
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,160
Even though he says he's fine and

846
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
But then he realizes he's really not fine

847
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:01,632
Because that's just the nature of the game and that's why he was able to win national titles in and make world

848
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,680
Games and stuff like that

849
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:09,312
Even what's interesting about him and he's analyzed all the people that he's Russell

850
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,640
And a lot of men have one world and Olympic championships

851
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
And he's beaten every one of them

852
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:20,320
At one time or another and he didn't get to that world championship gold living cold

853
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Add

854
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
He says it because

855
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,976
They did it so he's he's showing people

856
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
That

857
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
I beaten those guys

858
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
But

859
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
Apparently didn't beat him at the right time

860
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Add

861
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
So it's still hunting

862
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
You don't get away from that stuff

863
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
I mean it's just like

864
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Anything in life that's

865
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Really high

866
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
I mean it doesn't have to be Athletics

867
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,784
I mean you think I'm ever going to get over

868
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
The murder my sister

869
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,368
And you might not even know that

870
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,464
Let me pause for second please you've talked about it you've written about it

871
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,560
So I hope it's okay for me to say that your sister your older sister

872
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,144
On May 31st 1964

873
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
Was

874
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
Raped and murdered by local boy

875
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:14,592
So The Echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day

876
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
Today Ripple through your life still

877
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,736
Do your resting. Coaching through your

878
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,040
The way you when you wake up in the morning

879
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
What is that like

880
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
If you can be very emotional to me

881
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
Under certain circumstance

882
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
And

883
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
The mood I'm in

884
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
You know it can be

885
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
Maybe if I've had a Mountain Dew or or maybe if I've had a Gable beer

886
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,224
Or maybe you could turn the country music up a little bit loud

887
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
Emotions come out

888
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
And everybody has them

889
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
In their life

890
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
It's just so happens

891
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,352
You know what brings it out and hopefully it's nothing that you do to the extreme point of

892
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,168
Brings it out for me it's not extreme

893
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,240
I don't have to have any of that really I can get emotional

894
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,800
How did that changes a man

895
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,944
What it did was realize that I was already

896
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
Pretty well-developed

897
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
Because I was only a sophomore

898
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
15 years old in high school

899
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
And

900
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
I had Parents

901
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,280
That weren't making it and my parents are a lot older than me

902
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,864
And now that we're down just a me and my parents

903
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,192
And I'm going to be around the house for another two years

904
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,568
And they just lost a daughter that the only the only other

905
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Sibling

906
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
They were handling it

907
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
They they were the ones that were

908
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,551
Suffering much more than me

909
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Even though

910
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
I always

911
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:09,535
Look back upon one area that I wasn't good at was communication at that time except inside the resin room

912
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,583
Cuz I've been tipped off

913
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
And tipped off what do you mean

914
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
Well they really said that

915
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
Something to me about my sister

916
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,311
Just Cause 3 weeks before that that really

917
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
Wasn't

918
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,895
Normal or practical

919
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,711
And I said nothing to nobody

920
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
You don't

921
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,319
Is there a part of you that blames yourself

922
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Yeah

923
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Absolutely

924
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,951
Absolutely

925
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
But I'm 15 years old

926
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
And

927
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
You make mistakes

928
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,703
And you don't really act on everything that happens in your life

929
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,799
But I can tell you how it affected me if I acted a lot on

930
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,639
Anything that maybe wasn't even of that consequence

931
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:02,783
I mean cuz I had four daughters and I'm telling you when they left every time to go somewhere in a car or go out with some place

932
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
I always said something to him

933
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
And they always say Dad you said that last night

934
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Care

935
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,511
What like I love you or like

936
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:18,911
You driving and drinking her or don't be in a car with somebody that you know of

937
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
Of the same nature

938
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Or

939
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
You know stay out of trouble y'all don't go be somewhere where you you know you have I said you know how to get out of a car if you

940
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,199
Car goes into the river

941
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,991
Thinking ahead a little bit

942
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
Just in case of something

943
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Did happen

944
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,903
And I goes back to that goes back to that walk to school with that

945
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
With that young man that when he was talking to me and I just

946
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,303
I took it and I kept it inside me and

947
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
Once I found out she had been murdered

948
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
It took me maybe

949
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,727
25 to 30 minutes

950
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
I told my dad I think

951
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
I know who killed her

952
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
He looked at me and he just like

953
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
Slappy actually

954
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:09,599
Push me against a car Aiden slimy push me to start my mom slaps me she was going to slap me around little bit but my dad

955
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Kia

956
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,207
He he pushed me against something about this

957
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
I don't

958
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
For sure but

959
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,583
And I would probably all crying

960
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
But

961
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,655
And I don't like. If I was crying yet

962
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
Have you tried a lot of Tears since but

963
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
But

964
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
You know I just said

965
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Hey

966
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
I was walking to school

967
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
With his neighbor

968
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,431
I never had walk to school with him before

969
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,503
And he was kind of a troubled kid

970
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,063
And he said something about Diane

971
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,879
And it wasn't good

972
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
But I

973
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
I can Ingles why did you say something

974
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,631
Hi Daddy I just boy talk you though so you don't hug me hug me hug me

975
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
And

976
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,215
You know it was one of these things that

977
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
It's definitely made me

978
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
A lot of who I am

979
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:07,967
Because there's been a lot of choices and I don't I took the word choice out of my life

980
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:14,623
And I just like to say I could do the right thing do the thing that's so you should do and so I don't realize it's like

981
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
We going to do this or that

982
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
Well what do you mean which one is better

983
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,511
Halo I don't have that choice

984
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,559
Just give me the right way to go

985
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
And so

986
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,679
Perfect by any means but it's made a big difference in my life

987
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
Oh and how I

988
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,287
I handle my life is probably

989
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:37,663
Give me the opportunity to be married for 44 years it's just giving me opportunities

990
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,223
Do I'll be better in my life and

991
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,527
And I you know I I want to thank a

992
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,831
My sister for that you know it's so

993
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
And I think my family was ready to

994
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
Make a split

995
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
Because of that incident

996
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,559
They're blaming each other and I think that

997
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:02,239
I was able to help but more than that they really like each other but they didn't really know it at the time

998
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
Until I got out of

999
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
The House 2 years later

1000
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:10,175
It probably was going on for a couple years until I moved on and went to college

1001
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,223
Then they found out they really like each other

1002
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
When they were alone

1003
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,879
And it worked out pretty good but I think them being able to follow me

1004
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
Not just true

1005
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,999
Collagen Olympics and world

1006
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
But my coaching

1007
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,863
So it's the same the same success and Factor

1008
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,727
You know the excitement and and all those things gave them a real purpose

1009
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
And I

1010
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,079
I gave my four daughters they gave my wife

1011
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,919
Real purpose to be able to be close to

1012
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,735
Ollie's champions in championships in

1013
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:49,087
And it and now it's because now it's like is a family of 22

1014
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
And they're all interested in what

1015
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,207
What Richardson in and it's going good knock on wood but

1016
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,839
You know it's something that when all of a sudden you got too much time on your hands and you're not doing the competition much

1017
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
That thing's probably

1018
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
He'll get off get off track

1019
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:09,311
What do you think is the role of family in wrestling can a man do it alone and if not

1020
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,383
Where is family most important

1021
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
You know you can do it alone

1022
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,759
The why would you want to

1023
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
Yeah

1024
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:23,391
I think the chances of do it alone or much less in the chances of doing it together

1025
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,023
I know they say don't bring your profession home sometimes I say that

1026
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,911
I never got away from my profession and an awesome time

1027
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
It's like my house right here

1028
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
So when I'm moving home

1029
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
I'm not going to have an office

1030
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:47,711
Cuz I'm not going to coach anymore or I'm not going to be an assistant athletic director for a while

1031
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
That

1032
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
Got to do something that

1033
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:59,743
Gives you a little bit of a break not Eunice La maybe the person you're living with

1034
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:04,607
And so I don't know if you looked outside their I got a cabin right on the backyard probably can't see it right there but

1035
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
What's in the cabin

1036
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
That's my

1037
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,471
House away from my house it's only

1038
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
30 ft from my house

1039
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:17,407
And it's my office and it's my workout room it's like I got a son of there it's a bed upstairs

1040
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
If I needed

1041
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,575
If I ever get too close and she says hey what you go sleep in the other house

1042
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,879
Get the heck never happened but

1043
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,927
I do spend a lot of time out there

1044
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,951
Anda

1045
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
It's up

1046
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
A little distant sometimes

1047
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,095
You got to know you're better know your role

1048
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
And so all the sudden you're a guy that's been gone your whole life from 8 in the morning till close to 7:30 or 8

1049
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
Goodnites 11 12 hours a day

1050
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
Then all of a sudden you're not gone as much

1051
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,175
Even though you still weren't she trying to slow me down now I'm doing the

1052
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:54,527
Not so much like hear what we're doing right now but when I get in the car and drive somewhere

1053
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,391
Are flies somewhere like just last night I just went to bed and I hadn't told her that

1054
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,695
This guy called me and he wants me to

1055
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,743
Speak for a

1056
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,303
You want to build a Nook wrestling wants to

1057
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,631
Start another wrestlers in business networking out end up

1058
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:14,495
Delaware because we don't have any colleges in wrestling in Delaware

1059
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,335
So I see that's my life

1060
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
So

1061
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:24,223
But then all of a sudden I didn't send you my wife until all the sudden this morning

1062
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:28,319
And I told her that I might go on the Friday the 21st of December

1063
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Oh no

1064
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,415
Well that well I said that's not this Christmas she goes

1065
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:39,327
Celebrating Christmas that weekend early because a lot of the family can't be on be here except for that we

1066
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Weekend

1067
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
And I said oh well that's not going to work

1068
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,495
But I kind of didn't say anything to her first and then

1069
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,567
Well I tell you she started getting all emotional

1070
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,663
And if I want to stay married for another year 45 years

1071
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
Now you better

1072
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
Tell those people that

1073
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,319
I got family obligations

1074
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
Because

1075
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,487
That depends what's most important I love wrestling I love wrestling

1076
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,887
And I want to start another one for help start another wrestlers in business network but there's more than one day out there

1077
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,727
But there's there's a lot of people that are

1078
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
Maybe even closer

1079
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:26,175
And they got big names I mean work we're doing pretty well right now you got first 2 years ago

1080
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
And we got

1081
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
Second this year

1082
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,575
And then we got the women's freestyles doing good in wrestling

1083
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,879
We got to work a little bit are Greco yet

1084
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
But

1085
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
But they are working on it

1086
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,999
Are men's freestyle team right now

1087
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
AR

1088
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Par excellence

1089
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,959
Looking for them is to get them all on the same page

1090
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,751
Instead of

1091
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
Just

1092
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,591
Have new highlights by that I'm saying

1093
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,479
Who let you look and see who won this year will the three guys that have never won before one this year we have three world champions

1094
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,039
Rdr2 past world champions

1095
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Didn't win this year

1096
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
I mean

1097
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,415
Is it okay you know I got metals

1098
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,231
The debit debarros win no he did not

1099
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
You got third

1100
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,839
Oh that's right you got bronze yet I mean

1101
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,887
Schneider got second so

1102
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,679
Those two are men guys

1103
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
He also

1104
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,751
The three guys that came through

1105
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
We're guys it hadn't won

1106
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
World gold

1107
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,383
Vacuum have never made a world team before

1108
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,199
And so we have three world champions this year

1109
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,271
But we needed all five of them to come through to win the

1110
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
The Championships

1111
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
And so the key really is

1112
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
Get them all to do the same at the same time

1113
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
Year-in and year-out

1114
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,535
And not just based on

1115
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:49,119
Okay girls got beat this year so he'll win next year

1116
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,983
It's got to be every year if you're capable of doing that and that's what the coaching staff has to do

1117
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,031
It's kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence

1118
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,407
Actually on the coaching stats right now at the USA level because of the women's freestyle got

1119
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
Guy is up

1120
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,271
Is Terry Steiner and he Russell for memes a national champion

1121
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,599
Got a twin brother that's at Fresno State

1122
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,695
And then Billy's attic is the freestyle coach

1123
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,255
And hear us over the Hawkeyes back in

1124
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,839
The early days and now he was a national champion so

1125
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
We got a lotta

1126
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,727
A former Google influence on their butt

1127
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,359
In 2013 the international Olympic Committee ioc voted wrestling out of the Olympics

1128
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
So

1129
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:36,223
A lot of folks know about this the absurdity of it

1130
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
So on

1131
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:43,391
Butts in a big picture you can step back now is five years later what did you learn from that experience

1132
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,183
First of all

1133
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
Did it surprise me

1134
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,535
Yeah

1135
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,375
Did it really surprised me know

1136
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,727
You got to run you got to have

1137
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,263
People running

1138
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
The organization

1139
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Better

1140
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
Top notch

1141
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,711
If you take anything for granted

1142
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,783
And you're not the person of authority

1143
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Somebody can

1144
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,111
Kick you out

1145
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
And even though

1146
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:20,767
We had a lot of authority because we're wrestling where the one of the first sports to know

1147
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Olympics

1148
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Ever

1149
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
And that we

1150
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
Think that

1151
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,215
You know where and 180 some countries

1152
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
And

1153
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,031
Some of the

1154
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,311
Number one

1155
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,359
Countries in the world

1156
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
That are politically strong

1157
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
Have the sport

1158
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,551
You know we thought we were okay but then you got to look and see who's running the ioc

1159
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415
The international Olympic Committee

1160
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,231
Then you got to see that

1161
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,303
In wrestling we don't have any money in there

1162
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,095
I'm not shocked me

1163
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,655
We never had anybody

1164
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
On the ioc

1165
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
From wrestling

1166
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,983
You know why

1167
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,031
Because we didn't have to

1168
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,103
But yes that's wrong

1169
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
You have to

1170
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,687
And if you don't

1171
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,527
Have somebody looking out for you right within the structure

1172
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,111
That is pretty easy people turn their head

1173
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
But

1174
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,415
All it took

1175
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Was

1176
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,255
Statement

1177
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
You guys are kicked out of the Olympics

1178
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:31,935
You guys are done every came together I think it's the first time in ever in history

1179
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,263
That probably all this cup compared to people

1180
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,335
That we're working for their own agenda

1181
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,151
Turn that agenda

1182
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
To the sport

1183
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
So that made a big difference

1184
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,063
And we got a lot done in fact

1185
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,111
In America

1186
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
There was several people

1187
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
That were

1188
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Really

1189
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,791
Out there that we didn't know about

1190
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
Until this point in time

1191
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,375
And when they came aboard

1192
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,935
Now they're still aboard

1193
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,519
That doesn't mean we're doing everything perfect

1194
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,359
Because just because we got voted back in before we even got kicked out really

1195
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,151
That doesn't mean work

1196
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
By any means safe

1197
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,831
We got to do some of the things that I'm talking about or the some of the things that we didn't do before

1198
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,647
We can't fall right back into the same mess

1199
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
It's hard leadership got changed

1200
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
And it's

1201
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
Better

1202
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
But it's got to stay better

1203
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,607
But there are things

1204
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
That we could still be

1205
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,447
Doing to make sure that

1206
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,471
We don't

1207
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,519
Have situations like this

1208
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,567
Happened when I first learned about it

1209
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
I was like

1210
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,895
I broke down and wept

1211
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Again

1212
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,479
It's like every once in awhile I'll break down and

1213
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,271
And I'm cry about

1214
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
My sister

1215
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
Or I'll break down

1216
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,439
I don't know if I cry about losing the wings but

1217
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
I thought we get more determined

1218
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
But that's kind of

1219
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,655
You have to go back at it and think about those moments when you heard what I heard that moment and I

1220
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,239
It just

1221
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,823
Overcame me was like 4 or 4:30 in the morning

1222
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:19,967
When I heard about it and my wife had been up been up looking at the internet and see if she woke me up I thought you were joking

1223
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:24,063
But I jumped out of bed really quick when she said that I know she was serious

1224
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,391
Making phone calls right there

1225
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,999
To find out if it was true in my phone I was truly. Was just like devastating

1226
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
He.

1227
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,327
Yeah it was one of these things that

1228
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
It's a nightmare

1229
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
And

1230
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,215
Don't let it happen again

1231
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
I said it's that simple

1232
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,079
Yeah and you keep getting stronger

1233
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:52,735
And people haven't read they should read the loss of Dan Gable by Wright Thompson the ESPN article that kind of

1234
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,527
In this very beautiful poetic way

1235
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,575
Ties together

1236
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:04,255
Are all the losses of Dan Gable the losing your sister losing to Larry always losing

1237
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,583
Wrestling from the Olympics all of these tragedies

1238
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
Various forms

1239
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
So

1240
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:17,311
So that's the ioc is politics and your serve being very pragmatic

1241
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:22,175
Stepping back wrestling is one of the oldest forms of combat.

1242
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:25,759
Dating back does cave drawings 15000 years ago

1243
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,783
If you look at

1244
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,135
The Olympics 27 years ago

1245
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:35,487
Did you ever when you wrestled a coach do you know

1246
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:41,119
See wrestling in this way freestyle and folkstyle wrestling the purity of

1247
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:47,519
There's two human beings locked in combat the the roots of that that's just human beings

1248
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,359
Fair struggle between two men or two women

1249
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
I don't think I ever

1250
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,943
Looked at it

1251
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,783
As anything but just

1252
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
A combat

1253
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
And

1254
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
I think there's times

1255
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
That have made me

1256
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,535
Figure out how to make that combat better

1257
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,839
There's little

1258
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,375
Markers

1259
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,447
Are little points and time in your life

1260
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,239
That make you

1261
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,103
Wonder AR should say determined

1262
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,967
To be able to get more out of yourself

1263
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,039
And to be able to take it to a new level

1264
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,343
I don't think people can actually

1265
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:38,719
Feel that way unless you actually had a lot of accomplishments in anything

1266
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,511
I think there's anything out there

1267
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,351
I mean no matter what sport are or breaking the 4-minute mile

1268
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,631
I mean when you broke that

1269
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,703
Roger Bannister

1270
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,263
I can imagine in breaking it from

1271
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,567
Is best time being 4:30

1272
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,127
You know it's one of these things that

1273
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,175
Along the line there

1274
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Daddy did

1275
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,015
Had some close calls

1276
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
Or

1277
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:08,159
He had some coaching that was giving him the opportunity become a little better

1278
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,695
But I think because

1279
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,535
Was doing well and being very successful

1280
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,423
That the opportunity came and saucer me it's like the same thing I had so much

1281
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
Success

1282
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,287
And so many practices

1283
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
That went well

1284
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
And so much

1285
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,431
Goodness out of this sport

1286
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
That it

1287
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,271
Gave me the opportunity

1288
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
To really

1289
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,599
Look more

1290
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,623
Finite

1291
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,183
And look more how I could even make it better

1292
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,207
And so it's like

1293
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,815
If you look at my library upstairs I got a library upstairs

1294
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,399
And there's a lot of books up there

1295
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
From the family and

1296
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,263
But if you look Gable books up there

1297
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
I got a lot of

1298
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,895
Russian technique books

1299
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,687
I can't read

1300
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,455
The book

1301
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,015
But I can see the diagrams

1302
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,831
And I can see the figures

1303
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
They don't really show it in pictures

1304
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
They do it in drawings

1305
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
And

1306
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:19,839
And so it's like when I was trying to beat the best that as

1307
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,143
Label the best because

1308
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:27,007
They won the World Championships every year since they been just about involved

1309
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:30,079
I don't think they got started involved you like the 50's but

1310
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,871
But you know it's

1311
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,711
Something you know you study the best

1312
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,735
Who's out there

1313
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
But then you

1314
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:42,367
Don't Focus so much on the best that you can't beat the best

1315
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,415
You learn from them

1316
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,231
But there's something that they don't have

1317
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
That you can have

1318
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
Toughness to technique to the Arts to the science

1319
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
Do you when you're sitting over there you love MIT

1320
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:05,407
And you're bragging about it over Harvard you know it's cuz it's true

1321
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,479
Verizon internet

1322
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,039
But but it's the same type of thing

1323
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
That

1324
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:16,415
Yeah there's something that you're probably stealing from Harvard that but

1325
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
Do you want give them credit

1326
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Well then

1327
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
In the interest of time

1328
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,351
I've read that you're pretty serious

1329
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,119
Your

1330
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,911
Pretty serious into fishing

1331
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,959
So what's the biggest fish ever caught

1332
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,103
Are we talking about here I wait you talk about

1333
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,919
I don't think I've ever caught

1334
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:42,783
How big ocean fish, River Lake Ray Sherman

1335
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,831
Child problem

1336
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
Probably Northern

1337
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,183
I probably caught in Northern Italy

1338
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,719
27 pounds

1339
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,815
Official like to catch walleyes

1340
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,911
And that's the reason why I like to catch him cuz they're really good eating fish

1341
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,727
And the best eating fish and not the real big ones

1342
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:07,871
I know it's got you kind of interesting that I got people hunting deer right on my land and

1343
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:13,503
They're looking for the big bucks but they're not the best either see if you want if you want to eat but they're the best trophy

1344
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:17,087
So you know I do have a couple trophy walleyes on the wall but

1345
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,367
But

1346
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,951
Most time I throw the big ones back and put them back in there so

1347
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:26,047
I love you know there's a book by Hemingway called old man in the sea

1348
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
Atrovent and

1349
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,911
Ernest Hemingway Ernest Hemingway

1350
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:37,311
And he said there's an old man that basically catches an 18-footer but it's can't pull it in.

1351
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,359
Have the strength so they together spend

1352
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,407
Iwata sharks eat away at it

1353
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:45,503
Miss is very powerful story I think one of the Nobel Prize but

1354
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
He says it's better to be lucky

1355
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,111
Dogman says better be lucky

1356
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,927
But I would rather be exact than that

1357
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,743
That way when luck comes you are ready

1358
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,607
What do you think about luck

1359
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Do you believe

1360
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,447
And Free Will that we have actions

1361
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,007
The control the direction destination of our life

1362
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,543
What does luck

1363
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,591
And some other outside forces

1364
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
Really

1365
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,175
Land you where you end up

1366
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
For me

1367
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,247
I'm not about luck

1368
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,807
But I do think there is

1369
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,855
Luck is involved

1370
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,159
But I think it's mostly created

1371
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,719
Just how lucky you are

1372
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
Do preparations

1373
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,071
And things have things have happened in my life

1374
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,351
Forever

1375
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,167
A lot of good things

1376
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,263
A lot of people could say hey you've been pretty lucky to win all these Awards

1377
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,335
I don't know if you analyze

1378
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
My life

1379
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:49,247
I don't think it was involved with luck you know I think it was more involved with preparation

1380
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,551
And you don't and again science

1381
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:56,927
Had you been smarter had you understood that you could do some things

1382
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,743
And be just as lucky that be great but

1383
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,559
I'm only as smart as today

1384
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,423
So when I was training in my life and maybe even training people

1385
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
In my life

1386
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:14,079
As of that moment that's how lucky I am to be able to

1387
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,151
Have whatever is available to me

1388
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,735
And that's what you call that a lot of science so for me I

1389
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,855
I think that you don't like right now if I look back I got to do a Lot of Things Different

1390
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,647
Just because

1391
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,183
Things are proven

1392
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
Differently like I

1393
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,047
Give people water coming practice and I did

1394
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:39,679
And I would let them change their running wrestling shoes into running shoes to run sprints on the country

1395
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,007
Or I would actually maybe

1396
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:47,359
Maybe I've had a guy climb 12 ropes after practice one after another

1397
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,407
And then maybe the next day I'd do it again

1398
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,991
I might not make him do it the next day

1399
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,039
Lane recover little bit more

1400
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
And

1401
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:00,927
You got to learn keep adding to your philosophy

1402
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,535
And your father may have been great at that time but it's at that time

1403
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,607
And what is really important is where you at

1404
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655
With this time today

1405
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,471
And so there's better ways to do things

1406
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
Now you'd be ever take attitude out of it

1407
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,823
And just depend on

1408
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,359
Total science

1409
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,199
Then you know you're not going to be as high as

1410
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:28,319
And I think it's a listen to a couple people that are really pretty famous people

1411
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:32,927
You want a massage on Irving he was a writer and

1412
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
He told me so you think I really

1413
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,303
Learn how to be a great writer

1414
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,327
Henna

1415
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
Writing School

1416
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
Ice ice

1417
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,495
Yeah I learned a lot there

1418
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,799
But really what gave me

1419
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,335
The ability

1420
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,639
Stay focused

1421
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:59,039
Just to work extra hours to be more discipline was wrestling practices

1422
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:03,647
He was a wrestler go back to that that's what gave me that chance

1423
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,975
You know it and there's a guy and I will that

1424
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,791
Guy named Norman Borlaug

1425
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
Kia

1426
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,119
Eevee learn

1427
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,679
He invented a process to feed

1428
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,727
The underprivileged countries

1429
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,519
Of the world

1430
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
And

1431
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:26,175
He was a wrestler and he said the same thing and eat any worth extremely hard

1432
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,455
And he said

1433
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,759
I give a lot of credit to the sport of wrestling

1434
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:36,159
And even though I was I'm known for this I got a statue in in Washington DC because I

1435
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,207
I saved a Billion Lives Plus

1436
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,023
I'm going to get wrestling a lot of credit

1437
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
Self

1438
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,559
And I think

1439
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
Some of these

1440
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
MMA Stars

1441
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
And some of these guys that

1442
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:53,311
Maybe warrant wrestlers that had to Russell Russell had to fight wrestling guys

1443
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:59,711
And stuff missed a little bit there but I ain't the ones that did have wrestling probably have a really good chance in Canada

1444
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,735
Adapted the other ones

1445
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,783
But I think they are every

1446
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,343
Martial art or every activities

1447
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,415
Good and you probably can't skip any but I don't think they're ever going to

1448
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:14,047
Overlook and say that rustling pretty nights are not valuable because

1449
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
It is

1450
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:20,191
However that doesn't mean you're going to make it you still got to take the values and apply it

1451
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,007
Whatever area you're going to be in it

1452
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,543
And some people forget that

1453
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
Some people can't get over

1454
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,967
The highness of getting your arm raised in a wrestling match

1455
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,039
And you know what what's even greater than

1456
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,343
Me getting my arm raised

1457
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,719
Is that if I'm a cold sore virus along with you that you get your arm raised in

1458
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,303
And even if you don't get your arm raises what you walk away with

1459
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,607
And how and how you will learn

1460
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,887
2

1461
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,959
Adalat as well because there's going to be some losses

1462
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,239
But you don't want many

1463
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,823
Just so you don't get used to losing I can tell you that

1464
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:04,223
Sister Hunger for the win it's the Brotherhood The Sisterhood of the resting room and hard work and science

1465
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,503
That's going to be luck

1466
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,783
At the end of the day

1467
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,087
Absolute luck you know

1468
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:15,999
I like luck but I think it's created by the opportunity then that you make your luck

1469
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,279
If you make your luck yet

1470
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
Then

1471
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:24,191
Is a huge honor thank you for welcoming me into your home if I have his conversation no problem good man

1472
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:30,847
Be true to go to the mall in this potato and do the other things not because they are easy

1473
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:37,247
But because they are hard
