1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:13,312
Buckle Conway AR

3
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,760
Today I'm talking with Ryan Hall

4
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,112
Heading structure 50/50 Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in Falls Church Virginia

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,184
ADCC bronze medalist

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,488
With a long career high level competition

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
Throughout which

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,584
He is beating many of the top golfers in the world

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
Is Jiu-Jitsu black belt

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
MMA fighter

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,264
The creator of several popular and well-respected instructional dvds

12
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
And

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
He's a popular voice of reason

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
And did you get the community

15
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,200
Where is Google Now

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272
And I took a class yesterday

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
You give a speech

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
About the

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,184
Value of keeping a stoic expression

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
No matter how difficult things get

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Explain that principle

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,400
Absolutely I think obviously at you know things that we

23
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
And it was thinking internally you know are expressed outwardly and all in the way that we act in the way we feel in the way again on the

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
Smiling and feeling happy

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,696
Angry she kind of face you know not only am I

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Showing what that whatever my opponent or the other guy his doing is bothering me which is certainly,

27
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
For anybody that's kind of tough

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
I'm also telling myself that I'm concerned and whatnot so it's no different than if somebody hit you really hard in the face just stare

29
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,896
Nothing happened that's irrelevant

30
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
I'm all that matters is that you're not going to show

31
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
Can you watch Jerry Rice score a touchdown

32
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,488
Take some ball headed to the referee and kind

33
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,560
Watch out cuz I think he has a feeling he'll be back in there later today

34
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
What's he drops a passenger he's frustrated but he doesn't throw a tantrum

35
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,032
Because it's not going to contribute positively towards catching the ball in anyway

36
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,384
And if anything is going to show the opposition that he's getting frustrated that they can get to him

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,528
So I think it is very very important regardless of you know the situation to again and try to keep your emotions in check

38
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
They take you out to develop

39
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Again in of course she and you can

40
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,912
Anyone can be frustrated anyone can be happy to be several people we all have emotions and what not butter

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Basically you know. The more you can train yourself to master that the better because people

42
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
Pretty tops with you say it a little bit flustered

43
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,200
And they become less so and everyone is is subject to that

44
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
So in the same way that we trained technique can we train you know conditioning and we try and try and we try and everything else we should be training on

45
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,440
Has Walter try to respond in as much as we control the fashion as possible

46
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
You talked about moral victory

47
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,072
Can you explain how your morality contributes to

48
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Do AC

49
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
The value of winning

50
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,728
I think there's absolutely

51
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
They are trying to manipulate you or trying to get you to buy something

52
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Differently in two directions

53
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Can you compete against

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
A real black hole

55
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
And you compete against

56
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Is almost zero

57
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,304
However if you go out there and you try hard

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
Whether you come off the mat

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
To be very fortunate unlikely but

60
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,568
If you want answering you tried and you again I'll let you had some nerves but

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Captainshack

62
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
Can you fart hard you didn't like it

63
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
The better of you

64
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
You know that would be in my opinion a moral

65
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
Will be nothing wrong for recognizing

66
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Shots now that's not the same thing

67
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Is an actual physical victory

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
But there's nothing wrong with saying what's a

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
Your your opponents 260000 you're a hundred and twenty

70
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
And you tie

71
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
They get the decision

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
Hey you know that happened in the world

73
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
2008

74
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
Bellator super heavyweight

75
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
Generally speaking if you end up

76
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Level

77
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Considering that I have all the resources you don't

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
Make sure that I'm not shooting

79
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
I'm shooting for the actual

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
But every now and then

81
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935
It's very important to keep in mind that you know I might just asking myself and my conduct myself in a way

82
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
That I respect that hopefully other people of value or respect

83
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
And also a way that I believe is going to produce

84
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
Actual Victory and actual positive results in a long run

85
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
I think it's important to recognize that

86
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,527
Because sometimes you'll see people get very frustrated let's say Frances if I

87
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Box against people that have much more experience than me all the

88
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
Anyone that tells you differently

89
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,511
Has is either not training with people that are very good or B

90
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
They have no idea what they're talking

91
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
But

92
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
What I can say is hey did I do a little bit better today

93
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,335
More able to kind of keep my keep my focus and see what I wanted execute

94
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:41,503
I'm moving in the right direction so as far as I'm concerned is all sorts of different types of moral Victory but it will be there

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
The same thing as you know that's a princess

96
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
You know your mother

97
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
You got ahead of me

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
You have to

99
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
He's going to kick the s*** out of you almost certain

100
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Have to hit him

101
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
It would not be it would be

102
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
I didn't get hurt so that's a win if you ran away

103
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
But that would be the opposite of the moral Victory and

104
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,775
Losing would still be I would say the honorable thing to do

105
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,847
So you're saying sometimes you have to pay the price for them all the time

106
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,919
Absolutely but the reality is is the martial arts a dozen

107
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,551
Just teaches about how to beat someone offer technique of this is that that's really not the core of the martial arts Decor the martial arts

108
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
Heart discipline dedication Focus

109
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,415
And if you have those things

110
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
Better than you

111
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,559
But that's not the only metric by which you can judge performance or judge a person

112
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
You competed more than

113
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Many of the elite level guys

114
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Some

115
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
And you

116
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Competition

117
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
What do you think is the value of competition for martial artists

118
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,759
I believe that the value of competition is and that it teaches you the true

119
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Purpose of

120
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,647
Martial arts

121
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
Yes because you'll SAU 180cc gold medal

122
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
But

123
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,423
By someone bigger and stronger YouTube

124
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
Free Halo that wouldn't be no that's not what we're looking for but

125
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Competition develops

126
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,943
Is proper Focus proper dedication

127
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
And strong opposition it will force YouTube

128
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
The better your opposition is if you focus and you take your what you're doing serious is the better you become

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
. people are better Restless today than they once were people live better

130
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,047
Basketball players today than once were military is better now than it was in the past

131
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Because of all of the competition

132
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
That you know that is existed over the course of time

133
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
And you know it's just kind of

134
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543
Bullshitted if you like

135
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
Looks like that's a cowardly way to approach

136
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
That doesn't teach you

137
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,759
To really do the right things in the sanlitun not-for-profit not properly preparing

138
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
That was a cowardly way to approach

139
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Did you intentionally left yourself an hour

140
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Which was

141
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
If I win and if I lose it

142
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:02,303
Well you know I mean then you should have been out there

143
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,703
Win Lose or Draw

144
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
I'm going to go and if they go I will send them off

145
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
My gym and that's not how we conduct ourselves

146
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
And it has

147
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Weigh less to do about this

148
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
The physical you know the result

149
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
But the proper preparation

150
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
Proper preparation and proper focus and dedication

151
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:33,791
Positive results but most importantly it's about are we conducting ourselves

152
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
So I believe that the competition really teaches us

153
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,519
In the room you know there's always like

154
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
Thing when you go to competition

155
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
Everyone is nuts on everyone is on the

156
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
That day because everyone is trained for that specific moment end

157
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
We'll see what happens

158
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,295
So you get the most out of it

159
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
Cats in renal provided that there's not a lot of cheating

160
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Which unfortunately

161
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
Pictures of composition

162
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
Jiu Jitsu competition

163
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
But regardless you know from an athletic

164
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Performance perspective is the most honest

165
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
Because

166
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,495
Courage and take some heart to really properly prepare

167
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
And put it online because you're risking

168
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Horrible disappointment

169
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,663
I prepared so hard before I try so hard and I won

170
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
Prepared

171
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Failed it hurts

172
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,575
I really hurt

173
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
Because you can put that much into it again that's how a coward approaches

174
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
If you have

175
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
Prepare properly

176
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
The results and that's what I believe is the real benefit

177
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Competition of approach

178
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Do you admire

179
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Somebody

180
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Who sacrifices you know like 10-20 years

181
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Their life

182
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
That singular pursuit of competition

183
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
Towards a gold medal at the Olympics

184
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
Almost to the Olympians do

185
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
Absolutely

186
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Sacrificing willing to work hard in any

187
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,207
Area of life I should book that I'm reading again that I really like is a dune

188
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
It's

189
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
Basically

190
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
You know one of the things

191
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
That

192
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Either one of the

193
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Preeminent

194
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
If you

195
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759
If you search for Freedom you actually end up becoming a slave to your own desire

196
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Ironically

197
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
And if you search for discipline

198
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Define liberty

199
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,927
Because you're able to make yourself do what you want

200
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
In the long run where is it

201
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,727
Getting into a bunch of nonsense but anyone that's doesn't mean that it's

202
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
In any area of human endeavor

203
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
But as long as you're making it

204
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
Incredibly large amount of respect

205
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,879
The level of dedication that end the level of commitment

206
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Risk that it that you're taking

207
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Emotionally psychologically

208
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
Like I said you work 20 years you get that gold medal

209
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
But there's other people that work 20 years

210
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
I got the silver

211
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
I cannot like Siri in class the other day

212
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,335
I don't want to be too negative

213
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Do you know that if you're working hard enough

214
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
I think you know

215
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
But most people are not very honest

216
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:38,367
Themselves they won't like most people would press a button in my experience

217
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Look like

218
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
The thing then

219
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
That's it that's fine but

220
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
Hey it really

221
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
Victory is

222
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Reserved for those women

223
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Price and there is a price

224
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
Guarantee that if you pay the price that you will have victory

225
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:59,359
But you guarantee that the I mean from a physical

226
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,223
You'll have to learn discipline you will have shown

227
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
You showed that

228
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,879
You are the master of your own mind of your own body and if you're on circumstance and you can

229
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,719
Discipline yourself in focus and you deny yourself certain things

230
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
In the pursuit of something

231
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
Something that is valuable

232
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,959
Not talking to me why the same reason that you'll see guys that were

233
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
You know like

234
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,311
High-level military like kind of big dogs in SF world

235
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
Get hired by let's say for instance the Fortune 500

236
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
What would they know about

237
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Business

238
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Nothing

239
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Everything

240
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Because

241
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,343
That level of focus and dedicated like you don't get to that level of a

242
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Ability in something

243
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
By accident

244
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,743
That's what I think

245
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
What they do competition

246
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Serious

247
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
Because if you don't get the gold medal is a you may not

248
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
You may not walk out of it

249
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
But basically on

250
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
And able to

251
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Over the Long Haul put that

252
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
What time-in but I have to

253
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Walking off the mat

254
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Having to be carried off the

255
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
It means

256
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,391
Approaching reassessing reevaluating saying how can I be better

257
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
And

258
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
How will I believe I look at myself I'm still buy

259
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
I'm still looking

260
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
At myself

261
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
What should I be due

262
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
Don't better I'm going to find other people that I respect

263
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
People that can tell me and then I'm going to ask them

264
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
The courage to listen to them

265
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
And I just as much with their saying out of

266
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
And if you're doing those things that I believe that a lot of time to work

267
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,295
Working hard but I know plenty of people to come in

268
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Frankly stock

269
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
And there's plenty of people that I've been training for 4

270
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,535
They're pretty nice the best person that's been trained

271
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
But they could be really really really good

272
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
Because they understand how to be direct and how to focus

273
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Disgusting all before

274
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
Went with some other ain't no friends of mine

275
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Distressing whatever

276
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Look at guys like Randy Couture

277
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
They're on their second career

278
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
They started

279
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
32

280
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
And yet they got

281
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
To the top

282
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Maybe they weren't always Champion but they were

283
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Freaking good

284
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Because they're 26 year old self would be scary

285
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
Do you know like hey

286
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,935
They know what it is to be dedicated

287
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Bands like you said

288
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,775
A regular person

289
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
So I think that ultimately the skill it's not.

290
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:49,087
Knows how to work their ass off and

291
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Comprehend

292
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Yeah and be brutally honest

293
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Kill yourself

294
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
Sometimes you know it is I think it's

295
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
The price of

296
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Eight of looking inward

297
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
You know objectively is that

298
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
You're not going to like what you see a lot

299
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Because even if you're like all men

300
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
I'm 90% the way I want to be

301
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,919
If you are going to take the next step in my opinion it's you're going to focus on the temperature

302
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
Because it's like home and we're doing

303
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Let's talk about what we need to improve on

304
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
It's what's

305
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,743
It's what's going to drive you to a higher level but at the same time I think it's what makes a lot of people that are like that

306
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
A little bit neurotic and naughty by comparing by a normal standard

307
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
But again you show me someone that

308
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
Super well-adjusted and I'll show you someone that's probably not a high fever

309
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
In a class you

310
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
UEFA says they were working with

311
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Basic laws of physics

312
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,127
So I just read the Einstein's biography

313
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
He was obsessed with finding a single theory that we unify

314
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
All the fundamental forces of nature

315
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
Do you think their existing unified theory of grappling we can boil everything down to just

316
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Just a few principles

317
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,023
Unified theory I would sincerely

318
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,887
Question my ability to go that way but something like that could potentially exist absolutely

319
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Even if it doesn't

320
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
A belief in the possibility of it and the search for it

321
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Leave you better off

322
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
And where you started where as if I was at

323
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
B******* that would never end and I don't look

324
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
Because I didn't look this certain things I want learn

325
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
I think you know a lot of times

326
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
What's Alchemy

327
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Girls maybe that's

328
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
That kind of nutty and Dino

329
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,143
Highly unlikely probability of success Pursuit

330
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Yielded

331
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
Scientific progress elsewhere

332
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
In the search for that even though again

333
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,223
Well if you spend

334
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
A principle based approach to graph

335
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
What's your

336
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Process like

337
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
@the

338
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
High level

339
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,999
After all the years of experience what's your process like for learning new details and understanding the principles

340
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Behind

341
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Techniques

342
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
I bet you're going to believe that I have

343
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Like a

344
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
A singular

345
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
Perfect approached by any stretch of the imagination

346
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
But I mean I guess what I try to do is

347
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Block out extraneous

348
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Princess

349
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Both feet a lot of

350
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
People want to talk about

351
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,223
55 details and reasons for something this

352
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
What's going on in the reality

353
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
That you're clouding your thought process

354
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
There was a reason not to

355
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Political

356
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
But there was a recent issue where

357
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
I remember

358
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
And they use the new drug

359
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,071
And it was painful

360
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
What do you believe that capital

361
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
Is valid or not I think it's

362
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
It's against it

363
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
In fact I think most of the arguments that make sense or against it

364
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
Pain has

365
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
F*** all to do with it

366
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
You know I don't care if that's like

367
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
The helix

368
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
I'm going to kill you

369
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
But don't worry it's not going to hurt

370
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Show me the steak

371
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,511
If someone's going to sting I'm still going to try to fight you to the death

372
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
If someone wants to say hi

373
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,679
Let's go let's cut the b******* like fili feelings out of here and say hello

374
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
You forget the pain

375
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
Does this person deserted

376
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Is there a potential for human error

377
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
Is there potential for someone having this

378
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Political games

379
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
It has nothing to do with does it hurt

380
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,135
Orc which drug is it

381
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Hey

382
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
We're focusing on the wrong

383
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
In the public in

384
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Arena

385
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
They always focus on the wrong thing

386
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
And always hooks on the wrong address

387
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
Good reasons or bad

388
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
To do almost anything

389
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
But generally speaking people will focus on

390
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
Hundred other ones

391
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Extraneous and retarded

392
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
So what I want

393
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
And this guy likes

394
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,975
It's really important

395
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
It's very very important

396
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
But

397
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,215
Clearly they all work

398
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,591
Under the right circumstances and don't work on the wrong one and it has nothing to do or very little to do

399
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
With each other

400
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
Would you prefer to be painless or horrific leaf

401
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Okay

402
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
If it's already a foregone conclusion

403
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
I will start to talk about

404
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Like whether or not it's going to sting

405
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,559
Hey let's focus on the

406
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
I need to do this

407
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
Okay so

408
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
Yeah it doesn't matter

409
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
But it's a hell of a lot less important than 2500

410
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,431
Things that make all of the difference

411
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Is a lot of people

412
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Bulshit you

413
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Will focus on 45 little

414
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Description details for this technique

415
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
Okay that's true but

416
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
What are the two most important

417
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,279
Because it don't matter

418
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
But just like anything else in life is a highway

419
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,655
Because would you say that would you say that

420
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,727
Happiness and self-actualization is a valuable thing in life

421
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
I would as well

422
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
And you know what we have the luxury of saying

423
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
That type of thing

424
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,943
Because we're sitting at 50/50 Jiu Jitsu in Falls Church Virginia and there's no one trying to kill us rapist

425
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
And we are also

426
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
I know where food is

427
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,623
That if you were to walk.

428
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Feeling

429
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
Stare at you

430
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
F****** retarded I'm starving

431
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
I'm hungry

432
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,119
My issue are you are you satisfied in your life

433
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,959
So that's even the deeper question is are you eating something

434
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
Right

435
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
First time we start to work

436
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Self-actualization

437
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Don't tell me about where you're placing your

438
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Grip

439
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
It's like you're all leaning out in your

440
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
I'm starving to death

441
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
You know

442
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
The Barbarian

443
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Giving you a philosophy

444
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
It's like this is retarded

445
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Doesn't make any sense

446
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
Build a better wall a sharper knife and get some food

447
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
And then we'll cover the all the others

448
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Feel to be the most important

449
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Component parts

450
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
And then

451
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
If I won

452
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,040
Reach the level of where these tiny Details Matter

453
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
That's fantastic

454
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
The difference

455
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
Between you know the ability to

456
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
The past

457
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
Successful against recovery

458
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,048
A regular run-of-the-mill black

459
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
It's also presupposing that you're in proper

460
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Preposition

461
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
That even allow these details

462
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Become relevant

463
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
And I think that a lot of times

464
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
That's problematic

465
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Are there still in your opinion

466
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,712
Undiscovered position submissions a techniques in Jiu-Jitsu

467
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
I would say that

468
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
They're absolutely

469
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,624
Think that what we see is you get you now don't get me wrong to the core never change

470
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Because

471
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Physics doesn't change physics

472
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,768
Which is the same thing that's why I get a kick out of people that loves like self-defense argument

473
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Bullshit has another no physics

474
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Beyond the fact yes you can

475
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
I've never seen anything like that in real life

476
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,312
But you're crossing a pretty serious psychological line if you're putting your knuckles too dumb to Knuckles deep into somebody's eyes

477
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:41,152
Forget the fact that

478
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
I've never done that before

479
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
Before I wouldn't do it lightly then probably

480
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
Hesitation there what do so anyway

481
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
What makes it different is the psychological component

482
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
And all these other things going on with

483
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
No it's not

484
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
It is absolutely not

485
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
What are you talk

486
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
Physics of different inside of

487
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
And they are out in the field

488
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
Exactly the same

489
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,544
Now if I try to sport grapple you

490
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
Under a non sport grappling

491
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,272
Jiu-Jitsu is physics is is proper expression of his insanely boxing

492
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
So

493
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,464
I would say that as long as something adheres to the principles that that allows

494
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
To be effective and

495
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
Do you know and fundamentally sound

496
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
That you can do almost anything

497
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,912
Take the people will continue for tickling the kids going to get nuts

498
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
I'm just a level of the amount of

499
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Things that you can get away with it

500
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Conduent

501
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
Different grips that you can make

502
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,872
But I'd say what we're looking at right now

503
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Is going to look

504
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Only someone

505
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Like what you just going to look like

506
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
In 30 years

507
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
The same way that you get to we see now is

508
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
So much fundamentally

509
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
Better honestly and and more evolved

510
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
That it was

511
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
20 years ago

512
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:01,280
And people will swear up and down

513
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Well even 20 years ago

514
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Understanding hadoop

515
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Deal with jiu-jitsu

516
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
Very reduced so you can get away with all sorts of

517
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Pretty questionable

518
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
. like sitting in front of someone in clothes.

519
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
Jordan have them not completely kick the s*** out of you

520
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
It is

521
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
That's I always hesitate to say

522
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Invent

523
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
Don't like the word invent

524
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
Certain people use a lot

525
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,232
I'd say discover because you could show me I can come up with something

526
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,792
You know

527
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
And I could be doing that in a way that no one ever taught me

528
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
Because you've been doing it forever

529
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:46,592
But basically it's a show me the details

530
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,432
High-powered I discovered

531
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Who invented the dab

532
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
People in head two arms and two legs

533
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
Long as I can

534
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Probably longer than that

535
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
So in the history books

536
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
You're a Grappler

537
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Wrestler

538
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Judoka

539
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
You serious I was your dog as well

540
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
I mean only by a very very very

541
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:13,984
Low standard of computers you a tournament that you completed

542
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,384
All right yeah I hesitate to use the word someone a real judo player will come in and just just facepalm and stare at me

543
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
Mailboxes

544
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
What do you think is the best martial art

545
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,672
For defending yourself against an untrained opponent

546
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
Untrained

547
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,792
Statistically speaking you go through life

548
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,888
Minimize the chance of yourself being hurt by the untrained opponent

549
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
So Street Bar

550
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:49,056
Are there so many different factors

551
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,384
There's about

552
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,456
An ass whipping like seven people vs 3 people in

553
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,296
Okay that the more variables you add and it gets very very difficult I would say them

554
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
The best fighting style is using your brain

555
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
Because when winning the fight

556
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Now I know nothing about investing

557
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
Which is why I don't do it

558
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,912
But let's say for instance

559
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Did you get in here

560
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
But he said there's nothing

561
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
To do the best

562
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Can do is wait

563
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
But you're Warren Buffett tell me the best investment

564
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Are the best investment today still suck

565
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
Talk to me next week and I'll see what's up

566
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Maybe

567
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,168
And then

568
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
You're going to kill everyone

569
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
And you are armed

570
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
50/50 Junior

571
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
But for whatever reason

572
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,992
Sitting there polishing their fully loaded

573
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,832
The chamber safety off weapons

574
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
And you see everyone else

575
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
What do you do

576
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Wait

577
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,816
The Wednesday

578
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Being the best tactical shooter

579
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
There's too many of us into few of you

580
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,872
Could you make it out of there

581
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
I wouldn't bet on it

582
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
That's like Floyd Mayweather

583
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
Seriously

584
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,856
Because regular people can't fight for s***

585
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
Literally crippled

586
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
The first guy with the right hand

587
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
The other two guys unless they're really serious

588
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Oh and it hasn't

589
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
4 people

590
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:58,080
Free People

591
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,432
All these different things factor in so I would say that when it comes to the physical expression of how to best

592
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Defend yourself the most important thing is

593
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Situational awareness

594
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,600
And understanding what's going on around you because you could be the world

595
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Greatest ninja warrior

596
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,952
And still run yourself into a lose-lose situation

597
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
Because

598
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Starbucks

599
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
And you teach him a runic a joke

600
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,424
And then you let him put Rodger Gracie in that we're naked choke Rodger Gracie the greatest Grappler

601
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
In the world

602
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,752
And also a big freaking dude

603
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
And you let him put Rodger in that Renee control can you

604
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
You think Rodger gets out

605
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
Padres probably bad

606
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
He's one of the best escape artist

607
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Escape artist

608
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
You're like a tier 1

609
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,672
Best of the best f****** tip of the spear awesomedude

610
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
I shoot you in the face

611
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Do you live

612
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Mature immature

613
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Good fight

614
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,144
At a certain at a certain point it's gone too far

615
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,448
So now who thinks that

616
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
The above average

617
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Very very slim

618
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
Almost non-existent

619
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
Knockout Floyd Mayweather

620
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
If you let me hit him

621
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
But

622
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,648
I don't think I would come in spitting distance of him

623
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
If he didn't want me to

624
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
I would have no teeth

625
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Before I even tried

626
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
But if he sits there and let you hit them

627
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
He is a man

628
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
He is mortal

629
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
So basically under the right circumstances

630
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
Does anyone can win

631
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
Under the wrong circumstances

632
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
So in Spa

633
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Shredabull

634
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
As a martial artist

635
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
In particular Grappler

636
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Even if she

637
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
Allows the situation to get to far

638
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
It becomes a

639
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Lose situation

640
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Even for him

641
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
So

642
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,904
I would say that understanding that is step one

643
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Effective

644
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
Effective strategist

645
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
Can read a situation you say

646
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
4 seconds and run for it

647
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
The physical expression of everything you want to

648
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
What's a friendship

649
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,544
Best things for defending yourself in real life

650
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,128
Say probably wrestling or jiu-jitsu

651
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
Probably Jiu-Jitsu really in my opinion

652
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
But

653
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Fighting

654
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
I would say

655
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,856
Beat up more than one person right now it implies that I can wrestle

656
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
Or I can just

657
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Actually horrible

658
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
The boxing would be nice as well

659
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,840
But let's say you're great boxer

660
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Angular person

661
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,800
For sure but it also

662
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Basically

663
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
If I had to pick one art and everyone knows nothing

664
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Owl pictures

665
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
But in my opinion

666
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
Jiu-Jitsu at a high level

667
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Involves wrestling

668
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Lookaside grappling is

669
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
This is bigger

670
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
Everything that involves wrestling June 11

671
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Inside control

672
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
It's not pleasant

673
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,352
So it's a popular idea and Jiu-Jitsu that egos

674
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
You know your greatest enemy

675
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Have you had

676
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
Made any progress in defeating that out of me

677
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
Does it get stronger as you just a game is better

678
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
And they love that s***

679
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,608
But that's when you also know it

680
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,168
I don't trust large groups of people

681
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
And I certainly don't trust their thought process

682
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
Show me someone that takes losing well

683
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,664
What's a princess

684
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
5 year old

685
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,248
Because what am I doing

686
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Army

687
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
But if I go

688
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm not okay with what just happened

689
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
You're either

690
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
You're possibly

691
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
Realize Hixon Gracie

692
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,144
Or more than

693
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Because again

694
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
Anyone

695
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,824
It provided that they're not it's not

696
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
You have to want to win

697
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:23,552
Do you have to run when you have to believe but you can't

698
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
Drive you in a pot

699
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Directions

700
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
But you want to tell me that Michael Jordan

701
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
Has no ego

702
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Horseshit

703
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
What song is this

704
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Floyd Mayweather

705
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
Get out of here

706
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
If you ask what's

707
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
But the reality is a liar

708
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
He's bullshitting

709
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
You can say yes

710
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
He is the best

711
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
Or the British was

712
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
At a time

713
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
Does that mean he's perfect

714
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
No absolutely not

715
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
But not

716
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,288
Devolving into like a ridiculous self-love

717
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,128
Patting yourself on the back

718
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
Because you want to believe that with proper working with

719
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
Proper effort that you can achieve

720
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Anything

721
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
But

722
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
Just you being you

723
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Does not do any

724
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
They are sweet because of them

725
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Rather than like

726
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,560
I have trained hard I expected

727
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
I'm coming out to get you

728
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,008
Hey do I control the outcome

729
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:51,104
No

730
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Borderliner

731
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,480
But basically

732
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,784
Proper preparation

733
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
I was probably in the moment

734
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
I have to believe that I'm going to beat you

735
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,720
But that doesn't mean that I believe that I will beat you

736
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,072
Just by being me or just by showing up it's not going to be easy but I expect

737
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
To do well in to win

738
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
And I think that

739
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
Do you know sometimes just you guys or girls that

740
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
But don't believe

741
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
And it's a shame. It doesn't take much to

742
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
That they can beat you or that they will beat you

743
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
To really push hard

744
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
And sometimes

745
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Endeavor

746
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,344
Has been made by unreasonable people

747
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
That kind of said f*** you I'm going to

748
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
You know honestly in

749
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
That is true

750
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,864
If you look at in popular culture now it's completely gone over

751
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,472
That is so sweet meme

752
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Like that's garbage

753
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,360
4 positive things

754
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
If you

755
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
Do what

756
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,272
Is necessary for to July to generate a positive outcome

757
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,904
Super athletes that have done nothing

758
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
People that have

759
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
Made incredible things

760
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,328
The best and most successful people

761
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
In terms of Natural Resources

762
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
Good-looking or strong or smart or whatever

763
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
And they work their butt off

764
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
But I

765
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,568
More important the most important ingredient

766
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,616
What's hard work and dedication offer over a long period

767
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
You know I think that

768
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Leaving the door it's

769
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
You know don't let it get in your way

770
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
But

771
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Really when it comes to

772
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,624
Fighting it's almost all psychological

773
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Do I have to believe that I'm a

774
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Going to beat you and I want

775
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,744
Make you believe that I'm going to beat you he goes a few on that fire

776
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
At the other day it is it really is and I

777
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
Think that you know

778
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,960
Mosto

779
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
Believe in yourself

780
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
When this and I'm going to do that

781
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,712
Now if you say that

782
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,808
If you're willing to go like

783
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
I'm also willing to get out there

784
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,464
I'm willing to try

785
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
As long as you're willing to risk

786
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
The failure

787
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
You willing to come back and try harder and do it again

788
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Then I think positive

789
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
If if you're

790
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
If your confidence is hinged on

791
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:31,360
Unrealistic beliefs that you're always going to win without doing anything

792
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,272
But every hila molasses that I've ever met

793
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
But that's a successful one

794
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
They believe in themselves

795
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
