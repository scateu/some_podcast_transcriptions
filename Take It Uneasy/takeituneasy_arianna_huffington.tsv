EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:49,824	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Whether there is another dimension of consciousness

EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,168	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Question at the core of

EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:57,920	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The reflecting on one's own mortality puts things into

EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,808	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Perhaps not
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:07,904	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	You often think about your own mortality and what perspective
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,696	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Does that help you gain
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,256	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Yes I think about it a lot
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:18,912	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And that and it does give me perspective and it does help me focus on the things that matter to me
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,728	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	In times of

EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,576	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Life ends with death
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,952	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I'm just much more interesting what happens to my soul and
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:46,304	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Then what happens to my legacy on.
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Do you have a sense

EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,376	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Happens
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,656	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	After you die
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Absol
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,728	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Do you have a
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,312	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Is it more of a feeling if you have a more concrete sense
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Spiritually
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,384	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	How do you see the world what happened
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,408	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Do your soul
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,456	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	2 feet 500
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,784	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The heck you were while you were here on Earth what does that become
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,832	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	An Entertainer in time
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So my son
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,160	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Is that
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,768	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	We are a personality the body them
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,815	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The mind
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:21,631	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Is like a car that we rented
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,423	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And we
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And we
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,751	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Return
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:29,311	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I'm at the airport and get on the plane
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:34,175	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And go to another city and rent another car
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:40,319	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I want to rent another car if you believe in reincarnation depending on where you are and your state of evolution
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:44,159	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	But definitely that what survives is the soul
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:50,047	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And that's why how we live our lives and the choices you make an
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,839	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	How we treat others
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,935	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I'm is so Central to what happens after death
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,727	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	All of those elements
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	You believe kind of feed
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So you've also mentioned that
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,663	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Under
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:10,271	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	On the harsh challenging part of life that failure is an essential part of life
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:15,903	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So what may be a major failure that stands out to you for your for yourself
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:21,279	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	One of the toughest ones for you psychologically to have bounced back from if you ever
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,047	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Dead
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Bounce back from
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,863	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Yes Run Festival
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:28,191	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I don't think there is any if I don't think there's a single successful
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,703	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Compassion
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:32,799	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I was not saying that long the way I mean I
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:38,431	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I challenge you to find one if you do let me know but in my experience
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Everybody has failed along the way and
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,527	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I think it would be great if
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:45,855	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Successful people talk more about their failures
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,695	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The difference is resilience and
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,999	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	How quickly do you get discouraged
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,351	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	In my case I actually probably the hardest failure
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,655	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Was when I was 28
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,703	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And them
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,543	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And my second book you mentioned my Facebook with
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,079	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Did very well
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,663	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	My second book witches on the crisis in
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,711	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	In political leadership in the West
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Was it rejected by
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:20,671	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	At 27 Publishers unit one after the other after the other
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,975	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And then Empire
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,791	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	That time I had to run out of money
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,399	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I've been living off the proceeds of my first
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:37,311	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And I remember walking kind of depressed on Saint James Street in London
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:37,823	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Where I live
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:42,175	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And thinking when maybe my Facebook was just a flu
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:45,759	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And I'm not really a writer and I have to go get a real job
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:52,927	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And then I saw Barclays Bank in the corner and I walked in and asked to see the manager and ask them out
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,951	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	What the
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,743	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Brits call an overdraft
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,511	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Is that allowed
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,327	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And I have nothing
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,607	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Not now I said
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:04,703	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And for some reason the manager whose name is Ian Bell
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,495	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Gave it to me
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:12,895	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	You and that kind of changed my life because it made it possible for me to keep things together for another 13 rejection
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,663	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Samsung
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,223	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	At that point I got an acceptance and
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,551	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I sent in Bellaire holiday card every year
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:26,463	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And that he's a little bit like you know in fairy days when the hero are the heroine gets lost in the.
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,487	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Darkfall Reston
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,047	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And then suddenly

EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,719	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And I saw that is on some
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,791	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Different forms of right-wing or left-wing populism
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,399	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And them is a very serious moment but I don't think it's going to be

EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,143	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And then

EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:13,503	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Was it been a catalyst for the divisiveness or do they simply reveal the divisiveness those late in there already

EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:27,583	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	What blogging was you know when we launch the having a Boston 2005
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:32,703	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Blogging was dismissed as something that people who couldn't get a job we're doing in the
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,727	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Parents basement
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:40,127	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And because we brought in people who could have written for the New York Times like
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,711	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Walter Cronkite the Nora Ephron and Larry David

EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,959	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Want some point
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:09,823	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Before I left the hobbiton bus I even ended Anonymous comments all together

EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,735	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So from the beginning I wanted to democratize the conversation

EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,415	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I loved and honored
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	But at the same time
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:29,535	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I saw the dangerous of
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,583	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Diabetic ccd.com
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,375	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Infiltrate
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:39,007	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	These conversations if they're not monitored and there is no real curation
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,567	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So one of the core things
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:46,175	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	That emerged from The Huffington post's I mean there is a little bit of a viewpoint
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,223	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Underlying it is left
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:52,063	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	El Centro College laugh there's definitely a viewpoint
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:55,391	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	In fact we called our journalists Beyond
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,975	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Right and left I think the right left divisions
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,559	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The way of looking at the world in terms of right and left
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,095	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Is incredibly obsolete
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:10,239	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Being concerned about a growing inequality
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:14,591	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Is not a left-wing position if you are somebody who cares about Law and Order
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,639	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	You should care about that
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,223	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Unless you want the country to be turned into it
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,039	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Banana Republic with rich people living
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Behind Gates
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,855	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Security guards
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,439	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	If you care about
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:32,255	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Climate change does it mean your on the left
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,559	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	What does it mean that you want to preserve the planet
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:40,959	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So I think by looking at the world in right or left breast implant polarizing
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The conversation
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:43,775	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	But
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:45,567	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So that's a beautiful idea
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,359	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And that I share it
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,383	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	But nevertheless
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	It seems that
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:55,295	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Did there's a strong gravitational field that pulls people into left and right and no matter what they will place
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,087	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Different venues into those
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,599	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Polaris
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:02,207	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So is it seems that the hogs in the public perception
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,767	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Huffington Post kind of gets into the left and there's
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,559	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	These opposing forces
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:09,375	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	How Breitbart and so on the deck to get this
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,167	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Placed somehow and to the right
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:13,471	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And then there's the right team in the blue team
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:17,055	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I guess my question is do you see do you notice this
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:19,871	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Do you see a path forward in the coming decade
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,663	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	In the air of our current president
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Maybe bringing us back together
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,831	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And having a healthy disagreement on the issues
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,623	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	As opposed to having
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,159	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Teams and tribes of red and blue
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:39,327	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I absolutely do I think that two things that I sent really not to achieve that one is a reverence for fat
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:47,519	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	You and I have the right to our own opinions but we don't have the right part on side of face
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So that's number one
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:53,151	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And them and number two is to
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:58,015	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Do and the view of journalists. Jay Rosen has described
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,551	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Has the view from Noah
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,599	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Like I think
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,951	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Climate change is not a matter of opinion
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:10,303	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	So a lot of journalists feel that their position is to
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:17,215	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Have one person who thinks climate change is real another person with things it's not and their job is to stay in
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,007	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Midland play ponponpon
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,031	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Spiral to me
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,567	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	That's like
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,359	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Not at all
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:29,759	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Great journalist men's that about having a bus definitely had to Viewpoint as you're sad
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,599	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	But it was a Viewpoint based on fact
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,159	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And I actually recommend that people listen
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:40,511	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Do your podcast with a special conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:45,375	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	That kind of emphasises talks about science and the importance of
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,399	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Why people have
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,167	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Teresa
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,703	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The seriousness
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,519	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Amongst our leaders towards science
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,335	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	As a thing that you shouldn't politicize
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,615	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Well last question
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,223	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	How do you balance
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,735	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Love
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,783	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And ambition

EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,927	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	This Obsession towards

EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,791	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Building Huffington Post
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,839	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Obsession with your work life
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:21,215	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And a genuine deep obsession with your family or people in your life that you love
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,263	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	How do you balance that
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:23,775	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Time
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,311	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And energy
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:30,687	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Well let me give you an example right now you know Thrive global
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,479	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	He's an obsession
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,783	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Ending a
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,599	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The stress and burnout epidemic
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,671	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	He's our mission and I
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:47,583	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I've see that's having a huge impact on our hands on our mantel has an aura and they're not performance
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,631	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	But at the same time
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,959	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I have two daughters that I adore
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:59,615	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And everybody in my office knows that when I get a call from one of my daughters at any point
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:00,895	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I will take it
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,223	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And that and that they are a priority
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,759	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	That doesn't mean
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,575	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I can't dogs have be obsessed
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	About

EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,207	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	I think this is what a false dichotomy
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,231	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	It's because I think when
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,023	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	When we
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,303	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Nurture
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:23,423	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The part of us that is about love that is about connection
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:31,615	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	We also natural the deeper parts of our humanity and it's from those parts that wisdom and creativity

EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,063	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	Where we recognize that
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,903	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	While Ai and machine learning are going to
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:20,512	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	They cover a huge part of our life and Destroy many jobs
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:25,888	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	The things that AI is not going to be able to do other distinctly human thing
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,192	| takeituneasy_arianna_huffington |	And loving is one of them
