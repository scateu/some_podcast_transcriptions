EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:15,776	| IOT110 |	We had another ad

EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,384	| IOT110 |	Alright Kevin
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| IOT110 |	Let's get this show started with
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:55,968	| IOT110 |	Does Apple need
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| IOT110 |	TeleStaff
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:04,160	| IOT110 |	We can talk about the question but the news or
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:10,048	| IOT110 |	Licor remember how we want to put it is that apple is coming out with a Siri equipped speaker
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:12,096	| IOT110 |	This information comes from
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,144	| IOT110 |	KGI Securities analyst ming-chi
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:16,448	| IOT110 |	Quote was actually one of the better
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:19,264	| IOT110 |	Predictors of what apple is doing he looks
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,080	| IOT110 |	At supply chain like nobody's business and
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,128	| IOT110 |	He's thinking that
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:30,528	| IOT110 |	Maybe at WWDC or Apple's developer conference in June that they announced this
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:32,064	| IOT110 |	Siri equip speaker with
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:35,392	| IOT110 |	A subwoofer and 7 tweeters to provide excellent sound
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,440	| IOT110 |	Map of the question
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| IOT110 |	Do they need it
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,536	| IOT110 |	Well I think they do but they need something else first
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,608	| IOT110 |	I need to improve Siri
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:50,752	| IOT110 |	They need they need to improve Syrian it and here's the thing if I'll be watching the the developer event
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,312	| IOT110 |	Live keynote which is where I would predict
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,360	| IOT110 |	They would announce something like this if they're going to
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:56,896	| IOT110 |	And the first thing they
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:00,480	| IOT110 |	Should be doing if they start talking about Siri and improvements to Siri
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,016	| IOT110 |	Then I would say
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,296	| IOT110 |	Chloe's on
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| IOT110 |	Target for this
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,344	| IOT110 |	If they don't
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| IOT110 |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,672	| IOT110 |	Siri is just
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:11,232	| IOT110 |	In my opinion does not nearly as good
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:14,560	| IOT110 |	As Google assistant and the Amazon Echo
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:19,168	| IOT110 |	I can't speak pretty good about Bixby because I don't have Bixby voice that we talked about that a little bit more
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:23,008	| IOT110 |	But serious just not that great it just has
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,544	| IOT110 |	Seems stagnant
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,592	| IOT110 |	It is
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,104	| IOT110 |	Not that guy
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:30,176	| IOT110 |	I don't spend a lot of time talking to Siri my husband does
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,712	| IOT110 |	Not in
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,504	| IOT110 |	Crest
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:40,416	| IOT110 |	I guess if they can get Siri cuz yes I would be super frustrated shouting something across the room and
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,512	| IOT110 |	I'm not sure I can help you
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:50,400	| IOT110 |	But just keep you very limited information not be very conversational to have follow-up
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,936	| IOT110 |	Iteration
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,472	| IOT110 |	Amazon Echo is like
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:54,752	| IOT110 |	Agreed
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,032	| IOT110 |	Who created
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:00,384	| IOT110 |	Saudi Arabia it's not perfect. I totally agree with you there when it from
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,688	| IOT110 |	Conversational standpoint the echo is not there
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,992	| IOT110 |	It is something I think Amazon needs to address
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,832	| IOT110 |	But the echo has a lot of other positive that make up for that shortcoming
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:12,672	| IOT110 |	So what would let's assume Apple has the same
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,696	| IOT110 |	Model word
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,720	| IOT110 |	Has a limited
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| IOT110 |	AI
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,303	| IOT110 |	What would it really bring to the table here well
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| IOT110 |	Homekit
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,375	| IOT110 |	Right homekit device
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:21,887	| IOT110 |	Control
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:28,799	| IOT110 |	I would see this as an attachment for Apple music subscribers if the sound is really good could even sell more Apple
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,567	| IOT110 |	Music
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:34,431	| IOT110 |	Subscriptions and I would not anticipate it works with other services are easily
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,735	| IOT110 |	Amazon's Echo
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:39,551	| IOT110 |	Guys okay with that Google home does not
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,087	| IOT110 |	Premature Google play music
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,367	| IOT110 |	Play I can get Spotify
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,487	| IOT110 |	Because we mentioned that she word
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:47,999	| IOT110 |	We should mention
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:53,119	| IOT110 |	Oh yes I work for Google as a full-time consultant
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,447	| IOT110 |	Touch it more there Enterprise area with Android in Chrome not with
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,471	| IOT110 |	Iot devices
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| IOT110 |	Direct
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,775	| IOT110 |	I would say
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:05,151	| IOT110 |	Where we could see some cool stuff from Apple is things like healthkit integration
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,431	| IOT110 |	So
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,503	| IOT110 |	What if you can ask your I think you can actually ask
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:11,807	| IOT110 |	Your Fitbit data from
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,575	| IOT110 |	The echo
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,111	| IOT110 |	Where is it
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,415	| IOT110 |	A scale for that although I've never done it so maybe they
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,463	| IOT110 |	There isn't but being able to say hey
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,255	| IOT110 |	How's my health
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,023	| IOT110 |	But today might be real
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,863	| IOT110 |	Could be could even listen to see if you're snoring at night
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:30,751	| IOT110 |	I stuck so update you all I have not gotten my mice
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| IOT110 |	Snoring pillow
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,335	| IOT110 |	Not yet
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,383	| IOT110 |	It's expected to come I think
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,407	| IOT110 |	Like another month
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT110 |	All right yes
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,271	| IOT110 |	Sew in
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:42,783	| IOT110 |	Pricing
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| IOT110 |	Sure
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,159	| IOT110 |	Sure
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:50,207	| IOT110 |	Corset well
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,511	| IOT110 |	At least as much as an echo
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,863	| IOT110 |	Which is 189 although you mention right before the show there some refurb units
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:00,191	| IOT110 |	On sale like right now for 130 something
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,703	| IOT110 |	135
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,799	| IOT110 |	Yeah it's just really almost too good to pass up if you want an echo
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,359	| IOT110 |	As far as Apple pricing Shores it certainly a
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,407	| IOT110 |	At least 199 device if not
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,687	| IOT110 |	A 249
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,711	| IOT110 |	Device
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,039	| IOT110 |	Yeah now it would be nice if this device actually
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,343	| IOT110 |	Replace stored in replace augmented
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,439	| IOT110 |	Apple TV or an iPad as a home
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:21,951	| IOT110 |	Hub
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,231	| IOT110 |	4
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,743	| IOT110 |	Homekit wire
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:29,375	| IOT110 |	Yeah that could that could work in which case you know
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,935	| IOT110 |	There's a definite Advantage there
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,471	| IOT110 |	And an even I could see them
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:38,079	| IOT110 |	You know sell multiple ones that stream music simultaneously kind like a Sonos
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,359	| IOT110 |	Exactly
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:42,431	| IOT110 |	I think there's an opportunity I would love for these things
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:47,039	| IOT110 |	Play nicely the one thing I am sad about with Sonos and kind of missing this boat
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,343	| IOT110 |	Is there whole mission
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| IOT110 |	Was to be this neutral
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| IOT110 |	Kind of
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,463	| IOT110 |	Delivery device for the internet music
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,815	| IOT110 |	Tell him I'm kind of like
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,375	| IOT110 |	I don't know if I really want to see this fragment
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,423	| IOT110 |	And it's so much especially because I used my
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:03,935	| IOT110 |	Echo Dot
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:04,959	| IOT110 |	My television
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,751	| IOT110 |	Right
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:10,079	| IOT110 |	We'll just real quick related but not on the show notes
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:13,663	| IOT110 |	We mention saunas the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| IOT110 |	Phones at
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,455	| IOT110 |	Launch last week
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,247	| IOT110 |	We're two weeks ago rather
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,551	| IOT110 |	The first phones with Bluetooth 5 Ashley
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:24,415	| IOT110 |	Use the feature that allows you to stream the same song over Bluetooth
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:28,255	| IOT110 |	Two different speakers I do with my Amazon tap and my Amazon Echo
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,815	| IOT110 |	And actually works pretty good it's not a saint I was
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,327	| IOT110 |	Of course but
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,399	| IOT110 |	If you have multiple bluetooth speakers that works pretty well
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:35,679	| IOT110 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,447	| IOT110 |	Good to know
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,727	| IOT110 |	Celine cheaper alter
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,567	| IOT110 |	Speaking of voice
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| IOT110 |	Assistant
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,383	| IOT110 |	I have to ask Kevin

EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,455	| IOT110 |	Amazon
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,783	| IOT110 |	Free Amazon book
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,343	| IOT110 |	Echo with a camera
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,671	| IOT110 |	It is designed to take pictures of your outfits
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,695	| IOT110 |	To give you style advice
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,607	| IOT110 |	Is it
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,143	| IOT110 |	What's happening
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:09,215	| IOT110 |	Really I thought I thought you'd be all over this thing
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,007	| IOT110 |	Will you be like this
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,287	| IOT110 |	I did Aspirin
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,359	| IOT110 |	I'm not going to lie I told my husband
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,687	| IOT110 |	Right now anyone from Amazon listening to this
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,455	| IOT110 |	I would like
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,247	| IOT110 |	An invite so
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,783	| IOT110 |	I have to get your thoughts on this so
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:30,207	| IOT110 |	A hands-free voice-activated selfie camera that tells me what I already know which is I have no Style
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,999	| IOT110 |	Me personally
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,535	| IOT110 |	Not interested at all however
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:37,375	| IOT110 |	It's interesting to me would it do you think would be fair to say this is a
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,167	| IOT110 |	Product targeted at women
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,959	| IOT110 |	Probably end
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| IOT110 |	I put something out my newsletter about
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,591	| IOT110 |	What I thought was great about this and what I thought was just
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,103	| IOT110 |	Beyond weird
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| IOT110 |	I think Amazon's pushing
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,175	| IOT110 |	The envelope
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,991	| IOT110 |	Are people ready to have a camera
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:56,575	| IOT110 |	I just in their home but this is if it's checking out my outfits
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| IOT110 |	It's like a bedroom
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,623	| IOT110 |	Closet
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,135	| IOT110 |	Bathroom tile
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,695	| IOT110 |	Getting personal now
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,719	| IOT110 |	Feels like
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,999	| IOT110 |	Those are not places where
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,023	| IOT110 |	Right now I'm even
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| IOT110 |	There's no mechanical closed
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:09,887	| IOT110 |	Camera button
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:10,911	| IOT110 |	Which I thought was like
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,703	| IOT110 |	Please add that
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,775	| IOT110 |	But Amazon's been trying for fashion for a while
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,615	| IOT110 |	It's the flight one of the last holdouts of like
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,383	| IOT110 |	Retail for them
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,991	| IOT110 |	Where can I get a sense of exactly what's in my closet if I own some
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,783	| IOT110 |	I guess they're going to know all of me
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:31,391	| IOT110 |	I think it's a great idea for a service once it has information to be like
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:31,903	| IOT110 |	Hey Stacy
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,487	| IOT110 |	It is cold outside and you have an appointment
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,279	| IOT110 |	Maybe you should wear this
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,815	| IOT110 |	And my brain.
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:43,935	| IOT110 |	Yeah I know I mean it brings the assistant
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,727	| IOT110 |	To another level
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,519	| IOT110 |	So I can
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,287	| IOT110 |	See that
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:53,151	| IOT110 |	It's going to get some information as you said that they don't have today about what's in our closet
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,455	| IOT110 |	Knight start suggesting
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,991	| IOT110 |	Items to buy
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,063	| IOT110 |	You know like hey your you need an update in here which
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,135	| IOT110 |	Tell me it is a spell I haven't
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,463	| IOT110 |	Yeah I all you have is Beatles t-shirts and jeans and high tops
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,047	| IOT110 |	You need some help
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:14,143	| IOT110 |	I'm not saying it I don't see this as a viable product I think it's
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,959	| IOT110 |	Targeting particular audiences
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:23,359	| IOT110 |	So it's less Universal then say their Echo products are current Echo products that's a lot
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,895	| IOT110 |	I also talked to somebody
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:25,919	| IOT110 |	Who does
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:26,943	| IOT110 |	Craft block
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,247	| IOT110 |	And she was like
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:33,087	| IOT110 |	I don't care about 4 outfits but having something where I can put a
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:36,159	| IOT110 |	A camera like a mount above my hands while I'm doing
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,183	| IOT110 |	She says
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,231	| IOT110 |	Sewing project and then say take a picture
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,023	| IOT110 |	It have it take that
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:44,095	| IOT110 |	Picture that would be really great for me from a blocking
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,655	| IOT110 |	And I thought about things like
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:47,935	| IOT110 |	Cooking
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:54,079	| IOT110 |	And showing people things for like recipe blogs instead of having to stop what you're doing take a picture and then
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,383	| IOT110 |	I don't know
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,687	| IOT110 |	Oh I thought that was kind of interesting although again
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,199	| IOT110 |	A very niche
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,991	| IOT110 |	So
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:06,623	| IOT110 |	I'm excited I was speaking yesterday and it bent and they're like 250 people in the audience that I said hey
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,671	| IOT110 |	Is anyone going to get the Amazon look
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:10,975	| IOT110 |	Like literally
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,791	| IOT110 |	Interesting interesting
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,303	| IOT110 |	But it was
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,839	| IOT110 |	In fairness this was
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| IOT110 |	Maybe not
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,471	| IOT110 |	Its fashion
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,519	| IOT110 |	And I also my talk
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| IOT110 |	Privacy so I asked
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:32,735	| IOT110 |	Yeah well now that's a fine. The target audience site I would agree
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,783	| IOT110 |	So this is 199
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,295	| IOT110 |	199
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,087	| IOT110 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,135	| IOT110 |	Have to beg to buy it
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,183	| IOT110 |	Sarah now
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,767	| IOT110 |	You know you may not have people may beg to buy it
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,815	| IOT110 |	If you like up too soon too soon
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,167	| IOT110 |	And personal assistant news Samsung
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,983	| IOT110 |	Is bringing Bixby voice features to South
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:54,495	| IOT110 |	Korea
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,287	| IOT110 |	Latam country
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,871	| IOT110 |	Maybe it's it's getting ready
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| IOT110 |	We make it two voices
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| IOT110 |	I hope so
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:07,295	| IOT110 |	Galaxy S8 and S8 plus got updates in South Korea
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| IOT110 |	To enable
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,623	| IOT110 |	The voice command feature which
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:17,535	| IOT110 |	Kind of weird selling all these phones I have one and you can't use it by voice even though that's one of the big features
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,303	| IOT110 |	Wasn't ready for lunch
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| IOT110 |	And
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:23,679	| IOT110 |	I don't even know how well it works because they really haven't demonstrated it that much so
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:26,239	| IOT110 |	They did say the us we should have it
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,031	| IOT110 |	This spring
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:30,847	| IOT110 |	Which means I got about 7 weeks or so
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,663	| IOT110 |	I would say maybe 6 so
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,991	| IOT110 |	That's a good question I don't know
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,807	| IOT110 |	I would ask my phone but I can't do that by voice
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,135	| IOT110 |	Yeah so we'll see what happens again
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:47,487	| IOT110 |	I think I mentioned it prior to on a show when I did get this phone is got the dedicated Hardware button
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,023	| IOT110 |	For Bixby
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:53,631	| IOT110 |	I'm sure was you Google Now like cards there hit-or-miss for me
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:13:00,543	| IOT110 |	And it also has Bixby Vision that is enabled right now where you take a picture of something and it's just like the Amazon Fire Phone
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,311	| IOT110 |	Where you at
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,335	| IOT110 |	Scanner
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,895	| IOT110 |	Picture take a picture of something and it would magically
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:09,503	| IOT110 |	Determine what it was and then say Hey you can buy that here on Amazon for X dollars so
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,319	| IOT110 |	Also has an Amazon hookup in Bixby for that so
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:16,159	| IOT110 |	It's pretty limited right now so I'm dying to try the voice thingy
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,695	| IOT110 |	I'm not going to go to South Korea to do that
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,535	| IOT110 |	Sponsored
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,863	| IOT110 |	The other news from the personals

EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:50,463	| IOT110 |	Crazy but I will say it Cloud the Samsung stuff
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| IOT110 |	Actually
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:52,767	| IOT110 |	Connector
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,791	| IOT110 |	For all kinds of
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,655	| IOT110 |	Depending on how this works and I'll have to go play with it
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,727	| IOT110 |	You might be able to connect it to all kinds of other things that
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,775	| IOT110 |	It's like another mediating layer so you
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:06,335	| IOT110 |	You could be like two hops away from a device that you really want to come
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:12,991	| IOT110 |	Yeah I think I don't know because I don't have any Samsung Smart Home things in my house
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:17,855	| IOT110 |	I think it's kind of limited right now in this particular implementation to Legrand smart hubs
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,159	| IOT110 |	The Simpson arcade
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:23,743	| IOT110 |	Okay I see you're at Sola Grand who
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,511	| IOT110 |	Makes
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,047	| IOT110 |	Really nice light switches
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,607	| IOT110 |	And I think these really cool
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| IOT110 |	Plugs
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,959	| IOT110 |	They've actually been working I talked to them before about their smart home efforts
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:34,495	| IOT110 |	They're big on

EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,567	| IOT110 |	So that makes sense because

EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| IOT110 |	And
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,479	| IOT110 |	Honestly
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:50,367	| IOT110 |	Most chip vendors that I talk to and most people that I talked to her like thread is a dead standard
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:53,951	| IOT110 |	This may be like a
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,487	| IOT110 |	Come on thread
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| IOT110 |	Effort
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,303	| IOT110 |	Trying to build up momentum
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| IOT110 |	Because
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| IOT110 |	It sounds like it needs
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,911	| IOT110 |	I would agree with that
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,447	| IOT110 |	So how right
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:07,007	| IOT110 |	Will test that out
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| IOT110 |	All right
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,311	| IOT110 |	One more
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,335	| IOT110 |	Kind of news bit
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,615	| IOT110 |	Totally unrelated
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| IOT110 |	2
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:15,711	| IOT110 |	Personal assistants
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:20,319	| IOT110 |	Now you are very lazy we love our assistance
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,159	| IOT110 |	Last week cloudflare
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,183	| IOT110 |	Security cam
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:31,839	| IOT110 |	I know for over baggage on covering like servers and all this other fun
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,863	| IOT110 |	Kind of it
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,911	| IOT110 |	Take it cloud computing efforts
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:37,471	| IOT110 |	Uber happened is cloudflare launched a
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,519	| IOT110 |	Iot security products
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,543	| IOT110 |	Orbitz
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:45,919	| IOT110 |	And so I had to talk to them about it because I'm always in search of new ways of thinking about IO
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,431	| IOT110 |	LT security
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,735	| IOT110 |	And the cool thing about orbit
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,271	| IOT110 |	Cloudflare is it
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,063	| IOT110 |	It's designed in such a way that it
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,855	| IOT110 |	Prevent something like
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,623	| IOT110 |	The Mirai botnet
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,439	| IOT110 |	Everybody listen up
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,999	| IOT110 |	Your devices that are unsecured today
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,535	| IOT110 |	Have a potential
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:07,423	| IOT110 |	I'll say a potential for being secured using this so what it is cloudflare basically Acts
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,959	| IOT110 |	The way they've always worked is
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,983	| IOT110 |	You point your
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,031	| IOT110 |	Your computing
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,799	| IOT110 |	To them
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| IOT110 |	And then
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,871	| IOT110 |	It's basically like a filter that's like
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,407	| IOT110 |	You don't want to go here
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:20,735	| IOT110 |	You know where you don't want to download this packet because it's from an owner
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,295	| IOT110 |	Right
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,831	| IOT110 |	So what it does is it
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,135	| IOT110 |	Taxes that filter for iot devices
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,159	| IOT110 |	And
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,975	| IOT110 |	Right now a manufacturer has to
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| IOT110 |	Put this in
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:36,095	| IOT110 |	And so it's not going to be everywhere it takes efforts and
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:41,471	| IOT110 |	It's not like if you were like a sea so at a hospital and you're like oh my God I want it I want to scare all my medical device
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:45,567	| IOT110 |	You can't right now using that unless the manufacturers elect
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,663	| IOT110 |	There's going to be
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,687	| IOT110 |	Hopefully
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,991	| IOT110 |	More adoption they're already protecting about
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,783	| IOT110 |	Is that about 20
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:58,367	| IOT110 |	5 customers and they're protecting about 120 million devices now
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,159	| IOT110 |	Basically
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,951	| IOT110 |	What happens is anything
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:07,583	| IOT110 |	This coming from a malicious place or trying to get your device to download malicious
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,607	| IOT110 |	Content
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:09,887	| IOT110 |	That's going to be
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,423	| IOT110 |	That's the
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:16,799	| IOT110 |	So the right and IRT gatekeeper of sorts from a security standpoint
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:17,311	| IOT110 |	Yes
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,591	| IOT110 |	And
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,615	| IOT110 |	I was really just a
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,895	| IOT110 |	Appointed that
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:23,455	| IOT110 |	You know you had to put this on your end device
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,759	| IOT110 |	Manufacturer eventually up there hoping to have
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,063	| IOT110 |	And SDK
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,343	| IOT110 |	And some other tools
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,623	| IOT110 |	And they haven't solved like
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,927	| IOT110 |	Like we just don't know how to solve
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,719	| IOT110 |	The problem is you're not a manufacturer secure
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,511	| IOT110 |	Thanks for working
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,023	| IOT110 |	We hope to
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,815	| IOT110 |	But they're they're just not there
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,095	| IOT110 |	So
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,887	| IOT110 |	That's what it is
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:45,727	| IOT110 |	For those of you guys who saw this announcement it was like hey what's new with iot security
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,031	| IOT110 |	It is new it's
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT110 |	It's actually very
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,079	| IOT110 |	Compelling
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,639	| IOT110 |	But it's pretty limited so far and we're hoping it's going to
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,711	| IOT110 |	Bigger better again I should also stress
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,735	| IOT110 |	This does not
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,807	| IOT110 |	Cluj you needing to actually secure
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,575	| IOT110 |	Your devices
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,343	| IOT110 |	Physical level
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:06,463	| IOT110 |	Other security steps that you need to take but this is just for
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:09,791	| IOT110 |	You know this can help make your over there updates more secure
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,327	| IOT110 |	New things are talkin out
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:11,839	| IOT110 |	The internet
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,399	| IOT110 |	And downloading things if this helps there
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,423	| IOT110 |	But that's about
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| IOT110 |	That is cloudflare
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,055	| IOT110 |	Let's get into
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,103	| IOT110 |	Real quick bit of news
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:26,175	| IOT110 |	We got an update a story that we've reported on it
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,199	| IOT110 |	Weeks back
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,479	| IOT110 |	I actually
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:28,991	| IOT110 |	Purpose tour
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,111	| IOT110 |	What disease is
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:40,511	| IOT110 |	Zara which is a company that makes software that connects and integrates not the devices they were behind the Staples connect hub
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,791	| IOT110 |	They worked with ADT
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,815	| IOT110 |	On their pulse product
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,119	| IOT110 |	An ATT was actually an investor in the
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:50,239	| IOT110 |	What happened is an acquisition went South so not needed to sell
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,007	| IOT110 |	It didn't
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,543	| IOT110 |	Sol ring
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:55,871	| IOT110 |	Basically came in and hired everybody that worked at Saint off
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,687	| IOT110 |	Or they offered them all jobs most of them went over
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:01,247	| IOT110 |	And one day they work
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,527	| IOT110 |	One day they worked at Sonic
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,807	| IOT110 |	The next day
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,319	| IOT110 |	They worked
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,367	| IOT110 |	So this was a weird deal
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:15,839	| IOT110 |	In the theory is that ring is going to use the sauna team to build and integrate their products into more places which has
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,863	| IOT110 |	Hasn't been a huge priority
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,167	| IOT110 |	So this suit
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,471	| IOT110 |	Tiles in Delaware last Friday it's a 10-count suit
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:24,799	| IOT110 |	It's accusing them of all kinds of terrible
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,871	| IOT110 |	Lake Perris the CEO
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:30,687	| IOT110 |	It's saying that he downloaded a bunch of
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:35,039	| IOT110 |	Miles before going over to ring that rightfully belong to ATT
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:37,087	| IOT110 |	So this is a 9 piece suit
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,855	| IOT110 |	They're calling
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,623	| IOT110 |	The damages
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,415	| IOT110 |	Real and imminent
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:42,207	| IOT110 |	And they cannot be calculated
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,975	| IOT110 |	IT services
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| IOT110 |	High drama
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| IOT110 |	Hainan
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:49,119	| IOT110 |	And they're asking the court to find that ring and hair is breached
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,935	| IOT110 |	Orated breaches of fiduciary duty
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,727	| IOT110 |	Tortiously interfere
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| IOT110 |	The contract
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,287	| IOT110 |	Unjustly enriched themselves in
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,359	| IOT110 |	Converted adt's assets to their own purposes
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:00,639	| IOT110 |	This is
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,319	| IOT110 |	It's always tough when you work for a
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,623	| IOT110 |	Technology company and then you go somewhere else
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:13,951	| IOT110 |	You can't forget our unknow something that you know
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:16,255	| IOT110 |	I know it's always a challenge with IP
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,047	| IOT110 |	I don't know if ring
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:20,351	| IOT110 |	New how much is on off
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:25,215	| IOT110 |	I done in conjunction with ADT in the past I'm sure they did but
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,751	| IOT110 |	Balagan how deep a level
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,287	| IOT110 |	This stuff gets messy
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,079	| IOT110 |	It does and I will say it
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,359	| IOT110 |	Majorly Messi
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,151	| IOT110 |	Because
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,735	| IOT110 |	Was a big investor in saint of
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:41,599	| IOT110 |	But they stopped caring after being acquired by private-equity firm about
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,623	| IOT110 |	Other kind of home automation
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:46,207	| IOT110 |	In this field there's been a lot of legal wrangling
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:51,839	| IOT110 |	Write like in the last year or two so there's I control that was purchased by
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:54,399	| IOT110 |	Comcast and alarm.com
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,959	| IOT110 |	There was actually a suit with eye control
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,751	| IOT110 |	I believe it was Honeywell
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:03,359	| IOT110 |	So what's happening is a lot of these security firms are like
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,895	| IOT110 |	How to keep r i p
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,455	| IOT110 |	For while we didn't know what was he
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:09,247	| IOT110 |	Happening with the Zone off IP
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,575	| IOT110 |	This is not really a sip
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,087	| IOT110 |	Price
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:20,256	| IOT110 |	In-N-Out also keep in mind that when you file a lawsuit you got to paint every what this is your your complaint is your chance to pay everyone
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,048	| IOT110 |	The biggest jerk in the face
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,096	| IOT110 |	Murder puppy
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:30,752	| IOT110 |	Paste a poison schoolchildren I need that's the level of drama
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,848	| IOT110 |	So take it all with a grain of salt
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:38,688	| IOT110 |	Singer follow this case though assuming a ghost kitchen use on
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,200	| IOT110 |	I assume
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| IOT110 |	We'll see what happens
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| IOT110 |	Exciting news in the lawsuit
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:47,904	| IOT110 |	World Air
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,464	| IOT110 |	And let's follow up with
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,768	| IOT110 |	He was last week we talked about a company called
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,280	| IOT110 |	Hubble
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,328	| IOT110 |	Idevices
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,888	| IOT110 |	Skip and Kevin and I were like
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,656	| IOT110 |	Who
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| IOT110 |	What

EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:37,728	| IOT110 |	Sponsor
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,520	| IOT110 |	This week sponsor is if
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:43,872	| IOT110 |	And today I have with me Ann mercogliano who is ifs VP of marketing
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:47,712	| IOT110 |	She's going to talk about a new way for partners to think about integrating on
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:49,760	| IOT110 |	Hello Ann
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,784	| IOT110 |	Hi Stacy
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,808	| IOT110 |	Yes
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,576	| IOT110 |	Typically the old adage
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:55,392	| IOT110 |	Has been that anybody with an API
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,416	| IOT110 |	Rihanna
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:59,744	| IOT110 |	But we decided to make it even a bit easier and think about
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:03,840	| IOT110 |	If you have an RSS feed we're happy to have you integrating how to be a service on it
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:10,496	| IOT110 |	What are the interesting use cases of why we decided about this still see many people are still in the kickstarter fundraising stage
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:15,616	| IOT110 |	They're saying API we say come on to EFT and really think about the idea of
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:19,200	| IOT110 |	Keeping in touch and growing your user base by putting in updates
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,736	| IOT110 |	Your social media
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,016	| IOT110 |	Everything about a Blog
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,552	| IOT110 |	Being able to grow that user base
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:27,904	| IOT110 |	Even using it as a form of feedback in R&D for what you're developing so when you're ready
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,696	| IOT110 |	You can already have a robust user base
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,256	| IOT110 |	Sit on it and start using your service right away
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:35,072	| IOT110 |	So what do you think the most popular way that people are going to
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,120	| IOT110 |	Use this new feature at these new news feeds
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:43,008	| IOT110 |	One thing we seen from the user side is that a lot of people like to use our news feed services
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:49,152	| IOT110 |	Just be able to kind of author information overload so the idea of saving for later so it's not just about getting an email or have
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:54,016	| IOT110 |	You know every piece of information go to your inbox you can say things to things like pocket
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:54,784	| IOT110 |	Evernote
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,088	| IOT110 |	Dropbox Google Docs whatever is your choice
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:00,160	| IOT110 |	Essentially want to be able to catch up on information
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:06,304	| IOT110 |	Digesting you're only getting what you're interested in being able to use some of those filters is another really compelling way
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,584	| IOT110 |	Everything people use us
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:13,216	| IOT110 |	Also just alerting a group we use as a test around the office is all the time we love to have in our own slack channels
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:16,800	| IOT110 |	What's going on with different news is there interesting breaking stories
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:20,128	| IOT110 |	It's a great way to kind of keep everyone informed what's going on throughout the day
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,408	| IOT110 |	All right and
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:26,016	| IOT110 |	Everyone this was so easy I actually made one of these with if
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:30,368	| IOT110 |	So you can actually enable The Internet of Things podcast RSS feed service
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,136	| IOT110 |	And you can
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:36,256	| IOT110 |	Tweet for example when there's an episode or your Hue Lights might blink when there is an episode
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,072	| IOT110 |	Have fun play with that in an
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,352	| IOT110 |	What other cool Outlets are there
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,144	| IOT110 |	Share well with your service I think
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,448	| IOT110 |	Some great things would be alerted when you have a cyst
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:45,984	| IOT110 |	Coming on your show
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,056	| IOT110 |	So you never miss an episode on what's important

EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:02,112	| IOT110 |	Just a touch of getting notification when a new iot podcast has

EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,176	| IOT110 |	Said that it charging my
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,968	| IOT110 |	Mobile devices or tablets
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:47,392	| IOT110 |	You know you can't find your charger the cord is too short to waste the charger or someone has stolen It. Whatever might be
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:50,720	| IOT110 |	And that's what we got yours about the
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,768	| IOT110 |	The wireless charging technology
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,048	| IOT110 |	So we didn't at all
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,816	| IOT110 |	Invented
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:55,840	| IOT110 |	Stupid gesture
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:58,400	| IOT110 |	Captain to the existing technology
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,424	| IOT110 |	The chief technology
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:06,080	| IOT110 |	Incorporated into our bedside tables or desk lamps
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:08,896	| IOT110 |	Made it part of Home Furnishings
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,688	| IOT110 |	Stand-alone
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:15,296	| IOT110 |	But we can help a lot of people to
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:19,136	| IOT110 |	Easily charged at home in a nice and good looking man
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:22,976	| IOT110 |	Definitely starting point for HomeSmart
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:25,280	| IOT110 |	The kitchen concept was still strong.
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:29,120	| IOT110 |	Different poster constellation within Ikea
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,144	| IOT110 |	Public golf course
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,960	| IOT110 |	It was more of an experimental and more of it
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:33,728	| IOT110 |	Concept
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:36,544	| IOT110 |	That we showcase thing that email on that 2 years ago
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,104	| IOT110 |	We got some great lunch from
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,664	| IOT110 |	That project and I think yet
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,200	| IOT110 |	Aloha Del Sol
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,784	| IOT110 |	Inside the concert that we tested there
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:50,624	| IOT110 |	Generate a lot of pictures
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,440	| IOT110 |	Will we see some smart Kitchen products come out to
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:58,304	| IOT110 |	The good thing with with HomeSmart inside Ikea Easter we have no boundaries
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:03,168	| IOT110 |	Which rooms are areas of the home that we can go to or we can talk to you in so
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:04,704	| IOT110 |	Right now we are collaborating
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:08,288	| IOT110 |	With every part of the of the home inside a Kia Soul
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:10,336	| IOT110 |	Only businesses that you see the news
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,872	| IOT110 |	Go through the store the living room
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:18,016	| IOT110 |	We are basically working with all of them so good
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,808	| IOT110 |	Kitchen stuff coming out soon
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,088	| IOT110 |	All right
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,112	| IOT110 |	I cannot wait
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,928	| IOT110 |	So let's go back to the tradfri lights
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,976	| IOT110 |	Which recently launched
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,768	| IOT110 |	Why did you guys choose
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,536	| IOT110 |	Lighting
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,328	| IOT110 |	First of all we know live
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,888	| IOT110 |	We know the importance of life
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:35,168	| IOT110 |	For the life at home
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,472	| IOT110 |	We know that a lot of
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,264	| IOT110 |	People want to change
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,824	| IOT110 |	The atmospheric layer depending on that
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,104	| IOT110 |	Activities at home
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:45,664	| IOT110 |	Because basically you want to do
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:47,200	| IOT110 |	Homework around AA
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:51,552	| IOT110 |	Dining table if you want to have that cozy Friday night dinner on that same dining table
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,112	| IOT110 |	You should have completed except
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,904	| IOT110 |	Lighting setup in order to be
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,440	| IOT110 |	Yeah prepare for that setting
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:02,560	| IOT110 |	And we know that that's a huge potential in you proving life at home
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:03,840	| IOT110 |	Using lighting
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:07,680	| IOT110 |	We took a bold statement a few years ago
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:09,728	| IOT110 |	Going all-in LED
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,288	| IOT110 |	Autumn 2016
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:19,200	| IOT110 |	Meaning that we had the precondition to explore the full potential of digital lighting
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:21,760	| IOT110 |	So
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,528	| IOT110 |	Eagles
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:25,344	| IOT110 |	I shouldn't say easy but at least
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:27,648	| IOT110 |	Daily blast from the past or golden from
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,184	| IOT110 |	LED torch
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:29,952	| IOT110 |	Smart LED
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,280	| IOT110 |	Need for it
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:35,072	| IOT110 |	So we understood that people really want
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:39,168	| IOT110 |	Feel safe at home and a great atmosphere using lighting
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,448	| IOT110 |	So that was a
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,984	| IOT110 |	Starting point for us
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:44,800	| IOT110 |	And what are some things you learned in building
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:45,824	| IOT110 |	That Prada
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:48,128	| IOT110 |	And maybe even building the wireless charger
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,688	| IOT110 |	Call Lee learned a lot of things
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,784	| IOT110 |	Project versus initiative
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:56,064	| IOT110 |	One of the greatest
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,088	| IOT110 |	Importance of
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,368	| IOT110 |	Simplicity
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,928	| IOT110 |	You take the connected home massage
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:02,208	| IOT110 |	I think it's been nuts
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:03,232	| IOT110 |	Possible
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,256	| IOT110 |	Quite a few years
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:08,352	| IOT110 |	Stop looking at smart lighting work or whatever type of connected home that were looking at
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,912	| IOT110 |	Testing a lot of frustration on
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:13,728	| IOT110 |	How complicated is today to set up
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,776	| IOT110 |	And also in terms of how
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,824	| IOT110 |	Insidious 2
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,664	| IOT110 |	Guiding principles
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,968	| IOT110 |	How to make it super simple
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:28,576	| IOT110 |	People to get curious about the connected home or connected devices
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,600	| IOT110 |	Alarm contacts
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,904	| IOT110 |	And also how can we make it really for
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,696	| IOT110 |	So I think the
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,744	| IOT110 |	The greatest learning here was to
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:40,096	| IOT110 |	Finding the starting point so we can start with a fully connected home
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:42,912	| IOT110 |	We believe that people buy a smart products
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,216	| IOT110 |	Then add another smart product and
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,008	| IOT110 |	Suddenly God created your own
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:49,568	| IOT110 |	Rancho Park in the home and you get
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:52,896	| IOT110 |	More exploratorium edu connecting them together
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,456	| IOT110 |	Suddenly you're evolving towards a connected home
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:57,504	| IOT110 |	But you don't start by buying it for me
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,528	| IOT110 |	Connected
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,600	| IOT110 |	I think you're right that seems to be the journey
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:03,648	| IOT110 |	Hopefully soon to be less fraught
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,416	| IOT110 |	Frustration
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:05,184	| IOT110 |	Now
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,464	| IOT110 |	In looking at
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,744	| IOT110 |	The lighting
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:10,048	| IOT110 |	Kevin and I were talking about it a few weeks ago
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,584	| IOT110 |	I was like
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:17,984	| IOT110 |	Very concerned about security cuz I'm like yeah I hope you did this rate I hope you did this well because there's so much bad
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,032	| IOT110 |	Iot security
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:22,848	| IOT110 |	And it turns out you guys did
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:26,432	| IOT110 |	But in part one of the ways that you did it appears to be
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:28,480	| IOT110 |	Keeping it a closed ecosystem for now
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,272	| IOT110 |	I'm just kind of curious about
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,576	| IOT110 |	How you guys approach security
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,112	| IOT110 |	And the idea of the
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,672	| IOT110 |	Yeah I should start up
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:39,744	| IOT110 |	So thankful for having you
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:43,584	| IOT110 |	I think it's a we took today
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,888	| IOT110 |	Security aspects of Courts
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:50,752	| IOT110 |	Very seriously and we enter that dilemma with with great respect
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:54,336	| IOT110 |	And I'm the team put a lot of effort into
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:55,616	| IOT110 |	Finding the best
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:59,712	| IOT110 |	Apartments all dogs how to take the color out to make it to a
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:01,248	| IOT110 |	Secure systems
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,528	| IOT110 |	User-friendly
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,320	| IOT110 |	So I think
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:08,160	| IOT110 |	Really good job and yeah reading the reviews
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:12,768	| IOT110 |	Forever grateful that the music turned out well.
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:16,352	| IOT110 |	To the extent that we thought so real happy for that
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:18,144	| IOT110 |	Also saying that
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,936	| IOT110 |	Our intention is not to be closed
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:25,568	| IOT110 |	We we think that's the one of the major success factors in the connected home Easter.
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,616	| IOT110 |	I have good friends
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,408	| IOT110 |	K24
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:32,736	| IOT110 |	Seamless user experience in the home so
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:37,344	| IOT110 |	I think the more we can work together with with partners and and other players that use you're in a better way
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,440	| IOT110 |	It's on our journey for short tube
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:43,744	| IOT110 |	To make sure that we eat the open up in that direction
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:48,096	| IOT110 |	Okay any time frame or mechanism for this like an API
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:52,192	| IOT110 |	I compliment to give you a time friends but just to say that we are
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:54,240	| IOT110 |	Very good sir.
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:57,824	| IOT110 |	A good partner to collaborate with in the NHL standings in the states
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:35:59,616	| IOT110 |	Got meatballs
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,920	| IOT110 |	Okay
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:02,944	| IOT110 |	So
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:06,272	| IOT110 |	The other thing that Kevin and I talked about actually
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,832	| IOT110 |	After I was like please don't screw security up
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,600	| IOT110 |	Was
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:14,208	| IOT110 |	That you guys really have the opportunity in your stores to showcase
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,512	| IOT110 |	A smart home in a very compelling way that I think
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,536	| IOT110 |	Is lost
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,304	| IOT110 |	Actually
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,864	| IOT110 |	I shouldn't say lost a lot of retailers been trying
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,144	| IOT110 |	And figure out how to show off
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,168	| IOT110 |	The Smart Home
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,448	| IOT110 |	To their customers to get them
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:26,752	| IOT110 |	Interested in also just to educate
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:31,360	| IOT110 |	So how are you guys thinking about building that experience into
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,384	| IOT110 |	Your stores
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:33,920	| IOT110 |	Well I think it's
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,992	| IOT110 |	Fantastic opportunity man we have
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:41,600	| IOT110 |	More than 900 million visiting customers every year trust or Sunday
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:43,904	| IOT110 |	It's a great opportunity of course to have access
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:49,024	| IOT110 |	And of course we we will try to build there
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:54,400	| IOT110 |	Living room sets where you can experience the smart home and that we know that touch-and-feel is
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,192	| IOT110 |	OSHA when it comes to
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:37:00,800	| IOT110 |	The last message we just released for example
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:07,200	| IOT110 |	It's almost in that feeling when you switch that little nugget and I'm using the lights go
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:11,040	| IOT110 |	So we will try to build it
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:14,624	| IOT110 |	Intuitive any drafted station as possible in the store environment
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,464	| IOT110 |	It does take you quite a bit to
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:21,024	| IOT110 |	Walk you through the phone store so
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:26,144	| IOT110 |	It needs to be there if you want to play with it will give us some play areas and that we will also make them
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:29,472	| IOT110 |	Easy to grasp and use it to buy if you just have to grab them by in
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,568	| IOT110 |	Before coming to the store
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,640	| IOT110 |	But it's a great opportunity and we have to
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:39,456	| IOT110 |	Barely started yet
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,248	| IOT110 |	I agree
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:45,088	| IOT110 |	How to customers in the store in maybe online in general
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,392	| IOT110 |	How are they reacting to these
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,416	| IOT110 |	Kind of smart products
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:53,024	| IOT110 |	Do they see them in the store and buy them do they do their research ahead of time
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:54,560	| IOT110 |	What are demographics look like
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:58,400	| IOT110 |	So far we have seen that a lot of people to the
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:37:59,424	| IOT110 |	Homework online
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,704	| IOT110 |	Prior to the storm
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,824	| IOT110 |	The majority of customers
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:08,384	| IOT110 |	The know about the Detroit Red Wings before they
EDL	00:38:08,896	00:38:09,664	| IOT110 |	Sheet in the store
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,456	| IOT110 |	Bubbles Salon
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,504	| IOT110 |	Not exclude the ones who are
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,784	| IOT110 |	Maybe looking for
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:16,832	| IOT110 |	Just a lightbulb going to come to the store
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,880	| IOT110 |	And after
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:22,976	| IOT110 |	Sympathy 27 LED
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:25,792	| IOT110 |	Maybe they progressing there and
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:29,632	| IOT110 |	Knowledge level and the Curious stand there and see how they
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,936	| IOT110 |	Might get interested in
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:32,960	| IOT110 |	It's most likely just
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:36,288	| IOT110 |	Wendell buying a lightbulb so I think there's a little bit of a difference
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:39,360	| IOT110 |	Customer Journeys if you are
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,384	| IOT110 |	Curious about the
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:42,688	| IOT110 |	The Smart Homes from the starting point
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:44,480	| IOT110 |	Say goodbye
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,856	| IOT110 |	She's at people can man
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:52,416	| IOT110 |	Engaged
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,952	| IOT110 |	Coming from Los Angeles
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,768	| IOT110 |	And as you open up the platform
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:39:00,096	| IOT110 |	Are we going to see other devices Maybe
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:03,680	| IOT110 |	In your retail experience with your partners and that sort of thing
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:04,960	| IOT110 |	Will you go deaf
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:11,616	| IOT110 |	More products coming out from Ikea smart lighting is nothing in destination for us I would say that
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,664	| IOT110 |	First of all
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:14,688	| IOT110 |	Smart lighting Products.
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:16,736	| IOT110 |	Is in the store today
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:22,368	| IOT110 |	Is only the starting point we will of course expand base range
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:23,392	| IOT110 |	Get more rich
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:24,160	| IOT110 |	In this range
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,816	| IOT110 |	But that we will tap into the same TracFone
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:33,376	| IOT110 |	If you're asking if we will see
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:37,472	| IOT110 |	Third-party product or products from other vendors inside Ikea.
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:43,104	| IOT110 |	Highly unlikely we are quite strict about only selling Ikea parts stores today
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:44,384	| IOT110 |	That is true
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,920	| IOT110 |	That's why I was like
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:47,200	| IOT110 |	Dad in the meatballs in
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:47,712	| IOT110 |	And Lincoln buried
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:49,504	| IOT110 |	Delicious
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:54,880	| IOT110 |	Chocolate could be good for you to know that we are selling 2.9 Million
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,256	| IOT110 |	Okay
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,048	| IOT110 |	That is a lot of meat
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:04,352	| IOT110 |	As you guys
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:06,912	| IOT110 |	Build connectivity in the more products
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:09,984	| IOT110 |	And even with the tables that have Qi wireless charging
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,776	| IOT110 |	How do you think about
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:13,824	| IOT110 |	Putting technology which may have like
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,408	| IOT110 |	Three to five-year lifespan
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:17,920	| IOT110 |	Into
EDL	00:40:18,432	00:40:19,968	| IOT110 |	Your furniture witch
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:21,248	| IOT110 |	I assume has a longer life
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:26,112	| IOT110 |	It's a good answer that you bring up on me let me develop
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:26,880	| IOT110 |	Ikea Warehouse
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,184	| IOT110 |	Formula call Democratic design
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,256	| IOT110 |	Wait 5S
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,328	| IOT110 |	The Equalizer
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,864	| IOT110 |	Function
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:37,632	| IOT110 |	Quality
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:39,936	| IOT110 |	DeAngelo price
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:40,960	| IOT110 |	Those on the side
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:43,776	| IOT110 |	Always
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,080	| IOT110 |	Judging evaluation we developed
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:52,736	| IOT110 |	And of course I thought I can be recycled and and also what the chair just made up
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:57,856	| IOT110 |	The one aspect of course also
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,392	| IOT110 |	Table top cradle
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,928	| IOT110 |	Clicking no kick-out
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:03,744	| IOT110 |	So that's how we see the wireless charging
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:04,768	| IOT110 |	Solution
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:12,192	| IOT110 |	All the solutions that we are put out that mean you can basically mean it's almost a replaceable part that you can upgrade overtime
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:14,752	| IOT110 |	So you can keep the piece of furniture in MD
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,544	| IOT110 |	Work with the electronics SM
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,568	| IOT110 |	Usher more than module
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,360	| IOT110 |	When it comes to the
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,152	| IOT110 |	Connected products
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:23,200	| IOT110 |	We see a great opportunity
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:25,760	| IOT110 |	Using the Ikea Gateway because that's how we can
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,808	| IOT110 |	How you can download the latest
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:30,368	| IOT110 |	Firmware with the latest software from Mac Thomas
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:35,744	| IOT110 |	So hopefully making sure that the products are always up-to-date with the latest technology in the latest
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,768	| IOT110 |	Play the song
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:40,096	| IOT110 |	So why we hope that the lifetime of the product is going to be
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:46,240	| IOT110 |	Appropriate weight needs to be in order to being a sustainable product overtime
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:48,544	| IOT110 |	Along with sustainability
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:50,848	| IOT110 |	How are you guys thinking about
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:54,431	| IOT110 |	Reducing waste because I know that is a big function for you guys
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,199	| IOT110 |	When
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:59,295	| IOT110 |	You got these electronic components that often times have heavy metals and can't be
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:02,879	| IOT110 |	Tossed easy or shouldn't be too hot too easily
EDL	00:42:02,879	00:42:05,695	| IOT110 |	Are you guys thinking about programs to take that back or
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,743	| IOT110 |	How are you going to communicate that with
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:08,255	| IOT110 |	Your customers
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:11,583	| IOT110 |	Yes it is something we are
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,607	| IOT110 |	Lily Garden
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:20,031	| IOT110 |	Boats in every aspect of the value chain
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,311	| IOT110 |	Less every year
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:26,687	| IOT110 |	Recycling fossil have programs in place so we can
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:32,831	| IOT110 |	Recycled products or we use the products that at the end of life for when you are at the end of their life
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,647	| IOT110 |	You have a big program out
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:39,487	| IOT110 |	Alarm circularity we're looking into aspects of how we can take back
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:40,767	| IOT110 |	Mattresses
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,303	| IOT110 |	Whatever you can be
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,351	| IOT110 |	Okay yes cuz
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:50,495	| IOT110 |	I'm sitting there thinking about like my smart light bulbs that I've already had some of the LEDs that should last
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,287	| IOT110 |	3 years
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,311	| IOT110 |	Eminem like
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,847	| IOT110 |	I throw this out
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,639	| IOT110 |	Now I have to stem light bulb what do I do with it
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:57,663	| IOT110 |	This is
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:00,735	| IOT110 |	A first world problem
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:03,295	| IOT110 |	But I think it's also interesting
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:09,951	| IOT110 |	Opportunity for thinking about the LED light bulbs that you take YouTube
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:12,255	| IOT110 |	For 25 years
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:13,791	| IOT110 |	Ikea
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:15,327	| IOT110 |	If you open 2 years ago
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:22,495	| IOT110 |	20 years left on them it's a great
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:24,287	| IOT110 |	By and it's a great little
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:25,567	| IOT110 |	Secondhand opportunity
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:27,871	| IOT110 |	All right
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:28,639	| IOT110 |	Guys
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:31,199	| IOT110 |	I'm going to start Stacy II headlight bulb store
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:31,967	| IOT110 |	Just after this
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:33,759	| IOT110 |	All right
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:37,855	| IOT110 |	So you talked a little bit about extending the range of your light bulbs line
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,879	| IOT110 |	Does that mean
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:41,183	| IOT110 |	Colored light bulbs or different
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:45,791	| IOT110 |	Formfactor so not maybe the traditionally nineteen's or what what can I be
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,071	| IOT110 |	What should I expect
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:48,607	| IOT110 |	Planning my smart home
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,375	| IOT110 |	Around Ikea
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:53,727	| IOT110 |	Yeah so first of all you want to make sure that we have every socket size 2
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:57,823	| IOT110 |	Survival apps
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:44:01,151	| IOT110 |	Chick 63147
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:02,943	| IOT110 |	Exploring
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:08,063	| IOT110 |	What type of color temperatures are we we should have for a home furnishing a state
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:10,623	| IOT110 |	Today we are
EDL	00:44:10,623	00:44:11,903	| IOT110 |	Having a ball
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:13,695	| IOT110 |	Three levels of
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:17,023	| IOT110 |	Whitestone going from the lights to the neutral White
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:20,607	| IOT110 |	We are extorting you
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:24,959	| IOT110 |	If that is sufficient
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,567	| IOT110 |	Just play around with these three tones
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:32,383	| IOT110 |	In home furnishing context it makes a huge difference
EDL	00:44:32,383	00:44:33,663	| IOT110 |	2
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:37,503	| IOT110 |	We'll see how we go there
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:41,087	| IOT110 |	Right now I feel like there are a lot of really cool Technologies
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,623	| IOT110 |	That are being
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:45,439	| IOT110 |	Incorporate into the things like Fabrics or
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:47,487	| IOT110 |	Haptic research there's a lot of
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:53,375	| IOT110 |	Is a lot of cool stuff going on and I just be curious what kind of Technologies are you guys looking at in thinking
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:55,423	| IOT110 |	Wow this is exciting
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:56,703	| IOT110 |	Well I think
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,983	| IOT110 |	The luxury of working
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:01,311	| IOT110 |	Inaki I used to have our own
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:06,175	| IOT110 |	Material Development Department department for new technologies and so on
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,711	| IOT110 |	So we have access
EDL	00:45:07,711	00:45:12,831	| IOT110 |	I agree with you
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:15,135	| IOT110 |	Fabrics and textiles and
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:15,903	| IOT110 |	Smart textiles
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:18,975	| IOT110 |	So what we definitely take to explain that area
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:21,023	| IOT110 |	One thing we are very hard on him
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,631	| IOT110 |	Seville custom
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:27,679	| IOT110 |	So
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,447	| IOT110 |	Chico State

EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,543	| IOT110 |	Want to play around with
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:33,567	| IOT110 |	So we are
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:36,895	| IOT110 |	The Reel made for it before we launch
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,431	| IOT110 |	And also we compare
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:42,271	| IOT110 |	A solution with an analogue Solutions
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:45,087	| IOT110 |	So it makes sense that whatever we put out there

EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,231	| IOT110 |	Superior
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:54,815	| IOT110 |	Look Solutions out there so we are exploring
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,095	| IOT110 |	For sure
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:46:01,215	| IOT110 |	Sensors and how we can get the how we can get some Architects dolls
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:05,823	| IOT110 |	Evaluate this woman two and three times before we actually
EDL	00:46:06,847	00:46:07,615	| IOT110 |	That's probably why
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:10,943	| IOT110 |	There's a lot of things out there that I'm like
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:19,903	| IOT110 |	Way to calm down and hold off on that
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:20,415	| IOT110 |	Protest it
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:23,231	| IOT110 |	I will have to stop by my nearest Ikea
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:24,511	| IOT110 |	And
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:26,303	| IOT110 |	Consume some meatballs and also
