EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:36,000	| IOT008 |	We shall see in Target stores
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:37,536	| IOT008 |	A new
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:39,584	| IOT008 |	Home automation Center
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:42,656	| IOT008 |	I we know actually that it will host a
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:46,752	| IOT008 |	Piper home all-in-one home security system but we don't know what else is going to be in there
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:50,080	| IOT008 |	8 feet of shelf Space 2
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,616	| IOT008 |	Other home automation products
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:58,784	| IOT008 |	That is very good because that is a sign of a further sign I guess I should say of the home automation
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:01,088	| IOT008 |	Smart home sector going more mainstream
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,112	| IOT008 |	Do you want to do
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:05,440	| IOT008 |	Cooler Simon is going mainstream I picked up a market
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:06,464	| IOT008 |	Stewart Living
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,744	| IOT008 |	And you know what was in it
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,048	| IOT008 |	Was like eight devices that will
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:14,144	| IOT008 |	Save you money and make your home smarter and it was like the August locks
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,680	| IOT008 |	There's a Dropcam
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,192	| IOT008 |	There they were
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,776	| IOT008 |	I didn't recognize the thermostat they had chosen
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:20,800	| IOT008 |	But
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:24,640	| IOT008 |	There were several devices that we talked about on the show and I was like
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,408	| IOT008 |	Go Martha
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:30,272	| IOT008 |	I'm guessing she didn't have August locks where she was before she came back out of
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,296	| IOT008 |	Wonder Man
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,368	| IOT008 |	Do not talk to not speak ill of Martha
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:38,720	| IOT008 |	Don't don't the backtalk don't sass the most but do not
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,280	| IOT008 |	August lock when she was in prison August was
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,328	| IOT008 |	Interjet
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,352	| IOT008 |	I know I know
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,912	| IOT008 |	Now has an
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:47,936	| IOT008 |	Home automation section
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,472	| IOT008 |	I will say
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:53,824	| IOT008 |	As someone who visits the home automation section in her local Staples
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,872	| IOT008 |	Home Depot a lot
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,664	| IOT008 |	I'm going to hope
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,176	| IOT008 |	That
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,736	| IOT008 |	Target keeps there's a little bit better stock
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,832	| IOT008 |	Dehumanization section in my Home Depot is
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,856	| IOT008 |	Constantly
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| IOT008 |	Picked over and
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:12,512	| IOT008 |	A lot of the time it's an incap and it mostly has the wink products and then
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:17,376	| IOT008 |	The Nest stuff in the rest of stuff is kind of spread throughout the store I find
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,216	| IOT008 |	And I've been in my Staples and I've looked around and
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,264	| IOT008 |	You know it looks like they have
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:25,056	| IOT008 |	The right idea with the hole
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,360	| IOT008 |	Cluster of smart home stuff but
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| IOT008 |	It just
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:32,224	| IOT008 |	Doesn't it just kind of feel like it's tucked in a corner to me all the time and yes it's a little
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:37,856	| IOT008 |	In disarray when everytime I go as well so like I don't quite understand that but
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,440	| IOT008 |	I was hoping it was Staples has the stuff
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,976	| IOT008 |	Actually hooked into like a
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,280	| IOT008 |	I'm trying to think of the words
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:51,424	| IOT008 |	There's a demo area kind of like so you can press buttons and make lights go on and what not I was the one wanted that I visit
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,544	| IOT008 |	So that's that's actually nice Home Depot doesn't seem to have a lot of Education
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| IOT008 |	So
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,872	| IOT008 |	And I haven't actually been to Best Buy
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,640	| IOT008 |	In Forever
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,944	| IOT008 |	So I have to go check out Best Buy
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,224	| IOT008 |	This in Target's wants it stopped
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,784	| IOT008 |	Report back on who has the best
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,320	| IOT008 |	Retail experience for the smartphone
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,648	| IOT008 |	That's a good idea you guys can also tell us
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,208	| IOT008 |	Your thoughts at info
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,000	| IOT008 |	Iot podcast. Com

EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,583	| IOT008 |	News
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,119	| IOT008 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,167	| IOT008 |	Collector cars Kevin
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:26,495	| IOT008 |	Oh yeah there's a sexy topic for you because
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:32,895	| IOT008 |	It is interesting most of the of the gross now for the carrier's is not coming from smartphones because hey pretty much everybody
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| IOT008 |	We have one in the US
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,967	| IOT008 |	Tablets that are actually the big
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:43,135	| IOT008 |	Addition I guess when you look at net subscribers and left in the first quarter of the year and we have some data for
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,463	| IOT008 |	Good buddy Chetan Sharma you just had his quarterly
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,999	| IOT008 |	Us mobile market
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| IOT008 |	Date
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:49,535	| IOT008 |	I came out
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,583	| IOT008 |	And some interesting bits that
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| IOT008 |	Came out
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,423	| IOT008 |	To my eyes were that machine-to-machine
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,727	| IOT008 |	Connections and car connections
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:02,335	| IOT008 |	Accounted for 39% of the total net additions for all the carriers
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:05,407	| IOT008 |	And who's the leader here it looks like it's AT&T which
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,735	| IOT008 |	Probably not a surprise if people have read our past coverage
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,527	| IOT008 |	Over the years of
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,807	| IOT008 |	M2M stuff with
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:15,391	| IOT008 |	AT&T connected car business will be a billion dollar
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,695	| IOT008 |	Revenue generator this year says chatting
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,487	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,023	| IOT008 |	That's pretty impressive attack
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:26,655	| IOT008 |	Out of the 1.2 million Wireless net additions in the first three months of this year
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,447	| IOT008 |	684000
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,471	| IOT008 |	Were cars
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:32,543	| IOT008 |	Which was 62% of their total net add so
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:35,359	| IOT008 |	That's a big deal I mean a billion dollar
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,895	| IOT008 |	Revenue generator right there
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,455	| IOT008 |	Yes and that was a lot of numbers right there
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,015	| IOT008 |	That's a billion dollars out of
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,855	| IOT008 |	The whole cell phone industry or AT&T is total
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,159	| IOT008 |	Do you have AT&T is total
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,207	| IOT008 |	Revenue for the quarter
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,975	| IOT008 |	Or for the year
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:54,303	| IOT008 |	I don't have it for the year
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:57,631	| IOT008 |	I do not have it for the years I don't know what percentage of This Is Us
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,423	| IOT008 |	I was looking at it more along the lines of
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:03,775	| IOT008 |	You don't currently it's if the biggest cruise driver and their net additions
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,311	| IOT008 |	It is certainly big
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,079	| IOT008 |	I'm not going to say
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,639	| IOT008 |	AT&T has clients like Tesla
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,663	| IOT008 |	So
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| IOT008 |	I would buy a Tesla
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:14,271	| IOT008 |	Although I will say
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,087	| IOT008 |	Having I am kind of shopping around for a new car
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,391	| IOT008 |	And actually just last week
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,159	| IOT008 |	Boa
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,207	| IOT008 |	Obama administration or rather
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,487	| IOT008 |	The department of
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,767	| IOT008 |	Asportation actually
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| IOT008 |	Fast Track
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,839	| IOT008 |	The vehicle to vehicle
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,119	| IOT008 |	Wireless communication
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,143	| IOT008 |	Which is
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,447	| IOT008 |	It's it's in the
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,727	| IOT008 |	Wi-Fi band
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,519	| IOT008 |	Turn the upper levels to Wi-Fi Beyond
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:38,847	| IOT008 |	And it's basically a wireless communication protocol
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,639	| IOT008 |	It's going to let cars
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,407	| IOT008 |	Talk to each other
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,991	| IOT008 |	And basically the idea is they'll be able to say like
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,271	| IOT008 |	I'm here I'm here
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,295	| IOT008 |	Don't hit me don't hit me
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| IOT008 |	And ideas
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| IOT008 |	They're going to mandate this
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,671	| IOT008 |	Come into vehicles
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:55,231	| IOT008 |	Starting in 2017
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| IOT008 |	And then
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,047	| IOT008 |	Delta start adding it into vehicles
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,863	| IOT008 |	It's going to be awhile before that is
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,631	| IOT008 |	Real
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:05,215	| IOT008 |	So there's car-to-car talking so that's Vita V is what they're calling it
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,263	| IOT008 |	There's vehicle-to-infrastructure
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,287	| IOT008 |	And that's like
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,055	| IOT008 |	Cars talking
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,079	| IOT008 |	Signs
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,591	| IOT008 |	Toll booth
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:12,895	| IOT008 |	Some cells
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:16,223	| IOT008 |	That'll dovetails with the autonomous cars though that's
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,503	| IOT008 |	Way down the line
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,039	| IOT008 |	I think it in terms of mainstream
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:23,903	| IOT008 |	But in the meantime there's a nice stepping stone to get the car's a little bit smarter so that
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,719	| IOT008 |	When one of them that's three cars ahead of you suddenly breaks
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,047	| IOT008 |	The cars behind it already know even if the driver can't see that
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,327	| IOT008 |	Gdb
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,911	| IOT008 |	It actually Dia caddies
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:39,519	| IOT008 |	The caddy CTS with a fancy high and Cadillacs will actually have Vita vea
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,287	| IOT008 |	In those cars
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,823	| IOT008 |	Start in 2017
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,383	| IOT008 |	Sober as a
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,919	| IOT008 |	Person who right now in
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:49,759	| IOT008 |	In 2015 and maybe the 2016 models is looking at cars
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,063	| IOT008 |	I'm looking at all this technology
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:56,927	| IOT008 |	Even even LTE and trying to look at like what kind of car tag is going to be there
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:01,023	| IOT008 |	I'm like holy cow maybe I should start leasing my vehicle cuz
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,815	| IOT008 |	My Korean car
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:07,423	| IOT008 |	Which element guys I bought it in 2005 doesn't even have Bluetooth
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,727	| IOT008 |	And I've had it for 10 years now
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,543	| IOT008 |	I'm like Oh my goodness
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:16,639	| IOT008 |	If I keep my next car that I buy you know in 2016 for 10 years
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,687	| IOT008 |	Be like a dinosaur
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,759	| IOT008 |	All the other cars are going to be talking at talking about it behind its back
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,599	| IOT008 |	Bluetooth that's like so 2006 I mean come on
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,647	| IOT008 |	We're talking about car to car WiFi
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:31,487	| IOT008 |	So just think about that I am curious and I'll let you guys know is
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:34,047	| IOT008 |	This journey for a new car Progressive
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,839	| IOT008 |	But the wireless tech
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,631	| IOT008 |	In the car connectivity
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,191	| IOT008 |	Even even talking to you
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,239	| IOT008 |	Getting getting my wireless access
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:44,799	| IOT008 |	It's kind of complicated
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,335	| IOT008 |	I'm leaving bye
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:53,247	| IOT008 |	That's a good question. Cuz and it's funny because I release on the 2013 Chevy Volt actually runs out in October
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| IOT008 |	Uber so we're going to be looking at something
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,319	| IOT008 |	And chances are really look at
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| IOT008 |	2016 volt
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,623	| IOT008 |	With the new
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,647	| IOT008 |	I can look at a tattoo
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,439	| IOT008 |	It's new it's new
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| IOT008 |	Redesigned
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:07,327	| IOT008 |	Has a fake V seat in the back but that's not going to go there right now, but more importantly
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,119	| IOT008 |	More battery range and so on and
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,703	| IOT008 |	Eric nicely with our solar panels on the roof I just don't
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,751	| IOT008 |	Know if they have
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,055	| IOT008 |	4G LTE Connections in there I think
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,615	| IOT008 |	General Motors has been pretty hot and heavy on that though
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,151	| IOT008 |	They have I am
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,663	| IOT008 |	I'm pretty sure it does
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:25,759	| IOT008 |	I get it I don't know I don't know if I want another bill
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,039	| IOT008 |	That that is
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:28,575	| IOT008 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:32,671	| IOT008 |	All right so we will discuss that I'm sure in the future
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,439	| IOT008 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| IOT008 |	Let's talk about
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:39,327	| IOT008 |	This crazy dude this is more businesstech but we're going to talk about how
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,351	| IOT008 |	It might apply to
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:40,863	| IOT008 |	Consumer home
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:41,887	| IOT008 |	Which is
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,935	| IOT008 |	Honeywell
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| IOT008 |	Command wall
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,751	| IOT008 |	I think this is
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,847	| IOT008 |	I think this is like really cool but I also think this is overkill
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,615	| IOT008 |	And so
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| IOT008 |	What this is
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,431	| IOT008 |	Honeywell on Tuesday
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,711	| IOT008 |	Announced a
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:02,623	| IOT008 |	Who called they call it this man while I look at is like the touchscreen that's in Minority Report or any other science fiction
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,695	| IOT008 |	The movie where you get the characters and they're facing this giant
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,487	| IOT008 |	Screen in there just like
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:11,583	| IOT008 |	Blinking data left and right in the funny video screen and things are popping up
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,095	| IOT008 |	It's amazing
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,399	| IOT008 |	That is exactly what the
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,215	| IOT008 |	And the cool thing about it is
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,311	| IOT008 |	It's infinitely customizable and you pull in
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,615	| IOT008 |	Data it's design for commercial buildings
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:27,199	| IOT008 |	They got it customers right now who are trying it include
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,503	| IOT008 |	Landmark skyscrapers
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,551	| IOT008 |	Data centers Airport
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,319	| IOT008 |	Hospitals
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:35,135	| IOT008 |	These customers are integrating
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,159	| IOT008 |	Bear
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,743	| IOT008 |	Access control so there sit there security systems
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:40,767	| IOT008 |	There
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| IOT008 |	Video camera feed
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,887	| IOT008 |	Basic HVAC stuff to
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,679	| IOT008 |	Yes sensor data HVAC
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,727	| IOT008 |	Employee records in there other like
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:55,615	| IOT008 |	Their own customer files in their also bringing in outside data like Google Maps data or
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:58,687	| IOT008 |	Files they might get from like law enforcement or
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,967	| IOT008 |	Publicly available Act
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:06,111	| IOT008 |	They're pulling it all this data to create basically their own Dash
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,159	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,951	| IOT008 |	Kind of amazing
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,719	| IOT008 |	To see it now
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,583	| IOT008 |	It it actually isn't surprising that is coming from Honeywell
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:19,423	| IOT008 |	For one because I wouldn't call them a cutting-edge it type company
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:22,239	| IOT008 |	I watch the video maybe we can link to in the show notes
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:27,359	| IOT008 |	It's really neat because all of these different smart devices and door sensors and such
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:32,479	| IOT008 |	You just tap on them like say you tap on an icon of a video camera and boom the feed just pops up right there
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:37,343	| IOT008 |	There's all these little touch points in and information flowing all over the place here in
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:42,463	| IOT008 |	Yo I remember working in it and data centers for almost 15 years before I started writing and
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,583	| IOT008 |	You know I had a dashboard that may help me manage servers and routers and such but this is like
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,887	| IOT008 |	A hundred times beyond that I'm in this is this is just
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,191	| IOT008 |	Out there it looks really nice
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,263	| IOT008 |	And it's worth noting that Honeywell will work
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:59,871	| IOT008 |	It will work with Honeywell sensors but it'll also work with Honeywell competitors and
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| IOT008 |	As for
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,711	| IOT008 |	The date of its pulling in it pulls it in VA
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,015	| IOT008 |	Barry's apis and it
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,295	| IOT008 |	Attempts to pull it in
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| IOT008 |	Like from other data formats
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:13,439	| IOT008 |	It's crazy that it's coming from
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,975	| IOT008 |	Building management kind of
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:15,999	| IOT008 |	Bender
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:19,839	| IOT008 |	I'm as opposed to an IT company but maybe that's because
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,375	| IOT008 |	These guys don't have skin in the game
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,703	| IOT008 |	But I would love to see something like this
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,471	| IOT008 |	In my house
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:30,079	| IOT008 |	Best Buy sells a home hub system called the peak
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:32,383	| IOT008 |	And it has it actually
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,199	| IOT008 |	Similar user interface that can show you
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,759	| IOT008 |	Kind of what's happening in your home and they have a
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| IOT008 |	Partnership with zube
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,575	| IOT008 |	Which is
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,367	| IOT008 |	A device you can stick in your
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,135	| IOT008 |	Cars
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,159	| IOT008 |	Diagnostics port
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,439	| IOT008 |	And that
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:51,327	| IOT008 |	Will show you where someone's car is in real time so if you have a teenage driver for example
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,631	| IOT008 |	You can see their car
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:55,167	| IOT008 |	From the dashboard
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:55,935	| IOT008 |	The peak
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,471	| IOT008 |	Witches
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,495	| IOT008 |	It's kind of this idea
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:04,895	| IOT008 |	Really cool if you could throw that up on kind of like your TV screen or just like a dedicated screen
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,431	| IOT008 |	In your house
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,735	| IOT008 |	Instead of having to go through the peak dashboard
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:12,575	| IOT008 |	And then maybe you could combine it with your Evernote shopping list or
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:14,111	| IOT008 |	You know any other system
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:19,231	| IOT008 |	Yeah I mean this is this is like a dashboard too. Oh and this is this is impressive
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,023	| IOT008 |	I've kind of really really excited
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,583	| IOT008 |	But maybe that's just
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:29,471	| IOT008 |	Me and my desire My Desire for customizable dashboards I'm surprised I'm really am I'm really surprised that we don't have something
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,495	| IOT008 |	It's already
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,287	| IOT008 |	It's kind of sad for
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,847	| IOT008 |	Well yummy when you see it it's like
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:39,455	| IOT008 |	It's like common sense I mean through all these things together get them talking to each other
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,039	| IOT008 |	Get the Data Vault easily touchable and viewable and everything else
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,087	| IOT008 |	Tok why is anybody else doing this
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:49,183	| IOT008 |	There is an app called numerous it's actually iOS only
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,719	| IOT008 |	And they
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,255	| IOT008 |	They pulling any
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,535	| IOT008 |	Number related data
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,839	| IOT008 |	And they throw it up on a tablet
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,375	| IOT008 |	Kind of Anna dashboard
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:58,655	| IOT008 |	So that's
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,447	| IOT008 |	Sort of like
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,751	| IOT008 |	That and I think they have some sort of
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,775	| IOT008 |	Watch integration
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| IOT008 |	But
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| IOT008 |	Again
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,103	| IOT008 |	Not nearly
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,895	| IOT008 |	Is open
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,407	| IOT008 |	Or
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| IOT008 |	Seemingly is flexible
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,271	| IOT008 |	I have not played with this
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:19,391	| IOT008 |	I do not own it landmarks guys can a hospital or an airport
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,415	| IOT008 |	But
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| IOT008 |	I would really like to
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,303	| IOT008 |	Will work on that will do a Kickstarter for you
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,327	| IOT008 |	Stacey would like to own an air

EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:34,239	| IOT008 |	That's maybe I should just call Honeywell and see if I can get one
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:39,359	| IOT008 |	Maybe I haven't made it to let you take over somebody else's sky scraper for a day

EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,319	| IOT008 |	Are we ready for our Innovative Lee named
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| IOT008 |	Segment
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,367	| IOT008 |	New segment
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,903	| IOT008 |	What's it called
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,415	| IOT008 |	It's the
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,719	| IOT008 |	5-minute review
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,535	| IOT008 |	Oh I like your
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,559	| IOT008 |	You do what you do are sounded
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,375	| IOT008 |	All right
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,143	| IOT008 |	Kevin I
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,167	| IOT008 |	You've got our
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,191	| IOT008 |	Review of the week
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:08,031	| IOT008 |	I do it's it's actually a
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,079	| IOT008 |	Website and online database
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,615	| IOT008 |	As it were of
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,919	| IOT008 |	Smart Home Products and super useful
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:18,015	| IOT008 |	If you want to see it you want to go to smart home db.com
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,319	| IOT008 |	When you go there you'll see this
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,111	| IOT008 |	Online database of various
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,927	| IOT008 |	Home Smart Home components
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,695	| IOT008 |	Hubs
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,999	| IOT008 |	Product reviews
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,815	| IOT008 |	If there's all kinds of views
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,351	| IOT008 |	Citizens online database
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,167	| IOT008 |	They slice and dice is information anyway you want it so
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,959	| IOT008 |	Do you want to see what's compatible with
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:40,031	| IOT008 |	IOS or Android you can just click the compatibilities tab
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,871	| IOT008 |	Start picking up products and we'll tell you what works with your ear
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,663	| IOT008 |	Smartphone operating system for example
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:51,807	| IOT008 |	I'm thirsty does the same thing with apps with companies and just products in general that are related to Smart Homes
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,855	| IOT008 |	Also nice is
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:57,183	| IOT008 |	Product reviews by people who actually have bought these products
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:02,047	| IOT008 |	So we know you can take a look and see the Philips Hue Bridge has 4 and 1/4 Stars
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:04,863	| IOT008 |	I-25 and 103 people have reviewed it
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:08,447	| IOT008 |	If you want to see the compatibilities you can just click the little
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,471	| IOT008 |	NYX palette
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,543	| IOT008 |	Compatibilities works with graph
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,847	| IOT008 |	Clip app for any product which I just did for the Phillips
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,615	| IOT008 |	Hub
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:19,455	| IOT008 |	And now I've got this ginormous graph of all these different products that work with it from
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:23,551	| IOT008 |	Quirky and Staples and Phillips will of course cuz Phillips mix The Hub
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,111	| IOT008 |	Nest Lutron Belkin
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:29,183	| IOT008 |	So you can see before you actually buy Smart Home Products
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,487	| IOT008 |	You can actually kind of plan out
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,767	| IOT008 |	A little bit better I think
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,559	| IOT008 |	Because everything is right here
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,631	| IOT008 |	Easy what's compatible with what what products work with witch
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:40,191	| IOT008 |	Which have been highly rated which have been highly rated
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,727	| IOT008 |	There's prices for all of us
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,031	| IOT008 |	I'm so it said it's a
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:49,151	| IOT008 |	Really nice simple way of finding more information about your smartphone before you actually
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,943	| IOT008 |	Invest in your smart home is that make sense
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,479	| IOT008 |	It does
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,271	| IOT008 |	Although I wouldn't say that was a five-minute
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:58,111	| IOT008 |	I would also I would add that there is a
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:16:59,903	| IOT008 |	There's a section on
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,951	| IOT008 |	Cloud Server versus
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:06,559	| IOT008 |	Yes and no for those of you guys who hate sending your data to the cloud
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,607	| IOT008 |	This is actually kind of a nice little
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,911	| IOT008 |	Segment cuz I know there's a small
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,959	| IOT008 |	Or maybe it's a growing my majority I don't
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:14,239	| IOT008 |	What's a small minority actually
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:16,287	| IOT008 |	It might be growing
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,591	| IOT008 |	Keep their data on premise
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,663	| IOT008 |	And for those of you this actually gives you
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,967	| IOT008 |	The Limited number of products
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:30,879	| IOT008 |	Yeah so that way you can see if it's the Standalone product or it's based in
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,671	| IOT008 |	You know the cloud and you sharing data
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,207	| IOT008 |	Sew in
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:38,303	| IOT008 |	Kevin found this but I will say that actually this is been shared with me by like
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,583	| IOT008 |	Two or three people so
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,143	| IOT008 |	Thank you guys for sharing this with us
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,983	| IOT008 |	It is has a instruction set so
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,263	| IOT008 |	It's
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,543	| IOT008 |	It's really just a nice
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,591	| IOT008 |	It's a very nice
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,639	| IOT008 |	Kind of databases
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,431	| IOT008 |	Product to look at so
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,991	| IOT008 |	Check it out I will include it in the show notes for you
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,271	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:00,831	| IOT008 |	Hopefully you guys can spend hours
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,903	| IOT008 |	You can get lost in this thing
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:08,255	| IOT008 |	You can and you can spend probably a lot of money after getting lost
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,535	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:10,559	| IOT008 |	Lord help you
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,423	| IOT008 |	So I think that's it for us this week
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:18,751	| IOT008 |	And stay tuned because we have an awesome guest we have robbed
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,263	| IOT008 |	Coneybeare
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:26,431	| IOT008 |	And he is a partner at Shasta Ventures and we are talking about what devices will become
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:32,831	| IOT008 |	Connected and smart in which will stay decisively analog
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:39,231	| IOT008 |	Hey everybody we are back with the Internet of Things podcast and I have
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:42,303	| IOT008 |	A wonderful guest for us today it is Rob conybeare
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:46,143	| IOT008 |	Who is a managing director and co-founder at Shasta Ventures
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:49,727	| IOT008 |	To be here with you thanks for having me
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:54,591	| IOT008 |	I am so excited so I asked you on the show a couple weeks ago because you wrote
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,151	| IOT008 |	How do you say it's an amazing blog post
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:57,663	| IOT008 |	Switch
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:04,575	| IOT008 |	Might sound a little was called what will stay defiantly analog
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,367	| IOT008 |	Login in it you kind of analyzed
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:09,439	| IOT008 |	Basically what products are going to be connected and how those
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,719	| IOT008 |	Look
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,815	| IOT008 |	And your three categories were do you remember them or do you want me to break it down for
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:18,655	| IOT008 |	We can go back through them but I'm happy to walkthrough am right now
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:23,007	| IOT008 |	3 word products it'll disappear in the digital age so if you think of newspapers
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:24,031	| IOT008 |	Stand-alone cameras
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:31,455	| IOT008 |	And at the other end of the spectrum of products that remain defiantly analog and that would be things like writing instruments and
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:34,527	| IOT008 |	Notebooks and you can see how many people still buy Moleskine
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,551	| IOT008 |	Notebooks today
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,111	| IOT008 |	It is between it's hard to say
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:43,231	| IOT008 |	There's a number of product selection literally but he'll become connected and evolved over time into
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,743	| IOT008 |	New category
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,327	| IOT008 |	To me the most exciting I I took issue with some of your things
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,887	| IOT008 |	You have some thoughts about the kitchen we're going to talk about
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:55,775	| IOT008 |	I I really wanted to kind of think about the things that become connected in a Volvo
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:58,847	| IOT008 |	Time which is where I imagine you're probably making a lot of your bets
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| IOT008 |	What is a venture capitalist
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,663	| IOT008 |	Is that a fair assumption
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,455	| IOT008 |	That's absolutely true
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:05,759	| IOT008 |	So in this category
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,319	| IOT008 |	I think of it as a spectrum there's obviously
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:11,391	| IOT008 |	Right now I feel like we're adding intelligence
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:11,903	| IOT008 |	Products
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,439	| IOT008 |	That
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,487	| IOT008 |	Kind of on a one-off basis so
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,023	| IOT008 |	I'm thinking about things like my nest
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,815	| IOT008 |	Stir like my Philips Hue Lights.
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| IOT008 |	Act alone
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,911	| IOT008 |	They provide some sort of value or energy
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,679	| IOT008 |	Payment
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:28,031	| IOT008 |	And then when I look in the future I start thinking like you mentioned that connected chairs
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,079	| IOT008 |	And I feel like those things
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,639	| IOT008 |	Probably gain more value
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,431	| IOT008 |	When they become part of an ecosystem
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:38,271	| IOT008 |	And I'm really excited about that but I'd be curious how do you kind of
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,295	| IOT008 |	See that
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,063	| IOT008 |	Evolution
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,087	| IOT008 |	Products
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,135	| IOT008 |	I think initially
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:50,303	| IOT008 |	And for the next five maybe even 10 years you'll see silos continue to be the main way in which we see can
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,071	| IOT008 |	Divisive
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:56,191	| IOT008 |	I think part of it is because people tend to think
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,959	| IOT008 |	That way
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,495	| IOT008 |	So
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:04,895	| IOT008 |	Right here in Silicon Valley you might get excited about the idea of cuz your thermostat talk to your son assistant talk to your garage
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,687	| IOT008 |	Talk to your coffee maker
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:09,247	| IOT008 |	But I think the reality is
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,527	| IOT008 |	It's the silence
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,551	| IOT008 |	People really care about it
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,599	| IOT008 |	I like to have music in my house
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:16,928	| IOT008 |	What I like to have a thermostat the program
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:21,792	| IOT008 |	And I think a lot of the other scenarios have drawbacks did
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,840	| IOT008 |	People don't really think through
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:26,144	| IOT008 |	And the reasons that you haven't seen
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:32,288	| IOT008 |	Companies that have been focused on building these ecosystems that you're referring to
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,360	| IOT008 |	And what are some of these drawbacks
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,408	| IOT008 |	But I can think of is a user
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,968	| IOT008 |	The hours I spend making things
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,248	| IOT008 |	Connected work together
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,272	| IOT008 |	There is probably a big drawback
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,576	| IOT008 |	From your perspective what are you thinking
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:48,160	| IOT008 |	I like to think about you
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,696	| IOT008 |	And I like to think about
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:54,560	| IOT008 |	How a consumer would really interact with the connected device so
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:58,400	| IOT008 |	One of the examples that funny examples that people like to use
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,680	| IOT008 |	Talking about the internet
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,960	| IOT008 |	Coffee maker
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:04,800	| IOT008 |	And it's ideas at your house can figure out when you wake up
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,128	| IOT008 |	When you're headed downstairs and automatically brew a cup of coffee for you
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:11,712	| IOT008 |	Turning on a coffee maker and starting it Brewing
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:13,248	| IOT008 |	It's only a
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,528	| IOT008 |	A small part of the problem
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,064	| IOT008 |	So
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,368	| IOT008 |	When I think about making a cup of coffee
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:26,304	| IOT008 |	I even if I'm using Keurig I still have to load the coffeemaker I have to put the package in there
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,352	| IOT008 |	Put a clean mug in there
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:35,008	| IOT008 |	If I'm using a coffee maker that grinds beans I have to fill it with game that's put a filter in Africa water in
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:40,896	| IOT008 |	That's about 95% of the problem the actual turning on the coffee maker is only 5% of the crop
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,432	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:47,040	| IOT008 |	I think about everyday 10 or 20 times I use the coffee maker
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,624	| IOT008 |	I'd much rather go down and turn it on
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,392	| IOT008 |	5 minutes
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:52,416	| IOT008 |	Before I actually need it
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:55,488	| IOT008 |	Then they have a 1 + 10 * 4
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:57,024	| IOT008 |	Even one in 20 times
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,584	| IOT008 |	Activated the wrong time
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:01,120	| IOT008 |	When I come down and I have a cold
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,168	| IOT008 |	Hi coffee
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,216	| IOT008 |	It's actually going to be two or three times
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,520	| IOT008 |	6 long to get the coffee as it would be otherwise
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,360	| IOT008 |	So when I look at something like that I start to thanks
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:14,432	| IOT008 |	What would be far more interesting is if the coffee maker
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:17,504	| IOT008 |	Is able to tell when I actually need to order more beans
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,040	| IOT008 |	Do things like that
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,576	| IOT008 |	In my view is really more of us
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,624	| IOT008 |	Sight word activities
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:25,184	| IOT008 |	Where the coffee maker is getting its materials
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,976	| IOT008 |	Supposed to react into other things
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,000	| IOT008 |	Smartphone
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:31,840	| IOT008 |	Got it okay so are you excited about the Amazon fulfillment
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,960	| IOT008 |	You take a look at the ideas
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,496	| IOT008 |	Putting a little button on your
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,520	| IOT008 |	Washing machine
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:42,080	| IOT008 |	That's when the bottle starts to get empty
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,664	| IOT008 |	The bottle mic recorder so you could imagine
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,432	| IOT008 |	In 10 years
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,968	| IOT008 |	Get bottles
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:51,296	| IOT008 |	Free Wi-Fi built ending until in Ramsey but
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,600	| IOT008 |	He might not know where there's more bottles around the house
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,928	| IOT008 |	Replenishment button right there
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:59,744	| IOT008 |	Play Take a pretty interesting one and I think in a lot of areas
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:00,768	| IOT008 |	React
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,584	| IOT008 |	The Internet of Things
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:07,168	| IOT008 |	Starting to incorporate that into either buttons
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:10,240	| IOT008 |	Self replenishment services
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,032	| IOT008 |	Very interesting
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,800	| IOT008 |	Glimpse into the Future
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,128	| IOT008 |	So I like that I like the idea of replacement
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,640	| IOT008 |	Or kind of
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:20,480	| IOT008 |	So as opposed to just connecting things around your house
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,016	| IOT008 |	Connected object
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,576	| IOT008 |	To think about it as having kind of a replacement service Milton
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,904	| IOT008 |	I also am really excited about and I'm curious your thoughts on
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,208	| IOT008 |	Education so
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,024	| IOT008 |	And this is actually one of the reasons why I'm interested in the
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:34,560	| IOT008 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:39,168	| IOT008 |	In a coffee maker might not be a great example of this unless you ever really high end coffee maker
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,192	| IOT008 |	But
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,728	| IOT008 |	Devices
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| IOT008 |	That
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,800	| IOT008 |	That know what they're doing and can
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,080	| IOT008 |	Can teach you
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,128	| IOT008 |	Or offer recipes or
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:49,920	| IOT008 |	Ways to
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:52,480	| IOT008 |	To improve your coffee so it in the coffee maker thing
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,528	| IOT008 |	Maybe my coffee maker
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:58,368	| IOT008 |	You don't give me my two shots of espresso and then it'll also
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,416	| IOT008 |	Because I told it I want
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,256	| IOT008 |	A latte it will tell me how much milk I need to put in there
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,816	| IOT008 |	How long I need to steam it and it what temperature
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,376	| IOT008 |	And all of those things could become
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,144	| IOT008 |	Immensely value
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,960	| IOT008 |	Especially
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:17,312	| IOT008 |	Midday Pick 10 but it ends up getting baked into an iPad or an iPhone
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,080	| IOT008 |	Next to that device
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,920	| IOT008 |	So you can opt into that information and you can do it but
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,736	| IOT008 |	To actually control the
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,784	| IOT008 |	Milk that goes in Turkey
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:31,136	| IOT008 |	Call the sugar that goes in independent of your measuring at yourself with a very very
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,928	| IOT008 |	Simple measuring device
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:35,744	| IOT008 |	Does devices have mechanical moving parts
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:40,096	| IOT008 |	Why you say you don't multi thousand-dollar
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,120	| IOT008 |	Espresso machine
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,912	| IOT008 |	Because they have a lot of moving parts inside
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,984	| IOT008 |	And being from Italy a lot of things break all the time
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,312	| IOT008 |	So I think in the connected kitchen
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| IOT008 |	It's about
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:53,152	| IOT008 |	What are you trying to do what are you trying to solve
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:55,200	| IOT008 |	You still have to wash the pots
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:58,784	| IOT008 |	And you still have to order the food you still have to measure a lot of the food I think
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:02,368	| IOT008 |	Are Instagram models that are coming along like
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,136	| IOT008 |	4-H
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,672	| IOT008 |	Other companies
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,976	| IOT008 |	Deliver food in
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:07,744	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,536	| IOT008 |	Portion size for portion sizes
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,560	| IOT008 |	That makes sense
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,864	| IOT008 |	But at the same time
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,144	| IOT008 |	I think that
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,168	| IOT008 |	Studious
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,192	| IOT008 |	Relatively
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:20,288	| IOT008 |	Inexpensive it is an area where the artistry
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,080	| IOT008 |	Anna high social element
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:24,640	| IOT008 |	Did I think people really enjoying
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,944	| IOT008 |	That's that's why I have some Skeptics
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,992	| IOT008 |	Says I'm about the speed at which you see that
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,552	| IOT008 |	Connect to Kitchen really start to take off
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,880	| IOT008 |	I understand like I agree with
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,648	| IOT008 |	A lot of fat
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,696	| IOT008 |	I guess I see things
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:42,560	| IOT008 |	I see because I like to cook so much I see a generation of
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,376	| IOT008 |	Friends of mine for example in people who are even younger
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,192	| IOT008 |	Who don't know how to cook and I see
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,472	| IOT008 |	Things like
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:53,056	| IOT008 |	Meld is a good example of to Kickstarter for
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,104	| IOT008 |	It's both a
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:57,152	| IOT008 |	A knob that you put on your stove
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,200	| IOT008 |	And a temperature
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,480	| IOT008 |	The thermometer that you
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,504	| IOT008 |	Dropping a pot
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,552	| IOT008 |	And what it does is it
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,112	| IOT008 |	In conjunction with your iPad
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,904	| IOT008 |	It tells you basically how hot
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:08,672	| IOT008 |	Something is
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,976	| IOT008 |	On your stove and then
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:14,304	| IOT008 |	You tell it what you're making and it tells you kind of it controls the
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| IOT008 |	The temperature out
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:21,984	| IOT008 |	I'm trying to think of what that is that
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:22,752	| IOT008 |	We all have
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,032	| IOT008 |	Say hey
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,336	| IOT008 |	Turn the oven to 375 degrees
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:29,920	| IOT008 |	And we all know that that oven could be anywhere from 300
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:32,224	| IOT008 |	25 degrees to 425 degrees
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:33,760	| IOT008 |	Or
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,808	| IOT008 |	The temperature of the burner
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:37,600	| IOT008 |	1 stove I put it at
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,136	| IOT008 |	Medium
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,672	| IOT008 |	I put it at Lowe's
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,952	| IOT008 |	The same amount of heat
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:43,232	| IOT008 |	Question 2
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| IOT008 |	I guess that you're trying to cook
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:47,840	| IOT008 |	That type of problem
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:52,704	| IOT008 |	She better and better tools but they're still similar tools they're their measurement
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,216	| IOT008 |	Tools
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:28:00,384	| IOT008 |	But the idea of automating more the process of cooking as opposed to improving individual
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,664	| IOT008 |	Tools
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,944	| IOT008 |	Skepticism
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,480	| IOT008 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:09,600	| IOT008 |	Yeah cuz I could think of I can think of dozens of tools that I would be so excited to have
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,392	| IOT008 |	A little bit more intelligence in
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,464	| IOT008 |	And we're not quite there yet cuz I don't think the
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:21,632	| IOT008 |	The connectivity and the intelligence is it cheap enough yet but you know I would love a spoon that can measure viscosity so when I'm
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,936	| IOT008 |	You know a sausage
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,216	| IOT008 |	To be like okay now we're there
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,992	| IOT008 |	Looking at a stove
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,784	| IOT008 |	You can see all the variations
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:43,392	| IOT008 |	The idea of being able to build devices
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,696	| IOT008 |	Get a very accurate
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,208	| IOT008 |	Reputable
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:51,072	| IOT008 |	Better knives better spoons better dishes
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,096	| IOT008 |	Call those things
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,680	| IOT008 |	Okay we'll see we we weren't so far off
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:01,568	| IOT008 |	Same time you're not going to see a cheese grater go away
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,872	| IOT008 |	Which is a decidedly low-tech device
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,664	| IOT008 |	Oh no
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:11,040	| IOT008 |	Preparation preparation
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,576	| IOT008 |	The moment at which
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,624	| IOT008 |	Cut it or slice it open it up
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,136	| IOT008 |	Is when your
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:20,000	| IOT008 |	Releasing flavors and Aromas and all the things that make cooking so magical
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:24,096	| IOT008 |	It's true although I would love a little bit more high-tech
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,632	| IOT008 |	Built into my
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,400	| IOT008 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,192	| IOT008 |	And this is something I
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:32,288	| IOT008 |	I've no idea for get there but I was reading about Ikea actually has
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:32,800	| IOT008 |	A
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,592	| IOT008 |	I wouldn't call it an RF
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:36,128	| IOT008 |	Pee but they have like a vision
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,152	| IOT008 |	For the connected kitchen
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:41,760	| IOT008 |	And one of the things they're showing off and I'll be very clear for everyone listening
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,552	| IOT008 |	This does not exist today
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,088	| IOT008 |	This is something Ikea's talking about
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,368	| IOT008 |	I'm looking for
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,440	| IOT008 |	One of the things they were showing was something like
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,232	| IOT008 |	A smarter countertop
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,256	| IOT008 |	So it is
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,560	| IOT008 |	It kinda had a sense of what you were putting on it
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:58,912	| IOT008 |	Either through a computer and a projector like a camera and a projector kind of set up that said
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,216	| IOT008 |	This is a fish
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:04,288	| IOT008 |	And then it would project things onto the fish that said like
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,056	| IOT008 |	Here's how you're going to
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,080	| IOT008 |	Deponent
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:08,384	| IOT008 |	It's something like that
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:10,176	| IOT008 |	That would be hugely value
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:12,992	| IOT008 |	As
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:16,064	| IOT008 |	The reality of where those things
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,088	| IOT008 |	Today would be a lot like
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:24,000	| IOT008 |	Those are probably 40-50 years out the technologies that would be able to track where the fishes and then put the donation
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| IOT008 |	Information
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,864	| IOT008 |	Projected onto the fish is a ways out I think fit
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:35,008	| IOT008 |	Some of the visions that people have for the kitchen right now or a lot like when people are expecting self-driving cars back in the
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,592	| IOT008 |	60's hits till about another 50 years old
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,384	| IOT008 |	50 whole year
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,176	| IOT008 |	Alright well
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:44,736	| IOT008 |	That's that's really depressing
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,528	| IOT008 |	Let's talk about things that
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,576	| IOT008 |	You think will disappear
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:52,416	| IOT008 |	There's a couple things that I I would love to get your thoughts on so
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,440	| IOT008 |	Books
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:56,512	| IOT008 |	Are they are they going to disappear remain defiantly and
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,840	| IOT008 |	That's a very interesting one because
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,632	| IOT008 |	They do have the advantage of
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,960	| IOT008 |	Instant good time but that's going away this
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:07,776	| IOT008 |	The thing that I like about books in the thing that I do
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,568	| IOT008 |	When I read books has I like
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,080	| IOT008 |	2
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,872	| IOT008 |	Annotate physically
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:16,992	| IOT008 |	And it's been very hard for me to get used to the idea of using Amazon to annotate so
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:19,296	| IOT008 |	When I use a Kindle
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,344	| IOT008 |	I can see who else is
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:23,904	| IOT008 |	Annotated to give him section I can see
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:26,720	| IOT008 |	Comments that people might have made there's all sorts of interesting
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:31,840	| IOT008 |	Advantages to the hive mind so to speak when you're working with textbooks and other things
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:36,448	| IOT008 |	I think both have a much longer tail than what you see with newspapers right now
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,752	| IOT008 |	Because when people
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,776	| IOT008 |	Look at that object
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:43,872	| IOT008 |	When I'm in my library at home that's absolutely filled and stuff
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:49,760	| IOT008 |	When I look at that book it brings a memory back in a way that I've never get in a digital domain
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:54,880	| IOT008 |	And it inspires me and helps me think about other things so it's the physical artifact
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,928	| IOT008 |	But I think people find
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,464	| IOT008 |	Interesting and appealing
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,768	| IOT008 |	At the same time
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:04,352	| IOT008 |	A lot of that is just how I think about quotes and I interact
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,376	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:08,192	| IOT008 |	What I find with my kids my young kids
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,728	| IOT008 |	They
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,800	| IOT008 |	Between both mode
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:16,896	| IOT008 |	Stay still enjoy enjoy picking up physical books and reading books
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,200	| IOT008 |	Very very
EDL	00:32:19,200	00:32:21,248	| IOT008 |	Seamlessly move over using it
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,784	| IOT008 |	Kindle as well and
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,320	| IOT008 |	They really don't
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,344	| IOT008 |	Cure to have a preference
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,880	| IOT008 |	Between one another
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,672	| IOT008 |	And I think it's
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:31,232	| IOT008 |	The Arc I think it's the tactile
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:32,256	| IOT008 |	Temptation of a book
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:35,584	| IOT008 |	That is very different than a newspaper because it has a life
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,632	| IOT008 |	Beyond when you read it
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:41,472	| IOT008 |	You go back you reference a look at it later having you around has meaning
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:45,568	| IOT008 |	Newspapers and other disposable periodicals
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,104	| IOT008 |	You don't have that same interaction
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,408	| IOT008 |	It's true although
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:51,712	| IOT008 |	We had a paper mache project that was
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:55,808	| IOT008 |	Do and suddenly realized that we had absolutely nothing far paper mache project
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,880	| IOT008 |	Oh no I know I'd like
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:32:59,904	| IOT008 |	What will happen to the
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,928	| IOT008 |	Kids of the future
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:08,864	| IOT008 |	When you think about it books have a lot of things going for him the newspapers don't because even today news Prince comes off and
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,632	| IOT008 |	Your hands and
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:13,472	| IOT008 |	Target open up when you sit down in an airplane in a tiny seed
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:15,520	| IOT008 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:18,848	| IOT008 |	Issues I think that people have with newspaper
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:21,152	| IOT008 |	You don't quite have with books
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:23,456	| IOT008 |	So I think there'll be a lot of physical artifacts
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,480	| IOT008 |	You stay around but it
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,296	| IOT008 |	It'll be a good thing to see NFC and
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:31,392	| IOT008 |	Maybe not as much mass produced as many Masters
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:33,696	| IOT008 |	We're going to go down at list
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:35,232	| IOT008 |	A quick little list
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:36,768	| IOT008 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,536	| IOT008 |	I've got some ideas
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,328	| IOT008 |	I'm ready you ready
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:40,608	| IOT008 |	All right
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:41,888	| IOT008 |	Jewelry
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,168	| IOT008 |	It's Kind of a Funny
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:46,496	| IOT008 |	Yes why I think Julia Pfeiffer
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:49,312	| IOT008 |	Navigate into two categories and one of them is fine jewelry
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,872	| IOT008 |	And the other is fashion
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:55,968	| IOT008 |	And when you think about things that are fashionable these things fit
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,248	| IOT008 |	Typically
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,064	| IOT008 |	People wear for a year or two or three
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,624	| IOT008 |	And I think that's a little more
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:04,672	| IOT008 |	Tune to
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:07,232	| IOT008 |	The light cycle of technology in advance
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| IOT008 |	Technology
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:10,816	| IOT008 |	When I think about fine jewelry and I think about
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,632	| IOT008 |	Things that are artistic
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,960	| IOT008 |	There's an expectation when you buy it or you just it
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,032	| IOT008 |	You'll be using it
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:20,800	| IOT008 |	4
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,312	| IOT008 |	Decades
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,872	| IOT008 |	Whether that's true or not
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,408	| IOT008 |	That's a bit of the expectation
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:25,920	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:31,040	| IOT008 |	Part of the way you talk about the phrase diamonds are forever
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,576	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,344	| IOT008 |	You look at
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:36,160	| IOT008 |	The way that people interact with these
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:39,744	| IOT008 |	Items in the way that they build on top of it
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:42,560	| IOT008 |	I think this was fine jewelry people don't want
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:44,352	| IOT008 |	Literal picture
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| IOT008 |	They want
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,144	| IOT008 |	The
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,192	| IOT008 |	Positive
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:53,312	| IOT008 |	Sometimes negative emotions that come along with it it's still in your mind and there is much more of an arc
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:54,848	| IOT008 |	Please do it so
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,896	| IOT008 |	When I think about jewelry that's how I
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,688	| IOT008 |	I think about that category
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,224	| IOT008 |	Current that makes sense
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:00,992	| IOT008 |	What about
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,552	| IOT008 |	This it this encompasses a lot of things
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,856	| IOT008 |	So we can break it down further but building materials
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,672	| IOT008 |	That's a good one
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:12,000	| IOT008 |	I think you start to see something that happened with technology
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,024	| IOT008 |	Such as
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:13,536	| IOT008 |	Chalkboard
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:21,216	| IOT008 |	So you start to see advances in technology we can have paint that looks the same on whiteboard paint that allows you to write on it
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,520	| IOT008 |	I think those are some things that happen with physical characteristic
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| IOT008 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,104	| IOT008 |	You look at the door
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:34,272	| IOT008 |	The door is stayed defiantly analog for a very long time hinges work well the idea of being able to pull out a pen
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:35,552	| IOT008 |	To be able to remove a door
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:38,624	| IOT008 |	These are things that work particularly well
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:44,768	| IOT008 |	And I think we'll continue to work well for a very long time I don't think we're going to see the Star Trek sliding doors
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:48,864	| IOT008 |	Make monkey noises every time they slide open anytime
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,960	| IOT008 |	Or Worse the depressing door is out of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,312	| IOT008 |	No it's the same time I think you will start to
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:57,824	| IOT008 |	See
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,872	| IOT008 |	Companies like August
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:01,152	| IOT008 |	Lockitron
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,664	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:03,456	| IOT008 |	Unikey
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:05,760	| IOT008 |	People that are building internet-connected locks
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:09,344	| IOT008 |	I think there's a lot of utility to be had there I think he'll start
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,368	| IOT008 |	See more and more of that
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,160	| IOT008 |	And there are
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:13,184	| IOT008 |	So many doors
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:16,000	| IOT008 |	Somebody access points but that can be an enormous Market
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,560	| IOT008 |	Like to see the really
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:20,352	| IOT008 |	Mainstream adoption I think you need to
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:25,728	| IOT008 |	About another 5 to 10 years of reliability built into these devices
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:29,056	| IOT008 |	Because there's nothing worse than getting
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,360	| IOT008 |	Locked out of your house because the batteries might have died
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,456	| IOT008 |	Like I got locked out of my house all the time
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,224	| IOT008 |	Keys
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:37,760	| IOT008 |	Batteries connectivity at all
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:38,784	| IOT008 |	It doesn't matter
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:40,576	| IOT008 |	So I'm like whatever
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:43,648	| IOT008 |	What about you what about things like
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:46,464	| IOT008 |	I feel like windows are kind of an interesting
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,768	| IOT008 |	Interesting thing to think about maybe not
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:55,424	| IOT008 |	803 years for now but maybe 10 years from now just because in some ways they're kind of like a screen opportunity
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,960	| IOT008 |	I I don't know I
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:57,728	| IOT008 |	I have no idea what you're
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:03,360	| IOT008 |	If anything at all
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,408	| IOT008 |	Anytime you start to put something
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,968	| IOT008 |	Physical and then you start to think about
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,504	| IOT008 |	Cost of installation
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:12,320	| IOT008 |	At least run adventure capitalist point of view
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,856	| IOT008 |	Start to get a little frightening
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:17,440	| IOT008 |	Because it starts become Capital intensive
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,512	| IOT008 |	To inform people
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:23,328	| IOT008 |	And teach people about the benefits that you could have from
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:26,400	| IOT008 |	New windows are building materials like that
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,960	| IOT008 |	One of the things I've done in my house is
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:31,776	| IOT008 |	Put on 3M protective coatings
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:33,824	| IOT008 |	To reduce the UV
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:40,224	| IOT008 |	Protect are also to help with heating and cooling bills
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,272	| IOT008 |	But that's something that you can apply after
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,832	| IOT008 |	Retrofit Easley
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:50,208	| IOT008 |	And I think anything that's in Material Science is better suited to large companies spend
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,768	| IOT008 |	Got it in you and your
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:55,840	| IOT008 |	Your post you actually talked about furniture so
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:59,424	| IOT008 |	But let's talk about furniture we also mentioned Ikea and they're sticking
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,960	| IOT008 |	Charging stuff
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,032	| IOT008 |	Charging pads into their furniture and I know I
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:05,568	| IOT008 |	I got Kickstarter all the time and
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,872	| IOT008 |	I see some really interesting furniture
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:13,760	| IOT008 |	USB cables built in
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,040	| IOT008 |	The things that are
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:15,808	| IOT008 |	Suited
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:18,112	| IOT008 |	To The Internet of Things Memorial stamp first
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,416	| IOT008 |	I wear your solving
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,696	| IOT008 |	Really clear
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,256	| IOT008 |	Problems that people have so I think something like
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:28,608	| IOT008 |	The Nest thermostat and being an early investor they're one of the things that we saw was
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:31,424	| IOT008 |	You could go into a single point products
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,216	| IOT008 |	Connected to the internet
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:36,544	| IOT008 |	And you can pay for itself within a year along with all the other benefits
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:38,592	| IOT008 |	Will you look at
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:39,616	| IOT008 |	Something like
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,456	| IOT008 |	Looking at a leather chair right now
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:44,992	| IOT008 |	It might cost
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,552	| IOT008 |	As much as 500,000 $2,000
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:51,136	| IOT008 |	My expectation is a less that chair for 20 or 30 years
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:58,560	| IOT008 |	And I think that a lot of these charging devices and things that people think about building into Furniture in about
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:02,144	| IOT008 |	For five years is going to look like having an 8-track player in your car
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,936	| IOT008 |	Especially Theron Apple charger
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,848	| IOT008 |	And everything that's around you I think it's about
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:12,384	| IOT008 |	Mapping
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:16,224	| IOT008 |	The life cycle of that product to the life cycle of Technology
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:19,296	| IOT008 |	So if you have a product that you have next
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:22,112	| IOT008 |	Station that you use for anywhere from 1 to 3 years
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,416	| IOT008 |	That's where you'll start
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,440	| IOT008 |	She technology
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:31,584	| IOT008 |	If it's something where the advantages are just so overwhelmingly powerful like what you see in a thermostat
EDL	00:39:32,352	00:39:35,680	| IOT008 |	Put an item that you expect to have for 2030
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:37,984	| IOT008 |	Years are longer than 10 years
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:39,776	| IOT008 |	I don't think it's a
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:45,664	| IOT008 |	Place that you're going to see them be anything other than Analog Devices and backdrops for other products
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:49,504	| IOT008 |	So this will be our final question our final product category
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,040	| IOT008 |	Clothing
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,344	| IOT008 |	Clothing that's a good one
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,648	| IOT008 |	Well ask you how long do you
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,184	| IOT008 |	Clothes for
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:39:59,744	| IOT008 |	Woke up with fashion versus fine clothing
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:04,352	| IOT008 |	It's it's a similar it's a similar divide maybe not as long as a diamond ring but
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:06,400	| IOT008 |	But I think in general clothing
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:08,192	| IOT008 |	If you wear a regular later we're up
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,472	| IOT008 |	Clothing
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,240	| IOT008 |	Design
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:11,776	| IOT008 |	Only designed for
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:14,592	| IOT008 |	30 40 50 Washings before they really start
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,872	| IOT008 |	Come apart in general
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:19,712	| IOT008 |	It it's true and indefinitely when you go in
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,272	| IOT008 |	There are things I buy that
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:26,368	| IOT008 |	Like my Summer shirts and shorts those will probably last me
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:27,904	| IOT008 |	A summer maybe two
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:33,536	| IOT008 |	But like a fine like a suit or something like that or if I'm going to buy something by a designer
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,072	| IOT008 |	I expect that to last me
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:35,840	| IOT008 |	Probably a decade
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,424	| IOT008 |	Because
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,216	| IOT008 |	Where
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:45,568	| IOT008 |	You will see technology overtime but the price points have to get down to a point where if you
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:49,408	| IOT008 |	Incorporated into the clothing itself it has to be
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,200	| IOT008 |	Vanishingly
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:52,480	| IOT008 |	Inexpensive cell
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:56,064	| IOT008 |	I think the only reason that you won't see it on a broad scale
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:57,600	| IOT008 |	Anytime soon
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:59,904	| IOT008 |	It's just the cost of the technology and
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:02,208	| IOT008 |	I need to recharge I think
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:08,864	| IOT008 |	At the point that you're able to do energy Scavenging and wifi-only cost you a few pennies
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:09,632	| IOT008 |	2
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,656	| IOT008 |	Carmen
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:13,216	| IOT008 |	They might start to see that sort of thing
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:16,544	| IOT008 |	I've had the experience with a a shirt that
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:19,872	| IOT008 |	Edward at South by Southwest on your neck of the woods
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,408	| IOT008 |	2 years ago that had a
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:23,712	| IOT008 |	Graphic equalizer on the front and a batteries
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:25,760	| IOT008 |	And would actually
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:26,784	| IOT008 |	React
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:28,064	| IOT008 |	The music
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:32,672	| IOT008 |	And whatever venue I went to it South by Southwest and it was a huge hit love wearing it
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:35,744	| IOT008 |	I think you'll start to see some of these things
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,512	| IOT008 |	I'm into fashion
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,816	| IOT008 |	But it's an area where I think
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:42,656	| IOT008 |	Points make it very difficult unless you have a very unique
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:46,496	| IOT008 |	Reason that you're using it such as Fitness or or some other purpose
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:51,616	| IOT008 |	Yeah I think Fitness and I think also an interesting use cases things like
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,640	| IOT008 |	Health Lake
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:56,479	| IOT008 |	It'll sunsun tracking UV tracking is a really kind of interesting
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,783	| IOT008 |	An example especially like kids clothing
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:02,367	| IOT008 |	So when you look at something like that then you ask whether it's
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:04,159	| IOT008 |	Better for it to be
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:08,255	| IOT008 |	A highly effective state-of-the-art sensor that you clip onto the clothing
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:12,095	| IOT008 |	Survivor run through the wash if you forget to take it off
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:15,167	| IOT008 |	Is opposed to something that you would add to every piece of clothing
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:17,727	| IOT008 |	The kids has it might not be as good as sensor
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:23,103	| IOT008 |	Well it in that is the question but some of those some of those clips are very expensive and I'm thinking of
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:28,991	| IOT008 |	Like a rash guard that I put on my kid every time they go out to the beach when I'm most concerned about it might be
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:36,159	| IOT008 |	Interesting way to go see them building
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:39,999	| IOT008 |	Measurements of your form and Effectiveness when you work out
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:44,095	| IOT008 |	Areas where you have time and you're trying to make the most of your time and
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:49,983	| IOT008 |	It's much more measurable it's something that people will pay for and pay more for us in it
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,519	| IOT008 |	Guess I certainly
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:54,847	| IOT008 |	I certainly don't need my everyday clothes telling me I'm slouching on the regular
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,383	| IOT008 |	Yeah
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:59,199	| IOT008 |	All these categories is
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:01,759	| IOT008 |	Part of the human condition is
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:04,063	| IOT008 |	Spitting up in manipulating and working with
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:08,415	| IOT008 |	And touching and interacting with devices in our everyday lives
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:13,535	| IOT008 |	And so much of our world I think whether we feel it or not is about creativity it's
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:17,887	| IOT008 |	3D sidewalk on this side of the street of that side of the street or
EDL	00:43:17,887	00:43:21,983	| IOT008 |	What do we want to have for breakfast or how do we want to cook it and what do we want to do and I think
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,775	| IOT008 |	Art's Place
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:25,823	| IOT008 |	And creativity plays much bigger
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:27,615	| IOT008 |	Part of our daily lives
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:31,967	| IOT008 |	I think because of that that's where you'll see the tension between
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,527	| IOT008 |	Silicon Valley that wants to
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,551	| IOT008 |	Automate everything
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:38,111	| IOT008 |	Connect everything to technology and
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,927	| IOT008 |	Areas where I think you'll see
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,487	| IOT008 |	Thanks the analog four
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:44,767	| IOT008 |	Decades if not centuries
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,327	| IOT008 |	And I think
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:53,727	| IOT008 |	That's a wonderful topic that we could probably explain a whole nother podcast because I think actually some of the stuff opens up
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:57,311	| IOT008 |	A lot of opportunities to be creative and completely different ways
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,871	| IOT008 |	For people who want to explore that like I
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:02,175	| IOT008 |	I had a fun time building a
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,247	| IOT008 |	Pressure sensor into one of my chairs and
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:06,015	| IOT008 |	Tying a tie
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:10,367	| IOT008 |	Distance you lightbulb so when you sat in that chair and only that chair the light above your head
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:11,391	| IOT008 |	Pokemon
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:14,463	| IOT008 |	It was silly but it was kind of a fun party trick
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:17,791	| IOT008 |	Actually measures how much that person
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:21,631	| IOT008 |	No no that would be a terrible chair
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:25,471	| IOT008 |	No one wants that are displayed above the refrigerator
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:26,495	| IOT008 |	Can you imagine
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:27,519	| IOT008 |	I can't
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,335	| IOT008 |	No one would visit me again
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,407	| IOT008 |	All right
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:35,455	| IOT008 |	Brought thank you so much for coming on the podcast
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:39,807	| IOT008 |	I love that post I think it's a must-read for everyone all included in the show notes
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:40,831	| IOT008 |	And
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,111	| IOT008 |	Thank you
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:49,023	| IOT008 |	Call Stacy thanks for having me on the show it's been a great conversation
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:55,167	| IOT008 |	I will see you next week on the Internet of Things podcast
