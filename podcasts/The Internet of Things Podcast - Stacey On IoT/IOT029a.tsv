EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,152	| IOT029a |	229
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:24,480	| IOT029a |	It has a video doorbell that's going to be on sale and it's
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:25,248	| IOT029a |	Wired in
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:25,760	| IOT029a |	We're going to get to White
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,552	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:31,136	| IOT029a |	We mentioned this actually a couple shows ago because our buddy Dave.
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:31,904	| IOT029a |	Is so smart
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,440	| IOT029a |	Comes the FCC database
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| IOT029a |	Agape
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,232	| IOT029a |	Keypad
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:36,768	| IOT029a |	It works with their lot
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,048	| IOT029a |	And that's going to be $79
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,864	| IOT029a |	And if upgraded their bridge if
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:41,632	| IOT029a |	If you want remote app
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,984	| IOT029a |	It's important you don't actually have to buy the bridge
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,496	| IOT029a |	If you don't want
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,800	| IOT029a |	Angie bought the video doorbell
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,336	| IOT029a |	Set up bridges for WiFi
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:52,384	| IOT029a |	Is Bluetooth only
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,456	| IOT029a |	But if you want WiFi access and you would want this if you want to
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,224	| IOT029a |	See like
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,504	| IOT029a |	If you want a remote control your life
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,552	| IOT029a |	Control your life
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,320	| IOT029a |	What Bluetooth only
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:03,136	| IOT029a |	So if you want ad that Wi-Fi you got to get either the bridge
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,160	| IOT029a |	Or the video doorbell
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| IOT029a |	Both of those things
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,696	| IOT029a |	Trinidad wife
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:11,584	| IOT029a |	I could also see another reason for wanting the Wi-Fi if you have a bigger house or you have a large yard in your Outback
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:12,608	| IOT029a |	Bluetooth might not cut it
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,656	| IOT029a |	Would you want to
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,680	| IOT029a |	Open your door from that
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,752	| IOT029a |	I might if it's a pizza guy and I'm out back with all my friends
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,032	| IOT029a |	OKC and that's
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,568	| IOT029a |	So that gets to the second
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:22,336	| IOT029a |	Things in August
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:25,152	| IOT029a |	These Partnerships is called August Act
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,456	| IOT029a |	In August whole goal
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,248	| IOT029a |	Cuz you can't just make smart locks
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,808	| IOT029a |	In this world you have to have like a Grand Vision to transfer
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,576	| IOT029a |	Farm Society
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:36,672	| IOT029a |	So all his Grand Vision is to Lake make you feel comfortable letting people inside your home
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:37,952	| IOT029a |	Pizza dude
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| IOT029a |	Or the FedEx guy
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:43,840	| IOT029a |	Or like a whole plethora of San Francisco tech companies like
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,888	| IOT029a |	Postmate sir Alfred a rinse
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,424	| IOT029a |	All these companies
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:49,728	| IOT029a |	People in Middle America are like these companies and what do they do
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,544	| IOT029a |	Delivery services
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,056	| IOT029a |	Laundry service
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| IOT029a |	Courier Service
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,872	| IOT029a |	Dresses
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,152	| IOT029a |	You can basically
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:03,552	| IOT029a |	Tell ring your doorbell if you're like it's the Postmates guy they deliver anything
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,344	| IOT029a |	And you can just let them in your house
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:09,184	| IOT029a |	Give them that so you give them instant access with your August lock they can open the door
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:12,512	| IOT029a |	They can drop the costs are boss and then they leave and you
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,048	| IOT029a |	You can watch them go and then
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,816	| IOT029a |	Score
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:18,144	| IOT029a |	I got my cough syrup and I never had two egg get out of bed or maybe weren't even
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:25,056	| IOT029a |	Yeah I was just going to say this is the ultimate for lazy people because you not only are you so lazy you can't get cough syrup you have someone bring it to
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,616	| IOT029a |	You're too lazy to even open the door for Speed
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,920	| IOT029a |	Or maybe you're not
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,968	| IOT029a |	That maybe you're not well
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| IOT029a |	Maybe you're not you're in bed
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,016	| IOT029a |	And that's why your
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,832	| IOT029a |	Right now actually said this is
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:40,928	| IOT029a |	By the time the stairs I'll be back but I'm on vacation right now in Florida and
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,976	| IOT029a |	I've had to I was on a roller coaster
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:43,744	| IOT029a |	Sister both times
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,768	| IOT029a |	This happened which is a shame
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,584	| IOT029a |	Because my doorbell my video doorbell
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:52,448	| IOT029a |	Afterwards I get the notice I was at the door so I couldn't actually talk to
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,472	| IOT029a |	While they were
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:58,848	| IOT029a |	Tell them to like leave it on the doorstep but like I got to FedEx packages sitting on my doorstep
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,640	| IOT029a |	Right now that I'm keeping an eye on
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,920	| IOT029a |	Using my video doorbell
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,224	| IOT029a |	It would have been really nice if I weren't on the roller coaster
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:07,040	| IOT029a |	And I had an August lock or some Smart Lock
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,320	| IOT029a |	I could let them
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,088	| IOT029a |	Access
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,856	| IOT029a |	I could be like
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,648	| IOT029a |	Hey actually just drop it
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,440	| IOT029a |	You know just open the door you got access
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,488	| IOT029a |	Just for like 5 minutes just open the door
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,256	| IOT029a |	Drop it inside
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,791	| IOT029a |	And I close the door and door lock
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| IOT029a |	That would be amazing
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,095	| IOT029a |	But I was just
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:27,519	| IOT029a |	That would be cool refresh my memory the August lock this is the one that has batteries inside because
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:31,359	| IOT029a |	It has a mechanical mechanism to actually move the bolt
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,895	| IOT029a |	It does this fit
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,175	| IOT029a |	Over your dead body
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,223	| IOT029a |	This is not so there to kind of
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,735	| IOT029a |	Weather
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:42,111	| IOT029a |	The two kinds that I most commonly replacing are
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,671	| IOT029a |	You take your entire deadbolt lock mechanism
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| IOT029a |	August is the other
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,999	| IOT029a |	Over the exist
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,327	| IOT029a |	So this is a little bit easier to install
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,631	| IOT029a |	Are people who are may be intimidated by take
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,399	| IOT029a |	Making a screwdriver
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,423	| IOT029a |	Screen door lock
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,239	| IOT029a |	Yeah I guess so it fits basically fits over
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,799	| IOT029a |	Well actually now I'm looking as you mentioned I went to their site
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,335	| IOT029a |	You still have to
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:07,455	| IOT029a |	Open up the the Depo mechanism from both sides of your door to install this
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,271	| IOT029a |	Yeah but it doesn't look complicated mean is not
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,807	| IOT029a |	Challenger install a deadbolt
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,575	| IOT029a |	No
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:16,415	| IOT029a |	No I have I have literally in back when we talked about homekit we're going to talk about
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| IOT029a |	Installing yet another
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,279	| IOT029a |	So I install locks with
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,071	| IOT029a |	It is not
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,887	| IOT029a |	Yeah this looks this looks sad painless
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,911	| IOT029a |	It is very painful
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,447	| IOT029a |	When did they give you like
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:32,543	| IOT029a |	Did I think they give you everything you may need a screwdriver but I can't remember they may actually
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,103	| IOT029a |	I can't quite recall
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:41,503	| IOT029a |	Obviously I'm excited about the video part because that's what I need and really that's the only place on my door that I have
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:44,575	| IOT029a |	Room to actually put oneself
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,343	| IOT029a |	Video doorbell
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,391	| IOT029a |	And so the competitors here are going to
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,975	| IOT029a |	Ring ring just got money from Richard Branson
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,511	| IOT029a |	199 bucks
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,791	| IOT029a |	There's skybell
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,815	| IOT029a |	Also 199
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:01,471	| IOT029a |	Vivint offers one and then later next year so 2016 we're going to have something from
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,495	| IOT029a |	Chamberlain
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| IOT029a |	It's called the notify
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:08,127	| IOT029a |	So every single one of these is a little bit different I'm hoping to do a
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,687	| IOT029a |	Comparison chart I should also mention that you
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,967	| IOT029a |	Pre-order all of August
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,991	| IOT029a |	Krista as a
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,783	| IOT029a |	Actually now but
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:18,879	| IOT029a |	The stuff will ship over the next eight weeks so the doorbell is actually going to be the last
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,391	| IOT029a |	Bishop and ask
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,927	| IOT029a |	Mid December
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,743	| IOT029a |	So that's August
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| IOT029a |	Weight limit one more time
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:29,375	| IOT029a |	Only only cuz I just noticed it on their blog as you were talking about it's obviously I'm very interested since the
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,655	| IOT029a |	Precise
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:35,263	| IOT029a |	I see that they have their Smart Lock integrated into the Xfinity home app
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| IOT029a |	It now works with Nest cam as of October 1st
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,127	| IOT029a |	They have an Android app all new
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,431	| IOT029a |	And I was 9 support soap
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,991	| IOT029a |	This looks like a this is one of my Christmas wish
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:49,855	| IOT029a |	Oh yeah and I should actually say so the homekit version of the lock there's a version 1
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,135	| IOT029a |	That has been out for a while
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,439	| IOT029a |	That's actually 199 they're going to keep
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,487	| IOT029a |	Keep selling it there's a new version
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| IOT029a |	Does homekit certified
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,047	| IOT029a |	It's 229
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:05,471	| IOT029a |	So you may be able to actually if you're not really interested in the homekit part go with the 229 there's some slight
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,751	| IOT029a |	Mechanical differences to
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,287	| IOT029a |	About it so you know
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,055	| IOT029a |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,335	| IOT029a |	Soon as I get my video camera
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,359	| IOT029a |	The video cameras
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| IOT029a |	Two separate things
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,175	| IOT029a |	So if you want the lock and the video camera
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,455	| IOT029a |	You're looking at like
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:15,967	| IOT029a |	$400
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,527	| IOT029a |	The video doorbell is
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,807	| IOT029a |	199
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,343	| IOT029a |	So you can you don't need lockplus
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| IOT029a |	You could just get the video
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:26,975	| IOT029a |	This is true I just have to see what it looks like cuz all them been too wide for the
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:28,767	| IOT029a |	Wood paneling on my outside of my door
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,071	| IOT029a |	I have seen what it looks like but I don't have the actual
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,375	| IOT029a |	That's okay we'll figure it out
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,655	| IOT029a |	You was you will see on the website
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| IOT029a |	Go to the website
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,239	| IOT029a |	Get thee to the website
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| IOT029a |	Okay
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,287	| IOT029a |	So
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:45,151	| IOT029a |	Other news will go zip right through this Savant which is the apple of home automation
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,479	| IOT029a |	They did Steve Jobs
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| IOT029a |	Castle
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,903	| IOT029a |	Hi and they actually went a little lower into like last year
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,927	| IOT029a |	And by lower end
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT029a |	$200 /
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,023	| IOT029a |	Korean
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,791	| IOT029a |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,303	| IOT029a |	So
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,839	| IOT029a |	White Louis
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:08,447	| IOT029a |	They actually just teamed up with ammunition which is the Design Group that did
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,751	| IOT029a |	Beats headphones
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,775	| IOT029a |	EReader
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:17,151	| IOT029a |	This kind of comes together because the former CEO of Barnes & Noble is now.
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| IOT029a |	CEO at savant
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,991	| IOT029a |	They have created a 499
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,783	| IOT029a |	Remote control
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,295	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,831	| IOT029a |	Tub unit
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:29,695	| IOT029a |	The actually looks pretty good and looks like it is going to compete with like the Logitech
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,975	| IOT029a |	Ultimate Harmony
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,999	| IOT029a |	Remote
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,767	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,303	| IOT029a |	I bring this up because
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,863	| IOT029a |	I said a lot of pretty good things about the Logitech
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,887	| IOT029a |	Gear
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,679	| IOT029a |	Which was kind of a hug for your hubs
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,471	| IOT029a |	And brought together all your abs
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,335	| IOT029a |	This is less a hub for your hubs but it does bring together all of your AV stuff
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,615	| IOT029a |	It kind of works with like
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,943	| IOT029a |	Your shoe lights and nests and other stuff and Saban is
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,735	| IOT029a |	Really good at the software behind
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,015	| IOT029a |	Home automation
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:57,087	| IOT029a |	So I haven't tried it yet but I want to try it
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,391	| IOT029a |	I'm going to try to get a review unit so I can try it
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:08:59,903	| IOT029a |	Because
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,695	| IOT029a |	This looks really compelling but it also
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,535	| IOT029a |	It does end and you're actually the
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:09,631	| IOT029a |	Probably the target for this because you prefer not to use your phone for controlling things
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,191	| IOT029a |	You have a remote with us so
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,471	| IOT029a |	When she's a remote
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,031	| IOT029a |	I haven't fallen in love
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,543	| IOT029a |	With any of
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| IOT029a |	I haven't fallen in love with Alexa
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,407	| IOT029a |	It's a good solution but I haven't
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,687	| IOT029a |	Loft
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| IOT029a |	So and like
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,527	| IOT029a |	I have a Sonos
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,087	| IOT029a |	Shoes
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| IOT029a |	Roku's I have
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,391	| IOT029a |	Add a lot of these devices
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,487	| IOT029a |	And my husband
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,279	| IOT029a |	His ears perk up with a v
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,559	| IOT029a |	Supposed to
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:43,167	| IOT029a |	Sure we'll see so that's the Savant stuff it's out
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,007	| IOT029a |	It's 499 you can pick it up on their website Best Buy
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,775	| IOT029a |	Magnolia
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,359	| IOT029a |	Yeah so now
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,639	| IOT029a |	Are we ready Kevin
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,919	| IOT029a |	Let's do it
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| IOT029a |	Tomcat time
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| IOT029a |	Who killed
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,735	| IOT029a |	All right
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,247	| IOT029a |	So
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,527	| IOT029a |	Deep breath
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:00,063	| IOT029a |	I tested
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,879	| IOT029a |	A couple things I tested the Lutron Bridge
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,415	| IOT029a |	I tested the
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,951	| IOT029a |	Schlage sense
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:08,255	| IOT029a |	Lock and I tested the Hue Bridge
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:12,351	| IOT029a |	Are the Hue Lights so those are my three homekit things I tested all of this
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| IOT029a |	On an iPhone
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,655	| IOT029a |	Set
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,191	| IOT029a |	So there's a reason I'm telling you all this
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| IOT029a |	That's part of town
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,895	| IOT029a |	When I install I'll give you the individual
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,943	| IOT029a |	Does the Hue Bridge
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,247	| IOT029a |	I don't know if I'm actually going to buy it that's the first thing
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| IOT029a |	I mean I am going to buy it because
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,343	| IOT029a |	Reviewer and I feel like it's
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,623	| IOT029a |	Get better butt
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| IOT029a |	Like
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,927	| IOT029a |	Comes very little into my
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,999	| IOT029a |	Like day-to-day life because you already worked with
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,791	| IOT029a |	My Amazon Echo I didn't
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,071	| IOT029a |	Find talking to
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,351	| IOT029a |	To Siri to be better than
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:44,863	| IOT029a |	In talking to
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,679	| IOT029a |	Talking to my echo
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,959	| IOT029a |	And that's because
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,471	| IOT029a |	I don't always
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,775	| IOT029a |	Around
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| IOT029a |	Because Siri on my phone
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,591	| IOT029a |	Requires me to pay
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,639	| IOT029a |	With one exception
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,455	| IOT029a |	And that is if your phone is plugged in at the time
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,759	| IOT029a |	Yes but the new iPhones
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,295	| IOT029a |	SpaceX as the 6s
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,831	| IOT029a |	Plus do support
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,647	| IOT029a |	A phrase for her to be activated
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,951	| IOT029a |	When they are not plugged in you do have to
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,719	| IOT029a |	A train
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,231	| IOT029a |	Her
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,767	| IOT029a |	To recognize your voice
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,071	| IOT029a |	Yeah sure
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:20,959	| IOT029a |	If a train blah blah to recognize your voice which is actually good thing so that way Stacy you couldn't walk into a room and say hey blah blah
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,495	| IOT029a |	And have your husband
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,519	| IOT029a |	Phone start doing things
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:27,615	| IOT029a |	It's all individually pair to your voice which is a good thing
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,175	| IOT029a |	But I agree that the limitation on all of the other eye
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,247	| IOT029a |	And iPads and iPod Touches
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,319	| IOT029a |	The battery plugged in or obviously you can double press the button
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,391	| IOT029a |	Yo bring blah blah up
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,415	| IOT029a |	So here's the second one
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,231	| IOT029a |	What is a bit of a smart alec
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| IOT029a |	So
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,535	| IOT029a |	Yes
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,303	| IOT029a |	The echo
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| IOT029a |	Is actually
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,095	| IOT029a |	Pretty nice is
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,607	| IOT029a |	Is a robot in the
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,167	| IOT029a |	Hurts when I say
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,191	| IOT029a |	Turn on the lights
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| IOT029a |	If she can't find the lights
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,007	| IOT029a |	She just goes to the
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,287	| IOT029a |	And you get that like the next
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,079	| IOT029a |	Or sometimes
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,615	| IOT029a |	She's like I can't discover the lights
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,151	| IOT029a |	Or she can she says
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,455	| IOT029a |	Now blah blah
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,503	| IOT029a |	Must give you some running commentary like
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,575	| IOT029a |	Some of the lights don't seem to be interested in turning on
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,903	| IOT029a |	Or I turned on some of the lights
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| IOT029a |	The other lights
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,951	| IOT029a |	Art responding
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,255	| IOT029a |	I mean that's useful information
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,791	| IOT029a |	But I prefer the
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,863	| IOT029a |	The Amazon Echo for this
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:22,655	| IOT029a |	Cuz you don't find
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| IOT029a |	Which lights aren't
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:30,335	| IOT029a |	See I didn't know because I haven't tested interesting well that's kind of yeah I guess you have to start walk around your house then to see what lights are
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,359	| IOT029a |	Which ones are not
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| IOT029a |	Exactly
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,431	| IOT029a |	So I'm not
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,967	| IOT029a |	It would be interesting if she was like
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,503	| IOT029a |	These are the following
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,295	| IOT029a |	Aren't you know she called them out
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:43,647	| IOT029a |	But don't she just like that but everyone's apple is getting better
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,927	| IOT029a |	Contextual conversations
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,743	| IOT029a |	There and I wonder if they could add
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,583	| IOT029a |	A feature where you just continued conversation and say which lights are not active
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,631	| IOT029a |	And therefore she could then tell you
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| IOT029a |	But I don't know.
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,703	| IOT029a |	Obviously it's not that possible yet
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| IOT029a |	I did try to ask
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,591	| IOT029a |	You can't get a little bit like
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,359	| IOT029a |	You can't have
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| IOT029a |	Conversation
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,919	| IOT029a |	She will initiate following
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:06,943	| IOT029a |	Crustaceans with
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,527	| IOT029a |	Did you meet this one and you can see
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,831	| IOT029a |	So that is helpful
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| IOT029a |	Where is
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,391	| IOT029a |	The echo will just be like
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,671	| IOT029a |	Total energy
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,439	| IOT029a |	Oh it didn't work
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,231	| IOT029a |	Try again
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:19,743	| IOT029a |	Blac Chyna
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,535	| IOT029a |	Okay
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,303	| IOT029a |	So that's the
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,351	| IOT029a |	The Philips Hue kind of
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:28,447	| IOT029a |	Experience I will also say the Philips Hue Bridge does not work
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,983	| IOT029a |	The echo yet
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,519	| IOT029a |	That is something they know about
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,543	| IOT029a |	Working on
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| IOT029a |	But it broke my bridge connection
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,103	| IOT029a |	My bridge connection broke
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,895	| IOT029a |	And it does not come back
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,455	| IOT029a |	Broken Bridges are bad works with Nest work
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,223	| IOT029a |	With this
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,759	| IOT029a |	Bread the Philips Hue Bridge
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,295	| IOT029a |	Status still going strong
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,343	| IOT029a |	When I
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,367	| IOT029a |	Initially
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,415	| IOT029a |	My wing connection to all of my lights
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| IOT029a |	But there now back up
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,743	| IOT029a |	So I don't know what happened
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,255	| IOT029a |	But it's
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,327	| IOT029a |	Yeah and that is it
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,887	| IOT029a |	Myinstants in that integration
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| IOT029a |	Are working
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,191	| IOT029a |	Finish up that make sense
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,567	| IOT029a |	As as someone who has so many Integrations I was like
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,847	| IOT029a |	Let's see what's still up after
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:13,503	| IOT029a |	If not the reason I said it should work is because that's all cloud-based as opposed to
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:18,879	| IOT029a |	Hardware in your Homebase United csat some temporary glitches say between you know when carbon
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,903	| IOT029a |	And something else
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,439	| IOT029a |	In the house but the cloud services
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,231	| IOT029a |	The wink
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,767	| IOT029a |	In Phillips is actually cloud-to-cloud
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,375	| IOT029a |	Turn on AWS
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,935	| IOT029a |	Okay so that was that
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,471	| IOT029a |	Now onto the next
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,263	| IOT029a |	So the Lutron stuff in my house
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,567	| IOT029a |	Once again
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:41,151	| IOT029a |	I love it all the time and the user experience there the Lutron app
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,687	| IOT029a |	Brings in my Nest just because
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| IOT029a |	It does not bring in
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:46,783	| IOT029a |	Mike Hughes or anything else
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| IOT029a |	So far
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,367	| IOT029a |	I believe it would work with the elegado
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,951	| IOT029a |	Stuff the homekit Elgato stop but I could not find a way to bring it
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,487	| IOT029a |	Houston
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,535	| IOT029a |	Nor could I bring in my Schlage
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,047	| IOT029a |	Sense
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,351	| IOT029a |	Keep that in mind
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:03,167	| IOT029a |	I thought this was all going to be one big platform that
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,679	| IOT029a |	Everything just
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:04,703	| IOT029a |	I thought so too
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,983	| IOT029a |	Just checking
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,543	| IOT029a |	The other thing to know about
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,055	| IOT029a |	The Hue Bridge
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,335	| IOT029a |	Is if your Lutron light
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| IOT029a |	Are attached
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| IOT029a |	To the Lutron
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,175	| IOT029a |	Bridge they can't be attached to your Wii
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,039	| IOT029a |	That's it that's all you got and
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,551	| IOT029a |	It works
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,599	| IOT029a |	Great everything works as
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,879	| IOT029a |	You can schedule you
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:23,391	| IOT029a |	Do all the things
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:28,511	| IOT029a |	I had no problem Siri recognized everything so I haven't
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| IOT029a |	Water MC
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,559	| IOT029a |	What that was
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,327	| IOT029a |	Creative Zone
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,863	| IOT029a |	Upstairs at downstairs series
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:39,007	| IOT029a |	Cool with that and I put the Philips Hue Lights upstairs and downstairs as well and so when I told
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,799	| IOT029a |	Sear
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:43,359	| IOT029a |	Until your name I'm sorry y'all it's okay
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,431	| IOT029a |	Okay when I told her to turn my downstairs lights off
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,711	| IOT029a |	She turned off
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,991	| IOT029a |	My Lutron stuff
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:49,759	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,271	| IOT029a |	My Philips
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| IOT029a |	So that was a win
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:54,879	| IOT029a |	Yes the only unifying factor I had there
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,671	| IOT029a |	Was Siri there was no app where I go
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,183	| IOT029a |	I could pull all that
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,767	| IOT029a |	So that was cool on the light in front
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,535	| IOT029a |	Because I had
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| IOT029a |	1 Commandos like
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,839	| IOT029a |	Everybody your downstair
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,655	| IOT029a |	I would have brought the lock into
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,959	| IOT029a |	And the Schlage sense lock
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,983	| IOT029a |	Has keypad
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| IOT029a |	It has
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,799	| IOT029a |	You know Bluetooth it works you
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,079	| IOT029a |	You can go and you can go out with your phone
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,615	| IOT029a |	Very nice
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| IOT029a |	Having installed many locks
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,967	| IOT029a |	Serious about security
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,295	| IOT029a |	Oh yeah I mean I've installed a lot of Kwikset locks
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,319	| IOT029a |	Can I install the Kevo
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,391	| IOT029a |	Which is made by Kwikset like has a lot of
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,671	| IOT029a |	Much sturdier
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,231	| IOT029a |	Lot more screws to screw in in
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| IOT029a |	I was very impressed
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,327	| IOT029a |	Kind of a side note but if you actually care about the
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,399	| IOT029a |	I don't know how
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,423	| IOT029a |	Installing more screws makes it
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,543	| IOT029a |	So the lock is good the app
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,567	| IOT029a |	Yep kind of
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:49,151	| IOT029a |	Was not as pretty as some of the other apps that I've worked with but you know
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:49,919	| IOT029a |	It works
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| IOT029a |	You know what you're doing
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| IOT029a |	Pikachu history
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,503	| IOT029a |	Knock it and lock it
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,551	| IOT029a |	There's not a lot you can ask for here
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,343	| IOT029a |	I could not figure out
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,111	| IOT029a |	Houghton
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| IOT029a |	Siri will unlocked
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:16:59,903	| IOT029a |	My daughter-in-law
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:04,511	| IOT029a |	Lock my door but I could not figure out how to tie it to anything else for like goodbye
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,815	| IOT029a |	I'm leaving turn off my lights LACMA
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,839	| IOT029a |	Right I tried
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:14,751	| IOT029a |	Well it could be that we were just really now seeing the first generations of the homekit devices and the plateau
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,799	| IOT029a |	Form I think apple is mainly focused on
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:22,943	| IOT029a |	Security of it and getting it to the certified chips into product Partners hands and so on
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:26,271	| IOT029a |	Usability wise I think it sounds like there's work to do
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| IOT029a |	So I'd say we should give him some time
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,167	| IOT029a |	Lovely future
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:48,287	| IOT029a |	Homekit where when you add a device all you have to do is take a picture of a code on the box
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,311	| IOT029a |	Star on the device
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,871	| IOT029a |	So on the Philips Hue Bridge
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:56,479	| IOT029a |	It's on the back of the bridge on my lock it was on the instructions for the Locker on the back of the
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:01,855	| IOT029a |	So keep your instructions for the lock cuz on the actual back of the lock you've already installed the lock and soda
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,879	| IOT029a |	You don't really want to
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,415	| IOT029a |	Uninstall it to take the picture
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,439	| IOT029a |	Add apps to net worth
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,767	| IOT029a |	But it's very easy to add devices to your
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:09,791	| IOT029a |	I will give
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,839	| IOT029a |	There is no like
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,143	| IOT029a |	Password is saying there's nothing like that
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,191	| IOT029a |	But the core problem of having
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,727	| IOT029a |	A bunch of apps
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:20,287	| IOT029a |	And having to work with all of those apps
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,823	| IOT029a |	I still had to add all these apps
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,359	| IOT029a |	Phone
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,455	| IOT029a |	Siri
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:30,015	| IOT029a |	Figure out geofencing and all these things that I wanted to do with them
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,831	| IOT029a |	And only then could I can
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,855	| IOT029a |	Control limited funk
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,367	| IOT029a |	Ocean ride
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:39,999	| IOT029a |	I have a question and you don't know the answer that's fine we can leave it as an open-ended question for now
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:44,863	| IOT029a |	Do you still have an Android phone and if so have you tried using it with any of these new homekit products
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| IOT029a |	I do still have it
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,447	| IOT029a |	My iPhone is for work
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,983	| IOT029a |	So my day today phone is
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,031	| IOT029a |	I have not tried
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:56,639	| IOT029a |	Well actually it's oh the Hue Lights I use with the Android phone and it still works
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,431	| IOT029a |	So the bridge works both ways
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:03,295	| IOT029a |	I have not tried on the lot I can't see why they wouldn't work
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,831	| IOT029a |	My point though is
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,111	| IOT029a |	If you
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,903	| IOT029a |	Karnataka iOS
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,927	| IOT029a |	Household
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,719	| IOT029a |	You're adding homekit
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:14,047	| IOT029a |	People who don't have IOS won't be able to voice control things will have to use the app
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,887	| IOT029a |	Well right now that's true like I can't voice control
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,911	| IOT029a |	My lights anymore
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,447	| IOT029a |	That makes everyone
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,471	| IOT029a |	My husband is very sad
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| IOT029a |	And he actually
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,311	| IOT029a |	Refers to you
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,335	| IOT029a |	The echo
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,615	| IOT029a |	Supposed to
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:30,431	| IOT029a |	That is my follow-up comment
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:33,247	| IOT029a |	I was going to say I know I said this before
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,551	| IOT029a |	I would love to see two things happen
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,111	| IOT029a |	When I said before I know for sure and that is
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| IOT029a |	The Amazon
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| IOT029a |	Echo app
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,183	| IOT029a |	It's not called
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:48,607	| IOT029a |	I don't know why on IOS and Android you cannot use that app and your phone which has a microphone to actually be a
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,887	| IOT029a |	Voice controller
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| IOT029a |	For the echo
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| IOT029a |	And if they could do that
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,727	| IOT029a |	And some of these
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,751	| IOT029a |	Hardware makers
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,543	| IOT029a |	Let make the hugs in the end
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,335	| IOT029a |	And so on could integrate
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,871	| IOT029a |	Alexa voice services
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:03,455	| IOT029a |	Which is freely available now from Amazon where you can end table them to be
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,479	| IOT029a |	Voice controlled
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,247	| IOT029a |	Tumi
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,295	| IOT029a |	There's your underlying interface
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,575	| IOT029a |	And it doesn't matter what
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:11,135	| IOT029a |	You know phone you're using at the time doesn't matter if you're
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:13,695	| IOT029a |	If you are Echo is not in the same room as you and so on
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,975	| IOT029a |	Problem solve
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,767	| IOT029a |	Exactly because you know
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,303	| IOT029a |	Some kid has some valuable thing
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,095	| IOT029a |	The security
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:23,423	| IOT029a |	All of that stuff course people would have to buy new stuff
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,703	| IOT029a |	I mean you're going to have to buy a new Gear with the
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,727	| IOT029a |	Kit Hardware
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:32,639	| IOT029a |	And it cost more and it cost more because of the hum compatibility
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,407	| IOT029a |	Addition
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:33,919	| IOT029a |	Right
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,247	| IOT029a |	It's secure
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:40,319	| IOT029a |	But if you added something like the
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| IOT029a |	Services
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,159	| IOT029a |	What would happen is
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:50,303	| IOT029a |	Then you can control all of the stuff at once because right now I have broken rui for home in testing
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,119	| IOT029a |	Because I had to take my Lutron lights off
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| IOT029a |	What the wink hub
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,655	| IOT029a |	Right
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,679	| IOT029a |	To put it on homekit
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,703	| IOT029a |	Which doesn't talk
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:59,007	| IOT029a |	And now they don't talk to anything else
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,311	| IOT029a |	At least when they're on wink they talk to other system
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:04,383	| IOT029a |	I had to take the bridge the Hue Lights
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:07,711	| IOT029a |	You know that whole Bridge broke my access to
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,479	| IOT029a |	The
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,247	| IOT029a |	Amazon Alexa
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,319	| IOT029a |	So now like
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:13,855	| IOT029a |	You know I think I tweeted a couple nights
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,391	| IOT029a |	Mexico High broke I spent
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,672	| IOT029a |	An hour fixing my lights
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,952	| IOT029a |	I finally just
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,464	| IOT029a |	We had to go back to school
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,512	| IOT029a |	So I
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:25,120	| IOT029a |	I'm going to take this off as soon as I can because it doesn't work for us
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:25,888	| IOT029a |	It's terrible
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:28,960	| IOT029a |	As I as a user experience and I'll have to put it back on eventually
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,520	| IOT029a |	Again but it is it is no bueno
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,104	| IOT029a |	It's early yet like I'm not reading it off but I'm
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,640	| IOT029a |	I'm suggesting that
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,432	| IOT029a |	It's not going to be is
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,480	| IOT029a |	Appealing to as many people as
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:43,040	| IOT029a |	As if it were more open I guess it's the best way to say it
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:48,416	| IOT029a |	And it's a broken interface as it stands right now
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,952	| IOT029a |	I mean
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,464	| IOT029a |	Even
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:51,488	| IOT029a |	Okay
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,280	| IOT029a |	That's where it's at
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| IOT029a |	I will come back
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,352	| IOT029a |	Because you know there's more device
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,960	| IOT029a |	I'm going to try out cuz I know that there are Apple
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:04,032	| IOT029a |	Locations in devices that are supposed to bring these things together
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,312	| IOT029a |	I just don't
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,080	| IOT029a |	Have them
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,872	| IOT029a |	I have a purchase the right devices
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:11,712	| IOT029a |	It will it still early days like I said they're going to they're going to
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:14,528	| IOT029a |	Continue tweaking this and making a better make it more interactive with
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,344	| IOT029a |	Various apps and services so
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:23,744	| IOT029a |	I am willing to give him a little bit of a past but right now what I have today is working really done well for all of us here I just wish it was
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,768	| IOT029a |	Expanded to again
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:25,792	| IOT029a |	No smartphone apps
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:27,840	| IOT029a |	All right
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,608	| IOT029a |	Well
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,376	| IOT029a |	That's enough of that
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,912	| IOT029a |	So we will stay tuned
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| IOT029a |	For our guest
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,704	| IOT029a |	Today's gas
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| IOT029a |	Is
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,288	| IOT029a |	A professor from the University of Illinois
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,872	| IOT029a |	Who is going to talk to us about using drones in both
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,664	| IOT029a |	Farming but more
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,944	| IOT029a |	Typically a little closer to home
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,992	| IOT029a |	And helping our parents
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:47,808	| IOT029a |	And grandparents even Asian place
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:50,368	| IOT029a |	And making kind of warm and fuzzy drones that will
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:56,000	| IOT029a |	Deliver medicines and you know active kind of our friend for people as they age
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| IOT029a |	So stay tuned for that
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:03,936	| IOT029a |	Hey everyone this is feces
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:06,752	| IOT029a |	Higginbotham that I am back with the Internet of Things podcast
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:10,592	| IOT029a |	JB have an awesome guest it is nayyirah acumen
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:15,456	| IOT029a |	And she is with the University of Illinois and we are going to talk about a bunch of things
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,992	| IOT029a |	Warm-and-fuzzy drone
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,296	| IOT029a |	Drones on autopilot
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,064	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,832	| IOT029a |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,392	| IOT029a |	Analysis released basically two kinds
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:28,768	| IOT029a |	Making drones a little bit easier and more acceptable to a variety of people so
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:31,584	| IOT029a |	Thank you so much for coming on the podcast
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,888	| IOT029a |	Today angelface super having me
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,912	| IOT029a |	I am really excited
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| IOT029a |	It's so
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:42,080	| IOT029a |	I originally reached out to you because I read about your research with helping people Asian place with the aid of
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,104	| IOT029a |	Robots
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:49,504	| IOT029a |	That were designed to be a little bit friendlier I think the idea is called Aspire and this is kind of some of your
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:51,808	| IOT029a |	Research would you like to talk a little bit about what that's
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:57,952	| IOT029a |	What about are you sure it's piyo stands for automation supporting prolong
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,768	| IOT029a |	Independence residence for the elderly
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,328	| IOT029a |	So this is an NSF funded project
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,632	| IOT029a |	This will give us the opportunity
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:08,448	| IOT029a |	To design robots without more friendlier
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,240	| IOT029a |	Acceptable by humans
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,568	| IOT029a |	Unbuyable but she'll be mean strong
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,848	| IOT029a |	Underground wallpaper
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:18,944	| IOT029a |	It can help us to develop a complete sophistic system
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,480	| IOT029a |	4 people aging gets
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,528	| IOT029a |	Play Project 8
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,320	| IOT029a |	Goodbye 2017
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,600	| IOT029a |	The population of boxing
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,648	| IOT029a |	Will docker
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,928	| IOT029a |	Which means that
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:31,232	| IOT029a |	The nursing homes of Assisted Living
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| IOT029a |	Facility
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:34,048	| IOT029a |	Maybe understaffed
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,328	| IOT029a |	To support so many

EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,592	| IOT029a |	Stay at home
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,616	| IOT029a |	Then go to the store
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,384	| IOT029a |	Facilities
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,664	| IOT029a |	For example
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,712	| IOT029a |	Imagine a person who needs
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,784	| IOT029a |	Thule child for the medicine on a shell
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,320	| IOT029a |	And if he's hard
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:59,648	| IOT029a |	For somebody over 65 to do it alone
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:02,208	| IOT029a |	They can have a user-friendly tablet
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:06,816	| IOT029a |	IPhone with a push button launch a small drone
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,096	| IOT029a |	Fetch that message

EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,496	| IOT029a |	So I really like this
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,264	| IOT029a |	Concept
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,544	| IOT029a |	Because you talked about
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:19,872	| IOT029a |	Kind of actual safety versus perceived safety
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,664	| IOT029a |	Intent of building out the system
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:28,064	| IOT029a |	I like the idea of fuzzy drones and making them kind of friendlier sometimes robots and drones
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:29,344	| IOT029a |	Look like the stuff of nightmares like
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,624	| IOT029a |	Scary
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,392	| IOT029a |	Scary scary
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,672	| IOT029a |	Yes
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,720	| IOT029a |	We are trying to distinguish
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,536	| IOT029a |	Between actual safety and procedure
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:44,192	| IOT029a |	What does it mean it means that people usually tend to be afraid of flying objects
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:46,496	| IOT029a |	While in reality they can be safe
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,824	| IOT029a |	So how to distinguish between actual sanctity
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,104	| IOT029a |	Proceed safe
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:54,688	| IOT029a |	12:30 fundamental questions I will project
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:26:01,088	| IOT029a |	Is that an interdisciplinary school we have a psychology Professor on the team with her professor from you
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| IOT029a |	Human factors
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,928	| IOT029a |	Computer science club all together helping God

EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,376	| IOT029a |	To look more friendlier
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,912	| IOT029a |	And be less scary
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:19,264	| IOT029a |	Virtual reality lab of universe
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:26,944	| IOT029a |	Where Google immerse agent people into a reality world
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:31,552	| IOT029a |	So that I'm with the help of the biometric acquisition system
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,856	| IOT029a |	Will be measuring their heart rate
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:38,720	| IOT029a |	Skin conductance a lot about the parameters to do psychology professors
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,000	| IOT029a |	Things that are important
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,536	| IOT029a |	To have it handy
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,072	| IOT029a |	To judge on people's
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,096	| IOT029a |	Conception
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,888	| IOT029a |	About the flying technology
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:51,776	| IOT029a |	In close proximity
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:56,128	| IOT029a |	Fly a drone I'm actually kind of Highly stressed because he's are pretty expensive machines
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,432	| IOT029a |	I mean even at $300 I'm like
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,992	| IOT029a |	It's going to fall from the sky and it's going to break
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:06,112	| IOT029a |	So what is controlling the the Drone to go pick up the medicine bottle for example of
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,392	| IOT029a |	What's it's probably not
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,928	| IOT029a |	You don't my mom or my dad
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:13,280	| IOT029a |	No they will be autonomous which means that summer Cruise button on your
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:16,096	| IOT029a |	Tablet or iPhone
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:20,192	| IOT029a |	The drawing will be launched automatically thanks to its autonomous
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:20,704	| IOT029a |	Compulsive
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,824	| IOT029a |	It will be launched autonomously from your pool spots on it will go
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:29,152	| IOT029a |	Deliver definition
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,432	| IOT029a |	So it's a piece of
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,968	| IOT029a |	Software that
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:36,576	| IOT029a |	Can be developed today and there a lot of flights today
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:40,672	| IOT029a |	We are just trying to make sure that we can get them
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,976	| IOT029a |	Differently for their use
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,488	| IOT029a |	Indomethacin
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:44,512	| IOT029a |	Environment
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:47,328	| IOT029a |	This is possible
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,096	| IOT029a |	First of all
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,888	| IOT029a |	I would I would like to
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,168	| IOT029a |	Kind of project
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:53,472	| IOT029a |	Enjoyed it today our parents
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,544	| IOT029a |	Are scared of blood
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,080	| IOT029a |	Flying next to them
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:00,896	| IOT029a |	By 2030 2035
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:04,736	| IOT029a |	Does the projected timeline it's me who is going to be
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,016	| IOT029a |	1665
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,296	| IOT029a |	And if I'm
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,856	| IOT029a |	They developing the technology in the law
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:16,256	| IOT029a |	Bennington 15-20 years most likely I won't be afraid to use it in my home
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,536	| IOT029a |	Okay so
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:21,376	| IOT029a |	I'm still trying to imagine these things flying kind of all around me
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,936	| IOT029a |	And I do find it a little disconcerting
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:27,008	| IOT029a |	Kind of walk me through a day in the life of
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,056	| IOT029a |	Someone who is aging-in-place in their home
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,848	| IOT029a |	Can I have this vision
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,896	| IOT029a |	I assume they're still someone who comes
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,944	| IOT029a |	I assume it's not totally isolated
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:35,968	| IOT029a |	I'm so
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:42,880	| IOT029a |	What time it is maybe I'm communicating with my robots in the drones are kind of acting as extension of hands or delivery
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,416	| IOT029a |	Before the robots I don't know but
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,952	| IOT029a |	What do you see
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,768	| IOT029a |	Your this is 20 years from now and you're sitting in your
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,072	| IOT029a |	Futuristic Barcalounger
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,120	| IOT029a |	What is what is life like
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,912	| IOT029a |	Marisol
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:58,752	| IOT029a |	I'm sure all of you remember the Cinderella costume with Cinderella
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:01,312	| IOT029a |	Helped by meissenburg to set up the house
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,616	| IOT029a |	Sosa's preparation for this
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,640	| IOT029a |	Fire project
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,480	| IOT029a |	Kind of related to that Cinderella
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:08,992	| IOT029a |	Cartoon
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:12,832	| IOT029a |	My students told me Cinderella could be held by my son
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,368	| IOT029a |	The bird then we can have it
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:17,184	| IOT029a |	As well have drones underground robot
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,208	| IOT029a |	Things to draw
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:19,488	| IOT029a |	The Cinderella movie
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,840	| IOT029a |	Imagine 20 years ago none of us had to sell
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:27,424	| IOT029a |	Today we'll have a few of those and we know how to operate them
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,192	| IOT029a |	Smoothly
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:30,496	| IOT029a |	And how much we can accomplish with the healthcare
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,264	| IOT029a |	The cell phone
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:31,776	| IOT029a |	And
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:33,568	| IOT029a |	Within the next
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,616	| IOT029a |	When to use the drones will be the self
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:38,176	| IOT029a |	Is the cell phones at today
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:43,040	| IOT029a |	The way I Envision is that first module Industrial Revolution
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,832	| IOT029a |	Using PlayStation 4
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:48,928	| IOT029a |	We'll have drones flying collecting data helping the farmers to take
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,512	| IOT029a |	Regarding prescription farming
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:54,304	| IOT029a |	So cold when they will be
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:55,328	| IOT029a |	Applying
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:59,680	| IOT029a |	Fertilizers that taking care of weave
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:03,008	| IOT029a |	I'm different types of issues that agriculturalists AC
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:04,544	| IOT029a |	This can help us
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:11,712	| IOT029a |	The technology into the hands of the farm as long as the farmer is using it
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:15,040	| IOT029a |	In his farm he will start using it in his backyard
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,576	| IOT029a |	People slowly gets used
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,880	| IOT029a |	To the idea of changing the drawer
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:19,904	| IOT029a |	2 something

EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,016	| IOT029a |	Like YouTube
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:47,552	| IOT029a |	It should have a vision system
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,856	| IOT029a |	And old dad
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,136	| IOT029a |	Humble intelligence
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,160	| IOT029a |	That's going to be developed
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:53,184	| IOT029a |	Over the next ten
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,232	| IOT029a |	220 years to make them
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,792	| IOT029a |	Friends of people and not like
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,816	| IOT029a |	Karaoke
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,584	| IOT029a |	Check the round
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,352	| IOT029a |	Okay
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,144	| IOT029a |	So you're saying that
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,680	| IOT029a |	But kind of the computer like
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,704	| IOT029a |	PC actually
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:07,008	| IOT029a |	Little beginning offices little transition
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:07,776	| IOT029a |	Gradually
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| IOT029a |	To the home and then
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,616	| IOT029a |	Our pockets but
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:14,944	| IOT029a |	You know to a warm and friendly place where it's the first thing we
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:17,504	| IOT029a |	Turn 2 in the mornings and probably the last thing we
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,272	| IOT029a |	We deal with
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,040	| IOT029a |	Since we go to bed
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:21,344	| IOT029a |	So actually let's talk about Farms
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,648	| IOT029a |	Because you actually in addition to your research
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,416	| IOT029a |	Which
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,184	| IOT029a |	Itsfunneh
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:28,000	| IOT029a |	Cool I like the Cinderella reference
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,792	| IOT029a |	Two mice for my favorite part of that movie
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,816	| IOT029a |	Actually so
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:34,144	| IOT029a |	Let's go to your startup which is called intelinair
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,448	| IOT029a |	And you guys are kind of building
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:37,984	| IOT029a |	You call it a controller
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,520	| IOT029a |	And it sounds basically like
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:42,080	| IOT029a |	It's autopilot it's a better form of autopilot
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:47,712	| IOT029a |	For drones for commercial aircraft and even for highly automated mechanical systems
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:56,416	| IOT029a |	That's what I'm building a highly intelligent also intelligent husband's birthday
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:58,208	| IOT029a |	And intelligent
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,000	| IOT029a |	In air rights
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:06,144	| IOT029a |	The objective of it is to achieve actionable intelligence from Able information with recorded
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,448	| IOT029a |	So

EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| IOT029a |	It can be automatic
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:15,360	| IOT029a |	How to clean lungs from an iPad or iPhone by a farmer
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,688	| IOT029a |	Farm in the mall Stockton
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,224	| IOT029a |	Collect
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:26,368	| IOT029a |	I mean take pictures collect information about the Weeds about the water damage and various issues
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,160	| IOT029a |	The farmer may be facing
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:31,744	| IOT029a |	Take real-time decisions about
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:35,072	| IOT029a |	The need for fertilizing.
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:37,120	| IOT029a |	Pesticides and other types of
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,680	| IOT029a |	Treatments that the farm meaning
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,704	| IOT029a |	Health Department
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:41,984	| IOT029a |	Implement
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:42,752	| IOT029a |	Decision
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,288	| IOT029a |	So we know that
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:49,664	| IOT029a |	9 million people are hungry every day are dying from Hunger everyday
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,992	| IOT029a |	To save the world to solve the Hungary
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:57,856	| IOT029a |	We need to bring advanced technology to large farm
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,160	| IOT029a |	So that you know to have anyways
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,208	| IOT029a |	Otherwise
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:03,744	| IOT029a |	It would be impossible to
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,024	| IOT029a |	Feed the people
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,816	| IOT029a |	Which is the next 20 years
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:09,376	| IOT029a |	So I'll autopilot functionality
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:11,168	| IOT029a |	To give the farm
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:12,192	| IOT029a |	Butterfly
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:12,960	| IOT029a |	Consult
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:17,568	| IOT029a |	So that he flies easier Supply smoother he's not
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:20,128	| IOT029a |	Scared of unpredictable events
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:23,200	| IOT029a |	He can fly in high winds in inclement weather
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:24,480	| IOT029a |	How far away are we
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,272	| IOT029a |	Delivering a
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,040	| IOT029a |	Drone
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,832	| IOT029a |	That is so easy
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:32,416	| IOT029a |	I don't want to insult Farmers I'm like so easy to fly that farmer can do it her
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:34,720	| IOT029a |	Just power how far away are we
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,768	| IOT029a |	From delivering a drone that is
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:37,792	| IOT029a |	That capable
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:38,560	| IOT029a |	Into the hands of
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,864	| IOT029a |	I think only maybe
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:42,912	| IOT029a |	Google Toolbar very close
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,984	| IOT029a |	Launch their drawing
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,776	| IOT029a |	Skull
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:51,360	| IOT029a |	Purpose in the second or third quarter of nine
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:54,432	| IOT029a |	The other company
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,480	| IOT029a |	Names that have similar Solutions
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,760	| IOT029a |	Which Maybe
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,296	| IOT029a |	Partial information process
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:02,624	| IOT029a |	Right because when we are talking about
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:07,488	| IOT029a |	It would be capable of taking all the decisions
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:10,304	| IOT029a |	In real time do older in La cakes
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:13,888	| IOT029a |	This isn't a complex system to achieve that level of perfection
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,936	| IOT029a |	Have a complete system
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:17,472	| IOT029a |	It may take a few years
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:17,984	| IOT029a |	But
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,544	| IOT029a |	There are already two solutions
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:22,848	| IOT029a |	That address the problems
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:27,456	| IOT029a |	Possibly this may distinguish one or two weeks for example order
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:32,832	| IOT029a |	Be targeted for water damage Solutions I don't have everything on the top of my mind
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,624	| IOT029a |	How much would something like
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,392	| IOT029a |	That cost
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,416	| IOT029a |	OG ideas
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:38,720	| IOT029a |	To make it low cost and low coasters
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:40,768	| IOT029a |	Disposable in this is where the science
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,304	| IOT029a |	Take significant role
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:45,888	| IOT029a |	As a consultant acknowledges that can tells you to take any system
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:48,704	| IOT029a |	Blue loaded with all possible sensor
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,472	| IOT029a |	Making it
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:53,568	| IOT029a |	Super expensive so you can solve any problem in the most easiest way
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:59,968	| IOT029a |	Define to talk of lost cuz you my mom kids you're trying to make something accessible
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,808	| IOT029a |	To Farmer is an end-user you want to make it as cheap as pulse
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,880	| IOT029a |	There's a certain degree be on the way to Compton
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:09,696	| IOT029a |	Cheap because any of this advanced
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:13,280	| IOT029a |	Control guidance navigation just won't work.
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:13,792	| IOT029a |	Defensive
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:17,632	| IOT029a |	Performance level is required for old is Al Gore
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:24,032	| IOT029a |	To work but on the other hand and the sense of. Also getting cheaper and cheaper so we're hoping that
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,568	| IOT029a |	Eventually down the road
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:29,152	| IOT029a |	Technologist make cost around $500 or even less
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:32,736	| IOT029a |	Okay and so how much is it is it like $2,000 today is it
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,760	| IOT029a |	It like $5,000
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:38,368	| IOT029a |	Let's put it today today something for 5000
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,136	| IOT029a |	Can do quite a bit
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,464	| IOT029a |	I would imagine
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:44,512	| IOT029a |	Savages Enterprise to 500
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,280	| IOT029a |	Okay sounds
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,560	| IOT029a |	Alright
