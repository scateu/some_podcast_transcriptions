EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:41,376	| IOT182 |	Okay Kevin this show is going to be a bit of a
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:43,680	| IOT182 |	Challenge because one of our big stories
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:45,472	| IOT182 |	Is Amazon planning to release
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,008	| IOT182 |	At least eight new
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,800	| IOT182 |	Madame a powered gadgets
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,872	| IOT182 |	Set a reminder to everybody listening that Madame a is
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,664	| IOT182 |	The Amazon echos digital assist
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:56,736	| IOT182 |	So these devices include a microwave
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| IOT182 |	Amplifier
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,040	| IOT182 |	Dim sum in car garage
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,344	| IOT182 |	I expect we're going to see these
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,392	| IOT182 |	Pretty soon because the holiday season is
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,160	| IOT182 |	Is coming up
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| IOT182 |	So we're not going to talk
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,952	| IOT182 |	Whole lot about
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,000	| IOT182 |	I want everyone to stay tuned
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| IOT182 |	For Amazon news
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,584	| IOT182 |	Because if and when these come out we're going to be
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,120	| IOT182 |	Audit right Kevin
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,144	| IOT182 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:16,704	| IOT182 |	It could happen at any time you never know with Amazon
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,496	| IOT182 |	That's how to cut a trumpet the way you
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:22,336	| IOT182 |	Evidence I'm sorry
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:27,712	| IOT182 |	Okay we're going to talk about Terrace later don't worry you don't have to do that cuz I know that that's a favorite topic right there
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:28,992	| IOT182 |	So we can talk
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,808	| IOT182 |	What is actually happening
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:35,392	| IOT182 |	With the Amazon ecosystem that they launched this week something called
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,696	| IOT182 |	Madam egg gadgets toolkit
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| IOT182 |	And this
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,024	| IOT182 |	This is a really kind of
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:45,632	| IOT182 |	I think this is actually really cool thing what this is is this lets your devices
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,656	| IOT182 |	Interact
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| IOT182 |	With the Amazon
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| IOT182 |	Echo device
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,496	| IOT182 |	Kevin do you want to give an example
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:57,408	| IOT182 |	Yeah these devices which work over Bluetooth and I say these devices meeting these are devices that will be coming people
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,456	| IOT182 |	We'll have to make these devices are add these feature
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,224	| IOT182 |	Existing device
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,504	| IOT182 |	They can
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,784	| IOT182 |	Send events
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,088	| IOT182 |	To an echo where they can receive
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,952	| IOT182 |	Information from an echo so some examples that Amazon gives because against is all
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,976	| IOT182 |	A software development
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| IOT182 |	Kid it's not an actual product
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| IOT182 |	You just go out and buy
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| IOT182 |	They have like wake word to text
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:20,960	| IOT182 |	Frank Zappa you are Gadget could respond when it hears the Madam a wake word
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,240	| IOT182 |	So if you had
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| IOT182 |	It's not great example but
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:27,360	| IOT182 |	A Bluetooth connected cuckoo clock it could pop its head out whenever
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,896	| IOT182 |	You say mad at me
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:32,480	| IOT182 |	So you can add some things to your house that can do other things like they even say
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:36,320	| IOT182 |	Maybe have a robot that can lip-sync Asmat America local weather
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,344	| IOT182 |	It would appear as if
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| IOT182 |	The robot attacks
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,624	| IOT182 |	She saying the word
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:42,208	| IOT182 |	Odoo notifications timers and alarms on
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,256	| IOT182 |	Even music I thought the music example
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,536	| IOT182 |	What kind of cool cuz
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,304	| IOT182 |	I don't know
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,120	| IOT182 |	Growing up you saw these on dashboards of cars
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,008	| IOT182 |	Oh my gosh are you serious that's exactly
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:59,104	| IOT182 |	It's exactly about so here's what they say the music aspect of this
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:01,408	| IOT182 |	Gadget sdks coming soon you can't do this yet
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:05,248	| IOT182 |	I didn't say for example you could create visual performances with music
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:08,832	| IOT182 |	Such as a hula girl that sways her hips when songs are playing on
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,600	| IOT182 |	Amazon music
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,904	| IOT182 |	So it's kind of extending
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,672	| IOT182 |	The
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,976	| IOT182 |	Echo into other devices not
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:19,071	| IOT182 |	For providing information per se but more for interactive thing
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:23,935	| IOT182 |	Right and it's clearly Amazon is looking at this for games
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:26,751	| IOT182 |	Probably heading into the holiday season because
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,519	| IOT182 |	They
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| IOT182 |	Talk a lot about using it with
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,567	| IOT182 |	Toys
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:30,847	| IOT182 |	Baby products
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:34,687	| IOT182 |	So I think this is interesting because big picture
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:38,271	| IOT182 |	We should talk about this I think I'm last week show where we said that basically
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| IOT182 |	Google +
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:39,807	| IOT182 |	Amazon
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| IOT182 |	Ecosystem are basically the standards and iot
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,207	| IOT182 |	And from that perspective this basically gives
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| IOT182 |	The echo
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:50,303	| IOT182 |	A data schema that other devices can now
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,607	| IOT182 |	I'll see so we can understand when
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| IOT182 |	Madam
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:54,655	| IOT182 |	Alerted it
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,703	| IOT182 |	Darius
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,471	| IOT182 |	Samantha
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,239	| IOT182 |	Information
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,263	| IOT182 |	Things that it can do
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,335	| IOT182 |	So this is a pretty powerful tool and it sounds like
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:05,663	| IOT182 |	I mean if you think about the native support for various
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,199	| IOT182 |	Devices like light bulbs
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:07,711	| IOT182 |	Wasn't switches
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:08,991	| IOT182 |	Even ovens down
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,855	| IOT182 |	Those are also data schemas for those devices that only work with
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,623	| IOT182 |	Madam a
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:17,183	| IOT182 |	Until they're kind of building the standard out here
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,207	| IOT182 |	And is it
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,231	| IOT182 |	Great because
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:21,023	| IOT182 |	It's not interoperable well
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,047	| IOT182 |	No but
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| IOT182 |	It is happening
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:27,423	| IOT182 |	Yeah I agree I say no it's not great that it wouldn't be interoperable
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:30,495	| IOT182 |	Between everything in the house for example
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,799	| IOT182 |	But I'd rather at least have
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,335	| IOT182 |	A platform that has its own standard
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:38,175	| IOT182 |	Yes so that way all of the devices that work with that platform
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| IOT182 |	Suggested words with Madam a
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| IOT182 |	Logo and such
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| IOT182 |	You know it's going to work
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,111	| IOT182 |	You know I think it's smart of Amazon to do this
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,903	| IOT182 |	Yeah I wish it was more open but it is what it is
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,231	| IOT182 |	Yeah and if I mean if you only end up with
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,511	| IOT182 |	Google Amazon
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,071	| IOT182 |	Do we still count homekit
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,375	| IOT182 |	Yeah we can have to count it
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,935	| IOT182 |	So okay
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,703	| IOT182 |	So yes
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,239	| IOT182 |	Those might end up being our
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,031	| IOT182 |	And I mean that's not
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| IOT182 |	Terrible it's
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,591	| IOT182 |	And if you're a developer Building C
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:11,967	| IOT182 |	New product it is possible to get all those three things working on a device even though it is
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,735	| IOT182 |	Really freaking hard
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,807	| IOT182 |	So it's better than having a degree
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| IOT182 |	Every other
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,951	| IOT182 |	You mention that there's going to be some kid Focus product
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,743	| IOT182 |	That could work with this in fact
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,047	| IOT182 |	Amazon announced that later this year
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,327	| IOT182 |	The Meta make gadgets for
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,399	| IOT182 |	Kids would be implemented and they have four five different
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:34,751	| IOT182 |	Car makers that plans already brushed spots by while we while we are thinking
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,287	| IOT182 |	Small little robots and things but
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,567	| IOT182 |	They're making smart toothbrushes
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| IOT182 |	Call Brock Bots
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,383	| IOT182 |	San Antonio
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,175	| IOT182 |	Measure motion and cents
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:45,247	| IOT182 |	It's the motion so that way and the time of kids brushing their teeth
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,783	| IOT182 |	And that could interact with
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,551	| IOT182 |	Matinee
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,599	| IOT182 |	Through this gadgets for
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,879	| IOT182 |	Kids so they
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,671	| IOT182 |	Like how you can make games because
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,695	| IOT182 |	You can have an Interactive
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,207	| IOT182 |	But this toothbrush
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,743	| IOT182 |	Lots of potential
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,279	| IOT182 |	I think so
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:00,351	| IOT182 |	That really excited plus you tie that to last week
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:02,399	| IOT182 |	Snooze that we talked about and I think was actually 2 weeks
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,447	| IOT182 |	Which was the
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,751	| IOT182 |	Mattamy talking to sensors
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,031	| IOT182 |	And expanding
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,055	| IOT182 |	Capability
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:11,871	| IOT182 |	To Central light sensors and sensor stuck to the SmartThings system
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,919	| IOT182 |	And we're starting to see
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,199	| IOT182 |	Some really powerful stuff
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,735	| IOT182 |	With
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| IOT182 |	The
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| IOT182 |	So
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| IOT182 |	Again
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:19,807	| IOT182 |	Really excited
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,623	| IOT182 |	Don't overlook waddles the smart duck
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,159	| IOT182 |	Waddles the smart. Yes
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,207	| IOT182 |	The rubber ducky that plays music and
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,487	| IOT182 |	Talks to the echo.and
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,023	| IOT182 |	Hangs out with you and your kid
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,047	| IOT182 |	Skip
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,607	| IOT182 |	Okay I joke but man
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,167	| IOT182 |	When my daughter was born you guys it was
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,191	| IOT182 |	2006
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,495	| IOT182 |	And I want you to know that the iPhone wasn't
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,287	| IOT182 |	Get out
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| IOT182 |	Get out so I tell people
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:48,479	| IOT182 |	Like new moms are like oh you know at least I have my phone while my baby sleeping or nursing or whatever and I'm like
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,759	| IOT182 |	I had nothing
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,855	| IOT182 |	I didn't even have a Kindle
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:55,135	| IOT182 |	It was a dark time
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,647	| IOT182 |	So
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,927	| IOT182 |	It's good to be a parent
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,463	| IOT182 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,999	| IOT182 |	Peking
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,767	| IOT182 |	Of giant
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,071	| IOT182 |	Smart home platforms let's talk about
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,839	| IOT182 |	Google
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,911	| IOT182 |	I did get my new Google speaker I haven't been home
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,423	| IOT182 |	Witches
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:10,751	| IOT182 |	Tougher smart home reporter so I haven't been able to install it
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| IOT182 |	But
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,567	| IOT182 |	Soon soon I will be as excited about it as
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,871	| IOT182 |	That's the Lenovo smart cast
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,663	| IOT182 |	Yes but
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,455	| IOT182 |	Their new products
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,015	| IOT182 |	Allegedly
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| IOT182 |	Allegedly
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,575	| IOT182 |	This is the week for alleged products
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:30,207	| IOT182 |	Let's talk about Google's I believe this is real this looks like a very legitimate
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,719	| IOT182 |	Leak
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:37,631	| IOT182 |	We knew that Google was going to do its own smart speakers or had plans to do its own it just work with Lenovo and Jay
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,655	| IOT182 |	JBL first
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,679	| IOT182 |	Earlier this year
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,703	| IOT182 |	But a
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:43,519	| IOT182 |	Site called mysmartprice.,
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,335	| IOT182 |	Apparently has all the leaked information on the
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,871	| IOT182 |	Brand new coming soon
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,407	| IOT182 |	Google home hub
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:54,015	| IOT182 |	Which is their smart speaker it's a 7-inch display I would anticipate
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,831	| IOT182 |	It will be debuting on October 9th
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,647	| IOT182 |	Because that is the Google Hardware event in New York
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,671	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,487	| IOT182 |	I like this in I don't like this
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,255	| IOT182 |	That's because
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:08,095	| IOT182 |	It is very similar in terms of functionality to the existing smart displays
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:14,495	| IOT182 |	However Stacy you have a camera on your Lenovo smart display along a little privacy shutter and you use that
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| IOT182 |	Duo calls
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,543	| IOT182 |	Surprisingly
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,335	| IOT182 |	There is no camera
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,103	| IOT182 |	On this
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,151	| IOT182 |	This device this device is like a 7in
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,687	| IOT182 |	Tablet in landscape mode
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,223	| IOT182 |	It's patch the back of a
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,735	| IOT182 |	Speaker Bass
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:29,087	| IOT182 |	Which the speaker bass looks much bigger than what's currently available from the other smart
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:29,855	| IOT182 |	This place
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:33,439	| IOT182 |	That's good but I'm shocked ordino Duo support no
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,999	| IOT182 |	Camera that maybe because this is a landscape only device
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,583	| IOT182 |	You know I also think it might be
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| IOT182 |	Might be smart because
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:45,727	| IOT182 |	People are a little iffy about Google it right at this particular moment in
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,495	| IOT182 |	In time
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,799	| IOT182 |	There's even remember the location drama
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| IOT182 |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,919	| IOT182 |	Ghetto in more so than Amazon which has a business model that we
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,711	| IOT182 |	Tend to think we understand
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| IOT182 |	Which you like
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| IOT182 |	They sell us stuff
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,295	| IOT182 |	That's their business
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,343	| IOT182 |	Google is still they have this kind of weird
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:01,855	| IOT182 |	Add
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,695	| IOT182 |	Director of data broker is what they are
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,487	| IOT182 |	Yeah so I can
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,559	| IOT182 |	See why there might be a little hesitant on this Plus
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| IOT182 |	Harley lowers
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| IOT182 |	The cost a little bit
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:15,679	| IOT182 |	Good and they also have
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,751	| IOT182 |	Maybe it makes sense cuz you're not cannibalizing their other of their partner
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:24,639	| IOT182 |	But that's the funny part of it it's almost like hey people don't trust us with data so
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,687	| IOT182 |	We're going to be a little more private up the camera
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,223	| IOT182 |	But he Partners you go ahead and put your
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,735	| IOT182 |	September 2nd
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,063	| IOT182 |	That is
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,367	| IOT182 |	It's kind of funny but whatever
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,159	| IOT182 |	So everything that you're
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,183	| IOT182 |	Smart display
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,719	| IOT182 |	But you haven't had chance to use yet
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| IOT182 |	Can do
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,023	| IOT182 |	This will do so you can
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:41,791	| IOT182 |	Stream music
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,327	| IOT182 |	Chromecast receiver
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:47,679	| IOT182 |	You can watch YouTube videos on it you can use the Google Assistant
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,471	| IOT182 |	Controlling your home getting information
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,519	| IOT182 |	Etc and you have the display for all that time
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,031	| IOT182 |	Screen display
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,335	| IOT182 |	So everything we talked about with the
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,615	| IOT182 |	LG Smart display
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,383	| IOT182 |	You can
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| IOT182 |	Do
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,687	| IOT182 |	Here's the thing
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| IOT182 |	Here's the thing
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,735	| IOT182 |	The rumor
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,015	| IOT182 |	Is
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,039	| IOT182 |	149
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:06,111	| IOT182 |	Which is cheaper than the smart display even the 8in
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,903	| IOT182 |	So that's
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,671	| IOT182 |	Good
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,487	| IOT182 |	Here's the thing that I said I was kind of not excited about
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,023	| IOT182 |	I said back in March
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,839	| IOT182 |	Time for Google to make a smart home hub
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,631	| IOT182 |	And this only supports
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,447	| IOT182 |	2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,239	| IOT182 |	So I will
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,031	| IOT182 |	Have liked to seen zubeen
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,079	| IOT182 |	Seaway videos in a product like
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,127	| IOT182 |	Or even even
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,919	| IOT182 |	Make it a Google Wi-Fi router
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,687	| IOT182 |	As well.
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,223	| IOT182 |	I don't see any indication of that
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,015	| IOT182 |	This just feels like I'm
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,343	| IOT182 |	Missed opportunity but maybe I'm too needy I don't know
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,135	| IOT182 |	Man you are so focused you
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| IOT182 |	Kevin you're like
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,415	| IOT182 |	Having dreams of
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:41,695	| IOT182 |	Yes so
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,303	| IOT182 |	You got that straight you like I hate her
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:49,119	| IOT182 |	But I want a hub
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| IOT182 |	The issue here
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,703	| IOT182 |	And this is a big challenge in
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:56,543	| IOT182 |	The smart home is for most products that people are buying today
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,079	| IOT182 |	The one-off
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,615	| IOT182 |	Products there like I needed
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:00,895	| IOT182 |	Hubs
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,199	| IOT182 |	What you want is it be in Z-Wave
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,479	| IOT182 |	Which makes sense
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,551	| IOT182 |	But those are sensor-based products those are for things
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,599	| IOT182 |	Light switches and all kinds
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,415	| IOT182 |	For the most part the only thing we don't really have
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,439	| IOT182 |	Great stuff in
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,231	| IOT182 |	In the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth world
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,743	| IOT182 |	Is sensor
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,047	| IOT182 |	Because you have Wi-Fi
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,071	| IOT182 |	Is battery hog
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| IOT182 |	Bluetooth mesh
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,375	| IOT182 |	Took a while coming and
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,703	| IOT182 |	And it's starting so we might see some Bluetooth sensors that are really capable
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,239	| IOT182 |	But for now
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,007	| IOT182 |	That's what
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,287	| IOT182 |	And I think that'll actually
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| IOT182 |	Relatively
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| IOT182 |	And if it does I'll be okay
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:33,919	| IOT182 |	I'll be okay
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:40,575	| IOT182 |	I told about me obviously it's all about it
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,135	| IOT182 |	You know something really cool stuff requires
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,159	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,951	| IOT182 |	Yeah so I know you
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:46,975	| IOT182 |	I know you hate the
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,535	| IOT182 |	There's a really good reason they're not out there
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:55,167	| IOT182 |	If everyone started clamoring for sensors and wanted to really like deeply program their smart home I think we get there
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,703	| IOT182 |	But until then
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,215	| IOT182 |	I don't think
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,823	| IOT182 |	And I should say that you're going to be at this event so
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:04,383	| IOT182 |	The podcast coming out the week of the Google News
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| IOT182 |	Kevin will have been there
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,687	| IOT182 |	He'll give us all his
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,271	| IOT182 |	Also
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,295	| IOT182 |	Speaking of Google
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,087	| IOT182 |	Little step for you
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| IOT182 |	The Google home Mini
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:14,879	| IOT182 |	What's the best selling
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:19,743	| IOT182 |	Turn speaker into tube was it really sold or was it just packaged along with every single device I felt like
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:28,447	| IOT182 |	I don't know why it's really it's shipments not sales this is a report from strategy Analytics
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:32,799	| IOT182 |	At a pretty good regardless of the word they use sales or shipment
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,103	| IOT182 |	They say in the second quarter
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,871	| IOT182 |	That
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:40,479	| IOT182 |	The Google home have 2.3 million Global shipments compared to the echo Dot
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| IOT182 |	Stupid
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| IOT182 |	Tonight
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,063	| IOT182 |	Pretty darn close but
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:44,831	| IOT182 |	I think
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,647	| IOT182 |	This may be the first time that has happened
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,047	| IOT182 |	Ask could will be
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:54,815	| IOT182 |	I don't know
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,839	| IOT182 |	I think it's the first time
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,423	| IOT182 |	And speaking of all of this
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:00,191	| IOT182 |	Especially the housing
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:05,311	| IOT182 |	I should say because I wrote about it for the newsletter but if you don't read the newsletter
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| IOT182 |	Which is okay
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,127	| IOT182 |	You only listen to us
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,663	| IOT182 |	I had an Amazon smart person
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,199	| IOT182 |	Coming to my house
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| IOT182 |	House and set it to rights
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,295	| IOT182 |	Guess you paid 50 bucks for that
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,599	| IOT182 |	I think it's 4995 and I had a
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,623	| IOT182 |	Lovely gentleman
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,415	| IOT182 |	Who's actually employed by Amazon
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,207	| IOT182 |	Show up at my house
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,743	| IOT182 |	Cost for a hour-long comp
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,255	| IOT182 |	Application
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,327	| IOT182 |	Some people ask they were like
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,863	| IOT182 |	Did you do it just to show him up at
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:31,423	| IOT182 |	I was like I did not I really want it I had some problems with
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| IOT182 |	My implementation
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,239	| IOT182 |	Defects in
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,519	| IOT182 |	Let me tell you guys
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,055	| IOT182 |	This fellow knew
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:43,455	| IOT182 |	What he was talking about he walks in he's like wow you already have a lot of stuff like within 2 minutes of my home yet identified like all
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,479	| IOT182 |	All of these brands of products
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:48,063	| IOT182 |	Even identify my Logitech Harmony Hub just a little IR
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,599	| IOT182 |	Receiver that was stuck on top of the cab
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,903	| IOT182 |	And just to be clear
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,439	| IOT182 |	He did not know
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:56,767	| IOT182 |	Who you were that you do this show or anything like that you
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,559	| IOT182 |	Winter the typical customer process
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| IOT182 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,375	| IOT182 |	I did while he was there
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,143	| IOT182 |	Tell him
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| IOT182 |	You know cuz he was like
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,959	| IOT182 |	You really have a lot of stuff and I'm like
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,239	| IOT182 |	I do this for a living I
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,031	| IOT182 |	Gadgets for
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,567	| IOT182 |	And I'm not mentioning his name
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,871	| IOT182 |	There was absolutely nothing wrong with the experience
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| IOT182 |	Set there had been
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,943	| IOT182 |	Talked about it before we talked
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,735	| IOT182 |	But
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,503	| IOT182 |	I will say
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:20,575	| IOT182 |	He was prepared to install he was
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:24,159	| IOT182 |	Prepared to give me advice on which things to buy what we ended up doing because
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:25,951	| IOT182 |	We have a lot of things
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,487	| IOT182 |	Installed
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,023	| IOT182 |	Is we ended up
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:31,327	| IOT182 |	Focusing on programming a few
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,375	| IOT182 |	Because I find it so too
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:39,775	| IOT182 |	I like I'll make him do the boring stuff and maybe I'll have ideas for things I can include
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,543	| IOT182 |	So
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,591	| IOT182 |	We also talked about my naming a
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,383	| IOT182 |	So I have
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,431	| IOT182 |	A lot of devices and sometimes
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| IOT182 |	When I asked
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,503	| IOT182 |	The echo to turn something on or off
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,527	| IOT182 |	Madame Abel be like
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,319	| IOT182 |	Which device did you mean
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,087	| IOT182 |	And I have to say it again
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:57,951	| IOT182 |	So his advice to me was actually to name everything that was in my living room
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,487	| IOT182 |	Living room light fun
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,511	| IOT182 |	Living room light 2
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,815	| IOT182 |	Living room lights for the group
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:03,327	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,607	| IOT182 |	Living room blinds
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:06,655	| IOT182 |	Sitting room fan
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,191	| IOT182 |	All of these things
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:13,055	| IOT182 |	Is that actually for some reason help I have been trying to come up with creative names for everything
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,847	| IOT182 |	Because it seemed easier with
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,127	| IOT182 |	Other systems
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,919	| IOT182 |	But I just kind of acquiesced
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,943	| IOT182 |	He did say
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,015	| IOT182 |	Couple things I didn't realize you could add for
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:25,599	| IOT182 |	Teens if you create a grouping of Lights you can just add the group into the
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,879	| IOT182 |	So you don't have to add the light
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,159	| IOT182 |	Italy witch
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,719	| IOT182 |	Helpful if everyone else do that
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| IOT182 |	Good on that but I didn't
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,023	| IOT182 |	And I was like who
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,791	| IOT182 |	Thank you
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,071	| IOT182 |	And then the other thing
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:40,447	| IOT182 |	He told me is if I could if I wanted to name things only in The Madam a app
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,727	| IOT182 |	If I didn't want
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:45,823	| IOT182 |	To do it like my Lutron lights for example like either name them in the Lutron app
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,615	| IOT182 |	And then those would populate because
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,639	| IOT182 |	Is my Lutron hub
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| IOT182 |	Shares data with
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| IOT182 |	Madam
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,735	| IOT182 |	With Siri and
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,247	| IOT182 |	With Google
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:57,087	| IOT182 |	Or I could just change the names in Madam hey if I didn't
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:58,111	| IOT182 |	Want to mess up
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| IOT182 |	The names in the other two
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| IOT182 |	This is important
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,463	| IOT182 |	Because
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,231	| IOT182 |	For a while
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:04,255	| IOT182 |	Google
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:07,071	| IOT182 |	Really hated it that I named everything in the living
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,655	| IOT182 |	I personally do not want
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,703	| IOT182 |	Different names for everything in each differ
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| IOT182 |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,263	| IOT182 |	So I'm still
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,055	| IOT182 |	Dealing with the frustration of certain
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:17,567	| IOT182 |	Systems like
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:18,591	| IOT182 |	Different naming
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,383	| IOT182 |	Procedures butt
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,407	| IOT182 |	You know if your
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| IOT182 |	Really organized and you want you
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| IOT182 |	Devices to basically have three different names
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,247	| IOT182 |	You could
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,855	| IOT182 |	So is this available for pretty much anybody wants to
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:34,975	| IOT182 |	To call Amazon and say Hey I want somebody come to my house or 49 bucks or whatever it is
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,279	| IOT182 |	Help me get started or whatever
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,327	| IOT182 |	So I'm not sure
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:42,143	| IOT182 |	It came up as an option in my Amazon
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,935	| IOT182 |	Because they're an employee
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,959	| IOT182 |	Of Amazon
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,007	| IOT182 |	My hunch is if you're out in the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| IOT182 |	Maybe not
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| IOT182 |	But I bet
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,591	| IOT182 |	You could find it
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,871	| IOT182 |	You're near major city
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:53,663	| IOT182 |	Right I probably could do it
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,199	| IOT182 |	I don't know that I will but
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,735	| IOT182 |	It sounds like you had a pretty good experience
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,551	| IOT182 |	Like would you recommend this
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:01,087	| IOT182 |	For somebody who's Brand New
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,647	| IOT182 |	That's like the typical question and get right
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:09,023	| IOT182 |	You know I don't know where to start but I know what I want I don't know what I want to do I don't know what I want to have but I want us tomorrow
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| IOT182 |	So would this be good for those people
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:11,839	| IOT182 |	Yes
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,607	| IOT182 |	He would be
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,399	| IOT182 |	This one guy
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:22,335	| IOT182 |	Just this one guy I mean I'm assuming and I should tell you he was a genius before he was so it Apple Genius before he work for
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:23,871	| IOT182 |	He did
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| IOT182 |	The Border
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,431	| IOT182 |	Where the Rubicon
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,455	| IOT182 |	Not sure which one
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:30,527	| IOT182 |	So this particular individual
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,855	| IOT182 |	I feel confident saying that if you called this person to your house
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,391	| IOT182 |	That he would be able to help you
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:39,743	| IOT182 |	Setting stuff up he actually gently prompted me for he's like
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,767	| IOT182 |	What can I see in July
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,535	| IOT182 |	Do you want
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:44,863	| IOT182 |	Let's do movie time and have a conversation
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:51,007	| IOT182 |	And I explained what I was after he's like oh yeah that's really cool okay and then he actually even Mesa
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,031	| IOT182 |	Superlative suggestions
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,079	| IOT182 |	Based on the prices I had
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,847	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,895	| IOT182 |	He suggests he looked around he's like
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:59,711	| IOT182 |	Oh the Lutron light I love those actually recommend those
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,479	| IOT182 |	Everybody
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:03,551	| IOT182 |	And you know he liked the wink Hub he liked the ledge.
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,319	| IOT182 |	Lake Harmony
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:07,135	| IOT182 |	He did not force me to buy a Fire TV infrared
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,647	| IOT182 |	Cute saying
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:12,255	| IOT182 |	So overall I would say it was a really good experience even
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,815	| IOT182 |	Bless his heart tried to help me find
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:15,583	| IOT182 |	A Smart Lock
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,095	| IOT182 |	For my front door
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,119	| IOT182 |	Impossible
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,911	| IOT182 |	Because of the Locking
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:21,727	| IOT182 |	Because he was like already he was gung-ho ready to try it
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,263	| IOT182 |	I text you if I find
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:30,431	| IOT182 |	If he find something he's now going to be elevated till I coyote hero but
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:30,943	| IOT182 |	Pradel
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| IOT182 |	I got really positive experience
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,527	| IOT182 |	$50
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,807	| IOT182 |	For an hour of this person
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:40,415	| IOT182 |	Time you if you didn't feel comfortable installing you probably have to do it at least two
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:43,743	| IOT182 |	Because you would want this person and there's additional installation piece
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:46,047	| IOT182 |	But coming out and saying
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:49,631	| IOT182 |	Oh this is your life will to hear some ideas that might work for you
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,655	| IOT182 |	And here's the products
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,935	| IOT182 |	You should buy
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,703	| IOT182 |	Or I think
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:55,775	| IOT182 |	You should buy and I think you would actually have a good
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:56,287	| IOT182 |	Experience
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,847	| IOT182 |	Okay hey
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,639	| IOT182 |	Let's talk about utilities Kevin
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,407	| IOT182 |	Woohoo
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,247	| IOT182 |	Yeah let's do that with Telstra
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:08,575	| IOT182 |	Right so Telstra down in Australia
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| IOT182 |	Which has now
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| IOT182 |	2
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,391	| IOT182 |	Iot Networks
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,415	| IOT182 |	So they have a
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,719	| IOT182 |	NB iot Network as well as a cat
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,231	| IOT182 |	M
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,047	| IOT182 |	Network they have hooked up with
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:20,607	| IOT182 |	Some major water utilities down there we don't know which one
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,679	| IOT182 |	But basically this will allow the water utilities
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,983	| IOT182 |	To track and monitor water usage
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| IOT182 |	Conservation
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:27,775	| IOT182 |	Netty leak
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:32,639	| IOT182 |	Etc said something that you as a consumer going to use but maybe it's offered through your utility
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:37,759	| IOT182 |	Nowthis uses their NB iot Network which covers 3.5
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,807	| IOT182 |	Million square kilometers down there
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,087	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,111	| IOT182 |	They do have
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,159	| IOT182 |	As I said the cat m
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:47,999	| IOT182 |	Network as well but they're not using for this and that's because of the amount of data
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:50,815	| IOT182 |	They're two networks depending on what it is you want
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,583	| IOT182 |	To do
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,399	| IOT182 |	With our team one is better suited than the other
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:57,983	| IOT182 |	I was just going to remind people nb-iot
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,263	| IOT182 |	Cat M1
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,543	| IOT182 |	Up to
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:03,359	| IOT182 |	Megabit per second of data so you can do a little bit more
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| IOT182 |	Exactly
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,175	| IOT182 |	Isolate for instance
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,479	| IOT182 |	The water services don't need a ton of
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:13,087	| IOT182 |	But Telstra does sell three different
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,111	| IOT182 |	Tracking devices
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:16,928	| IOT182 |	Slap need more bandwidth and therefore
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,208	| IOT182 |	They use the cat M1 Network
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,744	| IOT182 |	Yay
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,536	| IOT182 |	And in other
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,048	| IOT182 |	Exciting
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,328	| IOT182 |	Exciting news
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:25,120	| IOT182 |	After the utilities is
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:25,632	| IOT182 |	Insurance
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:26,912	| IOT182 |	So
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,704	| IOT182 |	A company called a hippo insurance
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| IOT182 |	Is
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,776	| IOT182 |	Doing a deal with a company called no show
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,824	| IOT182 |	And I've written about notion they make these
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:34,592	| IOT182 |	Discs
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| IOT182 |	Is the best
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| IOT182 |	Hockey they're not hockey
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:39,456	| IOT182 |	Not that our sensors they have
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,760	| IOT182 |	Temperature humidity water leak
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,040	| IOT182 |	Lot of information motion
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,832	| IOT182 |	Very easy to use
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,368	| IOT182 |	So hippo has done
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,392	| IOT182 |	A deal with notion
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,184	| IOT182 |	To give new hippo cast
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:50,720	| IOT182 |	Samaritan qualifying States
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,512	| IOT182 |	A notion smart home starter kit
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| IOT182 |	When they sign up for an insurance policy
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,072	| IOT182 |	This is like
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,888	| IOT182 |	About their time and be
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:00,448	| IOT182 |	Could have what we talked about for a while
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,984	| IOT182 |	Which is trying to
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:04,544	| IOT182 |	Get insurance companies to subsidize
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:07,104	| IOT182 |	What is kind of a high price for a lot of smart home devices
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:07,616	| IOT182 |	Does people feel
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,432	| IOT182 |	Water leak sensors
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:13,248	| IOT182 |	Kind of pricey I'd rather do something cool like a color-changing bulb
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,272	| IOT182 |	Or nothing
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,808	| IOT182 |	That's probably the more common thing
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,832	| IOT182 |	Things to say
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:21,440	| IOT182 |	But this is you know your insurance providers helping you out with this kid and
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:25,280	| IOT182 |	It is also created a policy that integrates the information
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:25,792	| IOT182 |	From this
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:32,960	| IOT182 |	It's also the first policy to integrate this information into their pricing so what will happen is not only do you like a lot
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| IOT182 |	Like a 5% discount if you
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,544	| IOT182 |	Add like a security system
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| IOT182 |	Things like that
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:39,104	| IOT182 |	This they're basically
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,920	| IOT182 |	Lowering the cost as long as you have this kit
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| IOT182 |	Installed
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:46,016	| IOT182 |	And I think it'll be great to see what kind of data
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,040	| IOT182 |	They get from that
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:50,368	| IOT182 |	So it's an exciting deal I would keep an eye on it because
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,904	| IOT182 |	If this I think
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| IOT182 |	Actually is
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,184	| IOT182 |	The future
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:55,744	| IOT182 |	Okay moving right along
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,536	| IOT182 |	What about standards
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,560	| IOT182 |	Iot security standard
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,144	| IOT182 |	Are we excited yet
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:08,544	| IOT182 |	Going from utilities to standards I don't know in the world I don't know so Sprint has launched
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,080	| IOT182 |	What it's
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:10,848	| IOT182 |	Calling
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:13,408	| IOT182 |	The Curiosity iot platform
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:17,248	| IOT182 |	Oh I kind of made fun of this when it came out
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,552	| IOT182 |	Cuz who needs another iot platform
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,064	| IOT182 |	But here we are
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,856	| IOT182 |	With yet another one
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:25,184	| IOT182 |	This one has a lot of moving parts so it's not just
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:26,464	| IOT182 |	Sprint order
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| IOT182 |	Sprint
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,256	| IOT182 |	Portsmouth SoftBank
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,792	| IOT182 |	Who
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,816	| IOT182 |	Now owns arm
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,888	| IOT182 |	Yeah so there's the
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,192	| IOT182 |	Arm for connectivity management and
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| IOT182 |	Sim Solutions
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,008	| IOT182 |	Dislike for provisioning
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,056	| IOT182 |	Cellular devices with iot
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,360	| IOT182 |	As well as something called
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:49,760	| IOT182 |	Packets another SoftBank company softbank's really smart they're taking the buying all these other companies that are in the space
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,528	| IOT182 |	And then just
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:54,624	| IOT182 |	Putting together Thomas like being a smart venture capitalist you know using your own
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,904	| IOT182 |	Investment companies
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,184	| IOT182 |	Put things together
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| IOT182 |	But packet
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| IOT182 |	Enables an advanced Network
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:02,304	| IOT182 |	With bare metal servers at the edge
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,840	| IOT182 |	Watch that can be activated in minutes
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:04,608	| IOT182 |	Going to Sprint
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:11,008	| IOT182 |	Yeah and so the bare metal servers are important because the underlying feature here is basic
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:13,568	| IOT182 |	That you control your Edge Network
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,336	| IOT182 |	Yourself
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:18,944	| IOT182 |	As a customer and that means you can put your own containers or virtualize it
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:24,576	| IOT182 |	However you want it also means that you can reduce latency because you're going to run everything at the edge
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:29,184	| IOT182 |	This is okay right now the network for it is going to be LTE and Cat m
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:29,952	| IOT182 |	There
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,256	| IOT182 |	They're very excited seeing 5G is coming
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,048	| IOT182 |	Isn't everybody excited by that
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:34,816	| IOT182 |	Yes I'm like
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:40,704	| IOT182 |	But let's see other things that are good they thought about power consumption
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:43,776	| IOT182 |	Which is good they allow you to run this with different operators and different
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,312	| IOT182 |	Countries which is good for you know if your
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,360	| IOT182 |	Monitoring things to travel around
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:48,640	| IOT182 |	The world and
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,432	| IOT182 |	Their plan is to launch it
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:54,272	| IOT182 |	In eight areas in November 14th of February and then
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,808	| IOT182 |	150 + 29
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:25:02,208	| IOT182 |	Team so that's the Curiosity core they also have an operating system that ties into this and handles
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,744	| IOT182 |	Device and data management all that
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,280	| IOT182 |	Fun stuff that every iot platform
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:09,120	| IOT182 |	Have anime have on top of that with their call coyotes
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,888	| IOT182 |	Solutions
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,168	| IOT182 |	These are actually pretty
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,936	| IOT182 |	Packaged
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:15,008	| IOT182 |	Clusters of features for things like vehicle and Fleet Management
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,544	| IOT182 |	Or personal safety
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,824	| IOT182 |	And smart cities
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:20,640	| IOT182 |	But some of these are
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,176	| IOT182 |	Really aimed it like
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:26,016	| IOT182 |	Companies that don't want to have to do all this integration work and build everything
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,088	| IOT182 |	And that makes sense because you can
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:35,488	| IOT182 |	The platform out there but if nobody wants to do the world to use it it's not going to go anywhere so by targeting different verticals use cases
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,000	| IOT182 |	Isn't providing a
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:41,376	| IOT182 |	Place to start Sara speak or even a whole Solution that's how you're going to get
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,400	| IOT182 |	Customers
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:46,496	| IOT182 |	Anne-Marie to see if that it will see I mean the devil's in the details on these so we'll see
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,544	| IOT182 |	How Wellspring to straddle the line between
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,568	| IOT182 |	Customized enough
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,592	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,104	| IOT182 |	Flexibility
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,384	| IOT182 |	Which is everybody
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:57,760	| IOT182 |	So again nice package will see if people are going to use it
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:01,344	| IOT182 |	I feel like there's a lot out there but this could give someone a run for their money
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,160	| IOT182 |	Alright next up
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:04,672	| IOT182 |	Is
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:05,952	| IOT182 |	BlackBerry
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:09,792	| IOT182 |	And I'm surprised it took blackberry's so long to really
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:15,936	| IOT182 |	Get into the iot space but that's what they're doing. They been in there for a while remember cute
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:20,032	| IOT182 |	Way back in 28 12 2011
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,592	| IOT182 |	They were touting q and x which is an embedded
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| IOT182 |	System software development
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,176	| IOT182 |	As something appropriate for iot
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,736	| IOT182 |	It really wasn't because it didn't have like a
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,504	| IOT182 |	Jeffrey Artis
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,784	| IOT182 |	Yeah qnx was
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,088	| IOT182 |	It still is heavily
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,112	| IOT182 |	In Automotive
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,648	| IOT182 |	Fur entertainment systems and such
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,696	| IOT182 |	And I think they want to leverage infected
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:40,000	| IOT182 |	Tried to once with their BlackBerry PlayBook
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,536	| IOT182 |	Tablet that went nowhere
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:42,816	| IOT182 |	So yeah
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,608	| IOT182 |	You're right I guess you could say they tried to
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:47,936	| IOT182 |	Pivot qnx into something that it really wasn't but
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,728	| IOT182 |	It's okay cuz now they have Blackberry Spark
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:50,752	| IOT182 |	Exactly
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| IOT182 |	Kevin
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,800	| IOT182 |	What is black
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,360	| IOT182 |	So this is their plan
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:27:01,760	| IOT182 |	Top form for it security so it like for example it could cut off a devices connectivity
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,576	| IOT182 |	Send location when deciding on a risk factor
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,392	| IOT182 |	It has unified endpoint management so
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:11,232	| IOT182 |	That is part of the deployment and updating for devices also notification
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,000	| IOT182 |	Social Security threats
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,024	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,840	| IOT182 |	Oh I wasn't saying that that's about it however
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:19,168	| IOT182 |	They also are including something or calling London Shield
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,448	| IOT182 |	And this
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,216	| IOT182 |	Will
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,752	| IOT182 |	Use the data from the system
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:25,312	| IOT182 |	This could be some people may not like this
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:25,824	| IOT182 |	It will
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:30,176	| IOT182 |	Take data from businesses and people that use this technology and use it
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:32,480	| IOT182 |	Train the AI software
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,504	| IOT182 |	In spark
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:37,088	| IOT182 |	And therefore the more secure organizations individuals will be at home
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,368	| IOT182 |	People use it and that makes
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:41,952	| IOT182 |	Sent him a technical standpoint but I wonder if anybody's going to be concerned about
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:43,488	| IOT182 |	Privacy on these iot devices
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,280	| IOT182 |	Well if it's just this
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:49,376	| IOT182 |	Security threats incursions that's actually something that a lot of
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,936	| IOT182 |	Security companies actually offer today
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,984	| IOT182 |	A pull that data in and
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,776	| IOT182 |	Then train their bottles and send out
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:58,848	| IOT182 |	They're paid him for the latest threats and then we also have like
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,616	| IOT182 |	Their groups you
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:00,896	| IOT182 |	Send your
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,664	| IOT182 |	Threat information
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,200	| IOT182 |	Take a pilot
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,248	| IOT182 |	Panda sounds like that
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:08,576	| IOT182 |	I don't know there's not a lot of details on London
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,880	| IOT182 |	Okay well we'll wait
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,648	| IOT182 |	Find out for
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| IOT182 |	And in the meantime
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:13,696	| IOT182 |	It's time to
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,720	| IOT182 |	To talk about
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:16,512	| IOT182 |	Our question of the day

EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,112	| IOT182 |	We will
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,392	| IOT182 |	Cut off new entries
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:48,512	| IOT182 |	And we will dry name and announce you guys on the next show and send you out a
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,072	| IOT182 |	Schlage sense smart deadbolt and Wi-Fi adapter
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,608	| IOT182 |	Very nice
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,376	| IOT182 |	Is that a tie
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:56,192	| IOT182 |	Remember smarter homes start with
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:56,960	| IOT182 |	Play
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,752	| IOT182 |	Okay so this week
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,520	| IOT182 |	We have
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,544	| IOT182 |	Hazard question
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,080	| IOT182 |	Voicemail from Alistair
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:09,248	| IOT182 |	Hey Stacy it's Alice to hear from Sydney Australia I'm a long time listener and I'm looking for a solution
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,272	| IOT182 |	For a
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,320	| IOT182 |	Adobada and remote into come
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:14,112	| IOT182 |	For my apartment that I live in
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,648	| IOT182 |	I have a current you to come
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:18,464	| IOT182 |	System by scr Electronics
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:21,024	| IOT182 |	And look around at a few Solutions
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,560	| IOT182 |	Like Melo and
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,328	| IOT182 |	Monkey
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:29,472	| IOT182 |	But just wanted to know your thoughts and if you had any solutions that's I guess would work better or if there was any kind of
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,008	| IOT182 |	Solution
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,544	| IOT182 |	That would be great thanks for not much
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:36,896	| IOT182 |	LOL Alistar about a year ago someone else had this exact
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,432	| IOT182 |	Same question for me
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,968	| IOT182 |	And they too were looking at
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,736	| IOT182 |	Nelo
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,784	| IOT182 |	And just so you know the monkey
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:47,136	| IOT182 |	Popcorn that you're taking out actually became mellow hits started as a Kickstarter for monkey
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,416	| IOT182 |	And now it is
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,440	| IOT182 |	Hello
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,976	| IOT182 |	Really trying say the word mellow
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:51,744	| IOT182 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,768	| IOT182 |	So what this is
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:55,840	| IOT182 |	This is a speaker that you pop on the intercom
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,120	| IOT182 |	Button area in
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,888	| IOT182 |	Your apartment
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,400	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,192	| IOT182 |	Yes your existing
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,984	| IOT182 |	And it's inside your apartment
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:05,568	| IOT182 |	And it basically it communicates with the electrical signals
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:07,104	| IOT182 |	That are happening so you can
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:09,152	| IOT182 |	Talk to the person at the door if
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:10,432	| IOT182 |	Want to and
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,968	| IOT182 |	You can also
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:13,248	| IOT182 |	Send a signal to open the
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:16,064	| IOT182 |	Now that's all well and good
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,344	| IOT182 |	If you want them to come
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,624	| IOT182 |	All the way up into your
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,648	| IOT182 |	Apartment though
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:22,208	| IOT182 |	After you post them in you're going to need a Smart Lock
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:22,976	| IOT182 |	On your door
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:23,744	| IOT182 |	And you're going to have to
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:24,512	| IOT182 |	Open that
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,560	| IOT182 |	So that's kind of how that
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,072	| IOT182 |	Works
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,864	| IOT182 |	Danella website
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,656	| IOT182 |	If you know your intercom Baker they
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:31,936	| IOT182 |	Give you
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,472	| IOT182 |	Compatibility information
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:34,752	| IOT182 |	They seem pretty compatible slots
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,568	| IOT182 |	Announce have a 30-day money-back
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,336	| IOT182 |	Guarantee
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,360	| IOT182 |	So if it doesn't work you
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:44,736	| IOT182 |	I don't know how hard it is to install I don't have this problem so I haven't tried this device
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,528	| IOT182 |	Based on the Nilla website
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,320	| IOT182 |	It doesn't seem too difficult to install
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:52,160	| IOT182 |	Stop it literally connecting to your existing intercom
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:53,440	| IOT182 |	System in your apartment,
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,744	| IOT182 |	And therefore it's not any
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:57,536	| IOT182 |	Drilling ordering like that
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,816	| IOT182 |	You literally
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,584	| IOT182 |	Canada
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,864	| IOT182 |	Connected via jumpers
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:02,400	| IOT182 |	To your existing intercom so
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:08,800	| IOT182 |	System and when you're done when you move in that complex you can actually unwire and take it with you so it doesn't seem so
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,592	| IOT182 |	So bad but it's going to be late
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,616	| IOT182 |	500 euros
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,128	| IOT182 |	Back
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,152	| IOT182 |	That's a lot of money
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,712	| IOT182 |	But if you never want to get off the couch
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,248	| IOT182 |	It might be worth it
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:18,784	| IOT182 |	True
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:19,808	| IOT182 |	A lot of money
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:23,392	| IOT182 |	No I mean there are people with like mobility issues
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,208	| IOT182 |	Or you don't do parents
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,744	| IOT182 |	You got a baby in one hand
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,024	| IOT182 |	Amazon Echo in another
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,840	| IOT182 |	This is high drama
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:34,656	| IOT182 |	Waddle the Ducks running around I mean let it slide
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:38,752	| IOT182 |	So yeah Alistair that seems to be the best option and
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:41,056	| IOT182 |	The nice thing is it doesn't require your landlord
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,592	| IOT182 |	Cuz I was thinking of
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:44,384	| IOT182 |	Nest doorbell out there type
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:45,920	| IOT182 |	Black butt
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,224	| IOT182 |	Then you got to talk to your dorm in a lot of
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:48,736	| IOT182 |	Apartments have
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:51,552	| IOT182 |	That's actually another thing depending on your apartment
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,856	| IOT182 |	Depending on your country's regulations
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,416	| IOT182 |	You may not be able to install a Smart Lock on Europe
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:58,208	| IOT182 |	Apartment because there rules about
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,744	| IOT182 |	Someone having a master key
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| IOT182 |	Need to give emergency
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,280	| IOT182 |	Personal workers
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,072	| IOT182 |	In cases of fire in
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:05,120	| IOT182 |	That sort of thing so just be aware
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| IOT182 |	Of that
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,400	| IOT182 |	Good point
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,448	| IOT182 |	But you could at least get the Buzzard
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,288	| IOT182 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,080	| IOT182 |	Or you can actually do that not worried about fires
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:16,640	| IOT182 |	Your call
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:17,920	| IOT182 |	It's up to you
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,456	| IOT182 |	Okay
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:22,528	| IOT182 |	So if you have a question or you would like to enter to win
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:25,088	| IOT182 |	Can a Schlage sense smart deadbolt wifi adapter

EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,728	| IOT182 |	Smart Lock that they
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:45,312	| IOT182 |	Last week the impact of tariffs
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,616	| IOT182 |	On iot devices
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,640	| IOT182 |	Other consumer devices
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,432	| IOT182 |	This is big news
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,712	| IOT182 |	In the World At Large so
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,016	| IOT182 |	And now
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,040	| IOT182 |	A word from our sponsor
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:33:02,976	| IOT182 |	Hey everyone we are taking a break from this week's Internet of Things podcast for a message from our sponsor
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,000	| IOT182 |	Where is Basque
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:08,352	| IOT182 |	And I have json man who is VP of iot it's at
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,120	| IOT182 |	Ask you to talk to us
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:11,936	| IOT182 |	In the last few weeks we talked about sass
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:12,960	| IOT182 |	Edge computing
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:14,752	| IOT182 |	And what it's doing with iot
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,056	| IOT182 |	This week we're going to talk about the iot
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,336	| IOT182 |	Partner ecosystem you guys are
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,384	| IOT182 |	Can you tell us a little bit of
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:22,688	| IOT182 |	Jordans the critical element
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:23,712	| IOT182 |	And I empty space
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:24,736	| IOT182 |	The fact is there most
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,016	| IOT182 |	Components that are
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,552	| IOT182 |	Required to bring together two
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,088	| IOT182 |	Complete the total solution
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:29,856	| IOT182 |	Infor customers
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,392	| IOT182 |	If you think about the accident
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:33,440	| IOT182 |	Played
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:33,952	| IOT182 |	Locomotive
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:35,488	| IOT182 |	Or turbine
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:36,512	| IOT182 |	Or windmills
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,048	| IOT182 |	Abscess
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,840	| IOT182 |	Some cells that are generating the data with all of the
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,376	| IOT182 |	Appointments around
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,912	| IOT182 |	There's a storage Networks
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:45,728	| IOT182 |	Weatherby cloud or crimmins the network itself
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,496	| IOT182 |	In the Methodist
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:47,264	| IOT182 |	The transport
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:48,800	| IOT182 |	The data and there's so many variations
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:49,568	| IOT182 |	Snare from
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,336	| IOT182 |	Satellite
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,384	| IOT182 |	Will power win Networks
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:53,152	| IOT182 |	5G
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:53,920	| IOT182 |	Xiaomi next
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:55,456	| IOT182 |	Matisse is certainly critical
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,992	| IOT182 |	And we think certainly an important
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,272	| IOT182 |	Component of that is analytic
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,320	| IOT182 |	So we really feel like
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,344	| IOT182 |	These ecosystems have
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:04,416	| IOT182 |	Define tested verified for
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:04,928	| IOT182 |	A total salon
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:10,560	| IOT182 |	Where do you see the examples of this ecosystem approach
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| IOT182 |	Helping customers get better
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:14,400	| IOT182 |	Results so you do see it across
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,680	| IOT182 |	Industry what are folks
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,472	| IOT182 |	Just identified
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:18,752	| IOT182 |	These industry clouds

EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,800	| IOT182 |	Space coyote
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:21,312	| IOT182 |	Key platforms
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:23,360	| IOT182 |	Non example and then work
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,664	| IOT182 |	Put them to plug Sasson as he Analytics
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:28,224	| IOT182 |	Choice a great example of that is important
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:29,760	| IOT182 |	We have with g
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:30,272	| IOT182 |	Transportation
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,296	| IOT182 |	And their ads

EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,392	| IOT182 |	And their device
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,672	| IOT182 |	In this case those devices
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:40,000	| IOT182 |	Deployed locomotives but they can be deployed to any high top
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,024	| IOT182 |	Last. End
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,048	| IOT182 |	Helpful
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,584	| IOT182 |	What's processing at the edge
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:44,864	| IOT182 |	And the prep for data is
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:45,888	| IOT182 |	Get back into
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:47,168	| IOT182 |	The server found
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:50,240	| IOT182 |	So that's one example where we're seeing Great Sea

EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,144	| IOT182 |	Just this month
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:23,680	| IOT182 |	You guys launched a
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,704	| IOT182 |	Ran
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:25,984	| IOT182 |	Connect a lock on them
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:29,312	| IOT182 |	And it's kind of different than most connected
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,384	| IOT182 |	So we're going to talk about that but first
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,408	| IOT182 |	Let's level set with
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:35,456	| IOT182 |	Hampton products International
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,224	| IOT182 |	What is that
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:42,112	| IOT182 |	Canton was established to create a security Hardware platform

EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:06,432	| IOT182 |	But that has given us a real opportunity to create some very distinctive
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,456	| IOT182 |	Security Hardware products
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,760	| IOT182 |	Underboss the Brinks
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:11,552	| IOT182 |	And the Hampton brand name
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,856	| IOT182 |	So we did launch Deer Point last
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:20,000	| IOT182 |	Thursday we announce that the array deadbolt would begin shipping on or about October 1st to Consumers
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,792	| IOT182 |	And we're really excited about that lawn
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:24,352	| IOT182 |	Okay when I saw the lock I was
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:26,400	| IOT182 |	Most impressed by the fact that it uses
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:26,912	| IOT182 |	Wi-Fi
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,192	| IOT182 |	And it has
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:28,960	| IOT182 |	Solar panels
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,752	| IOT182 |	It so it can charge if it's outdoors
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:32,288	| IOT182 |	Obviously not if you installed this
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,312	| IOT182 |	Patrick Rodgers
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:36,640	| IOT182 |	Why go with Wi-Fi Bluetooth
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,408	| IOT182 |	Some of the other
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:37,920	| IOT182 |	Technologies out there
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:43,040	| IOT182 |	2010 when we started this what has become an odyssey and we designed
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:45,856	| IOT182 |	Connected home platform we knew that consumers
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:47,648	| IOT182 |	Told us that they wanted to start with the deadbolt
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:51,488	| IOT182 |	They call that kind of a handshake as you're going into the house
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,792	| IOT182 |	And so for years ago weed
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:55,072	| IOT182 |	Cat outline
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,864	| IOT182 |	The structure of
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:03,264	| IOT182 |	The way this deadbolt should be built and as we interviewed consumers and we talked to lots of people in the iot world
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,032	| IOT182 |	They all said
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:10,432	| IOT182 |	If there's a way for you to do this without creating a hot or a Gateway and it could just connect directly to the home router
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:10,944	| IOT182 |	That would be awesome
EDL	00:38:11,456	00:38:13,248	| IOT182 |	What we knew would be a challenge
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:20,928	| IOT182 |	Most people in residential loan don't have power to the front door so we knew we'd have to come up with a really robust battery
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,976	| IOT182 |	Software configuration that would
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:25,536	| IOT182 |	Extend battery life behind just a couple of weeks
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,816	| IOT182 |	Over the last 4 years
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:28,352	| IOT182 |	By combining the solar
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:31,936	| IOT182 |	Technology with some really Innovative battery and circuitry
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:32,960	| IOT182 |	Technologies
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,520	| IOT182 |	We've been able to create a platform where
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,800	| IOT182 |	Is this lock is in
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:37,568	| IOT182 |	Installed in your phone
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:40,128	| IOT182 |	Contour you make that up to seven eight or nine months
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:42,432	| IOT182 |	Battery life out of a
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,456	| IOT182 |	A single battery
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,992	| IOT182 |	If you get indirect sunlight
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:49,600	| IOT182 |	Your 90 days and if it's installed in your garage to your point
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,904	| IOT182 |	Then it's going to be probably 30 days max
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:54,208	| IOT182 |	So to account for that
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,000	| IOT182 |	We elected ultimately to put
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:56,768	| IOT182 |	2
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:39:03,168	| IOT182 |	5200 milliamp batteries in each package so that the consumer can keep one battery fully charged
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,192	| IOT182 |	When they
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:08,288	| IOT182 |	Array app tells you that your battery is down to maybe 10% life left
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:13,152	| IOT182 |	Then you can pull it out and put in your second battery in that process takes about 5 Seconds
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:14,944	| IOT182 |	With this locket
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:18,272	| IOT182 |	MSRP used
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:20,320	| IOT182 |	Compared to some of the other locks
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:23,136	| IOT182 |	The closest is going to be the nest by Yale lock
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,648	| IOT182 |	Its 2:40
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:26,464	| IOT182 |	Are you concerned that you're coming in high
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:26,976	| IOT182 |	In this market
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:33,888	| IOT182 |	We really have challenge ourselves in her thinking about the value and originally our Target price was to be between 249
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:34,912	| IOT182 |	259
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,192	| IOT182 |	To build in
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,728	| IOT182 |	The solar technology and
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:43,360	| IOT182 |	Give consumers to $50 suggested retail price batteries in a single package
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,896	| IOT182 |	Forced us to take the
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:48,992	| IOT182 |	Suggested retail price to 299 initially expecting like a
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,272	| IOT182 |	Every consumer product
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:51,040	| IOT182 |	In the
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:57,440	| IOT182 |	Field that over time we're going to be able to squeeze cost out and check right now we're working on a new prove battery
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:03,840	| IOT182 |	Allergy and to your point of Non Solo version that could be installed in the garage with Superior battery life and clearly a
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:07,424	| IOT182 |	Lower price because we wouldn't have the solar technology built into the lot
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:10,240	| IOT182 |	So yes I think it's relatively high price
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:14,336	| IOT182 |	Very premium products going in it's a great to deadbolts
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:20,736	| IOT182 |	Which will mean something to a locksmith and consumer some consumers a lot too
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:23,808	| IOT182 |	Customers who insist on a real high-quality deadbolt product
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:26,112	| IOT182 |	The foundation for these iot devices
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,392	| IOT182 |	But over time we do expect
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,928	| IOT182 |	Text that it would be able to be
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:33,280	| IOT182 |	Reduced in cost that it would still connect directly to the consumer
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,328	| IOT182 |	Router near home Wi-Fi
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:39,936	| IOT182 |	And that battery life could be extended as the Technologies continue to improve
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:43,520	| IOT182 |	The focus of the show isn't actually on the product but I did want to talk about it
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,336	| IOT182 |	What you do
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,104	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:48,384	| IOT182 |	What I really wanted to talk to you
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:50,688	| IOT182 |	To about his something that's actually on our minds this week
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:51,712	| IOT182 |	Because
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:54,016	| IOT182 |	It's happening again is Terrace
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:55,296	| IOT182 |	And this weekend
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,832	| IOT182 |	The Trump Administration
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,112	| IOT182 |	Said they might
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:41:00,672	| IOT182 |	Actually go forward with another round of tariffs
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,976	| IOT182 |	Roughly 200 billion dollars worth of
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,000	| IOT182 |	Chinese Goods
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:07,072	| IOT182 |	A lot of these are going to hit the Consumer Electronics
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,632	| IOT182 |	So I'm very curious
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,656	| IOT182 |	About your take
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:12,704	| IOT182 |	So Pro tariff
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,216	| IOT182 |	Or not protest
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:18,592	| IOT182 |	Well mostly I'm in favor as I think the administration is
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:20,128	| IOT182 |	Of a Level Playing Field
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,408	| IOT182 |	And for sure
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:23,968	| IOT182 |	Coming into the United States and moving into China
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:27,552	| IOT182 |	The playing field isn't level across all categories
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,600	| IOT182 |	Witness racing has focused on
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:31,392	| IOT182 |	At this point in the additional
EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:33,440	| IOT182 |	200 billion dollars worth of
EDL	00:41:33,440	00:41:36,768	| IOT182 |	China Imports into the United States as you pointed out
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,560	| IOT182 |	And I think any change
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:39,584	| IOT182 |	Interest
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:42,144	| IOT182 |	He's going to significantly impact most us busy
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:44,960	| IOT182 |	This proposal will impact
EDL	00:41:44,960	00:41:45,728	| IOT182 |	Thousands of
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:47,264	| IOT182 |	Businesses in the United States
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:50,848	| IOT182 |	If we didn't do anything and simply absorb the tariffs
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:53,663	| IOT182 |	And we're unable to pass our pricing long
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,943	| IOT182 |	It would put our company out of this
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:57,503	| IOT182 |	So I'm going to guess that there
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,271	| IOT182 |	A number of
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:41:59,807	| IOT182 |	Unknown
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,599	| IOT182 |	An unintended consequences
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,903	| IOT182 |	That would be associated with this move
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:09,023	| IOT182 |	For sure most companies in our industry are going to be impacted by this proposed next round of tariffs
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:10,559	| IOT182 |	But you understand the impact
EDL	00:42:11,071	00:42:12,095	| IOT182 |	Or the background
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,887	| IOT182 |	You really have to understand
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:17,727	| IOT182 |	What consumers in the United States have grown to expect and what retailers
EDL	00:42:17,727	00:42:20,287	| IOT182 |	Have gone out of their way to be able to provide for them
EDL	00:42:20,287	00:42:21,311	| IOT182 |	The retailers
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,335	| IOT182 |	Feel that there's
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,103	| IOT182 |	Appropriately
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:25,919	| IOT182 |	An obligation for them to give consumers the
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:26,687	| IOT182 |	The best value
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:28,735	| IOT182 |	On each one of the products that they offer
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:31,295	| IOT182 |	So that is the highest quality products
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:32,831	| IOT182 |	The best price
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:34,879	| IOT182 |	And to ensure that in a global market
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:36,671	| IOT182 |	The retailer
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:41,279	| IOT182 |	Jet that value they hold line reviews virtually every year and every product
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:44,607	| IOT182 |	Hampton has spent 27 years
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:46,143	| IOT182 |	In Southeast Asia
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:47,423	| IOT182 |	Principally in China
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:49,727	| IOT182 |	Making sure that we could provide the
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:51,007	| IOT182 |	The best value
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,287	| IOT182 |	To our customers
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:53,567	| IOT182 |	And then on to
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,335	| IOT182 |	There
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:57,151	| IOT182 |	Consumers so that we remain competitive
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,943	| IOT182 |	That we're going through a process of
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:42:59,967	| IOT182 |	Continuous Improvement
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:01,503	| IOT182 |	And that were able to meet
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:04,575	| IOT182 |	Our customers and their consumers expectations
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,879	| IOT182 |	That makes sense I do love buying things for cheap
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:09,951	| IOT182 |	So let's talk about your history
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:11,487	| IOT182 |	With Chinese Manufacturing
EDL	00:43:11,487	00:43:12,255	| IOT182 |	Because
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:14,559	| IOT182 |	Obviously this company has been around for a while
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:16,607	| IOT182 |	And where is it manufactured
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:17,119	| IOT182 |	Its products
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:24,031	| IOT182 |	When we bought the Old Hampton Lock Company back in 1990 would actually did have any 85% ownership in a small
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:26,591	| IOT182 |	Allied manufacturing concern in Taiwan
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:27,871	| IOT182 |	Shortly after that
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,407	| IOT182 |	Because I have been going to church
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:30,431	| IOT182 |	3 years
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:33,247	| IOT182 |	We ended up moving most of the manufacturer
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,015	| IOT182 |	Bring into China
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:37,599	| IOT182 |	Because we found in one case that there was generations of
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:41,695	| IOT182 |	Experience making the products that we were interested in making an expanding
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:44,511	| IOT182 |	The change that we've seen in China has been
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,023	| IOT182 |	Lab Hood
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:46,303	| IOT182 |	Significant
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,607	| IOT182 |	But it's taken Generations
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,631	| IOT182 |	To take
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:53,727	| IOT182 |	China from a relatively primitive Manufacturing
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,007	| IOT182 |	Concern in the 80s
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:58,591	| IOT182 |	To a world leader in a number of different Industries today
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,615	| IOT182 |	They've got great Labor

EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:15,487	| IOT182 |	Especially engineering
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:18,303	| IOT182 |	Over the last 30 years they've built

EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:25,215	| IOT182 |	Supply and more recently there
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,263	| IOT182 |	Concern about environmental and
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,311	| IOT182 |	Sustainability issues has become
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:30,335	| IOT182 |	Much more acute
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:32,127	| IOT182 |	We got an example in one of our Pact
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:34,687	| IOT182 |	Where 80% of our power
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:36,479	| IOT182 |	For the factory plus
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:37,247	| IOT182 |	The seven dormitory
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:40,063	| IOT182 |	That we operate on this facility
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,087	| IOT182 |	Are solar power
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:44,927	| IOT182 |	And there are many factories like that even in the United States today
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:45,695	| IOT182 |	So
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:47,231	| IOT182 |	The significant investor
EDL	00:44:47,743	00:44:50,559	| IOT182 |	That people have made in wages and benefits
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:52,863	| IOT182 |	Healthcare and families and quality of life
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:54,399	| IOT182 |	To be upset by
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:55,167	| IOT182 |	Tariff
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,447	| IOT182 |	Dispute
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,727	| IOT182 |	And so we're hoping that the
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,495	| IOT182 |	The trade War
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:00,031	| IOT182 |	Doesn't happen it will have
EDL	00:45:00,543	00:45:05,919	| IOT182 |	As I said not known and unintended consequences not hundreds of thousands of businesses including ours
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:08,735	| IOT182 |	Okay so would you be able to or willing
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,527	| IOT182 |	To move manufacturing somewhere else
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:12,575	| IOT182 |	We may be forced to
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:14,111	| IOT182 |	A couple of points on this
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:17,183	| IOT182 |	Hampton Inn 1999
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:21,279	| IOT182 |	Made significant commitment to manufacturing facilities in
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:28,191	| IOT182 |	Southeast Asia we continue to make those Investments until 2008 9 and 10 when it be
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:31,519	| IOT182 |	Became clear that if the trends continue
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:37,663	| IOT182 |	Economic labor environmental health care if the trends continued in China
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:42,527	| IOT182 |	That we were seeing an ocean Freight continue to be as expensive as it had become
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:48,927	| IOT182 |	But it might make sense for us to move manufacturing back to the United States which in three or four categories we did in two
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:50,463	| IOT182 |	2013 14 and 15
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,487	| IOT182 |	So we know exactly
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:52,767	| IOT182 |	To the penny
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:53,791	| IOT182 |	How much it cost
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:54,559	| IOT182 |	To make these products
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:56,351	| IOT182 |	In the United States
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:58,655	| IOT182 |	And after three and a half years of trying
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:05,055	| IOT182 |	We also know we ended up having to shut her those factories and move it back to Southeast Asia because we couldn't be competitive in the
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:09,663	| IOT182 |	Long-term with other countries manufacturing if we were to move our Manufacturing
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,943	| IOT182 |	Across the street
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:16,575	| IOT182 |	Within one country it would take a year it would create incredible disruption and it would be very expensive
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:21,183	| IOT182 |	To move it to another country is increasingly
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:23,487	| IOT182 |	Expensive and increasingly complicated
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:25,279	| IOT182 |	Because you got to deal with different
EDL	00:46:25,279	00:46:26,047	| IOT182 |	Cultures
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:27,327	| IOT182 |	Different languages
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:32,447	| IOT182 |	Different environmental regulation different labor laws Etc and that's his takes time
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:35,519	| IOT182 |	And the issue that we've all got
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,287	| IOT182 |	The people in are in the sky
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:39,871	| IOT182 |	Have with the Tariff proposal is there's no time
EDL	00:46:39,871	00:46:40,895	| IOT182 |	July
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,943	| IOT182 |	Proposal was that the Tariff
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:44,223	| IOT182 |	Burden on the
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:46,015	| IOT182 |	200 billion dollars
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:46,783	| IOT182 |	And imports
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:48,063	| IOT182 |	Would be around 10
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:50,879	| IOT182 |	First that number increases
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:51,647	| IOT182 |	25%
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:52,671	| IOT182 |	Any tariff
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:55,743	| IOT182 |	Will have a meaningful impact
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,279	| IOT182 |	Not only are cost
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:47:03,423	| IOT182 |	But potentially ultimately the cost of the American Consumer one could argue that it could be short-term but
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,703	| IOT182 |	Short-term pain
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:06,239	| IOT182 |	Which some have described as
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:09,055	| IOT182 |	Relatively insignificant short-term pain
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:11,871	| IOT182 |	Versus the big picture we believe is true
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:14,943	| IOT182 |	But for us to move manufacturing to another country
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:15,967	| IOT182 |	Will take time
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:19,295	| IOT182 |	And there are no guarantees that we're going to be able to
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:22,623	| IOT182 |	Replicate all of the different things that we were able to create in China
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:26,463	| IOT182 |	Okay so let's talk about something a little bit more fun let's talk about innovation
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,999	| IOT182 |	You guys
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:28,767	| IOT182 |	Last year
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:31,839	| IOT182 |	Actually established a relationship with a company called benjilock
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:34,655	| IOT182 |	It was on Shark Tank for having a
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:35,935	| IOT182 |	Connected padlock
EDL	00:47:35,935	00:47:38,751	| IOT182 |	I would love to get your take and some tips from you
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,031	| IOT182 |	On how to bring
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:40,799	| IOT182 |	Something that
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,847	| IOT182 |	Very cool very Innovative but
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,127	| IOT182 |	May not be up to
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,943	| IOT182 |	The quality standards of a physical
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:47,455	| IOT182 |	Device
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:50,271	| IOT182 |	And kind of smelled those two worlds together effect
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:52,575	| IOT182 |	It's been an exciting Journey
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:54,111	| IOT182 |	One of the things that we've learned over
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:58,975	| IOT182 |	The last 27 years is that nearly every product sold in the United States is way more complicated than it looks
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:02,559	| IOT182 |	We looked at categories that you look you'd say
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:03,583	| IOT182 |	How's difficult
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:08,959	| IOT182 |	Could that be I'm not once you begin to understand with the standards in the industry and the consumers expectations
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:10,239	| IOT182 |	And Manufacturing process
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:11,007	| IOT182 |	He's been required
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,055	| IOT182 |	We walked away from
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:16,639	| IOT182 |	But we do know how to make padlock
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:19,455	| IOT182 |	Actually know how to make door locks and we know how to make lighting and Electric
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:21,247	| IOT182 |	Products and so with benjilock
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:26,111	| IOT182 |	When we saw this product at CES in January 2017
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:30,463	| IOT182 |	And it had one and Innovation award at Cas and we said
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:33,023	| IOT182 |	How can a padlock when the Innovation award
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:34,559	| IOT182 |	An electronic
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:40,703	| IOT182 |	Michelle and we met Robbie Cabral the inventor and we said while this is a really cool product and boy is it going to be tough
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:43,775	| IOT182 |	Because we understand what it takes
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,823	| IOT182 |	The bill padlocks we didn't know a lot about
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:51,199	| IOT182 |	And we didn't know a lot about the electronics that would have to support the two of them how you integrate
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:54,271	| IOT182 |	We work with Robbie
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:55,807	| IOT182 |	And we looked at this
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:57,087	| IOT182 |	Technology
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:49:01,439	| IOT182 |	There's a way for us to deliver this technology to the consumer in a way that
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:02,975	| IOT182 |	Could really Delight
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:04,767	| IOT182 |	The consumer and it could
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:06,815	| IOT182 |	Meet or maybe even exceed
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:08,351	| IOT182 |	The expectations of the event
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:10,655	| IOT182 |	Fast forward to October
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,935	| IOT182 |	And Robbie goes on Shark Tank
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:15,519	| IOT182 |	And he develops a relationship and ultimately
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:18,079	| IOT182 |	Secures investment from Kevin o leary mr wonderful
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:20,383	| IOT182 |	And in November
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:21,663	| IOT182 |	Kevin and Robbie
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:22,431	| IOT182 |	Gucci Mane
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:25,759	| IOT182 |	And I ended up negotiating a
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:27,039	| IOT182 |	License arrangement
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:33,439	| IOT182 |	Where to buy Hampton Wood manufacturing Market benjilock initially in North America and we went on TV
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:36,255	| IOT182 |	Robbie finally on November 30th
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:37,279	| IOT182 |	Live on
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,047	| IOT182 |	CNBC
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:41,375	| IOT182 |	Halftime report
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:42,655	| IOT182 |	Live on CNBC
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:46,495	| IOT182 |	We met for the first time live our team has been working with Robbie
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:50,335	| IOT182 |	4/8 months but he and I didn't actually meet
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:51,871	| IOT182 |	Until we saw each other live
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:53,407	| IOT182 |	On CNBC
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:56,991	| IOT182 |	It was a real feel good moment
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:58,527	| IOT182 |	And the last eight months
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:00,831	| IOT182 |	Has been filled with
EDL	00:50:00,831	00:50:03,391	| IOT182 |	Engineering back-and-forth testing
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:07,231	| IOT182 |	Penetration testing all the stuff that goes with making a reliable
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:09,023	| IOT182 |	Sakura product that's got some cool technology
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:12,607	| IOT182 |	My point is that building a reliable
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:13,631	| IOT182 |	Your Hardware Prada
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:14,911	| IOT182 |	Is difficult
EDL	00:50:14,911	00:50:16,959	| IOT182 |	Understanding technology
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:17,727	| IOT182 |	Today
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:19,263	| IOT182 |	Is relatively simple
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:21,055	| IOT182 |	But marrying the two
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:21,567	| IOT182 |	Is
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:22,591	| IOT182 |	Varidesk
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:26,943	| IOT182 |	So when you're looking for a way to take a
EDL	00:50:26,943	00:50:32,063	| IOT182 |	Very complicated piece of technology and put it into a relatively simple
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:32,831	| IOT182 |	Security pro
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:34,111	| IOT182 |	Padlock
EDL	00:50:34,623	00:50:37,439	| IOT182 |	Deadbolt door lock or security lighter
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:40,767	| IOT182 |	Coach light fixture or even a camera you've got to pick the right partners
EDL	00:50:41,279	00:50:44,607	| IOT182 |	He's got to figure out a way to Roadmaster products
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:45,631	| IOT182 |	So that
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:51,519	| IOT182 |	The Partnerships that you've created and the technologies that are going to be required anticipate not only the
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:52,799	| IOT182 |	Consumer needs in the market
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:59,199	| IOT182 |	Condition of today but can have some kind of line of sight to see what's going to happen Downstream nothing
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:50:59,967	| IOT182 |	Thing is more
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:01,759	| IOT182 |	Complicated today then
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:03,551	| IOT182 |	Creating roadmap for The Internet of Things
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:07,135	| IOT182 |	Okay I agree with you it is hard to create product lines for the inter
EDL	00:51:08,159	00:51:09,439	| IOT182 |	What are the big challenges assoc
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:12,511	| IOT182 |	Well first you got to start with being able to market the profit
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:13,791	| IOT182 |	So
EDL	00:51:13,791	00:51:16,095	| IOT182 |	As we're looking at security Hardware products
EDL	00:51:16,095	00:51:18,399	| IOT182 |	We think we're pretty good at making reliable
EDL	00:51:18,399	00:51:18,911	| IOT182 |	Figure products
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:22,495	| IOT182 |	Since we've been in business we've sold over a billion and a half
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:24,031	| IOT182 |	Units of locks and Light
EDL	00:51:24,031	00:51:24,543	| IOT182 |	Adding an electrical
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:29,919	| IOT182 |	And we made years of Investments and in some cases we got generations of skill
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:30,687	| IOT182 |	That's required
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,711	| IOT182 |	To build these products
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:32,991	| IOT182 |	Understanding the teks
EDL	00:51:32,991	00:51:34,015	| IOT182 |	Is pretty straightforward
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:37,087	| IOT182 |	But the steps that we went through were
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:38,623	| IOT182 |	Pretty straightforward
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:39,903	| IOT182 |	For a consumer packaged Goods
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:43,231	| IOT182 |	So the first thing you have to decide is can it be done
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:47,071	| IOT182 |	The internal sessions that we had talking about can we build
EDL	00:51:47,071	00:51:48,095	| IOT182 |	Connected
EDL	00:51:48,095	00:51:50,655	| IOT182 |	Dental that will connect directly to
EDL	00:51:50,655	00:51:53,727	| IOT182 |	Consumers Wi-Fi and would not have power
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:57,823	| IOT182 |	And just because you can do it doesn't mean that you should
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:51:59,103	| IOT182 |	So we went out and talked to a bunch
EDL	00:52:00,639	00:52:03,711	| IOT182 |	What do you really want in this product and in our case it was
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:04,735	| IOT182 |	Security and convenience
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:11,647	| IOT182 |	The combination of two except to the extent that your product ends up not being either secure or it becomes an
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:14,463	| IOT182 |	Then you missed the mark and then you got understand
EDL	00:52:14,463	00:52:15,487	| IOT182 |	What your core competency
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:18,559	| IOT182 |	What are you good at and then you got to go out and rims
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:21,119	| IOT182 |	The rest of it so we need security Hardware
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:27,007	| IOT182 |	But we didn't know anything about Cloud technology or the software in the firmware in the app development that would
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:29,567	| IOT182 |	Deport all that so we have to go out and interview partners
EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:31,359	| IOT182 |	And what made that tough
EDL	00:52:31,359	00:52:31,871	| IOT182 |	And pretty
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:34,431	| IOT182 |	What's the whole list of unknown unknown
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:39,807	| IOT182 |	Because you're talking to people who are going to help you invent something or create something
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:40,831	| IOT182 |	That's never been done before
EDL	00:52:41,343	00:52:42,623	| IOT182 |	So how do they point
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:46,207	| IOT182 |	To something that says in my area of expertise I know I can do this
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:47,743	| IOT182 |	Because they've never done
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:49,023	| IOT182 |	Before so
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:50,559	| IOT182 |	Iot platform
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:51,327	| IOT182 |	AR
EDL	00:52:51,327	00:52:53,119	| IOT182 |	Covering a whole bunch of different Prada
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:56,959	| IOT182 |	But just because it's an iot product doesn't mean that
EDL	00:52:56,959	00:52:57,983	| IOT182 |	Somebody who has X
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:53:00,543	| IOT182 |	Rotation one area biote is actually going to be able
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:02,847	| IOT182 |	Translate their skills into another area
EDL	00:53:02,847	00:53:09,247	| IOT182 |	So I might be able to create an iot voice-activated platform but it doesn't mean that I can make a deadbolt I might be
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:11,807	| IOT182 |	Able to create a security camera or a light switch
EDL	00:53:11,807	00:53:14,623	| IOT182 |	Coyote but it doesn't mean that I can create a deadbolt
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:17,439	| IOT182 |	So we went through and we identified
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:19,487	| IOT182 |	Embedded a whole bunch of different partners
EDL	00:53:19,487	00:53:20,255	| IOT182 |	And
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:22,559	| IOT182 |	While we're developing the product we have to
EDL	00:53:22,559	00:53:26,655	| IOT182 |	Continue to do market research to make sure that the world in passes by
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:31,519	| IOT182 |	While we were busy developing the widget that we had identified back on day one
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:33,055	| IOT182 |	And so the array product
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:34,079	| IOT182 |	AcuRite head bolt
EDL	00:53:34,079	00:53:35,103	| IOT182 |	And then she like
EDL	00:53:35,103	00:53:38,175	| IOT182 |	Have gone through in the case of a race 70
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:39,455	| IOT182 |	Different iterations
EDL	00:53:39,455	00:53:40,479	| IOT182 |	Over the four years
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:42,271	| IOT182 |	Most of them in the last 12 months
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:47,903	| IOT182 |	And benjilock we made most of our changes to the design and development of the product in the last
EDL	00:53:47,903	00:53:49,695	| IOT182 |	90 days before launch
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:51,231	| IOT182 |	We launched benjilock
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:51,743	| IOT182 |	Annie
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:54,047	| IOT182 |	August of 2018
EDL	00:53:54,047	00:53:59,935	| IOT182 |	And as I said we wants to write last Thursday and September and will begin shipping that on or about October 1st
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:03,007	| IOT182 |	Awesome alright but we've come full circle in this interview
EDL	00:54:03,519	00:54:04,543	| IOT182 |	Kim I really
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:05,567	| IOT182 |	You coming on the show
EDL	00:54:06,335	00:54:11,199	| IOT182 |	It's been my pleasure
EDL	00:54:11,199	00:54:13,759	| IOT182 |	And remember if you'd like more iot news
