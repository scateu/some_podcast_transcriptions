EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:10,912	| episode3 |	Honestly after playing with a device twice I'm not going to say I'm not impressed by it but I don't know that I need it
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:15,776	| episode3 |	However from a work perspective to test gadgets and try different things I did buy one
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:20,128	| episode3 |	Welcome

EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,624	| episode3 |	Order it online
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,928	| episode3 |	Now so I don't have it
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:36,512	| episode3 |	If a cat 307 that was 7 minutes after the
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:41,632	| episode3 |	Pre-orders began it had already pushed me back to a mid-may delivery date
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,936	| episode3 |	So I'm not even having on April 24th when it
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,216	| episode3 |	Quote-unquote launches
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,752	| episode3 |	And I
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,312	| episode3 |	Shame on me I ordered the most popular
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:52,384	| episode3 |	Apple watch with the most popular color and of course
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:57,504	| episode3 |	The most popular colored band I got a space gray aluminum sport model with
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| episode3 |	Black
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,296	| episode3 |	Sport strap
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:03,136	| episode3 |	And yeah everybody else got that too so
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:07,232	| episode3 |	$350 later I am waiting at about 5 weeks for the
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,792	| episode3 |	So was there an option
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:11,328	| episode3 |	Pink strap
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:15,168	| episode3 |	Absolutely although I have some data
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:22,336	| episode3 |	From slice intelligent stop talking about who ordered what and sliced I don't have ever use slice it's for iOS
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,104	| episode3 |	An Android you can
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:27,456	| episode3 |	You can slice and what it does is it monitors your email so it finds
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,528	| episode3 |	Receipts email receipts from things you order online
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:34,624	| episode3 |	And then they actually gather that data and get rid of all your personal information and then
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:37,184	| episode3 |	Put together reports and they put a report together on Monday
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,720	| episode3 |	And said that the pink
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,512	| episode3 |	Strap and one of the other
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:43,584	| episode3 |	Pasteli color Caesar they like the iPod touch colors
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:47,936	| episode3 |	For only 4% of people ordered those
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:50,752	| episode3 |	So I did not and I could have gotten that but
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:54,592	| episode3 |	I didn't want that I want something I can wear everyday pretty much all settings and
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,920	| episode3 |	Yeah I don't think that pastel pink or blue or
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,480	| episode3 |	Whatever was is my thing for that
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,248	| episode3 |	I could have warned
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,272	| episode3 |	Pastel pink
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,624	| episode3 |	I know you could pull out of I could not
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:09,184	| episode3 |	Although I say this wearing a white
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,976	| episode3 |	I see the way
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,488	| episode3 |	Pebble watch there
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:15,072	| episode3 |	It goes well see it's going it goes with my current outfit right now
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:20,704	| episode3 |	You got the whole monochrome thing going on here
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| episode3 |	On the radio
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| episode3 |	And don't see my
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:29,920	| episode3 |	So I am excited to get to watch because of the potential that it brings
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,784	| episode3 |	And the fact that may lead a little bit into WWDC
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:38,624	| episode3 |	I was going to say you can tell by the time it comes out maybe we'll have homekit devices
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,160	| episode3 |	And start playing
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,696	| episode3 |	I
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,000	| episode3 |	I suspect we're not going to have
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:48,608	| episode3 |	A big homekit push until June 8th which is when WWDC
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,168	| episode3 |	Kids place at Moscone West in San Francisco
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:57,312	| episode3 |	And the reason being if you look at the logo for the WWDC event which
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| episode3 |	Just today it came out
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,896	| episode3 |	Yeah I don't want to read too much into this is not like
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:06,528	| episode3 |	And I'm trying to decipher the logos here but it sure looks like an Apple TV in the center of the logo to me
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:11,904	| episode3 |	And we've heard rumors of Apple TV getting an upgrade hasn't really seen one since 2013 refresh
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,720	| episode3 |	And there's talk of homekit
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,488	| episode3 |	You know being
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:20,607	| episode3 |	On the Apple TV as a as a hub which I like as we know from the last show because
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,167	| episode3 |	I don't want to get zillion Wi-Fi things on my network
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,447	| episode3 |	And say she's laughing at me again
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,311	| episode3 |	The big thing about home
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,383	| episode3 |	What's the big thing about made for
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,407	| episode3 |	The made for
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,431	| episode3 |	I
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,455	| episode3 |	Devices program
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,503	| episode3 |	It's
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,807	| episode3 |	Kind of Wi-Fi beso a lot of these
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,575	| episode3 |	Devices have a
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,135	| episode3 |	Part of the security + cert
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| episode3 |	Location is over the Wi-Fi
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,439	| episode3 |	So
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,975	| episode3 |	It could be that even if there is a
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,607	| episode3 |	That's all right
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| episode3 |	Europe you're bursting my bubble but that's okay I can live with that
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,727	| episode3 |	I was just thinking with this this whole
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| episode3 |	WDC
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,079	| episode3 |	WDC WDC
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| episode3 |	Worldwide about WWDC
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:04,639	| episode3 |	Yes yes
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,967	| episode3 |	H-E-B wdcb whatever worldwide developer,
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,735	| episode3 |	Okay
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:13,599	| episode3 |	We need to get you like a conspirator Kevin's conspiracy corner
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,671	| episode3 |	We're going to change your name
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,695	| episode3 |	Because I can't do it
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,743	| episode3 |	Not happening
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:24,607	| episode3 |	CCC so this is your Apple
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,655	| episode3 |	WDC conspiracy
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,983	| episode3 |	Get the logo is shaped
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| episode3 |	It's like an Apple TV
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,847	| episode3 |	We're going to have an Apple TV refresh
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| episode3 |	At the event
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,407	| episode3 |	And it's going to be home care
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,943	| episode3 |	Kind of face
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,711	| episode3 |	Because
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,735	| episode3 |	Apple TV
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,271	| episode3 |	Refresh might include
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,295	| episode3 |	The homekit
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,343	| episode3 |	Apple TV
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:52,255	| episode3 |	I think that's a safe that regardless of the logo, so I think that's a safe bet mean there's been
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:55,583	| episode3 |	Some leaks and rumors about the new Apple TV and that it will have
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:58,143	| episode3 |	More apps will get a refresh in terms of apps
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:00,447	| episode3 |	And when you think of home kit and apps
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| episode3 |	So just all fits together
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,519	| episode3 |	I agree with you so
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,335	| episode3 |	As someone who has played around with most
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:06,847	| episode3 |	Apple home
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,127	| episode3 |	Hobbs already
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:11,199	| episode3 |	The biggest weakness of apples
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:13,503	| episode3 |	Can't when it was tied to the phone
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,271	| episode3 |	When your phone leaves
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,551	| episode3 |	Your house suddenly has
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,343	| episode3 |	And that
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,183	| episode3 |	Because you still want things that you
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,951	| episode3 |	Scheduler
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,719	| episode3 |	Seems to happen
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:23,999	| episode3 |	Especially things
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| episode3 |	Security like my lights
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,047	| episode3 |	To go on and off
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,607	| episode3 |	Midas shades
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,935	| episode3 |	All of those things still need to happen
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| episode3 |	So it makes total sense
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,519	| episode3 |	That you would have some
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:38,591	| episode3 |	Now
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,895	| episode3 |	I am really excited
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,199	| episode3 |	I'd like an Apple TV is fine
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,735	| episode3 |	I hope that apple
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,503	| episode3 |	Doesn't just
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,343	| episode3 |	Because I don't
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:53,439	| episode3 |	I would love to see any of the intelligence
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| episode3 |	Get a home
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| episode3 |	Not be relegated
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:56,767	| episode3 |	It's just one
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,583	| episode3 |	Because I don't want to buy Asus
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,607	| episode3 |	Take device to me
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,423	| episode3 |	Like to act as a bridge basically
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,191	| episode3 |	Ready
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:08,543	| episode3 |	So could that be done and we'll iCloud be a big part of this I suspect yes
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,823	| episode3 |	Probably
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| episode3 |	So Apple has
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,615	| episode3 |	Apple TV
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,151	| episode3 |	They also at the airport
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| episode3 |	For example
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,479	| episode3 |	So I could see like
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| episode3 |	Bad acting
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:18,783	| episode3 |	Bridge device
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,647	| episode3 |	You know you want to add Wi-Fi to
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:24,927	| episode3 |	Cheap locksmith
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,487	| episode3 |	Instead of buying
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,583	| episode3 |	How many Outlet
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,143	| episode3 |	None
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,935	| episode3 |	Right
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:41,311	| episode3 |	So you would hate all these Bluetooth Lawson Bluetooth devices that require a Wi-Fi Bridge cuz you have to
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,615	| episode3 |	Plug in and out within just live there all the time
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:46,687	| episode3 |	Every outlet has a Wi-Fi device in my house
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,199	| episode3 |	It's crazy
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:50,783	| episode3 |	You got more stuff on your network and they're taking about
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:51,807	| episode3 |	I know
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:56,927	| episode3 |	You got a device
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:01,535	| episode3 |	So I just thinking about all the kind of protocol
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,839	| episode3 |	All the devices that apple
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,631	| episode3 |	Reasonably call ahead
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,959	| episode3 |	Apple TV that I don't know what else to do
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,775	| episode3 |	It could be their brand new cool device like a
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:16,383	| episode3 |	Amazon Echo type devices
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,407	| episode3 |	Siri I don't know
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| episode3 |	I like that idea
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:24,063	| episode3 |	Fundamentally here's my crazy predict
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| episode3 |	Like a year or two after homekit is lost
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,159	| episode3 |	Apple will launch
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,439	| episode3 |	Real product
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,023	| episode3 |	And that product will be fundamentally different
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,815	| episode3 |	In a true kind of
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,375	| episode3 |	Something completely different for the home
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,143	| episode3 |	It makes it
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,935	| episode3 |	Usable for the mange
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:45,311	| episode3 |	I don't know I think you're wrong cuz I can't see how they would design a logo for that
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,871	| episode3 |	But that's just me
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,431	| episode3 |	No I think you're I think you're spot on
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,711	| episode3 |	This is
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:58,111	| episode3 |	This is been a long time coming I'm an apple announced homekit at last year's WWDC if I recall correctly
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,879	| episode3 |	The last June
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,695	| episode3 |	It's been a long time just to get to product version 1
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,719	| episode3 |	And
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| episode3 |	As we all know it's
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:10,911	| episode3 |	What is Apple do they introduce a product that doesn't have every single possible feature or the best features just yet we're the best
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| episode3 |	Experience yet
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:16,799	| episode3 |	And the iterating iterating all of a sudden they got you know a market-leading products oh yes I would agree
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,615	| episode3 |	World and they don't even have a crime rate
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,127	| episode3 |	Actually

EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,727	| episode3 |	That's kind of how that came to be
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| episode3 |	And that's how
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,823	| episode3 |	Home kits facts for other products also came

EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,687	| episode3 |	My hunch is Chamberlain

EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,503	| episode3 |	The garage door
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,295	| episode3 |	So

EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,207	| episode3 |	Means actually for
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,487	| episode3 |	People who are used to working
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,767	| episode3 |	Does products you probably have

EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,191	| episode3 |	The huge advantage
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,727	| episode3 |	Totally
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,287	| episode3 |	But it also means that
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,847	| episode3 |	We probably are going to see a lot of really cool innovative
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,895	| episode3 |	You know we're going to see kind of what we
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:28,991	| episode3 |	I don't have a sign I'm trying to picture what I need in my home
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,015	| episode3 |	Today or tomorrow
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| episode3 |	Aluminum
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,575	| episode3 |	Or aluminium
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,183	| episode3 |	I want sitting somewhere doing
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,207	| episode3 |	Something that I don't even know
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,511	| episode3 |	Actually I do know I want it to end
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,631	| episode3 |	Is that too much to ask
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,143	| episode3 |	I mean
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,703	| episode3 |	I'm still waiting for my husband and my daughter.
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| episode3 |	You mention Amazon Echo
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:05,087	| episode3 |	There's some big news I read it
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:08,671	| episode3 |	But not into tell I knew you were that's why I didn't
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:11,231	| episode3 |	What's the big news because it is big news
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| episode3 |	I think it is
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,815	| episode3 |	Amazon
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| episode3 |	Actually supports
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,887	| episode3 |	Hue and WeMo
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,191	| episode3 |	Over the Amazon Echo now
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| episode3 |	So
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,847	| episode3 |	I'd leave my living room guys
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,359	| episode3 |	And
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,383	| episode3 |	I say
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,663	| episode3 |	Alexa
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,199	| episode3 |	Turn off
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| episode3 |	Living room lights
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,503	| episode3 |	Go off
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,807	| episode3 |	Alexa says okay
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:39,135	| episode3 |	I think it's amazing I always want to say thank you
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,439	| episode3 |	Can I catch other people in my house doing the same thing
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,743	| episode3 |	We're always like talking to Alexa we like
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,279	| episode3 |	Please do this
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,399	| episode3 |	So I have both the polite family and
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,679	| episode3 |	We don't know how to text
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,215	| episode3 |	So
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,495	| episode3 |	What it does
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,007	| episode3 |	Is
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| episode3 |	If you want to set this up
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,103	| episode3 |	If you're one of the few people who have an Amazon Echo
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,151	| episode3 |	It's in beta
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,687	| episode3 |	And you just say Alexa
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,711	| episode3 |	Discover my device
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,295	| episode3 |	And Alexa goes through your Wi-Fi and discovers
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,831	| episode3 |	Your WeMo devices
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,135	| episode3 |	Right now it only supports
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:11,647	| episode3 |	Three wheel motor
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,695	| episode3 |	It support
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,207	| episode3 |	What's the
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,231	| episode3 |	Outlet
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,791	| episode3 |	The Outlet Plus energy saving
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:18,815	| episode3 |	And a light switch
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| episode3 |	Arduino
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,655	| episode3 |	And the WeMo is a little buggy
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,423	| episode3 |	I'm going to tell you this
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,727	| episode3 |	The WeMo API
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,591	| episode3 |	On the Hue side it's
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,615	| episode3 |	Support Steam
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| episode3 |	Hugh
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,151	| episode3 |	Colored lights
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,943	| episode3 |	In the light bulb shapes with a night
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| episode3 |	The lights
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,855	| episode3 |	And the moon things
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,159	| episode3 |	Does not support the other thing we talked about last week
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,671	| episode3 |	Hugo
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| episode3 |	No Hugo
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:51,327	| episode3 |	The bowl with a light in it
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,119	| episode3 |	So it doesn't support that yet
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,191	| episode3 |	And it also supports do I say the Hue Lux white lights
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:00,031	| episode3 |	He didn't but now you did
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,543	| episode3 |	It is
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| episode3 |	A little bit weird
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,639	| episode3 |	So it took me awhile to figure out how to group the law
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,687	| episode3 |	In the Hue app
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,503	| episode3 |	You can't actually group your Hue Lights
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| episode3 |	In a room setting
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| episode3 |	Which I've always liked you after I speak
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,623	| episode3 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,951	| episode3 |	So I got four living room lights and their names really stupid things
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,999	| episode3 |	Left front
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| episode3 |	Living room light
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,863	| episode3 |	So if I were talking to Alexa
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| episode3 |	I would have to
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,167	| episode3 |	How to say turn on left
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,847	| episode3 |	Excruciating
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,871	| episode3 |	So
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,967	| episode3 |	The Hue app you have to prove it in the
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,479	| episode3 |	Amazon
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,575	| episode3 |	That's I was wondering if there was an interface in the Amazon app now
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:48,927	| episode3 |	There is but it took me awhile to find
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| episode3 |	Whois
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,487	| episode3 |	Wander over it that's not funny
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,279	| episode3 |	If you guys like our show you love that's enough
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,583	| episode3 |	Is it
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,375	| episode3 |	The URL just wwd
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:01,215	| episode3 |	Wf.com
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,799	| episode3 |	He took me off to hell
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,335	| episode3 |	How you can actually find
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,871	| episode3 |	Amazon Echo
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,175	| episode3 |	Intonow
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,455	| episode3 |	I've named it living room lights
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,735	| episode3 |	And so
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:13,759	| episode3 |	Once group
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,807	| episode3 |	You can just tell Alexa
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:16,831	| episode3 |	Turn on
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,623	| episode3 |	Living room lights you can
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,391	| episode3 |	Tell Alexa
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,671	| episode3 |	Dim
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,439	| episode3 |	Living room lights
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,207	| episode3 |	To 50%
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,743	| episode3 |	You cannot
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,511	| episode3 |	Manage the
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| episode3 |	Color preferences
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,047	| episode3 |	Sindecuse
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| episode3 |	With Alexa
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:28,863	| episode3 |	And
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,911	| episode3 |	There's a little weirdness that I'm sure they will
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| episode3 |	Update out
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,239	| episode3 |	But right now if you're
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,519	| episode3 |	Turning the Hue Lights Off
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,079	| episode3 |	You can say turn off
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,591	| episode3 |	Switch off
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,895	| episode3 |	But if you're turning the WeMo
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| episode3 |	Off
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,711	| episode3 |	You have to say switch off
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| episode3 |	Only switch off
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:50,623	| episode3 |	Yeah I'm not a I'm not a fan of those very specific commands like my Xbox has the same thing and I'll turn it off
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| episode3 |	By voice
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,927	| episode3 |	A lot of noise control with it
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:59,327	| episode3 |	And sometimes I say the wrong turn off command I'll say switch off or something and it does nothing but blink at me like what
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,119	| episode3 |	Obviously not the right thing
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,399	| episode3 |	The nice thing about
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,935	| episode3 |	The interface is
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,727	| episode3 |	When you get it right
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:06,495	| episode3 |	Alexa
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,519	| episode3 |	Will say okay
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,591	| episode3 |	When you get it wrong you get this tone that is like
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,407	| episode3 |	Sad trombone
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,199	| episode3 |	If it would be better
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,735	| episode3 |	Womp womp
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,271	| episode3 |	Instead you just get this like
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,879	| episode3 |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:23,391	| episode3 |	Makes sense
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,951	| episode3 |	Let me ask you this since you now have
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:29,535	| episode3 |	Connected I'm sorry you have control these devices
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,839	| episode3 |	Through several interfaces now in the past
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,863	| episode3 |	I don't know how many months
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:37,727	| episode3 |	Is there what would kind of lag time is there between Alexa and say your lights going on or off
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,519	| episode3 |	Less than a second
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,591	| episode3 |	Okay it's a really it's really very effective
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,175	| episode3 |	What I've done because Alexa has a remote
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:46,943	| episode3 |	Control
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:50,015	| episode3 |	A lot of people brought this up there like I only have an echo in one room if my
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,039	| episode3 |	My house
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| episode3 |	Q's in other rooms
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:52,575	| episode3 |	Good point
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,599	| episode3 |	My
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| episode3 |	Downstairs is a
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,415	| episode3 |	Floor plan
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,951	| episode3 |	So I have it
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| episode3 |	Downstairs
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:00,255	| episode3 |	Kitchen area.
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,535	| episode3 |	Control my entire kitchen
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:06,911	| episode3 |	That's the area where you have your blender that just goes on by itself when somebody hacks your network
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| episode3 |	We keep it there but I keep the remote
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,895	| episode3 |	Control
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,919	| episode3 |	Stairs cuz I have
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:18,431	| episode3 |	The Hue Lights
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,479	| episode3 |	Thai table lamp
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| episode3 |	So now I can
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,135	| episode3 |	And that work
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,791	| episode3 |	Controlling my
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,815	| episode3 |	In-N-Out
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:39,167	| episode3 |	Yeah because the remote that comes with the echo actually you can speak to and it
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,447	| episode3 |	Does its thing just like
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,751	| episode3 |	The Amazon Echo itself does okay
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,519	| episode3 |	That makes it
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:48,127	| episode3 |	Is there a third option in that you can control through a phone interface with
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,639	| episode3 |	Amazon
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,967	| episode3 |	You know I'd there is an Amazon Echo app
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,015	| episode3 |	I don't believe it's in here
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,343	| episode3 |	So there you go something
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,743	| episode3 |	So there you go
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,535	| episode3 |	Cuz then think about it
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,839	| episode3 |	With iOS
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:10,143	| episode3 |	Or Android Wear watch
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,679	| episode3 |	You could even
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| episode3 |	Speech you're watching
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,543	| episode3 |	Do it that way to take the phone out of your pocket
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,079	| episode3 |	So here's the deal.
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,383	| episode3 |	Once you take your phone
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,431	| episode3 |	And you open an app
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,735	| episode3 |	You might as well just do it from the apps
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:25,759	| episode3 |	Already on
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,855	| episode3 |	You don't even have to unlock the phone or open yet
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:33,183	| episode3 |	Because all these apps right now for the lunches are extensions of the phone apps
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,975	| episode3 |	So boom
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:39,327	| episode3 |	Oh my say boom okay
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,863	| episode3 |	True fairness you are right
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,911	| episode3 |	All right so stay tuned
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:43,935	| episode3 |	Because
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,007	| episode3 |	This is all I have on the echo
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,287	| episode3 |	Unless you have other questions Kevin
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:53,919	| episode3 |	No I'm just happy to see that kind of integration I didn't buy an echo even though I had the invitation
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,223	| episode3 |	Partly because it didn't do enough and had no
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,783	| episode3 |	Home integration now we're seeing the first
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,599	| episode3 |	Steps for that and now I'm much more intrigued by
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,391	| episode3 |	But you don't have any Hue Lights
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,695	| episode3 |	I don't have any
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,743	| episode3 |	Thing right now because
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:12,095	| episode3 |	Cuz I'm a slacker and haven't reinstall all of my crap
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:13,375	| episode3 |	So once again I'm going to
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| episode3 |	Here right now
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,983	| episode3 |	Kevin
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:19,263	| episode3 |	Where where are we now
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,567	| episode3 |	How many 6 months behind I'd say
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:23,103	| episode3 |	You've been harping on me
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,431	| episode3 |	If I'm going to my wife
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,503	| episode3 |	Ashley she could care less tickets
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,575	| episode3 |	Hey it was it was my birthday on Sunday
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,879	| episode3 |	I know happy birthday
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,159	| episode3 |	Yeah and you know what
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:42,559	| episode3 |	Turning on your blender from Pennsylvania here but
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,863	| episode3 |	I was going to say let me make you a mixed drink
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,287	| episode3 |	No I would say
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:52,799	| episode3 |	Beyonce
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:55,871	| episode3 |	Okay

EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,695	| episode3 |	You're not covering mobile or anything
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:14,815	| episode3 |	You're not right for five bucks a day, 7 days a week again
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,607	| episode3 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,655	| episode3 |	I think
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,935	| episode3 |	That's probably
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,959	| episode3 |	Some awesome stuff
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,983	| episode3 |	That we talked about
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:26,079	| episode3 |	And if you stay to you will learn we have Bluetooth lighting

EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,792	| episode3 |	Buy lamps you actually mean light bulbs

EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:20,672	| episode3 |	Instance stores for example
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:25,024	| episode3 |	And some of your commercial customers are companies like California Pizza Kitchen
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,072	| episode3 |	And let's see who else are some of your customers
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:33,728	| episode3 |	Do we have a restaurant change

EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:19,552	| episode3 |	I thought that this was pretty cool
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:24,160	| episode3 |	Because one I feel like this is 2015 is the year for Bluetooth
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,952	| episode3 |	Into
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:31,328	| episode3 |	I think it's actually a really interesting to talk to a kind of lighting manufacturer about
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,376	| episode3 |	Cut up the future of connected lighting
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:38,240	| episode3 |	And I I wanted to talk to you about why Bluetooth and then go into kind of

EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:25,792	| episode3 |	The Starwood Hotel chain is using
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:28,608	| episode3 |	Connected locks actually as part of

EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:35,008	| episode3 |	And that is a really compelling reason to book through them
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:41,920	| episode3 |	Is that you can actually use your phone to unlock the doors these sorts of kind of real-world interaction
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,456	| episode3 |	Are really
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:46,528	| episode3 |	Interesting reason to get people to actually use
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,040	| episode3 |	Who's the apps
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:48,832	| episode3 |	I will say though
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:53,952	| episode3 |	Having 800 apps on your phone for each individual place that you go is still
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:31:00,864	| episode3 |	Not something that I think most people want to do but for like the top 10 places it could be a compelling enough for
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:09,824	| episode3 |	Can you do the room
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:16,736	| episode3 |	You stayed there before

EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:30,304	| episode3 |	You're working with a company called

EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,568	| episode3 |	Are you integrated with Starwood
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,640	| episode3 |	Are you decided to work with Starwood and

EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:48,992	| episode3 |	Back-end they have a different Bluetooth back in for their locks
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,760	| episode3 |	This program so
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:53,600	| episode3 |	Would something like that be difficult to kind of bring together
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,624	| episode3 |	How how would that work
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:59,488	| episode3 |	Reason for us

EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:40,704	| episode3 |	I think she will help
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,264	| episode3 |	That would be really exciting because
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:45,568	| episode3 |	Lamps are a great spot to put
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:50,432	| episode3 |	Presence detection and Bluetooth beacons are kind of something I'm really excited about
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,736	| episode3 |	And I'm curious
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:54,016	| episode3 |	With your lights
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:58,368	| episode3 |	Are beacons something that you're considering kind of presence detection via the
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:03,488	| episode3 |	It could be for your restaurant customers it could be like in hotels
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:08,608	| episode3 |	But once you have kind of a Bluetooth radio you also have the ability to say
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,936	| episode3 |	Hey this phone belongs to Stacy or this
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:13,728	| episode3 |	Is Stacy's wearable and then
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:16,800	| episode3 |	Using that information tied to an app on my phone you can
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,616	| episode3 |	You can offer me that that preference that
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,152	| episode3 |	Stacy likes her
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:23,456	| episode3 |	Her room this way or
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:28,576	| episode3 |	Last time Stacy was in this restaurant she ordered this maybe you want to offer her a coupon
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:32,160	| episode3 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,440	| episode3 |	The nice thing is about Lambs
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:36,256	| episode3 |	And there's power

EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:45,472	| episode3 |	If you talk about Deacons
EDL	00:33:45,472	00:33:47,520	| episode3 |	Not long ago on my phone

EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:55,968	| episode3 |	It's already
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:58,272	| episode3 |	So attached to the beacon
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,624	| episode3 |	It's something that is
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:08,256	| episode3 |	G-Eazy and I think she lives in India
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:10,304	| episode3 |	Lives

EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,400	| episode3 |	So is that something that
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:17,728	| episode3 |	Sora does or is that something that see does
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,776	| episode3 |	With their platform like
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:21,824	| episode3 |	How does that kind of get worked out
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:28,992	| episode3 |	So anybody integrating sensors into
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:31,296	| episode3 |	That is something that we would work on it
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:37,440	| episode3 |	Coming full circle for you guys so these are the first connected products we should see these in the market for you guys at what time
